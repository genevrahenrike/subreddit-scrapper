      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I‚Äôm excited to share that I passed my PMP exam (1/9) on the first try! I had my exam on a Pearson VUE test center. It was a challenging but incredibly rewarding journey. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what I used, what worked, and a few tips that might help you: ‚∏ª üß† Study Resources I Used: 1.\tAndrew Ramdayal‚Äôs Udemy PMP Course\n‚Ä¢\tGreat for foundational knowledge\n‚Ä¢\tI watched it at 1.5x speed and took notes\n‚Ä¢\tHis mindset tips helped with situational questions a lot\t\n  ‚Ä¢\tThe mini exams and mock exam that were included, didn‚Äôt feel like it was very representative of the actual exam. More like just a test for the theoretical part of the PMBOK\n\n2.\tPMI Study Hall Essentials\n‚Ä¢\tThis was a game changer\n‚Ä¢\tThe questions were the same difficulty with the actual exam in my opinion\n‚Ä¢\tI started first with the practice questions. Score 68% on average. Then reviewed all wrong answers and low confidence. Redid the tests and scored 74% on average \n‚Ä¢\tAfter I did the mock exams. I scored 75% on mock exam 1 and 80% on mock exam 2 (1st try)\n\n3.\t200 Ultra Hard PMP Questions (from Andrew Ramdayal)\n‚Ä¢\tExcellent for understanding trickier situational scenarios\n\n4.\t100 David McLachlan YouTube Questions\n‚Ä¢\tSuper helpful to practice and build confidence\n‚Ä¢\tDavid‚Äôs explanations are easy to follow ‚∏ª üìä My Study Timeline: ‚Ä¢\tTotal prep time: 8 weeks ‚Ä¢\tStudied 8 hours on weekdays, more on weekends ‚∏ª üìù My Exam Experience: ‚Ä¢\tAll situational questions, no ITTO memorization ‚Ä¢\tNo calculation questions ‚Ä¢\tThe real exam felt exactly like Study Hall, but only because I trained with difficult questions ‚Ä¢\tManaged time well, finished each section with 10 mins to review marked questions ‚∏ª üí° Tips That Helped Me: ‚Ä¢\tFocus on mindset, not memorisation. Always ask what‚Äôs the best thing the PM should do in this situation? ‚Ä¢\tPractice with tough questions (Study Hall & Reddit) to build stamina and reduce anxiety ‚Ä¢\tSimulate test environment! Try to do the mock exams as if you were doing real time. It will build your endurance a lot! ‚Ä¢\tDon‚Äôt skip PMI Study Hall ‚Ä¢\tTake breaks between sections to reset your brain ‚∏ª üí¨ Final Words: If you‚Äôre scoring in the 75% range on Study Hall exams, you‚Äôre on the right track. Trust your prep. If I can do it, you can absolutely do it too. Feel free to ask me anything! Good luck, future PMPs! üöÄ",

Sharing here cause none of my friends or family truly understand how difficult this exam is or the effort that goes into it. Here's my advice to those struggling: -use SH i used the essential version. Go over all tje practice questions and exams, ensuring you test yourself on difficult and expert level questions. -Purchase Third3Rock Notes and watch ARs Ultra hard 200 videos to develop the mindset. -Using the strikethrough and highlighting feature in the exam helped to keep me focused. Learning the PMI mindset after 10 years of PM experience was key though challenging! Most of the questions had answers that I hated all of them but you have to select the best of the available options. Keep studying you got this!",

The PMP got me the job, and I don‚Äôt mean because I had the line on my resume. I had zero formal project management training before getting my PMP and would have miserably failed my interviews without it. I passed my exam in March 2025 AT/AT/T (big thanks to this subreddit) and it taught me all the right vocabulary for so many tools and tasks I had already been doing. Suddenly I sounded like the experienced project manager that I already was. It really was the make-or-break that allowed me to switch industries via project management, and into a much higher paying job. If you‚Äôre applying at small companies, I don‚Äôt know how much difference it makes, but for organizations that value systems and mention PMP in their job ads it‚Äôs worth the $800 and 100 hours I spent on it.",

      "content_preview": "As the title of the post says, I passed, today (September 1st) with 3 ATs! Took the exam in a testing center, and I received the preliminary/provisional result right away (i.e., after the exam), which already contained the results per domain. 15 hours later, received the official results, along with the certificate, and the exam analysis. The exam was relatively easy. Can't really say if it's due to my (adequate?) preps, but I suppose luck played a huge role i.e., the question set assigned to me was relatively easy. To those taking the exam soon, wishing you all the best! A few recos on preps, based on what worked for me (spent around 3-4 hours a day of study i.e., before starting my work shift, since mid-July; longer during weekends): * AR's 35-hour Udemy Course (a colleague lent me hers) - Used this as a starting point/refresher (attended a formal/face-to-face class in 2024 for the required 35 contact hours). * AR's 200 Ultra Hard; DM's 150, 200 Agile, and 100 Waterfall; Eduhubspot 180 - These helped immensely with the reinforcement of theories, as well as the mindset. * Yassine Tounsi's 180 Questions YT video - This was one of the major breakthroughs to my prep! Came across this by sheer chance (or perhaps by algorithm). The way the questions were structured, and the overall execution style were the closest to Study Hall, and the actual exam (including the \"trick questions\"). I actually had a second pass to this video the day before my exam, as I didn't want to review the SH questions anymore, so as to not get thrown off by the explanation of the rationale behind the \"Expert\" questions-- this was my final prep, so to speak. Study Hall Plus - GOLD! The practice questions, and most especially the mock exams were instrumental to gauging if the theories, and the mindset have already been ingrained in you.  DON'T SCRIMP IF YOU HAVE THE MEANS/RESOURCES. * TrustedInstitute.com - Very complementary to Study Hall. Once I finished the above-mentioned videos, everyday, I would take the 10s, and the 20s (questions/mini exams) at Expert/Difficult/Master Level. It has a built in tracker for your performance which gauges your proficiency based on your historical practice test data. It also has 5 free full mock exams (though I just took one, to avoid mental fatigue--I already took 5 full mock exams in SH+, anyway). This site became instrumental to further ingraining the mindset, and helped tremendously in developing critical thinking, as well as reading comprehension-- majority of the questions were verbose (which is PMP's inherent style, to begin with). I guess, that's it! Hope the above-mentioned nuggets of information have been helpful. Cheers to my current (and future) fellow PMPs! P.S. - Wore blue on the exam day-- dress, blazer (and even undies, LOL!)-- guess AR's \"witchcraft\" really does work wonders! :)",

      "content_preview": "I passed the exam today with T/T/AT. Big thanks to this community as I would not have been able to complete this journey under budget and ahead of schedule without you all! LOL see what I did there? Hope you all own some stock in Reddit. I used Andrew Ramdayal Udemy course for the 35 hours, third rock notes for references and Study Hall for exam readiness. My SH scores were 69% for both full-length exams 1 & 2, only taking them once and treating it as a real exam - 4 hours straight with two 10 minute breaks. Exam 2 was much more difficult than exam 1 so I was surprised I got the same score. I would say the difficulty of the real exam I took today fit right between the SH exams 1 & 2. Not as easy as exam 1 but not as difficult as exam 2. I had a lot of questions that required 2-3 answers, about 20-30 total. I was surprised at how many of them I had considering SH had very few. I will say the multiple answer questions on the real exam were easier than the ones on SH. The only mathematical questions were related to CPI & SPI and were easy to answer without a calculator. How I studied: Study Hall, Study Hall, Study Hall! Practice questions with instant \"review answer\" on will prepare you for the mini exams. The mini exams will prepare you for the full length practice exams. And taking the full length practice exams, uninterrupted, will prepare you for the actual test. Doing this, in that specific order, is important for gaining the knowledge and endurance in chunks to work your way up. Unorthodox opinions: At a certain point during my studies, I felt like I was preparing for Ms. Cleo's \"How to be a Psychic\" certification. Difficult and Expert questions are usually classified that way because of the ambiguous verbiage and even more ambiguous answer options. Look at my post and comment history for example. Some of them outright contradict the PMI mindset. I spent a lot of time on some questions trying to justify the answer PMI deems as correct. At the end of the day, if you have to do all sort of mental gymnastics to validate an answer, chances are it's just a poorly worded or illogical question/answer. Do not let these kind of questions break your confidence. They do not represent the majority. Adjusting your mindset to rationalize them will unravel the mindset that will enable you to get majority of the questions correct. But do take the time to understand if you are missing something about the question and go in with an open mind. I enjoyed engaging with this community about difficult questions and sometimes the responses helped me connect the dots. But just know, YES - there are illogical and/or ambiguous questions that should not be rationalized. My humble opinion of course. Study timing leading up to the exam: This is probably not discussed enough. I have a very flexible schedule at the moment so I am able to put a lot of hours of studying during the weekdays and gave it a rest on weekends. When I would take mini exams after the weekend I felt rusty. Answering exam questions in quick succession for hours straight is not a skillset most of us in the real world are accustom to. It takes time to develop and you have to stay active with it, or else it will feel like starting all over when you pick it back up. For me, I did SH full length exam #2 two days before the real exam. The day before the real exam I did a couple of practice question sessions that were between 15 - 30 questions long. This helped me stay sharp leading up to the exam. Final disclaimer: This is just my experience. Everyone is different. This community has lots of great suggestions, find what works best for you. Do know there are different versions of the exam out there with different levels of difficulty. Not passing could simply be a matter of what version of the test you received. So do not let that discourage you. Best of luck!",

      "content_preview": "Honestly, not here looking for any sort of praise. Just wanted to share some helpful tips, for whatever it may be worth to you. If you're curious, my stats for the exam: Total Score : Above Target Process (50% of Exam): Above Target People (42% of Exam): Above Target Business Environment (8% of Exam): Below Target Pre-Exam Tip: If you have a little extra coin, pony up and buy a PMI membership. Lots of good resources included in the membership cost, including decreased exam (and retake if necessary) pricing. Especially if you happen to be a student. Student memberships are super cheap, and there's literally no reason not to purchase at that price. Also good if you happen to be going for multiple PMI certs, the money you'll save in exam fees alone will pay for your membership. 1) Every post you see about \"one of the hardest things is how long the exam is\"...just throw that mess in the trash. It's 180 questions. You're obviously not going to be done in 20 min. They give you 3 hours 50 minutes to complete it. But...every 60 questions...you get a 10 min break where the clock stops. So, ballpark, you'll get a 10 min break every hour-ish. 60 questions - 10 min break - 60 questions - 10 min break - 60 questions - Done. Not exactly a violation of the Geneva Convention. I actually finished the entire exam with 45 min to go. On average, I spent just over a minute on each question. Some questions, I had done inside 10 seconds. Others, it took me a few min. But, it's super manageable. Don't let things like exam length mess with you and make it harder than it needs to be. 2) Exam Tip: There are usually two blatantly bad answers. Sometimes, it's one. But, the bad answers are waaaaaaaay out in left field. Like, \"What color is Santa's Suit?\" \"A) Black; B) Green; C) Red; D) Red and White\" It helped me to use the Strikethrough option to visually take the wrong option(s) completely off the table. So, after taking the bad answers off the board, you now have a 50/50 shot at a correct answer, which if you read the question and each possible answer carefully, there's a standout correct answer. But, pay attention to the wording. Don't skim the question or the answers. 3a) Lots of advice rolling out there about what to use for study prep. I didn't use SH, so I can't speak to whether or not it's good, bad, or other. In all honesty, I didn't even open the PMBOK. I'm not someone who can just sit down and read books like that and retain anything. I start glazing over, and eventually realize I just \"read\" 10 pages...and don't recall a single word I read. It's like I'm just flipping pages. I bought Andrew Ramdayal's¬†Udemy PMP Course¬†for the PDUs and used that for some studying. But, for me, the gold mine was his PMP Exam Simulator on his Technical Institute of America site. $45, and easily worth many times that amount. Similarly structured and worded to the actual exam. Lots and lots of very well crafted practice exams and questions. There are several (six total) 60 question/75 minute exams; a couple full length 180 question/4 hour exams; and a 200 question \"Ultra Hard\" walkthrough. That's a six hour endeavor, because it's a YouTube video. I skimmed through that, looked at 20-25 questions with his explanations. Each 60 question mock exam also has a \"study mode\", where instead of being on a timer, you can go through, answer each question, and after submitting each answer, you'll get feedback on whether it's right or wrong, with a written explanation of the correct answer, and a video explanation as well. If you take the timed mock exams, you still get the feedback about the correct answer, it's just after you submit the entire exam, instead of question by question. I just hammered the Mock Exams like crazy. If you fail a mock exam, you can retake it as many times as you need. Once I was consistently scoring over 80% on each, I scheduled my exam. So, for me, the TIA stuff was fully worth it, and I highly recommend it. 3b) I've seen a lot of people looking for an identical setup to the exam, with near identical questions and answers. You may as well abandon that search, and start looking for Atlantis or Jimmy Hoffa's remains. You'll find those before you find an identical PMP Exam online somewhere. Do yourself a favor: learn and practice the material. It will legit make your exam easier. If you try to play the exam memorization game, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Memorize concepts and formulas, not possible exam questions and answers. 4) There wasn't a ton of math on my exam, but there were a few. Mine weren't EVM. Mine were determining timeline (Beta, Triangulation, etc). You absolutely need to know how to read SPI and CPI at a high level to know if something is ahead/behind schedule and over/under budget. Also, be sure you know when/why it's best to use Agile, Hybrid, Traditional, or Predictive methods. For whatever that's worth to you. BE AWARE: Just because there wasn't much math on my exam, does not mean there will not be math on yours. I have a colleague who had about a dozen or so EVM questions on their exam. So, it's a roll of the dice as to whether or not you'll get any EVM on your exam. 5a) If your home supports it, I'd suggest taking the exam at home. First , it makes those 10 minute breaks nice. My first break, I went out, grabbed a quick snack, threw the ball for my dogs a little bit, chatted with my wife. My second break, I went outside, chatted a bit more with my wife, played a little more with my dogs, etc. It just lightens the mood a bit. Secondly , the online proctoring system is pretty solid. But, just like at a test center, you definitely want to login 30 minutes prior and start that check-in process. You'll need to take some pics of your testing space (I luckily have a nice home office, so that played a part); take a selfie of you, take pics of your ID, and upload it all. Then, the proctor will come online, and you'll have to show them on the video of your webcam your testing space, etc. Just make sure you have a clear desk space. You are allowed to have a water bottle on your desk. Also, you don't get a calculator or paper/pen. Those will be part of the exam (there's a calculator and whiteboard app in the exam itself). Thirdly , there are a TON more openings for testing at home via the online proctoring system than there are openings available in a testing center. In my area, the first available testing center opening was 5 weeks out (and there are three separate testing centers in my area). Online, there were options all week long, including same day, at many times of day. A testing center is only open from 8a - 5p. Online, you can test whenever there's an opening. Be you early bird or night owl. I started my exam at 7pm (logged in at 6:30pm to get the pre-exam stuff sorted). Also, be sure to run the system test the day before your exam, to ensure your system can handle the test environment. 5b) I say all that, because I've also taken the PgMP exam, and that's only offered in a testing center. 170 questions, 4 hours, no breaks. Sterile, ultra quiet environment filled with the sounds of clicking mice and scrolling mice wheels where you're almost scared to blink too loudly. I much preferred taking the exam at home vs a testing center. 5c) If you take the exam in the test center, you get your results instantly (at least, you do for the PgMP exam). If you take the exam at home, you'll get a screen saying you'll get your results within 48 hours. In my specific case, I finished my exam at home at 10:15pm; and I had my results the next morning by 8:30am. 6) I see a lot of people saying this exam is about \"mindset\". Honestly, the only \"mindset\" here is learning what PMI is looking for and the wording they use. Andrew Ramdayal actually says this (almost) verbatim in the PMP PDU Prep Course, which I agree with: Even if you're an experienced Project Manager by trade, you need to learn the vernacular and semantics of PMI. If you go in with your real world experience thinking you'll ace the exam, you'll get your ass kicked. You're not being tested on Project Management. You're being tested on what PMI says is Project Management. And, that is a very, very important distinction to make. I've been a Program Manager in some fashion across multiple industries for nearly 15 years, managing more projects and programs than I can realistically recall. Had I gone in with my real world experience as my only knowledge, I guarantee I would have failed. There is no \"SOP\" for how to manage a project or program across all industries. Treat it as a baseline, not gospel. Lastly, there is a minefield of prep courses and YouTube videos out there using the word \"guarantee\", in terms of passing the exam if you use their content. That \"guarantee\" is fully on you and the level of focus you give your preparation. Like all things, you'll get out what you put in. If you put in a half-assed effort, you'll get a half-assed result. I'm also a believer in \"you get what you pay for\". You're about to pay hundreds of dollars for a certification, because you see a value there. So, take the prep seriously, and don't try to rush it. TIA worked for me. SH works for others. Lots of options out there. But, don't put yourself behind the 8-Ball by trying to skimp on the training. You think the certification is expensive? It gets more expensive if you have to retake the exam because your prep was boo boo. Just my $.02. Hope that's all helpful. Good luck to you, and I hope you get that very rewarding, very exciting \"Congratulations\" notification after you finish your exam!",

I scored a 70% on the SH mock exam I used AR‚Äôs PMP exam simulator which was great for engraining the fundamentals. Then I did all the SH practice questions which are way harder than the actual exam, and took one full length mock exam. Don‚Äôt stress it, trust your gut and you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre ready to go in there  and take it, good luck!

Took notes, used them to create my first set of flashcards & drilled to get down the terms.  I felt like this was a good foundation. + Studying for predictive, I did learn the processes and documents from each process backwards and forwards until I could write the entire thing front to back and get it ~90% correct recall + Ran through Andrew's video of 50 questions for the PM mindset completely, was getting 90% of those right by the end. + Then I did the practice test at the end of Andrew's course, got 79% correct. + Then I jumped into Study Hall, and did all the mini practice tests first.  Averaged around 72% correct for the questions. Went through the practice questions for those areas that I wasn't quite happy about or needed to learn stuffs. + Did about 35 of the 200 Ultra Hard questions from Andrew's video, was getting them almost all right after around 15 on, so decided that was enough. Ran through about 10 more the day before the test. + Ran the Practice test #2 from Study hall, got 75% right, decided to schedule the actual exam based on that, took the actual test 2 days later. Overall thoughts on the test: I thought the test was a little easier than the SH - there were a lot more questions with obvious (and only) right answers.  No drag and drops, no calculations, I had to know what SPI and CPI were but didn't need to calculate anything. Almost all the questions were mindset based. SH practice questions and Andrew's videos I mentioned above were exactly the right prep for me, along with reading through the Notes and Cheat Sheet. No issues doing it online! I liked that it was basically exactly how I did the practice test.  It was way easier to schedule online as well - I scheduled mine a day and a half in advance and I had my pick of times. If I had gone in person, the earliest I could have tested would have been October. Hope this helps you all, and good luck!  I've been lurking here as I've been learning/prepping for the last month and a half, and really appreciated people's advice and thoughts.  I think if you follow the advice here, you'll be well prepared.",

My exam was Saturday morning, so Friday I turned on DM‚Äôs 150 PMBOK 7 Scenario-Based Questions at 1.5x speed. I fell asleep during it and ending up listening to the last 10 questions on my drive to the exam center. I found that the actual  exam questions were shorter and more simple than the ones used by David in his study material, while the answers were more ambiguous. Some of them had a very glaringly obvious answers and most others I could narrow down to two. I got to the end of my test, took the survey, and when I was handed my result printout expecting to see a ‚ÄúFail‚Äù I saw that I had actually passed with scores of T/BT/T. I suppose the point of this post is to say not to stress too much going in and don‚Äôt be overwhelmed by all the people here saying that they studied for months to get their AT/AT/AT.

The course is structured in such a clear and practical way that even complex concepts become easy to understand. Andrew‚Äôs teaching style is engaging, straightforward, and focused on what really matters for the exam. The real-life examples, detailed explanations, and practice questions helped me build not only knowledge but also confidence. Most importantly, the mindset taught throughout the course was very valuable. It helped me approach situational questions with the right perspective and stay confident on exam day. The practice exams and strategies mirrored the real PMP test so closely that I felt fully prepared. Thanks to this course, I walked into the test center with confidence and walked out with a pass. I highly recommend it to anyone serious about becoming PMP certified ‚Äì it‚Äôs truly a game changer!",

The exam is basically a case of \"guess what's in the examiners head\". Even following the 'PMP Mindset' doesn't work. So much in so many questions questions is assumed, not even inferred...assumed and unstated. You can follow the mindset, answer accordingly, but, because some element of context wasn't stated have (quite fairly) made a different assumption to the examiner - and, as a result, failed to 'guess what's in their head'. It's almost impossible to 'learn' for the exam. Methodologies and mindsets don't work when questions have unstated assumptions. It's not learning, it's guessing. I'm struggling to justify committing time to a test I can't properly learn for and is too easy to fail. Rant over.",

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/passed-with-at-at-at-the-most-efficient-way-to-study-v0-mxy483h9kuif1.jpg After getting a lot of help from the community, its time to share my experience. I took an approach with the objective to pass the exam with as little time as possible, so it may or may not be the best approach for you. Course : Any Udemy course mentioned in the other post would work. IMO this is probably the least important aspect of studying. I spent prob around 10 hrs going through the 35hr of required CDU videos. All it did was introduced to me to certain terms like waterfall, agile, project management plan, ect. Had no idea what they actually meant. No where near ready for the questions on the exam after course completion. I would recommend spending 5hrs just to get general familiarity. Total hardcore studying time: 2-3 weeks , I still went to work Monday to Friday and kept up with my gym/sports commitments. But I would use lunchtime and whenever available to study. Maybe around 3-4 hrs a day. Longer on the weekend. Study Material: Study Hall Essential . This is by far the most important tool, it is very similar to the question on the exam. My first attempt on the 717 practice questions ranged from 50% to 90%, avging 69%. Then I did the mock exams and mini exam, averaging 73%. I think a good target is to get 80% of all moderate questions correct, 70% of all difficult, and 30-50% for expert (some of these makes 0 sense so don't stress it too much). Then review why you got them wrong. I did so many questions I got to the point where I would pick up a few key words from the questions and know which answer is the correct one. Without really understanding the question or the options. This is when I saw a few post where people are getting 80-90% on Study Hall and claiming they failed the exam. So I was freaking out. Actual Exam: I finished with roughly 1.5hr to spare and didn't want to second guess my answers. So I didnt review anything. The exam was very similar in terms of difficulty to study hall, but less wordy and straight to the point, so overall it was easier and had less expert questions. Good luck to everyone who is taking the exam! Don't be afraid to reach out and let me know if you have any questions!",

For those of you who‚Äôve made a similar transition, what‚Äôs the best way to break into project or product management from a data/technical background?

They did not give me any reason. they just said sorry. Even on email they said \"Sorry, you signed on our terms and condition that we can revoke this certificate any time.\" I don't know what to do! I am unable to breath. It was my heard earned money and hard work. I don't know what process or AI or statistics they are following but they are so wrong. They don't have rights to rob hardworking people for whom $400 is worth much more. Forget about the money... they just robbed me of so many things. My studies, my time management between grueling office hours and what not! I am not even thinking of my job prospective or anything, I am just heartbroken. You trust a system and they just cancel you certificate for no reason at all? I can retake it in a year, again spending 400$ just to get it revoked again!!! For them it's just an OOPS but for us it's shattering. edit: I took the online exam in an office to avoid anyone disturbing me. the office had a table 3 chairs, and a sofa set. Maybe an AC as well. Edit 2: I was emotional when I made this post but I have got to know about some cases where PMI re-certify them or allows them to retake the test. My contact support page is still not loading but I got their Email ID. Honestly, I am fine with any of these solutions. Even if I'll have to take the test in the center with as many proctors as they want. I appreciate every positive comment and sorry for rude replies to some rude comments. Your intention might not be wrong but my state of mind was. I have removed those. Thank you all for your insights. I'll await PMI's response before taking any further action. Edit3: Got a reply from PMI saying it would take 30 days to revert for revocation cases. Revocation took thirty seconds and to give the reason they need 30day! WOW! To answer some question here- yes, I finished the test earlier. Like 35-40 min earlier. I took all the breaks. And there was no VPN that I could think of. Proctor checked literally every thing before the test. The test started only after she okayed it. I was supposed to trust, right? Look man, I was very hopeful till this very moment but someone just share this thread with me. https://www.projectmanagement.com/discussion-topic/209169/help--pmp-exam-score-canceled#_ A person by the name of GHENA ALTAL claims that her online test certificate was revoked without reason. She waited forty-five days, made another payment and took the test at a trusted center. After passing and getting the printed \"Passed\" confirmation, she was given another cancellation a few days later! No comments...",

      "content_preview": "PMP Important Notes: Work performance data is an output of the integration process of direct and manage project work. Team Performance assessment is an output of develop team. Control resources is a process that ensures the physical resources are being utilized correctly. 4. Manage team and develop team are used to manage the project team and not the physical resources. Lessons learned should be done with the team and not just by the project manager. The steps in closing usually involve conducting the lesson learned, releasing the team, and then writing the final report. In the process of determine budget is where the tool of financing is used to seek funding for the project. Develop project Charter is used to get the project authorized. Plan cost management is used to create the cost management plan In the executing process group, the team completes the deliverables. During the monitoring and controlling processes, the deliverables are accepted by the stakeholders. During the planning process, the project management plan is created. 10. During the closing process, the project or phase is brought to formal closure. If an activity is on the critical path, it will have zero slack. Non-critical path activities will have a slack of at least 1 day. The critical path method is about creating a network diagram and finding the critical path. In the forming stage of Tuckman‚Äôs ladder, the stages are forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning. The team is formed and learns about each other. In the norming phase, they stop storming and come to an agreement on how to conduct the work. Performing is when the team actually builds the deliverables. Storming is when they disagree on how to conduct the work. Emotional intelligence is defined as the skill to identify, assess, and influence emotions of ourselves and others around us. Crashing is a scheduled compression method where you add more resources to complete the project sooner. Fast tracking is about running activities in parallel. There are 6 constraints on a project,: scope, cost, time, resources, risk, and quality. When a risk is transferred, it is usually transferred to another company, such as by purchasing insurance or hiring a consultant. Avoidance is used to eliminate a risk by going down a different path. Mitigation is used to reduce the probability and/or impact of a risk The resource calendar shows the availability of resources, both physical and team. 18.The lessons learned register is used to keep track of all lesson learned in the project. Mind mapping is a way to visually organize data. A matrix diagram is used to show the relationship between two or more groups. A flowchart shows a graphical representation of a process. A Pareto diagram displays Pareto‚Äôs 80/20, rule usually in a histogram. Manage quality is an executing process where you will improve processes by conducting audits and process analysis. Compromising is when both sides in a conflict give up something to come up with a solution. Smoothing is when the problem is pushed aside, and forcing is when one side completely wins and the other side completely loses. Problem-solving is the best way, but that would require both sides to come up with a solution in which they both win. Leadership skill is part of interpersonal and team skills. It is used to inspire people and to communicate the project‚Äôs vision An affinity diagram is used to group large numbers of ideas to be analyzed. A prototype is a functional model of a product given to customers for their feedback. Decomposition is a tool used to break work down into more detailed activities. Quality management is about preventing defects from getting into the hands of the customers. It‚Äôs more important to have high quality than high grade. More prevention will lead to less inspection. The cost of quality includes all prevention and inspection costs. Sunk cost is the money that has already been spent on the project. The project budget includes the cost baseline and the management reserves. Opportunity cost is the cost of all lost opportunities when selecting a project Crashing involves adding more resources to a project to decrease the schedule. In this scenario, the project is 7% over budget but is 10% ahead of schedule. Fast tracking and resource leveling generally do not increase costs Ishikawa diagrams, or cause-and-effect diagrams, are used to identify probable causes and sub-causes of a particular problem. A histogram is a bar chart and a flowchart is used to represent a process graphically The communication management plan outlines who will be receiving what type of communications, how often they will receive them, and who will provide them. The project manager should update this plan to specify who will be attending the weekly meetings A project scope statement not only contains the project‚Äôs deliverables but also the exclusions, which are features the project will not accomplish.",

      "content_preview": "If you‚Äôve ever wandered into a Reddit thread asking ‚ÄúWhat does a Project Manager actually do?‚Äù you‚Äôll know the answers range from dead-serious career advice to sarcastic quips that could make it into a stand-up routine. The most upvoted, of course, is the timeless line: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically herding cats.‚Äù And honestly? That metaphor sticks because it‚Äôs both funny and painfully accurate. Imagine trying to guide multiple personalities, deadlines, budgets, and ‚Äúurgent‚Äù last-minute requests, all while the sales team has already promised the client a spaceship that doesn‚Äôt exist yet. That‚Äôs a day in the life of a project manager. Cats everywhere, and none of them want to move in the same direction. Project Management is a role that‚Äôs both gloriously vague and critically essential. It‚Äôs the job that nobody outside the industry fully understands, yet every team quietly depends on. One recurring theme was that the scope of a project manager‚Äôs role is blurry. Sometimes you‚Äôre the orchestrator of deliverables, budgets, and timelines. Other times, you‚Äôre a coach, therapist, or part-time firefighter putting out workplace chaos. One PM described it perfectly: ‚ÄúAnyone who thinks being a PM is a nicely pigeon-holed role with clear boundaries is kidding themselves.‚Äù In some organizations, training team members or even stepping into product strategy becomes part of the role. In others, you‚Äôre told to just ‚Äústick to the plan‚Äù (a plan that, naturally, changes every 24 hours). The scope is elastic ‚Äî it stretches depending on the project, the stakeholders, and sometimes the political mood of the office. Despite the chaos, Project management teaches you skills you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre learning until you use them outside of work. Negotiating with your toddler about bedtime? That‚Äôs stakeholder management. Convincing your friends to pick a restaurant without starting World War III? That‚Äôs conflict resolution. The role also comes with exposure to multiple teams, industries, and projects. You‚Äôre not stuck doing the same thing every day ‚Äî you‚Äôre spinning plates in different corners of the circus. And let‚Äôs not forget the career benefits. The demand for strong project managers is real, and the salary can be very comfortable. One Redditor summed it up well: ‚ÄúThe control you have over scope, budget, and communication can make or break a project. When it goes right, you feel like the captain of a ship.‚Äù Of course, no discussion about project management would be complete without gripes. Imposter syndrome came up more than once. Even experienced PMs admitted to feeling like they were just ‚Äúwinging it‚Äù at times, especially when teams expect them to know everything about technical details they were never trained in. Other pain points included being blamed for delays that weren‚Äôt your fault, dealing with sales promises that defy physics, and constantly proving your worth in organizations that don‚Äôt always see the value of project management. It‚Äôs a tough gig when your successes are invisible but your failures glow neon. There‚Äôs something oddly comforting about realizing PMs across industries all fight the same battles. From software to construction, the core struggles look the same: too many moving parts, too few resources, and way too many cats. Yet despite the frustrations, most people agreed that the role is rewarding in ways you can‚Äôt always measure on a balance sheet. You get to be the glue holding ambitious projects together. You‚Äôre the person who turns chaos into something that vaguely resembles order. And when a project finally crosses the finish line, you feel a sense of accomplishment that no Gantt chart could capture. So yes, project management is herding cats. But it‚Äôs also building bridges ‚Äî between teams, ideas, and deliverables. It‚Äôs equal parts chaos coordinator, diplomat, and accidental comedian when things go off the rails. The scope may be fuzzy, the downsides very real, but the upside is a career that keeps you learning, adapting, and occasionally laughing at how ridiculous it all gets. If nothing else, at least you‚Äôll never look at a group of cats the same way again.",

I don't want to take the CFA but I want to continue to strengthen my profile. I'm hesitant with an Agile certification or something else. Thank you in advance for your advice",

      "content_preview": "Hello, So I'm currently filling my application and planning to take the exam soon remotely. I travel a lot, all the time, so this is my current situation: I have a citizenship in egypt Im currently in canada and staying for a while, until after taking the exam I want to register under egypt because its much cheaper (about 200 dollars cheaper) due to zone pricing In the application they ask you where you intend to take the exam and they warn you of misinformation. Im quite unsure of what to do. Do I just say canada because im here for a while? In that case I'll end up paying 200 dollars more... Seems excessive tbh Do I say egypt and use a secured vpn while taking the exam? Is that an issue? Would it cause problems? Would they know? I have the Kaspersky premium vpn and I can choose egypt easily Do I say egypt and just take the exam remotely without a vpn and they won't really care that my laptop's location is Canada? Do they ask that question only for the physical center? Anyone knows for sure based experience or previous stories? edit: I digged a bit deeper and saw that the remote exam is done through PearsonVue. I downloaded a technical requirement test and it detected my VPN and said it isn't allowed. So I guess the second option is out of the question. Now it's whether I should just use Canada as my intended place or use Egypt and take the exam from my laptop while I'm in Canada.",
