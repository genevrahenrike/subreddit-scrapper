      "content_preview": "I want to share my unusual and frustrating (but also a bit funny) experience with IDFC FIRST Bank. Initially, IDFC approved my credit card in 2023 with a limit of ‚Çπ45,000. Later, in Sep 2024, the limit was increased to ‚Çπ80,000. From that time onwards, I continuously requested further limit enhancement (my other bank cards all have ‚Çπ3L+ limit minimum). But IDFC never increased mine, despite multiple requests and submitting my income documents. Out of frustration, I asked them to reduce the limit as a joke/protest. Shockingly, in June 2025, they actually reduced my card limit to ‚Çπ1,000. After that, I posted about this on social media. Now, today, I received an official mail from IDFC, which said: They acknowledge my repeated requests for limit increase. They reminded me my card started with ‚Çπ45k, went up to ‚Çπ80k, then (on my request) was reduced to ‚Çπ1,000. They said I also posted ‚Äúdefamatory comments‚Äù about IDFC on social media. Finally, they informed me that the bank has decided to discontinue my entire relationship with IDFC FIRST Bank. They will close my account and send further communication about it. This means not just my credit card, but also my IDFC Wealth savings account, FD-based credit card, investments (like gold bonds bought via IDFC) everything might be impacted. I replied to their mail simply: ‚ÄúIDFC win, I quit.‚Äù Honestly, I feel this is the first case in India where a bank reduced a card limit to ‚Çπ1,000 and then completely closed the customer‚Äôs entire relationship because of social media comments. üëâ My previous detailed story is here for context: I‚Äôm the first person in India to get a credit card with ‚Çπ1,000 limit (IDFC) https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCreditCards/comments/1llpd85/im_the_first_person_in_india_to_get_a_credit_card/ Anyone else faced such an extreme step from IDFC or any other bank? And what happens to FD-backed cards, savings, or gold bonds in such cases? At this point, I think I hold a world record: First person to have ‚Çπ1,000 limit credit card in India First person to get bank account closed for memes https://preview.redd.it/idfc-officially-informed-me-we-are-discontinuing-your-v0-8jog4h42wdlf1.png",

Where I use these cards - Amex travel - amazon pay gift cards, once in a year gold shopping in premium brands, amex gyftr Axis atlas - flight booking, hotel booking, Airbnb Icici coral rupay - everyday small UPI spends mainly i use in local meal hotels And The rewards justify the annual fee for amex travel and atlas Would love to hear community thoughts on my 3 card setup! https://preview.redd.it/the-3-card-setup-for-online-shopping-and-travelling-in-tier-v0-fkhvz42ctsmf1.png",

He said application submitted sucessfully but didn't provide any tracking no. And few days later he had provided few more OTPs to that person. He didn't check his email (not very techno-savy). And when did, he found many transactions, and a statement of around 41K. He called bank customer care but thwy said no card issued on your mobile number and DOB. There is an email that says PIN changed. Help what needs to be done. Haven't recieved any card yet.",

      "content_preview": "I got a call from a personal number - the lady on the call said she is an SBI employee from the Pune branch- Komal Maske. And they are offering me a LTF pulse card . I was actually considering going for an SBI cashback card and hence i thought I will get information regarding that from her. Below are the multiple red flags from the conversation which had my alarms ringing They had all my data and she only wanted my Mothers name and adress details to create the application (red flags alert- data leak?) i ignored it as i was checking card offers on paisabazaar yesterday and i thought they must have taken a lead from there I asked her to give information on the Cashback card and she said even that is free (major red flag as i have seen on this thread that SBi cashback card never converts to LTF I asked her to share the information from official email id. She insisted on whatsapp. Fishy. I confirmed again whether she was an employee and not a third party. She said yes but she doesnt have an official email id (here i was sure there is something fishy) i ignored and said ok whatever. They sent a random information pdf of cashback card on whatsapp and i ignored it I called up SBI tollfree to ask them about the cold calling and whether they can confirm this callers number. They said they dont do cold calling and i need to apply via bank. (But no one asked me for the number to do an internal complaint ) PHEW!i was relieved i ddint share my details with the fraud komal ( all this while they have called me 2-3 times to give my address details to confirm) They called back and just to mess with them i answered and asked them to share their employee details as i need to check whether they are the employees. KOMAL IS PANICKING SHE HANDS THE PHONE TO HER BOSS. But now the boss says they are third party and dont have official email id - but can make a call from their landline (make it make sense?) I confronted and obviously he lost it and started abusing me. Registered a complaint with the cybercrime. I got saved as i had some research on the card details and spotted the red flags. Seems too easy - they were offering a paid credit card as a LTF which I desperately wanted only with the details of my address and mother‚Äòs name ‚Äî on bad day might have fallen for it. TLDR- got a cold call offering sbi LTF credit card , called SBI customer care to confirm, got abused by the fraudsters. Question- how would they have used my information to get money from me? Any idea on what the next steps could be in their modus operandi?",

      "content_preview": "Hi Friends, I‚Äôm looking to move ‚Çπ11-12 lakh currently parked in my wife‚Äôs and my IDFC Wealth account, which we use for applying to IPOs and SMEs. The problem is, IDFC‚Äôs Wealth debit and credit cards offer minimal benefits, so I‚Äôm considering switching banks to get better premium credit cards, ideally lifetime free (LTF). Here‚Äôs my current setup: Cards: I hold an HDFC Infinia (‚Çπ10K annual fee), plus a little more than three dozen cards(Pls don‚Äôt judge, I use wisely, pay on-time full amount), which are mostly basic cards with some fees or lifetime free, and a few others like Axis Flipkart, Privilege, and Rewards, Credit History 17 years and 800+ score Banking: My salary account is with ICICI. Spending: Mostly online shopping, travel (domestic), and dining. I spend ~‚Çπ50K-‚Çπ1L monthly on cards. Annually 6~7L Kid‚Äôs academic fees. Goal: Get premium cards with benefits like lounge access, high reward points, dinning, movies. LTF is preferred or renewal benefits like Infinia, but I‚Äôm open to paid cards if the benefits justify the fee. I‚Äôm also planning to optimize a few basic cards‚Äîfor example, from SBI Simply Save, Simply Click, and Octane, I‚Äôd like to close Simply Save and Octane; from RBL‚Äôs three variants, I‚Äôd like to close two, out of 4 Icici I am thinking to close 2-3, out of 3 Axis 1-2 thinking to close and few more. A few specific questions: ‚Å†Can I convert my HDFC Infinia to LTF by moving ‚Çπ11-12L to HDFC? If so, what relationship would I need? ‚Å†Is it possible to achieve Axis Burgundy status with this amount and get a good LTF card like Magnus? ‚Å†Are there other banks (e.g., ICICI, SBI, Kotak) where parking ‚Çπ11-12L could get me premium LTF cards or strong benefits? I understand ‚Äúpremium‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù cards vary by person, so feel free to share based on your experience. I‚Äôd love to hear about specific cards, bank relationships, or strategies you‚Äôve used to maximize benefits. Thanks in advance for your insights!",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys, My monthly income is ‚Çπ2L and I hold savings accounts with HDFC, ICICI, and SBI . Most of my funds are always parked in HDFC, so I keep getting offers from them, while ICICI & SBI are barely used since it has almost 0 funds. Recently, I got the HDFC Diners Club Privilege card (1st year free, chargeable from next year). The issue is‚Äîmany of my domestic and international transactions keep getting declined , and honestly it‚Äôs super frustrating. Here‚Äôs my monthly spending pattern : Groceries: ‚Çπ10‚Äì15K (Lulu/Dmart/SmartBazar) Fuel: ‚Çπ5‚Äì7K Restaurants: ~‚Çπ5K Mall Shopping: ~‚Çπ5K Travel (Flights/Bus): Rare (maybe once in 6 months) Online Shopping (Amazon/Flipkart): ~‚Çπ5K Rent & Electricity: ~‚Çπ15K Loan repayments (via UPI to friends/family): ~‚Çπ50K WiFi: ‚Çπ1.3K Facebook Ads (freelance/personal): ~‚Çπ10K - I sometimes run ads for myself My Cibil is 714 as per August 2025 - Got from Google Pay Now, I‚Äôm confused between reward points vs cashback cards . Cashback cards (like Millennia, etc.) have caps I heard, which seems limiting. Reward points look good, but I don‚Äôt know if I can extract real value out of them. So my questions: Based on my spends, should I focus on cashback cards or reward points cards ? Which cards would you recommend to keep in my wallet, and which one should be my primary card ? What should I do with this Diners Club Privilege card (issued ~2 weeks back) since it keeps giving me problems? Should I open a new savings bank account somewhere and apply for some other card? I am so confused lol Would really appreciate some guidance in brief. I am new to thisüôè",

      "content_preview": "Review: I‚Äôve been using the Jupiter Edge+ RuPay Credit Card for a bit, and honestly, I think it‚Äôs one of the best cards out there if you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or high-spend user. Most cards cater to people spending ‚Çπ50K+ a month or chasing lounge perks, but this one is perfect for those of us spending ‚Çπ15K/month online on Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Nykaa, etc. Here‚Äôs my experience so far: Why I Like It: 10% Cashback That‚Äôs Actually Usable If you spend ~‚Çπ15,000/month on shopping sites like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, Zara, Nykaa, Reliance Digital, Croma, etc. You‚Äôll consistently max out the ‚Çπ1,500 cashback cap at 10%. Each site has capping of max ‚Çπ500 per billing cycle. For someone like me who shops online moderately but not excessively, this feels perfect. 5% on Travel (up to ‚Çπ1,000/month) on travel bookings (MakeMyTrip, EaseMyTrip, Yatra, Cleartrip). 1% Back on Everything Else This isn‚Äôt groundbreaking, but I like that there‚Äôs no complicated category tracking‚Äî1% is flat and uncapped. UPI Being able to pay via UPI with this credit card is ridiculously convenient. Scan-and-pay everywhere and earn 1% cashback. Jewel System Rewards are credited as Jewels (5 Jewels = ‚Çπ1). You can: Redeem them for bill payments after one month (this is what I usually do). Use them for gift cards or digital gold if you prefer. And recently, they added the ability to redeem Jewels for up to 10% on Swiggy and JioMart, which is genuinely handy for groceries and food. One-Time Joining Fee‚ÄîNo Annual Fee The card starts with a ‚Çπ499 + GST joining fee for a limited period, including benefits worth ~‚Çπ1,900‚ÄîAmazon Prime (‚Çπ1,499) and a Fraud Protection Plan (‚Çπ399)‚Äîbut it remains lifetime free, with no annual fee . Downsides I‚Äôve Noticed Caps Limit Heavy Spenders If you spend ‚Çπ50,000+ a month, this card won‚Äôt maximize your returns because of the ‚Çπ1,500/‚Çπ1,000 cashback caps. No Lounge Access or Premium Perks This isn‚Äôt a travel or luxury card. It‚Äôs best for cashback, not lifestyle benefits. Fintech Risk Like most fintech products, there‚Äôs always a chance benefits change over time. TL;DR:If your spends are around ‚Çπ15K/month online, this is one of the easiest cards to squeeze consistent value from. Net cost is basically ‚Çπ100 one time (thanks to referral + freebies), and you‚Äôre set for a lifetime-free card. Edit: I just found out that you need to join via link for referral to count. You can dm for the referral link if needed.",

I had gotten a swiggy cobrand many months ago from YT recommendation, naturally that guy didn't tell me about the cobrand first curse. After sometime i got to know about it from the subreddit. I wanted a core card, wanted hdfc discounts. I waited months I was not offered anything from HDFC, same message \"You already have a card with us\", \"You already have the best offers\". After many months I decided enough is enough, I emailed CC team, they said visit bank and do fill application manually, I enticed them by saying I will open salary account (it won't work btw). 100s of documents I had to submit, the entire process took around one month, I didn't have to do much during this period though, only initial document submission. I will pickup from where i left my previous post post application decline adhaar ekyc happened at my home, the guy took my picture also My application went to inprogress My application was declined again I emailed HDFC CC support asking reason, they said demographic reason My application then again went into inprogress CC email team replied saying PAN card not clear, send again My application went into inprocess again My application got approved I got a final confirmation message of approved Card dispatched I believe it was showing falsely declined in the application, my application was inprogress 3 times and declined 3 times. then it got approved, i think some re-screening processes were pending from their end, after decline maybe someone else reviews it IDK. Final verdict, I got a DCP card. Some may say it's not worth it, it's a bad card etc. Mine is paid i am happy with it, the lounges (no spend) and RP. A checklist to help others get core cards if you recently got a cobrand, wait atleast 6 months first try via hdfc website, they will most probably reject you but worth a try paytm also offers hdfc core freedom, check there earlier paytm was showing me hdfc paytm cobrand but the moment i applied DCP it removed this option for me, AFAIK paytm also keeps checking hdfc status for you. that could mean if paytm is offering u core card, hdfc could also directly try to get a saving/salary/fd/rd account with HDFC first for better chances, if you go this route wait few months for pre-approved. if you don't want an account with them, go to them and ask to fill cc application manually. Try to get special pricing compared to normal pricing. offline application has hell lot of checks, I had to go through 7-8 checks. Be available for them. Don't trust application declined unless you recieve an SMS message application actually declined Keep emailing cc support to keep track of things, don't cut it loose Keep checking application status daily via hdfc tracking my current salary is very good. maybe that helped with dcp because my earlier swiggy card limit was shit. like 3x less than salary this also helped me get a marginal limit increase in swiggy card Happy core card hunting. I suggest start with something like millenia/freedom and then climb your way through to DCP/regalia and hopefully DCB/infinia",
