This was one of the rare gay episodes of the show. I already have confirmed episodes for Nathan, Jared, Benjamin, Roy, Kruse, etc., but Casey is the only one I can’t locate . Has anyone seen a clip or full upload of Casey’s episode on YouTube, Dailymotion, Archive.org , Pluto TV, or elsewhere? Even just the episode number / air date would be incredibly helpful for my tracking project. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "September 11th was the complete death of 90s culture and style. Literally no semblance of the 90s after that. Late 2001 was when the original 2000s culture went full blast. Britney Spears going mature, teen pop dying out, 6th Gen consoles fully taking over with the XBOX and GameCube release, followed by the PS2's popularity and no longer being rare to find. Games GTA III, Halo, Super Smash Bros. Melee killed the relevance of the 5th Gen consoles, and the Y2K console Dreamcast was dead by then too. Movies like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings came out. Michael Jordan came back on a new team. The WWF's Attitude Era was basically over post-9/11, after they got rid of \"RAW IS WAR\" and changed it to \"RAW\". Core 2000s genres like pop punk, butt rock (think Nickelback and Creed), bling rap, and even emo either took its roots from this period or took over as the main genre. This is just late 2001 by the way. Also, Bush's approval was at its ultimate peak here. Can't get anymore \"Aughts\" than that. For 2002, you had the Euro making its debut as a currency, Tom Brady beginning the Patriots dynasty, Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears breaking up followed by the former going solo in the summer (after NSYNC broke up), Backstreet Boys were on a hiatus. Groundbreaking movies like Spider-Man came out, which was very un-90s. Like Mike, Barbershop, and even Friday After Next were very 2000s movies. The War on Terror was in full motion and there were even talks of Iraq by then. The WWF was now the WWE. Everything just felt so fresh during this time. Fashion-wise, lowrise jeans were in style and you started to see white boys with the pop punk look and no longer wearing frosted tips, while the girls wore a sort of rugged haircut. The \"Rachel cut\" was dead on arrival by late 2001. Flip phones were also getting popular. DVDs were starting to become more popular than VHS. The iPod came out. Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius released and Spongebob was starting to become relevant. Like pop culture fully settled into the new millennium and that was the main focus, in spite of being in the shadow the tragedy of 9/11. Eminem was at his peak with The Eminem Show and 8 Mile. When I think of the 2000s, I think more of Pharell, Avril Lavigne, Vanessa Carlton, J Lo, Ja Rule, and Ashanti, not 50 Cent, Kanye West, Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and Lil Jon. The post-Dot Com recession was the epitome of what was the real 2000s economy. The 2002 VMAs were the culmination of what the 2000s were \"supposed to be\", while the 2001 VMAs ushered us into this new exciting culture. It doesn't get anymore 2000s than the \"Remember 2001\" and \"Remember 2002\" montage on YouTube. Remember 2001: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJdELoiiAoU Remember 2002: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bORRM0LNa6s However, things started to change around late 2002-early 2003. One reason: 80s nostalgia. GTA Vice City came out and gave way to the explosion of 80s things being relevant again. Paid In Full also came out in the fall of 2002, which was a movie based on the 80s. Even George W. Bush and the USA in general were trying to go back to the 80s and try to bring back the \"good ol' times\". It really wasn't about the new decade anymore. It was about \"bringing back the 80s status quo\". McBling culture and consumerism/materialism being at an all-time high after the brief recession that went on in 2001-2002, really showed us that this new decade would just be a replay of the 80s and nothing original. Society was even trying to be conservative like the 80s, but failed miserably. It was a watered down version of it. The earliest sign of it was in early 2002 with That 80s Show, but that show was so bad that it didn't make a difference. It was a flop. Got cancelled within months. I'd say by late 2003, \"reboot 80s\" culture came back in full force. late 2002-mid 2003 was a transition. Late 2001-mid 2002 was the complete pure 2000s. Core 2000s culture was somewhat relevant until 2008 or so when the recession hit and Obama became president, but it didn't feel the same, and it was barely relevant. Completely dead on arrival by mid 2009 as the new core 2010s culture went into full motion. In recap, the core 2000s were from late 2001-2002. Late 2001-mid 2002 was the absolute peak of \"Aughts\" culture. Late 2002 was the beginning of \"reboot 80s culture\" that lasted until 2008 when the recession hit. 2000s culture wasn't at the centre of relevance anymore. 2000s culture hit its peak in that immediate post-9/11 period and it was started to decline by the end of 2002 as culture was starting to become a replay of the 80s. That's my two cents. Tell me what you guys think in the comments.",
