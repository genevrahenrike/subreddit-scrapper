JUST USB CONNECTION DOESNT . i retried",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, Back in the day I used to mess around with R-Trophy folders for PS3, PS4, and PS Vita, and I really enjoyed it as a hobby. It was always fun to sync and see how the system handled it. Lately, I’ve been feeling like getting back into it and trying to rebuild/collect these folders again. I was wondering if there are others here who also enjoy this kind of thing, or who might have collections they’d be willing to share. If so, maybe we could start putting everything together and make a kind of research/topic hub so all this information doesn’t get lost. To show I’m serious, here are a couple of links I already have, as examples: 🔗 Vita Folders By Name (Mediafire) 🔗 Trophy Unlockers Collection (Mediafire) If anyone has more folders or related files, feel free to share — or even DM me if you’d rather. Depending on what’s out there, I’d even consider negotiating for certain sets. Would be awesome to see if there are still people out there who are into this and maybe rebuild a solid archive together.",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I want to download the original \"Jetpack Joyride\" game on my Vita (not the \"Deluxe\" version) in order to complete the trophy list. However, the game has been delisted in EU stores. It is still available on US stores. I do have a US account on my PS3/PS4/PS5, but not on my Vita because AFAIK, you can't have multiple PSN accounts on a Vita. So here is my idea: if I buy the OG \"Jetpack Joyride\" on my US account on the PS3, download it, switch to my FR account, can I plug my Vita to the PS3 and download the game on it? Hope it's clear enough. Thanks! :)",

Would there perchance be any hope for me to learn enough about vita plugin development to make it myself? (I’m a relatively competent programmer, though I’ve never touched console homebrew modding or any low-level stuff like what I’d imagine plugin developement would be). where would I get started?",
