      "content_preview": "Hello, I'm a new board member in the treasurer position of our Townhome Condominium HOA development, 7 buildings, 42 units. Earlier this summer, the roofs of two units underwent repair to replace rot around skylights. The repair was 2-3x higher than anticipated and exceeded the approved budget set at the start of the year. Thus, we pulled from reserves. We have many fiscal conservatives on the board who keep using the term 'borrowed from' reserves and insist on immediate repayment through assessment. However, $ from the reserve account was used for a legitimate and intended purpose and while it does result in an end-of year decline in reserve level to the monies allocated for roofs, it does not put us in a position where we are underfunded. I would like to see the reserves rebound, but I slightly resistant that it's necessary to levy a separate assessment for this particular line item right away. I cannot find any information about reserve repayment requirements for my state and would like to know the thoughts of this community. As a separate question, what other mechanisms do we have at our disposal for repayment (earned interest on investments)? What is an appropriate target date to set for any repayment? Thank you.",

Before the camera was taken, the florida police agencies covering my area stated that it would be illegal for the HOA to just take the camera as HOA rules are civil and taking something would be criminal.   Am I missing something here?  If it is illegal to just take someone's property even if in a common area, why would the  HOA do it?",

Our parcel has never signed any of the paperwork recognizing there is an HOA like other parcels (confirmed through county auditors office). A couple years ago they decide to be active, we pay the fee because its small, even though the HOA literally does nothing for the community. We get a notification that our trees and shrubs are too tall, so we get it taken care of. We didn't realize we had to notify them. A letter shows up notifying us of the fines they are charging for the trees that are no longer there and telling us they are putting a lien on the house. They are trying to tell us that just because we bought our home in 2018, that makes us part of the HOA automatically (they said this is according to their lawyer). We consulted with a lawyer who said the opposite and that it appears we are not part of the HOA. We exhausted all our money taking care of the trees and dont have the approx $4000 to hire a lawyer to fight this. Has anyone gone through something like this? EDIT: I was partially going off of what my spouse was telling me about documents but I actually read them myself tonight to get a full understanding. The county's auditor office has the CC&R's online and it does say for participating lots. It has attached all participating parcels (ones that have signed the form acknowledging the HOA).

      "content_preview": "Our annual homeowners meeting is next week and from what we can tell our HOA doesn’t follow the by-laws for meetings/elections We live in a private, gated HOA that is organized under state law as a not-for-profit corp. Our attorney general regulates HOA offerings but not operations. There are 125 single-family homes on private lots.  We share a clubhouse and various amenities and services. Conservative aggregate property value $150M. Annual budget with special assessments about $1.5M. Five board members. One P/T property manager. The HOA apparently routinely struggles with meeting quorum requirements and relies on proxies to conduct business. Busy owners with busy schedules is the default explanation. This will be our third meeting. From our reading of the HOA By-Laws and Declaration, it appears that several annual meeting requirements are not being met: No roll call - how do we know who is in attendance and if we have a quorum? No reading of the previous meeting’s minutes - which are required to include how many proxies were filed with the board secretary for the prior meeting/vote (and do not). No appointment of election inspectors. No Executive Board vote - the By-Laws requires the election takes place AT the annual meeting. Proxies are valid only for the duration of the meeting. Per the official Annual Meeting Notice, voting begins AFTER the meeting and runs for three days No Grievance Committee elections - the By-Laws authorize five volunteer-staffed committees (finance, architectural review, maintenance, social, newsletter) but mandate a Grievance Committee consisting of three annually elected members. This is where members can challenge the board’s interpretation/administration of the rules and regs, as well as violations and fines. There is none. The board and PM have not responded to our written communications outlining our concerns.  We have spoken with an attorney but view litigation as at best the second worst option. We recently mailed a “call to action” flyer to all of our neighbors reinforcing that the strength of any HOA is dependent on homeowner participation and encouraging them to attend in person.  Our sad expectation is that most have already gone out in the recycling. Thoughts?",

Our CCRs allow for liens to be placed on homes in the event that people do not pay dues but we have never really dealt with violations of the CCRs themselves. Because of that, we were fortunate to be able to go without a fine system/structure but unfortunately, we've had some new homeowners move in that have become destructive of HOA property (primarily landscaping which they do not own) and refuse to make things right. This has called into question that our HOA and the CCRs have no \"teeth\" behind them unless we want to place liens on homes for every little thing which is impractical. I'd like to get our CCRs amended to include fines and a fine structure to put some \"teeth\" in the agreements that doesn't involve a lien but does involve repercussions for breaking CCRs. I've noticed people here have mentioned that they are fined for some violations and I'm just wondering what that structure is and how much?",

      "content_preview": "A recent special election was held in a small HOA (fewer than 20) due to unexpected resignations. The person who ran for president ran unopposed and won by a two-vote margin. This was surprising because the nay's had discussed the votes beforehand and determined they had enough votes to deny a majority. However, the results were accepted at the time and the new president assumed their position. A few days later the member who collected (but not tallied) the ballots reviewed them and saw that their own ballot was incorrectly tallied as a yea (they had torn off the \"no\" option and left the \"yes\" boxed unchecked, intending it to be a blank ballot). This would have resulted in a tied vote with the sole nominee not being elected. Now, this person is struggling with what to do with the info since any discussion or correction of this mistake would overturn the election result and cause a bit of an uproar. To add, there was existing animosity between the newly elected president and those who opposed, and if this ballot issue is brought to light there would likely be significant pushback and accusations of lying and/or cheating. Anyone encounter a similar situation before or have any advice?",

A home in our community was sold, and the HOA account tied to that property had a credit of over $5,000 because the previous owner was unknowingly overpaying through autodebit. The new owner not only bought the home but also became the HOA treasurer. Shortly after stepping into that role, he received the refund check for the $5,000+. When another resident asked about it, he said he didn’t know how to reach the former owner — so he kept the refund. Who should actually be entitled to that money? •\tThe new owner, since the account is technically tied to the property? •\tOr the former owner, since they were the one making those extra payments every month via autodebit? This is in Florida, where HOA law can be pretty specific. Curious if anyone here has dealt with something similar or knows how this typically plays out (both legally and ethically).",

      "content_preview": "I have managed to stumble into the presidency of our small SFH neighborhood HOA that was just transitioned from the developer to the residents. I've never been on a Board of Directors, and as such, I am the peak of ignorance on all of this. Today's question has to do with opening a savings account for our reserve fund. Based on my strategy in my personal life, I am looking to open a HYSA at an online bank to get started, then eventually migrate everything over a certain amount to a brokerage account where I can invest in index funds. So on to the question. Obviously I can't just open a personal HYSA and brokerage account. What specific type of account(s) should I be looking at to hold the reserve fund? Is my general strategy sound, if I'm looking to minimize risk while maximizing my bottom line? Any advice in this area would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content_preview": "So the HOA here sent out a notice last month saying all mailboxes needed to be beige instead of black. Mine was black, so I went out, bought paint, and did exactly what they asked. Two days later I get a violation notice saying “unauthorized alteration of property” with a $50 fine. I called them and explained I literally painted it beige because of their letter, and the manager tells me I should’ve filed an architectural request form first and waited for approval. For a mailbox color change that they themselves required. Now they’re telling me it’s $50 a day until it’s “corrected,” but when I asked what “corrected” means they said to leave it as-is but still submit the form and wait up to 30 days. Basically I’m being fined for not waiting for permission to follow their own rule. Feels like they just look for ways to squeeze money out of us.",

      "content_preview": "What a mess! Long Post. Situation - We have a committee who has circulated a very inflammatory and emotional petition to members via email to recall two directors (8/6). Committee notifies Board of Directors that they are officially notifying them of said recall by email. (8/11). Committee notifies Board of Directors of an October 4 election, outlining opening polls in community room. (8/16) An Inspector of Elections notifies Board of Directors that we are to produce a Member List with all contact information (8/17) The Board of Directors voted in Executive Session to allow Legal Council of the HOA to handle this. (8/24) Legal Council notified the Committee that the procedure they were following was incorrect and that they had not submitted a valid recall petition. Since then it's been back and forth between the Attorney and Committee Chair multiple times. No matter how much the Attorney informs that they have a right to a recall but they have not followed the proper procedure, they push back citing DV code (that only governs regular voting) saying that the recall vote and subsequent election is taking place, they are in charge and that we are trying to intimidate members. They have also said that the Board of Directors is not to discuss the recall with any member as to not intimidate them. So the affected Directors have been sitting by, with multiple false allegations being lobbed at them, and no recourse for presenting factual evidence to disprove the committee's allegations. The Attorney now says it will cost between 15k and 20K to deal with this, post illegal election, in court (not counting what has already been spent), and now that she is apprised of the situation she cannot allow illegally elected members to sit on the board and will file an injunction with the court. Back story - even though the Board of Directors voted unanimously to not renew a long term manager's contract (complicated situation but basically it was very expensive and no value added at $35K a year at a 20hr/wk), they singled out two directors - President and CFO. The plan is to recall them, replace with two of their own people and hire  the manager back because she is their friend. Our reserves are pathetic - 14% funded - which led to the finance committee assessing the budget this past year, shaving off every bit of fat so we could build our reserves up. This board is the first in the 40 year history to add more than 10% per year to the Reserve. It is now at 30%. The Board has been behind this unanimously every step of the way. Final - I've had it. Can I give this committee the proper information  ie: Davis-Stirling and corporate codes to submit a valid petition? The only thing our By Laws say is that since we have cumulative voting the removal election has to be handled the same way. (yes I know, that should have been removed years ago). Seriously, have the recall, it's your right, but let's do it correctly and allow the directors the opportunity to present evidence to the members in their defense. Thank you for reading this.",

There is a management company and the person from the company has been working with the board for over ten years. I happened to notice that the board president recently got reimbursed for some purchases which had some personal items and I couldn’t find the things in our common spaces either. The total value was about $200. When I raised it with management the lady is just being evasive saying it was already approved, for the community etc. I don’t want to inform the other board directors for fears of retaliation and the possibility that they will look the other way and see me as the “troublemaker”.

      "content_preview": "Background: I'm the secretary and a member of a seven-member BoD for townhomes. There are well over 200 units. I have two questions/requests for advice. 1a. Recently, there was a miscommunication between employees at the property management office resulting in an unauthorized payout from our accounts of over $6,000.00. It looks like one employee thought that the other employee had permission to engage a vendor without bids, and did so, resulting in the payment. To their credit, we were informed very soon after it happened. 1b. We've set a discretionary limit; I think it is $500.00; that management can spend before approval from the board. If the board had been informed, we would not have approved it without bids, and would not have approved that bid as it is a lot more than we've paid for similar services in the past. The vendor has already been paid from our accounts. I have not yet seen the detailed invoice of the payment (services provided, etc.). 1c.This afternoon is the first board meeting since the expenditure. How would you handle it with property management? We've paid an amount that we would not have otherwise paid. 2a. Yesterday afternoon, (Sunday) we all received a copy of the management company's contract for the upcoming year in email. It is 16 pages long. There was a note saying that it needs to be read before discussing at this afternoon's meeting. According to the time stamp, it arrived 25 hours before our scheduled monthly meeting. 2b. I saw the contract late last night and skimmed it, but am not comfortable voting on it or even discussing it in front of the property manager. Short notice and the amount of the contract dictate that we don't jump into approving the contract today. In spite of Issue 1., I think that property management has done a good job. This is one of our biggest expenditures and I don't want to put my name/vote to something I haven't had time to read, research, and ask questions about. 2c. I think we should table discussion until we can have an executive session to fully discuss the contract. Thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "I am on the HOA board of a small condo complex (48 units). I joined because our HOA previously just said 'no' to everything even if reasonable. My partners and I agree that we should be open to all ideas and requests, and denials should be based pretty much on cost and legality. For the past 2 years, we've tried to make condo-living more like independent living (while at the same time protecting the complex from typical detriments). The latest effort: Write guidelines to allow emergency power generators during extended power outages (due to weather, terrorism, etc.). This would logically include the kind you can roll into your driveway, but also 'permanent' kind (like Generac-style). Even though all tenants would benefit from the ability to remain in-place and not require relocation, we have some older folks with medical equipment in residence that would be impacted even if outage was just more than a couple of days (vs. a backup-battery style solution which may give you a day). So, I ask: Anyone have front-row experience with successful HOA rules regarding generators? Our current considerations include: Operating according to manufacturer rules, proper distance from structures, noise mitigation, hours of operation, use entirely within the scope of HOA guidelines or will be removed, letter of obligation to operate properly and release HOA from liability if you fail. We realize much of this must go through the lawyers but would appreciate input getting started. Thanks in advance. MHGA, Woodstock GA",

      "content_preview": "hello, i live in a first floor condo with one neighbor above me. these neighbors are renters and are incredibly negligent when it comes to home maintenance. TLDR: they had a busted AC and didn’t fix it, it started leaking into my home and borderline flooded it, breaking our hot water heater. now, my sink has started to slowly back up and we noticed the water was slightly greasy. we never put grease down the sink. we stopped using the kitchen sink entirely. we leave one afternoon and don’t come back until about 1am. we come home and our sink (and dishwasher) are full of literal grease water that we had to suck out and transfer manually. called plumber next day and they came to fix it and pretty much told me it’s obvious the clog is not in our home as we were not even home when it happened and we had not been using the sink at all. SO MUCH GREASE. it’s like they’re literally pouring oil into the sink straight out the bottle. i call hoa and asked what the process is for a reimbursement since this problem was not ours and was caused due to the stacked line. hoa says they’ll only pay if the clog is over 150ft out. every plumber i have spoken to including the one that fixed our clog, says this is a ridiculous number. i called again to ask for this in writing, they will not do it until i share with them my invoice from the plumber. i am just asking for the “rule” they gave me in writing to my email. i absolutely hate dealing with my hoa and they are awful and pretty much everything, i know this is how people get away with these things but i need clarification on how they can withhold sharing with me this rule they seemed to have just made up on the spot to not have to pay for the maintenance. i just need some assistance, thank you. UPDATE: association has provided me with rules, bylaws, declarations, the whole everything. it clearly states that any plumbing issues caused within a system that supports  the building (shared pipes) or issues that happen within a unit that are a part of system that is contained within the unit but service other units are the associations responsibility. they are still completely ingoring my question about the 150ft. plumbing company is adding to the invoice that is caused by another unit and they entered common pipes. fingers crossed i get my money back.",

      "content_preview": "Our HOA needs to start building our reserves and the board is a bit gridlocked about how to do it. Our current monthly dues are high enough that we can put ~$1k into the reserve every month, which isn't enough. I've proposed increasing the monthly dues to build the reserve over time would probably be more acceptable to ownership than large and/or repeated special assessments. One member objected saying that his accountant warned him that doing this would make it impossible for owners to track improvements that increase their tax basis - that collections for the reserve should allow homeowners to increase their tax basis or depreciate if they're renting their unit, and that becomes impossible if it's lumped in with the monthly collection for operating costs. But reserve collections don't immediately translate to additions to the building so I'm not sure that's a valid concern. And in any case, we are already collecting more than operating costs and adding to the reserve, and our management company says that's normal. The issue has been on ice for a few months now since neither of us is budging and the others don't seem interesting in making a decision, but we will be completing a reserve study soon and I expect we'll be at about 25% of the recommended funding. So I'm curious to hear from others - is it generally acceptable to build the reserve through higher monthly dues or should this be done through fundraising? Can anyone recommend resources I can bring to the board to help substantiate either position? And, what records should the HOA make available to owners to help with tracking relevant repairs or improvements to the building? (Our management company was completely silent on that question)",

The HOA has recently gone against their own bylaws for roofing when putting a new roof on the neighborhood pool house which is why I’m finally asking this here.  We looked at the same type of roof (metal) before we replaced ours a few months ago and opted NOT to do it went against the allowed roof materials. We have read our covenant, bylaws, & read every “resource” link on the website. I put that in quotations because none were resources, they were links for things such as “things to do & places to go in our city”.

      "content_preview": "I live in an townhome community and about 7mo ago, there was an incident with our car that we needed some video footage of. We went door to door in the area asking if the neighbors had Ring footage of the incident. The last door my husband knocked on turned out to be the HOA President’s. He’s not my husband’s biggest fan because my hubs had very vocally called out some BS rules a bit before. Seeing it was my husband, he started getting agitated and started calling my husband a “fuckface” and “shithead”. My husband never curses but he’s really good at respectfully getting under peoples skin 😂 because next thing you know, the President is threatening to “beat the shit out of” my husband. My husband walked away to de-escalate the situation. A little while later, the cops showed up because the President called them on my husband for “trespassing”. The cop got both stories and apologized to my husband for the drama and even stated “that guy has no business being a board member”. Fast forward to the end of the day, my husband gets a Cease & Desist letter from the HOA citing that my husband was the one using threatening language and threatening violence?? The HOA president COMPLETELY lied and flipped the story! This falsified story is now in our “record”. We usually wouldn’t give 2 shits, but we’ve been getting parking violation notices sent to our house twice now for parking our car outside our garage for - I kid you not - 5 minutes. We have 2 babies and sometimes between transitions, I need space and my husband will park the car right outside our garage for a BRIEF MOMENT so I can put the kids in or take them out. People all across the neighborhood park their cars this way for days and overnight but we feel like we’re being specifically targeted with these violation notices and being fined. Every appeal goes to the HOA president to review and he obviously denies every single one. Is there anything at all we can do? Also, we are moving to another single family home later this week with NO HOA. But we will still own this townhome property so still need to deal with this bullshit.",

      "content_preview": "Hi board members - I'm curious as to whether anyone has a technical solution for this. We are a SFH community with just under 300 homes. Because we do not have a clubhouse and it's more convenient for members and board members, we do our meetings virtually. Currently, we use Zoom because that is what our management company prefers. The challenge with this is the time that it takes to verify members when they join the meeting. Last year, we had about 50 people attend and it took more than 20 minutes to get everyone verified. The meeting started late, and the members got impatient while waiting. (And I don't blame them). Our board has discussed this and we agree that we need a much more streamlined solution for this year's annual meeting. Does anyone have a solution that they use that works better for this? Obviously we will check any legal implications with regard to open meetings law (etc.) with our own counsel but at the moment we're looking for systems that would allow us to verify each member and their address without requiring them to pre-register for the meeting. Thanks in advance for any advice that you have.",

I’ve attached photos and reported it to the property manager, but am unsure about what costs the HOA is actually responsible for. A few details: The shutter is a common condo facility. Also, I have auto insurance but sorting that as last resort. My main concern is who should pay for repairs—1. Should the HOA’s master insurance cover property damage to resident vehicles when it’s their infrastructure that failed? 2. Has anyone had success with HOA or building liability insurance in a situation like this? 3. What steps should I take to get them to process the claim and not push responsibility back on me? 4. Any tips for documentation or legal arguments if they try to deny responsibility? How long can this process take? Would love to hear any similar experiences, advice, or details on how you got your HOA or condo insurance to pay for car repairs due to building/common area failures!",

      "content_preview": "Our condos were built in 1963, and since then, the boiler that heats 24 units hasn't been replaced. It gets multiple repairs a year and is inefficient. Most co-owners use space heaters. The quote was $40,000 to replace 8 years ago. There is no new estimate. It is an issue where it's possible that individual units must have their radiators replaced. My guess is it's potentially $120, 000 or a $5,000 special assessment. The co-owners, by and large, refuse to pay increases and have the mindset that the boiler must continue to work [just 'cause, I guess]. Is there anything I can do to prevent the units from potentially becoming uninhabitable in the winter? My guess is some may stay with space heaters, which is dangerous. There is legal action I can take that doesn't have to do with the boiler, but the issue remains that some may not have the $5000 for the special assessment if it comes to it. We don't have financials for the past three years, so the association getting a loan is likely a non-starter. Somehow,  individuals may qualify for a HELOC loan if they have worthy credit. I've posted before about the COA, and it's dysfunctional. The suggestion to move is considered,  but I've been told property value would double with coherent management and upgrades. Any help is appreciated,  thanks.",

This happened around 4am, we noticed water entering our basement around 4:45 through the escape window and tried to figure out where it was coming from. We found the water coming from the parking lot, roughly 30-40 feet from our basement. Phone calls were made to public works beginning at 5:10am by residents, the fire department, and the police. No response from their or of hours service. First response came at 6:35 once their office hours had begun, and they arrived on scene around 6:45. The water was eventually shut off around 7:40am. The water was entering our basement very quickly, several hundred gallons over the duration of the leak. Luckily the sump pump worked hard to jeep the water level as low as possible, but it still got to around 4 inches. So far I’ve spoken to our town hall, HOA, and personal home insurance - nobody is being very helpful. I’m trying to figure out where liability stands here, of course I don’t want to pay a deductible and have my own insurance premiums increase for something I had no control over. I’m waiting for maintenance records, but initial suggestions are that the water lines have not been inspected, valves turned, hydrants flushed etc for over 5 years - this could place liability of the town. There is also a suggestion that the water system has some kind of bypass, and as such the HOA are responsible for maintenance, in which case liability may be placed there. Has anyone dealt with anything similar? Any information on likelihood of each part accepting liability for damages?",

I assumed a neighbor, that Im friendly with, mightve been leaving me a note. For further context, I serve as a board member and we've recently received a homeowners petition by this neighbor, and a very select few, raising concerns about a mandated inspection of unit radiators connected to the boiler-- only to find out some homeowners have neglected their radiators (one cracked, was duct taped and turned off) triggering multiple safety shut offs of the boiler. The emails the board has received about this matter are quite hostile. Ive been cc'd on them because no one has access to me outside of management. The note neighbor requested my personal contact information in their note, leaving their email address, that they slid under my door. This feels delicate to navigate in a certain sense because Ive only met this neighbor in person 1 time. We're also a smaller community that has a history of some tension between members who've lived here longer while newer owners are pretty committed to fostering community engagement, myself included, as we get along well. I also believe in boundaries and maintaining personal space. Respect the bubble. My bubble feels violated having seen someone use this approach since they have access to the building. I started creeping around my condo, tiptoeing, so as not to alert someone I was home and I did not like having to do that. I doubt Im being asked to dinner and exchanging information will open a door I'd rather stay shut.",
