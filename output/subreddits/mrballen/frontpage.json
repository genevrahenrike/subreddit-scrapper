      "content_preview": "I apologize if my writing is bad but I'd like to share one of my stories. My name is Ellie, I'm sixteen and live in Alaska. One night my friend was over, and it was about 8-9 PM but it was already extremely dark outside. I asked my friend if he wanted to go outside and explore, kind of in the hopes we'd come across something weird. He agreed so we got some warm clothes on, got lights, and other such things. So we're just kind of walking around my property messing around and kind of giggling and cracking jokes whenever we'd here a noise. But after a few laps around my property we heard this incredibly loud sound over by my uncle's old shed. It sounded like something really heavy bumping into some metal. It freaked us out at first but we played it off and again just giggled about it. After a couple more laps though we had noticed a white light over by the shed.. it felt piercing in a way, like it was looking at us. Soon after it disappeared, few laps later, we saw a SECOND white like, alongside a red light. They would kind of flicker? I guess that's the word. They'd disappear for a second then come back on. (Soon after all this happened we had looked it up and those lights are a common sighting with alien related things) Even though we were freaked out we were also excited in a way, intrigued even. This is what we wanted, we WANTED to see weird stuff that's the whole reason we came outside! Again though, after a few more laps around the property we started hearing this loud ringing sound. We both heard it at the same time. I don't know how to describe it, I've never heard anything like it. It really did sound alien like. It was like a ringing but it sounded exponential.. like it was growing? It would get louder, quiet down, get louder, quiet down, etc. I'm probably giving an awful explanation because again it's like something neither I or my friend have ever heard before so it's hard to describe. It was incredibly loud though.. it scared the hell out of us but AGAIN we were still so interested! So even though we had a gut feeling that hey, maybe we shouldn't keep messing around with this stuff. But we kept doing laps around the property (I should also explain we never went directly to the shed. Around our laps we'd pass by where the shed was, a bit away in the woods) we kept hearing that noise over and over again Everytime we'd walk by it. Even if we were extremely far away from the shed we could still hear it in the background, just ringing.. after awhile we got too freaked out and went back inside. Later that morning we went over to the shed and found nothing at all, kind of to be expected. But we found anything metal and would kick or hit it with something as hard as we could to see what could've possibly made that crashing sound we heard before everything else. Nothing, nothing over there was loud enough to have heard it from where we were. I'm sorry for the bad writing and bad explanations but wanted to share my story, maybe even have it put in a video! Also I bet I'm just looking too far into it, but we also saw an owl in the shed several days before that all happened. Apparently owls are a sign of alien activity? I dunno, sounds silly doesn't it? I have a lot more stories, they're all short but I still have a lot. It probably has something to do with the fact that my property was bought from cultists! Anyhow, to anyone who's made it this far, thank you! If you'd like me to share more stories please do tell!",

A bunch of people get their own letters that threaten to out their secrets to the whole town. If anyone can remind me of the name of this story or give me a link I’d be so happy!

Jon Bon Jovi helps talk a woman off the ledge of a bridge while filming a music video September 12, 20248:57 AM ET By Rachel Treisman Jon Bon Jovi, pictured at the U.S. Open tennis championships in New York on Sunday, is credited with helping save a woman's life on a Nashville bridge just days later. Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP Rock star Jon Bon Jovi helped talk a woman off the ledge of a bridge in Nashville this week, bringing a new meaning to “ Keep the Faith .” The Metro Nashville Police Department tweeted on Wednesday that Bon Jovi and his team had persuaded the distressed, unidentified woman to come “off the ledge over the Cumberland River to safety.” “It takes all of us to help keep each other safe,” added Police Chief John Drake. Music Bon Jovi docuseries 'Thank You, Goodnight' is an argument for respect The police also shared a video of the incident, which has since been taken down by YouTube. But other clips posted by local media and fan accounts help paint a picture of what happened on the Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge — a truss bridge offering panoramic views of the Nashville skyline — Tuesday night.",

      "content_preview": "My names Matthew, I was 19 at the time. I just moved back home to TX. I went to visit my dad in Rio grand city, his house is located inside his ranch. One night he and my step mom get ready for a party, they asked me if I wanted to join but i declined. I wanted to explore my dad’s ranch, nothing too fancy just 12 acres. The sun was setting and I had my cousins pistol for protection for we have hog, snakes, coyotes etc. I stayed out longer than expected and before I knew it it was pitch black outside. I had a flashlight app on my phone, not that it did much but better than nothing. As I’m walking back I get the feeling I’m being watched. I stop and look around with my flashlight but saw nothing. As I continued walking I heard rustling up ahead. I immediately drew my pistol, moving a couple steps forward when this massive dark figure with a large wingspan flew over me. It scared me so bad that I pulled the trigger and the gun didn’t go off. This is the part that puzzles me. When I left my dad’s house I immediately racked the gun. As this dark figure flew over me I had a clear shot but the gun didn’t go off. I racked it again and the gun went off. I ran faster than I had before, the image of the dark figure with the large wingspan kept replaying in my head. As I made it back to my dad’s, it dawned on me that the figure might have been a la lechuza, a witch owl. Down here in the Rio grand valley and being of Mexican descendants we believe in most of the Mexican folklore. A memory than popped into my head. My grandmother told me a story when I was a kid. Her father went to my great grandfathers ranch where my dad lives now and while hunting for rabbits he said he smelled sulfur, the smell of the devil and saw a glowing pair of red eyes staring at him. He raised his rifle and like me the gun didn’t go off. His rifle went off when he was out of sight. 2 incidents occurred in that same ranch. My encounter was different from my great grandfather but how ironic both of our guns didn’t go off when we encountered a mysterious figure",

The latest one was when I was at work and, I won't go into details because I work in healthcare, but something happened where someone said that line from Dirty Dancing \"no one puts Baby in a corner \".

Just wanting to check before I pull the trigger on a copy!",

      "content_preview": "This true but crazy story starts off summarized in an old TV episode of “ A Haunting – S4, Ep 5: Spirits of the Dead. ”  But it doesn’t end there.  It would get worse.  MUCH worse.  When digging deeper online, no one is talking about the connection to the events that happened later. First, how do I know what happened to this family? My sister lived on this property, in the family home, for many years, and I had the chance to visit on many occasions and talk to the family.  In the TV episode, their names were changed, but I'll tell you privately who the boy in the story is, his mother, and his father - they lived in Kingston, NH.  (think bloody battles between indians and settlers over precious water resources) Some pieces of this story are out on the internet to confirm, but the whole story is yet to be told.  And eventually, a horrific shooting would occur, one that involves the little boy in this story.  But before that, things were escalating on the farm. The mother had created her dream life of running a horse farm with student riders boarding their horses in her barn.  Everything she had built would crumble in an instant when gathered in the kitchen.  The keys in a bowl levitated and floated across the room in front of her riding students, who fled in terror, never to return. This proud woman wasn’t ready to give up her farm, and some time later, the rest of her world would crumble.  Her son would get shot in a most unusual way.  He was struggling to get a gun AWAY from his best friend, who was trying to commit suicide.  The gun went off, and he was shot in the head, but survived, hanging on for dear life! There were over 10 people there as witnesses.  I've spoken with some of these people and also had the opportunity to speak with the gunshot victim himself on many occasions, as well as his mother, and other family members.  Yes, he is alive, he can speak (it’s a bit different than on the TV episode), and remarkably, this mother and her son still live there today. Is it possible that demonic forces entered this guy's best friend, who was trying to commit suicide?  Had these dark forces also entered his father?  His mother had said that if she had not separated and divorced her husband that she thought he would kill her.  When you see this episode, you’ll see how strong these spirits are!",

Although I didn't respond to this call, I did have to sit with the murderer in a hospital room for hours after the fact...it was bizarre to say the least. That's as far as i'll go with my direct experience on a reddit forum. Here is a link to the story. https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/mcgee-escondido-man-sentenced-for-killing-mother-with-claw-hammer/170595/ My question is this...I recently created a channel and i've seen people post their own videos on this forum. Is that fair game? I didn't see a rule against it, but maybe I missed it. Anyways, here is a link to a vid I recently released if anyone is interested.  If it's against the rules, I'll be happy to delete the thread. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUy78g6rdPw",

      "content_preview": "So a while ago I rewatched his own story \"What I saw in my room still haunts me\" but I'm so certain that there used to be a different version of it, the title 100% wasn't that. It wasn't in the first person like the new version is so I remember almost dropping dead when he told us that it was him at the end. I did find a short that's more like how I remembered it but I could have sworn that there was a full version like that also. On top of that I remember how that full on yellow backround seemed like a lot when I rewatched it so that felt different about the video too. So it this a Mandela effect and I'm maybe putting together multiple videos or does someone else remember it too?",
