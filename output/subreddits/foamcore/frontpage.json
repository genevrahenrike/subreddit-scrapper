The most difficult part was coming up with an arrangement for the map tiles that kept the layers as low as possible I have all the physical content for 2nd edition and plan build organisers for all of it. I'll post them here bit by bit I picked up a couple of spare core boxes on ebay. one was just the box and another was missing most parts so they weren't expensive. I intend to use these to store all the lieutenant and monster pack expansions as there is just so much that I would never be able to combine it with the existing expansions",

I enjoy the challenge of arranging the components while trying to keep the compartments usable - which was tough. I couldn't squeeze individual player boxes and the resources box is smaller than I'd like. I prefer a less-is-more approach, but even that was stretched! Still, I'm really happy with it - it's really satisfying to get it all neatly into a single box. I ran out of knife blade and a few of the cuts have some tearing, but it's a minor blemish. I don't own a 3d printer, but I found a model on Thingiverse of Franz Joseph 1 - the emperor in the game and I printed it at a makerspace near me. I painted him with acrylics and used a clear gloss varnish. I will probably find a satin varnish - he's a bit glossy.",

      "content_preview": "This is going to be one of a few posts I make one after the other. I have now made 5 diy box inserts with one being very complex. I will post photos of those later. This post is about what foam I’ve used, my experiences and my recommendations. 1st, foam core is a brand. But often people refer to all foam board as foam core. Here I am discussing foam board as a whole. There’s 4 main foam types I have used/recommend and I’ll begin with the cheapest. Dollar tree: I have purchased and used many board from dollar tree. The foam is obviously a 1.25. It is really really good for your first foam board just getting into the hobby. It crushes under some pressure and takes dents with harder pieces like acrylic walls and obstacles. It comes in multiple colors but I got white to make it easier to hide the glue. Shortly after making diy boxes, you’ll realize this more than likely will not be your go to board for long as box inserts require a lot of time and you do not want to remake your boxes as I have had to do. Joanne fabrics royal brite: Joanne’s has a black or white board (I used white) by the company total brite. From my understanding this is the same if not similar to Elmer’s board. This foam board is around 5$ regular priced. I got it on sale for 3$ I believe. This board is alot more resistant to crushing, almost to the point it does not crush at all. The board itself, from memory, does still take some damage from heavier items over prolonged/repetative use. This is the foam board I’ve made most of my inserts out of as it’s thicker than the dollar tree foam board by 1 mm and extremely resistant to crushing. Sometimes if I’m uncertain about whether I’ll need to make changes I’ll do the box in dollar tree then switch to this foam board. I’ll create a post later on how I make that easier to do without extra work. Walmart “ultra strong” black foam board: This foam board is 3$ a board on Walmart. Make sure to get the one that specifically says “ultra strong”. I just made a box insert using this board for Dom Pierre last night. It did feel slightly stronger than the Joanne fabric board and I was pleasantly surprised i did not poke holes in it with my pen like I did with Joanne’s board. In general this board felt higher quality and stiffer to me. Also, the glue I use didn’t stand out too much on the black. I will note I personally don’t care much how “pretty” my inserts look. 4th and final foam board. I have not used this board for personal boxes but I have felt the quality of the board and used other people’s inserts. If you’re looking to spend anywhere near the price of brand name foamcore I would recommend folded space. They sell blank sheets. They sell 2 sheets totaling approximately the standard 20”x 30” for 7$. These foamboards are Eva foam sandwiched in cardboard instead of paper. They cut and glue the same as any other foam board. You can buy them only on folded space’s website. That’s it for foam. Please keep an eye out for other posts and let me know what foam you like below!",

It looks quite simple, but it’s extremely important for packaging my computers. I often face issues with my computers getting damaged during shipping, which has been very frustrating. Does anyone know what kind of machine can be used to quickly produce this model?
