I upload a drawing that has nothing wrong with it and is nothing suggestive, and it appears with comments disabled and hidden for other users. Usually, when this happened, I used to contact support and they would unban the pin, acknowledging that it had been a mistake from the AI, but this time, the response I got was very different. Support sent me an automated message saying that some pins, even if they don't break the rules, may be hidden to protect the community. I was really sad because I was trying to post my character's main bio, and apparently, now every time I upload something of my character, this happens. The AI kind of banned my character's name which is mine. üòÖ There's no point in using my profile if I can't have my main character there, so with this I can confirm that: there is no longer a human there to help us when something bad happens (or at least it's very difficult to receive help from them), and my Pinterest is no longer useful for my work. I know this is not new on this subreddit, but it is like an update for me, because I used to receive help from support but not now. Maybe some of you noticed this too",

Before that, Pinterest has been a source of comfort and hope to me as someone who had anxiety and depression. I have spent countless time and effort to organize my nearly 10k pins, sections, and boards, which contained memes, recipes, art tutorials, and DIY ideas- pretty much non-problematic content. Unfortunately, Pinterest‚Äôs AI moderation system has constantly flagged my pins as violating the CGs, though for questionable reasons. Most of my art references have been flagged as ‚Äúadult content‚Äù, and my dieting and recipe guides were flagged as ‚Äúself injury‚Äù. Before long, I logged in one day just to find out that my account has been deactivated for pins I didn‚Äôt upload. I tried appealing through the form on the Pinterest website, but received a permaban notice the next day (automated). So far, I have switched to their support email and has consistently emailed them 20+ times, but only received the automated ‚Äúwe received your response‚Äù emails and nothing else. I have tried rewording and mentioning legal action but to no avail. For now, the shock and disappointment from losing my account for content not belonging to me has taken a toll on my mental health and performance. I have created a new account, but it would take time to rebuild both my feed and boards, plus the chances of me getting suspended again. For now, I‚Äôm looking for suggestions on what action to take next. Thanks for reading my lengthy write up and have a nice day.

Who‚Äôs asking for these new layout changes??? They removed the ability to add music to your video pins so no matter what all my pins get copyright struck and muted essentially. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the fact we can‚Äôt delete messages we accidentally sent other people or appeal shadowbanned pins. The search is genuinely to shit right now. Like whenever I look up ‚ÄúGoth‚Äù or ‚Äú2004 Gyaru‚Äù I get nothing similar and just posts similar to what I‚Äôve been pinning. How am I suppose to find new ideas if you‚Äôre just gonna recommend me the same ideas I‚Äôve been pinning? And my homepage is filled with the same pins that I‚Äôve already pinned to my boards. Like overwhelmingly so. It‚Äôs SO broken. Like you don‚Äôt even know how many times I‚Äôve swiped left, accidentally gotten a frozen black screen and had to reset the entire app. Sometimes when I‚Äôm on certain pins my whole app will just freeze, not allow me to click anything and the comment section will get stuck on my screen, causing me to have to reset my app all over again. My biggest grievance is how the AI treats human body parts!!! Like they‚Äôll straight up take down anything that shows a bit of skin. Shoulders? Violation. Feet? Violation. Legs? Violation. Don‚Äôt even get me started on even remotely having curves or appearing female in any sort. It‚Äôs so fucking unfair that I can‚Äôt post myself or other women cause my pins will just get taken down for the crime of having a collarbone or bra strap showing. Like half of my posts don‚Äôt even show up on the app cause the AI detects shoulders as inappropriate or some shit, it‚Äôs WACK. I sorry I had to go on this LONG rant. I had to let steam out, cause I feel utterly useless. What am I even suppose to do when Pinterest isn‚Äôt responding to my appeals? I barely got my original account back and that‚Äôs only because people lit them up online for using AI to ban people. Now they‚Äôre going back into their old ways (Not that they ever left) and completely ignoring everyone. The app just feels like it‚Äôs gonna go the MySpace route. Lose popularity, they accidentally delete a bunch of the data somehow, they completely stop working on the app and it just fades into obscurity.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I just started a business account on Pinterest a little over a month ago and I‚Äôm a bit confused about the analytics. My impressions are really low, and honestly I think most of them are just from me refreshing my own page, except for a small bump when I ran two short campaigns. For context: I‚Äôm based in France, my content is in French, and it‚Äôs in a pretty niche topic (gardening & self-sufficiency). So maybe the numbers grow differently than for mainstream or English-speaking accounts. For those of you who also started a professional account: what did your analytics look like in the first couple of months? Did you also see almost no impressions at the beginning, and if so, how long did it take before you noticed ‚Äúreal‚Äù traffic from other people? Also curious: what‚Äôs your niche and who are your target visitors? Thanks for any insights!",

None of my pins even remotely violate any guidelines, it‚Äôs the bad ai system that thinks that a random image somehow violates it.

The pins that recently got taken down from my account were uploaded over a week ago and now suddenly they just removed some of them, but some others that look very similar don‚Äôt. Pinterest doesn‚Äôt even care how this affects us and how we have to now worry about uploading anything because it may be detected as something bad.

Somehow, it was fixed last week, but only for 1 day, then it went back to the way its been. To clarify a few things; the website is not affected. The algorithm is a lot better and pin history updates, the app, however (regardless of which version you use) like using v12.12; the same problem persists, even with the latest version, where it has the broken ass algorithm that just keeps recommending the same 4 or 5 pins to you and pin history no longer updates. So I have no idea what the hell is going and why this hasn't been fixed for almost a damn month now. How is nobody else not having the same problem as me?

      "content_preview": "the app is so cluttered with ads and stupid updates that it literally hurts my soul. whenever i try to find clothing inspiration 90% of the ‚Äúpins‚Äù i scroll through are just adverts and they‚Äôre so subtle that when i click on them thinking it‚Äôs a pin i can save but it actually just redirects me to the store website. and the newest update as of 08/31 makes my boards so hard to access, it just shows ‚Äúmore ideas‚Äù first instead of what i saved , and im convinced the ability to click the little pin button is also broken. honestly this is more of a rant than anything else, im just so sad because i have been using pinterest for years. this is quite literally the only social media app i use as of late but with each new unnecessary update it‚Äôs becoming harder and harder to keep using it.",

I used to LOVE pinterest for everyhting from hair/clothes inspiration to just looking at quirky weird niche things, but between the ads, ai, and mass bannings, I want to find a better site if at all possible. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions if anyone knows of anything that has the same vibe and content of pinterest before this nonsense. Thanks!",
