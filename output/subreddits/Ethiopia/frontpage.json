But also when I go back to the US, I am again just seen as black and have to identify as such on papers, job interviews, college applications, etc etc‚Ä¶ So I find this conversation stupid, in the west, we are seen as black AND Ethiopian, back home I think we‚Äôre just Ethiopian because everyone is the same as us.",
