Yet another celebrity who succumbed to vanity and plastic surgery. Such a shame.",

The studio is set up with 3 corners - the host corner, with Jimmy behind a desk, and the two guests on chairs, the audience corner (audience of about 40/50) and the (for want of a better word) contestant corner. Pre-show a member of production went round asking the audience if they had their own stories, before the ‚Äòwarm up‚Äô guy came and introduced him self, and explained the show. Once started the format was one of the featured AITA, lasted probably about 20 minutes so will get cut down, with a back and forth between the panel and person, then it pivoted to the Audience - there where 5 people where each one of them explained their situation, talked (and argued!) with the panel before moving to the next person. There was then a duo-pair. After the second ad break they brought a group of three (think Would i lie to you who is this person) and the panel decided which was the worst. Finally they had a selection of video submissions with quick discussions, written ins and a few audience questions. Overall we had a great time, some of the featured stories seemed insane but at the end of the show, they crowned the biggest A-hole. Interested to see how it works out in the edit!",

So it was something to the effect if I prefer guys who asked if I could send them a video of me (doing stuff to my butthole) to make sure I got home safe üòÇ and naturally I went along with it. It was a great show overall and the funny part is, which I wanted to mention but I was a bit starstruck, was that my ex was a big fan of his too.

I‚Äôm just wondering whether anyone had seen sniffer dogs at Jimmy Carr shows before ‚Äì or other comedians? I‚Äôve been to other gigs at Brighton Centre and they never had dogs. Full disclosure: I‚Äôm a journalist and researching a potential story about cocaine and comedy crowds.
