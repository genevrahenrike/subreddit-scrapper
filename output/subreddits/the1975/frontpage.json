THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME they did a live (one of the recent year ones) they had a HUGE rectangle box light up, and Matty said \"this one is for the 19 year old you\" before they started playing. I remember him saying something clever before Somebody else too during that concert but that was the video that had me stunned. cant seem to find it on YouTube now, can somebody please help a brother out please, much appreciated. I want to relive that moment",

Woman is the same. I wish they did more of this on GHEMB or wherever record is coming. I have a feeling it will be more electronic, lots of autotune, experimental.. Similar to Notes possibly.
