      "content_preview": "We’ve been open almost a year now but we had a regular customer from that loved our restaurant. She’d come with her family, come with her friends, come by herself. Our menu changes regularly and she was always there to try out our new dishes or a new cocktail or new wine we just got in. She even got our dining room playlist to listen to on her own. She was the perfect, best guest. And then she was diagnosed with cancer and faded so quickly. Only a matter of weeks before she passed. Her family reached out and asked if we would be willing to play host to a celebration of life for her. Even though we were a new restaurant she connected with us so deeply, so differently than anything I’ve ever been a part of. Of course we said yes. So Sunday we had 60 of her friends and family into the restaurant. We had a cocktail hour with snacks while people mingled and told stories. A formal champagne toast to her. Then we all sat down and had her favorite dishes—even ones that weren’t on the menu anymore but we brought back for the evening in her memory. Finished with her favorite peach cake we did at the beginning of the summer. I cried after everyone was gone. What an honor as a chef & restaurateur to have made an impact on someone’s life so much to be part of their send off. Restaurants can be about so much more than just feeding people.",

One sandwich was so large they had trouble closing the 9x9 foam container.  Two sandwiches were steaks, and she complained that there was not enough meat. We did make a legitimate mistake and did not toast their bread.  She wants the entire order refunded and said she has pictures to back up her claim.

Very low commercial vacancy. I’ve zeroed in on 8- 10 spots and have been hosed every time by a combination of corporate landlords that won’t rent to non chain/non franchises/first locations or non competes from other larger tenants. I also get used a lot by realtors as backups when there’s already a LOI or get invited to see a space that is either under contract or has a non compete just to get me as a lead. Each time I’m in the running for a space, because of the nature of commercial real estate here, it’s like applying for a mortgage. Full personal financial disclosure, tax returns, 3 year proforma, application. The works. This is my first food venture but I own other businesses. I’ve only had to deal with industrial commercial real estate. I am self funding and can easily guarantee the lease with secondary income. Is this a normal process and time frame in anyone else’s experience in a hot market suburb? It’s brutal out her",

      "content_preview": "I run a payroll service that works with restaurants, and we’ve noticed something surprising: most owners aren’t claiming the FICA Tip Tax Credit . Even a lot of accountants don’t seem to be familiar with it. This is an IRS program (IRS Code §45B, Form 8846) that lets you take a credit for the employer share of Social Security & Medicare taxes on employee tips . In plain terms: If your staff reports tips above minimum wage (servers, bartenders, etc.), you likely qualify. The credit equals 7.65% of those reported tips . It can be claimed retroactively for 2022, 2023, and 2024 , and on an ongoing basis for 2025 and beyond. Refunds typically come back in 6–8 weeks once you amend your returns. We’ve been helping restaurants claim this for a while, and the savings are usually in the tens of thousands per year. For example, a mid-size restaurant with $500k in reported tips could see around $38k in tax credits . 📄 If you want the full details, we put together a simple 2-page explainer you can download here: 👉 FICA Tip Tax Credit Guide (PDF) Or, if you’d like to get a quick estimate for your business, try our calculator here: 👉 Estimate Your FICA Tip Credit Hope this helps some of you — the last few years have been rough, and every dollar back in the business makes a difference. edit: I failed to mention that this only applies to US restaurants.",

The salesperson says that most people don’t remember the number of any restaurants they contact, they simply google and press call, which to be fair, makes sense. But I’m hesitant because the number has been in use for over a decade, not to mention I have to change all print and digital media, plus communicate this change via social media. I’m worried that we will lose business as a result of this change because not everyone is going to be paying attention to it. Does anybody have any experience with this? Thank you for your help!",

But they do apparently offer online ordering with zero commission from our own website if I wanted and it provides google maps integration. What I want to know is what platform is worth using and what will be the least hassle? What do you use to let customers order online?

Sort of a destination restaurant for tourists and also popular among locals, with Paula appearing from time to time for meet and greets and book signings. I'm not in the restaurant business but I thought I'd seek out people who are to try to find an explanation. She does daily youtube videos and had talked about her restaurant just a couple of weeks ago with no hint that anything was amiss. She has a number of franchised restaurants that will remain open, but the one closing is her original, The Lady and Sons, down in Savannah that she opened in 1989. I would imagine it was a source of great pride to her, and I would have thought her sons would have kept it going into the future. But even if they decided they wanted to shut it down, is not having sold it some clue as to what might have happened? I suppose it could be that they wouldn't want to lose control of their brand, and maybe it is for sale as a facility and will open up under some other name. I feel like whatever happened doesn't seem to have been planned as they likely would have had some transition otherwise.",

We are essentially able to buy a cash flowing business with very little money down due to the equity that would be in the business and building day one.

I realize that net is higher than average and he actually forecasted 21k but I built in a higher financing payment than he has.  I have owned and run several other sucessful businesses over the years including dealerships and I will typically run the business for several months to learn the ropes and then hire management to take over. But, have never owned a restaurant.  My question is, how much time should I expect my wife and I have to have to commit to the business once we hire a GM?  Is it realistic to think that we could just pop in from time to time to inspect or to greet the staff and enjoy the additional income along with our other business income?  We would stay involved in promoting the business, overseeing advertising, fundraisers, etc. and other big picture aspects.  But, hoping with good management the day to day would be mostly managed.",

I understand life is more expensive now, but so is running the business... One family even said no photos could be shared unless we took a thousand off the bill (I felt so bad for the photographer). We have a meeting soon for another larger party, and I just want to be better prepared.

      "content_preview": "I did 15 years in restaurants. Built them, opened them, closed just under ten of them. I have had dishwashers walk out mid service, refrigeration die at 4 pm on a July Friday (which is always when  it happens) , and a city inspector show up on Thanksgiving morning with 70 turkeys in the walk-in. If you know, you know. Here is the truth (or at least, my truth) as someone who went from sweating on a line to sweating in boiler rooms and basements. Restaurant stress and construction stress can both chew you up. One works like a blender set to puree every single night. The other grinds more slowly, and lets you catch your breath I respect both worlds. I prefer the latter. The daily stakes are different. In restaurants every day is make or break. One twenty dollar fryer part fails and your whole weekend is toast. Tickets stack, servers get slammed, a bachelorette table wants ten different mods, and now your expo just called out. You are improvising on the fly and praying the walk in door sealed when you remember  it on your drive home . In construction a late delivery or a crew member out sick hurts the schedule and the budget, but it rarely wipes out the week. You can resequence tasks. Paint can move ahead of tile or vice versa. You can build a catch up plan. In a dining room during peak hours there is no resequencing, only survival. Payroll hits differently. In construction a payroll snag slows things down. Maybe we slide a crew from one site to another while the office sorts it out. In a restaurant a payroll issue puts you on the line cooking, bartending, and quietly dying inside while a birthday party demands individual checks and someone just spilled a round of espresso martinis on the POS. I have done that night. I do not miss that night. The scoreboard resets. Restaurants reinvent themselves every shift. The best prep day in the world can get buried by one surprise private party or one bus of tourists that never told anyone they were coming. In construction there is usually a punch list and a defined end. We set milestones. Framing inspection. Rough plumbing. Tile. Trim. Paint. Close out. A thousand small fires pop up, but you put them out and keep moving toward an end date that is real. Public feedback is ruthless versus remediable. A bad restaurant review lives online forever and drags your Google rating year after year. In construction if something is off we fix it and move forward. A grout joint out of plumb is not going to spawn a viral dance trend. Clients remember how you responded and whether you owned it. I would rather stand behind my work than refresh an app to see if a stranger decided my chicken parm was a war crime. The 2 am panic check is different. In kitchens I used to bolt awake at night and ask myself if the walk in door was shut. Or I would lie there wondering if brunch was going down in flames because my manager forgot to place their weekend produce order. Now my 2 am thoughts are usually about a supplier arriving late or a layout tweak that ripples through electrical rough in. It is still stress, but it is not existential. We will sort it in the morning with a revised sequence and a call sheet. Restaurants taught me that speed matters, but clarity matters more. Stations get crushed when tickets are unclear. Job sites get sideways when the scope is fuzzy. So I put a heavy emphasis on clear drawings, finish schedules, and meeting notes. At the restaurant pass you call the dish and the table number so no one grabs the wrong strip steak. On a site we call the room, the wall, the elevation, the fixture. Confusion is expensive. Prep is everything. Restaurants live or die on mise en place. Construction lives or dies on preconstruction. We run scope reviews, sample approvals, long lead tracking, and site protection before the first demo swing. When that work is solid, the job flows. When it is not, you get three trades stepping on each other in a hallway that is four feet wide. Service recovery beats perfection theater. Anyone who has worked a floor shift knows that problems are inevitable. The table remembers how you made it right. Same on a renovation. If a backsplash arrives damaged, I do not craft a fairy tale. I tell the client what happened, how we are solving it, and what the new date is. Clear plan, realistic timeline, no blame dumping. Communication cadence wins. In restaurants, pre shift is sacred. You huddle, you set specials, you call out 86s, you align. On jobs we do a standing weekly with our trades, plus a tighter daily plan with foremen and PMs. No mystery. No guessing. Protect the team. Kitchens are a family, a strange loud one, but still a family. Good crews are the same. You watch for burnout. You rotate the person who has been on the dustiest duty. You bring water. You keep the site safe and clean because a clean station is a safe station. If you disrespect your people your quality will tell on you. The 4th of July Friday refrigerator failure I mentioned happened in Queens. I had ten cases of perishable product and a packed book for the weekend. I drove 30 minutes for 400lbs of dry ice, rerouted deliveries, and moved the entire prep list to the smallest backup fridge I have ever seen. We pulled off service by the skin of our teeth and I aged about five years. Now cut to a bathroom gut in the same borough where a custom vanity arrived with a finish that did not match the approved sample. Similar heart rate spike, different playbook. We documented the mismatch, escalated to the mill shop, placed a rush order for a corrected face set, and installed a temporary top so the client could still move in. No meltdown required, just process. Another one. A Sunday brunch where two servers no showed and the floor manager was new. We were in the weeds from the second the doors opened. At 2 pm, someone from Edible walked in. I cooked and expoed for three hours straight while bussing tables between fires. That review was polite but not kind and it lived online for years. Now cut to a Manhattan townhouse where an unexpected hairline crack in a party wall showed up during demo. We stopped, brought in an engineer, added a reinforcement detail, and gained a day on drywall by resequencing another level while the new detail was executed. The client never had to live through a panic. They saw notes, photos, and a revised plan. I slept fine. Construction stress really just hits different. Everything is manageable after living through the dumpster fire that is restaurants. Control beats chaos. In restaurants, you chase chaos and wrestle it to the ground every night. That can be thrilling. It also wears your body out and eats your weekends. In construction, you plan, you track, and you correct course. When the plan is good, the job moves. When something goes wrong, you can actually fix the root cause rather than apologize table by table. Progress is measurable. At the end of a kitchen shift you cleaned the flat top and maybe hit your food cost if the waste log is honest. Tomorrow you start again. On a job site you can point to framed walls, run plumbing, set tile, hang doors. There is a sense of permanent forward motion that I find both satisfying and calming. Relationships last longer. Restaurant crews feel like family, but turnover is constant. In construction we build long relationships with supers, subs, inspectors, suppliers, and clients. When you treat people with respect and deliver consistently, the work gets easier and the phone calls get friendlier. A good tile sub who knows your standards saves you a hundred tiny headaches. That kind of trust is gold. I tell anyone thinking about leaving restaurants for the trades that your superpower is decision time. Restaurant veterans know how to make a call fast with imperfect info. On a site, that means you do not let small questions pile up into schedule killers. You get the missing dimension, you ask the designer today, you clear the path so the crew can keep swinging hammers. You already speak calm under pressure. Use it. When a homeowner is stressed, your voice sets the tone. You do not sugarcoat. You lay out options and consequences. You guide them like you would guide a table through a menu that had three specials and two 86s. Trade skills can be learned. The culture of accountability is the hard part, and you already have it if you cared about service. Show up early. Leave late when it matters. Keep the job clean. Protect finishes. Own mistakes. These habits are worth more than a thousand tutorials. Money is different. Restaurant cash flow spikes and dives daily. Small businesses in general live and die on cash flow. Construction checks come slower but bigger, and everything is tied to milestones, lien waivers, and paperwork. Set up a system. Invoice on cadence. Keep retainage expectations clear. Pay subs fairly and on time and your phone will be answered on the first ring. Boundaries are healthier in construction. You will still have late nights. You will still have emergency texts. But you will get more real weekends than you did on the line. Set communication windows with clients. We publish ours in our kickoff packets. It is amazing how much stress drops when everyone knows when updates happen and how to reach us if something truly urgent occurs. As an aside, because I can't help it; if you're going through a renovation job... please decide the details early. Late decisions cost money. If you want to move a wall, switch a shower valve, or upgrade to a panel ready fridge, tell us as soon as you think of it. We can almost always make it happen with less drama if you bring it up before rough in. Protect your relationships. Give your superintendent a heads up. Tell your neighbors when demolition starts. If you live in a co op or condo, get your alteration agreement reviewed early and loop your contractor in. We will follow the building rules, and life is easier when everyone is aligned. Budget for what you cannot see. Old wires, out of plumb walls, undersized drains. These are common in older NYC housing stock. Keep a contingency. When you do not need it, great. When you do, you will not lose sleep. Walk the site. Short, regular visits beat one long panic walk at the end. We love a client who wants to see progress and ask smart questions in real time. It keeps communication clean and prevents surprise reveals. Don't be a nitpicker if you don't know the details though. Respect the sequence. Tile cannot go down until floors are leveled and plumbing is tested. Paint should not start until the dust making work is finished. If someone tells you they can do everything faster by doing everything at once, they are selling you brunch service at 6 pm. Honestly, I do occasionally miss the adrenaline of a full house. The feeling like a celebrity in your own place. The weird family you build on a crew is real. The shared language, the dark jokes, the way the last plate of the night feels like winning overtime at the Garden. I miss the energy. I do not miss limping into Monday feeling like I survived a small war just because it was Sunday morning. My final thoughts, if you've been able to read this far... (and thank you if you did) If you are burned out on the line and thinking about the trades, you are not alone. A lot of us made that jump (whether to construction or something else) and brought our service brain with us. The work is physical. The stakes are real. The pressure can spike. But when you lean on process instead of adrenaline, you find a different kind of calm. I traded lines of customers for construction deadlines, and most nights I sleep like a baby.

Last year I donated $200 (this is the average collected by each store) myself and skipped the whole thing.

Or do you have a separate catering pricing that accounts for these things? We have been dabbling in catering on a limited case-by-case basis, but get requests often.  I’m trying to figure out how to account for set-up/breakdown time at the event, travel time and costs, and the amount of staffing required which will vary according to the size of the order over the timeframe of the event. Most of the food prep would happen ahead of time, but there is a component that would be prepped onsite on a grill, so I suppose catering equipment needs to be factored into the overhead also. I’d like to hear how others handle this.  Thanks!",

Is it just the cost of doing business? Should we add $5-10 to the delivery fees as a hedge against the random ticket?   Call the customer- tell them we followed their directions 100% and still got a ticket, they need to clear it up/pay? If we have to drive around looking for parking then take a slow ass elevator and that delivery is 30 minutes not our average 15 minutes, do we charge them $25 for delivery next time instead of the$15 we normally do?  Also, this is probably TMI but if your delivery downtown takes 30 minutes, it's harder for us to schedule one driver to do to deliveries because it's taking too long there If they tip $20/$30/$50 I'm fine (they get it I don't).  But less than half our deliveries tip Not really sure what my question is, but discuss....",

We’ve had great publicity, even being named best new restaurant in the state by a national magazine. But as soon as May hit and K-12 schools and the University let out for summer break we slowed way down. Schools started back last week and college freshman move in is today. Last night we did 327 covers ($19k), just shy of our February 8th record of 330. We have 3 fewer BOH staff than we did back then as we lost some people over the summer and didn’t replace them since it was slower. It felt absolutely great though to be back slammed busy—not even from a financial situation. Our current team absolutely killed it and we had fun doing it which I think is key. This is just to say: it’s been a rough summer for everyone but if you can hold out just a little while longer maybe the grass will be greener on the other side.",

We have an employee who is part-time, wants to move up to full-time, wants to be a manager as we grow, and has mentioned his money problems to us before. We've been very supportive of trying to mold him into leadership material, told him we'd like to move him up as we grow if he keeps up the good work, but lately when we've needed his help to come in when someone calls out, he has plans... 3 different days in the last week. He complains about not enough money/hours, but then he always has plans with his spouse where he'll be busy the WHOLE day when we let him know well in advance that someone won't be able to be there. One day we even had the schedule published for a day that he was supposed to work, he asked us if he could actually get that day off. He had been great up to that point so we said we'd see what we could do. We texted back and let him know that we could get half of his shift covered, but not the other. He let us know that he actually had something with family the WHOLE DAY that he could not get out of. What would you do with such an employee?",
