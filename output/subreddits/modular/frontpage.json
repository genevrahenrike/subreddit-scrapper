      "content_preview": "I used web archive to get instructions on how to actually do this update. I copied and pasted from the Malekko website below. VOLTAGE BLOCK UPDATES NOTE: Only Voltage Block v1.5 (black or red PCB with v1.5 printed on PCB) or Voltage Block v1.6 (red PCB with v1.6 printed on PCB) support firmware updates. Earlier blue PCB versions of Voltage Block do not support firmware updates. Voltage Block v1.6 firmware download here: VOLTAGE BLOCK v1.6 (I've updated this link for you)( https://drive.google.com/file/d/15u6v-HnKZLbkml6-UnDrAM0i1uU5YMzt/view ) MAIN FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS: -Possible freezing when holding step and adjusting slider. -Possible freezing when holding arpeggio. NEW FEATURES: OCTAVE RESTRICT PER STEP: SHIFT then SCALE for octave restrict per step. Octave is C to B. Press SCALE or SHIFT to exit. NOTE: If step note value is highest C, no notes are higher therefore no change to pitch in octave restrict. SCALE PER CHANNEL INDICATOR: Select SCALE, then select channel (steps 1-8). LED will indicate scale. FIRMWARE VERSION INDICATOR: On startup, step LEDs 1 and 14 will light for 2 seconds, indicating v1.6 firmware installed. HOW TO UPDATE: PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS THOROUGHLY. These updates are delivered to the Voltage Block via the CLK/CV input as packets of data included in a .wav audio file. This data file is LOUD so TURN DOWN YOUR SPEAKERS! Download the zip file to your computer, unpack it and get ready to play back the file. Turn the volume of your sound source to max output, but turn your speakers down. NOTE: If you are connecting to your phone, make sure you are in airplane mode and no other sounds occur during the update or you will receive errors. NOTE: if you are using an iPhone, make sure your volume is set to max before plugging into the headphone out, once you plug in set your headphone volume to max, then check the volume once the file is playing to make certain it is at maximum. If you are connecting to an audio source on your computer, you will need to connect directly from an audio interface with more gain control (going directly out from a 3.5mm output jack on your computer might not be loud enough and you will receive errors). Connect a 3.5mm patch cable from the audio source (audio interface or phone) to the CLK/CV input jack. Set OFFSET to MIN Set ATTEN to MAX Set switch to CV Power down your case. Power up while holding step 16. Play audio Step 9 flashes when installing correctly Step 10 solid indicates error If you get an error, make certain your audio is turned all the way up and repeat steps again. On startup, step LEDs 1 and 14 will light for 2 seconds, indicating v1.6 firmware installed. Set switch to CLK, CV, or SLAVE to select mode. Took me days to hunt down all this information. Hopefully no one will have to anymore <3 Love Otavio xo",

      "content_preview": "So I am looking for recommendations on hi hats in the rack and am torn between making my own with a noise module such as Intellijel Flurry OR just getting a dedicated module like Archers Rig. I have a Bit Box Micro that I have been using for drums but since getting the Battering Ram I really enjoy having more control over each drum sound and want to add a module for hats. The Archers Rig seems like the logical choice. I have the Battering Ram and also a Dual Dagger from Shakmat and absolutely love both. I’ve heard mixed reviews on the Archers Rig but generally it looks pretty awesome. The Intellijel Flurry isn’t a hi-hat module but it’s definitely capable of making hats, among other percussion sounds, but needs a dedicated envelope and VCA which means more HP. It also offers more than just hats and has a lot of other useful utilities. I figure either way I can’t go wrong but curious what y’all would do?",

      "content_preview": "With any sort of trade, please be careful if you don't know the other user. Request additional pictures beyond the initial time stamp. If you want to be extra careful ask for something specific like for them to patch a specific patchpoint in the image. Try reverse image searching to make sure it isn't just an edited picture from somewhere else. Be specific with how you expect the items to be packaged and when the ship date is going to be. If a trade goes sour and someone can show that the pre-agreed terms weren't honored I will permanently ban the offending trader. Consider using something something like PayPal's \"Goods and Services\" instead of friends and family. Sending a stranger money via friends and family is just asking to be scammed. I also recommend checking that the user has some positive history in the sub - especially to verify that they aren't banned from here! Almost every scammer on here has no history in the sub. **IMPORTANT** \\- Do not spam the comments with your listings. Please limit your listings here to 1 per month. If you get new items or things change, just edit your original post.  When possible simply edit the original post; there is no need to announce new items in a separate comment. Try to limit the clutter. Do not delete your posts and re-post to bump back up to the top. BEHAVE PLEASE. Pictures are not required in the thread (though you should request them by DM), but ANY picture sent by DM or in linked in the thread MUST be physically timestamped. **PRICES MUST ALWAYS BE POSTED** This includes trades so that everyone involved knows the fair value of the modules they're looking to swap **RESIST THE URGE TO COMMENT ON PRICING** if you don't like a price, simply ignore it. There is no reason to go around pointing out that the item is cheaper new, or reverb prices, or anything else.",

Out of it, I pulled an 7-minute piece I’d love to share. Around the 2-minute mark, a happy little accident surprised me. I was layering sounds, patch cable in hand, when suddenly this unexpected interference sound popped up as I was plugging the patch cable to the module (I’m honestly not even sure what to call it). At first, it startled me, I wasn’t ready for it. But instead of pulling away, I leaned in, embraced it, and it turned into something I really love. The funny part is, I still have no idea why it even happened, it’s never happened before. But hey, that’s the beauty of modular, sometimes you just don’t know what will happen. https://youtu.be/dZ17fUq9LSM",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I’ve been diving deeper into subtractive synthesis and a question came up: Can an EQ technically be considered a form of subtractive synthesis? Since it’s also shaping sound by cutting/boosting frequencies. Or is it a different tool altogether? Also, I stumbled upon the concept of an all-pass filter . From what I get, it doesn’t change the amplitude of frequencies but shifts phase. Where do you actually use this in sound design or mixing? Curious to hear how you guys approach this. Do you think EQ belongs in the same “subtractive” family, or should we keep synthesis and mixing tools separate? btw I made a short breakdown with visuals on this topic here if anyone’s interested: https://www.instagram.com/p/DOGA_0djAN7/",

Mono input (L) works fine. As soon as I plug in the right input (R), it doesn’t work. There’s a brief moment while inserting the R cable where I hear both channels, but once the jack clicks fully in, the right channel mutes. I thought it might be a faulty unit, so I returned it. Got a replacement — exact same problem. Am I misunderstanding how the stereo input is supposed to work, or did I somehow get two bad modules in a row?",

I know the basics ( like How to use sequencer and filters) but i want to go deep into it and learn How to do complex ambient patches . The QuickStart guide didn’t help me a lot and the majority of YouTube video i’ve seen use some modules in addition to the ones the system has , wich i don’t have yet . Do you know any manual that can help me? I would like to buy patch and tweak but i don’t know if it can help with the behringer Because a know that some signals it uses are a bit different from the Classic modulars. Thanks",

All equipment is provided (each attendee will have their own Tascam or Fostex MTR to play with); there will be a selection of noise-makers provided, but please feel free to bring Volcas, OP1s or any other small synths. Bringing headphones would also be recommended. This workshop will be small; there are two sessions (morning and afternoon) with only 5 places available for each. To cover venue and travel costs I will have to charge a minimal fee - £25 per person. Come along and make music the old way. Booking is via Eventbrite: Book a morning session Book an afternoon session Cheers, Alex https://youtu.be/D0yVISjPpgw?si=5IpY3pa688Fq7ULt",

On my radar:  Akemis castle, triton/trident, panharmonium, complex oscs like 3-body/mindphaser/brenso etc i use a lot of slides so always interested if there is some cool sequencer that might do 'bendy' in a cool way, or oscs that respond well to bendy sequences, also think music over really noisy (even though they can all be both, i get that) Anyone have any good suggestions?",

I try to record one last playground before I pull the plug. Mostly, like in this case, into my phones microphone. I´ve gotten so used to that sound that I actually like it more the when I record \"properly\". Anyway, I started out with a Matriarch two years ago. Three weeks ago I got Pamelas new workout. And a month before that the Morfagene. I just play for myself and don´t thrive for perfection. I´m trying new things all the time, and more often than not I fuck up. No one but my girlfriend has ever heard any of this. I dont really know why, but I suddenly got the urge to share it. I´m (still) having problems in taming the Labyrinth. But if you listen past that I think some things sound pretty good. Pam has really helped with the DFAMs. And now that I listen to it back I obvioulsy wish I had done differently in like a thousand places. And thats kind of the point. I listen back, and get new ideas. Also I´m high. (Anyone spot where the riff is stolen from?)",
