Is it better to freeze them uncooked and then cook them when I want to eat them, or cook them and then freeze them for reheating? Also, would it be best to (if using uncooked frozen eggs) bake them or would they be safe to microwave? I've never prepped using eggs like this before and I want minimal texture issues if possible.

For those who meal prep regularly, how do u keep things fresh and interesting without spending hours cooking every day? Do you rotate ingredients, change flavors or use some other trick to avoid getting stuck in a routine?",

      "content_preview": "So I am a working mom to two beautiful little girls (11&8). I share custody with my ex their father 50/50. I have them Monday and tuesdays and we alternate Friday- sundays. We are in the longgg process of moving in with my SO who lives 45 minutes away, but he and I bounce between the two houses together. The girls go to school at my house so the weeknights they are with me we are at my house (P house) and we will spend the weekends at my SOs house (T house) or my house depending on what’s going on that weekend. My SO works nights and we share a car but with me having the kids normally I just drive so that way I always have a vehicle Anyway. Last year we did a similar version of this set up and I ended up buying double the groceries and then inevitably so much food went bad because we weren’t at that house to eat it. So this year we agreed to plan our meals. Then when I need to bring things to the other house we will transfer with a cooler. I am always awful at figuring out what to have for dinner or meal planning but my wallet and sanity can’t afford for me to fail at this. Here is where you guys come in. There are mornings that I will wake up in one house, but dinner is going to be had at the other house. That means I can’t pull anything out of the freezer in the morning or set a crockpot up. What are your favorite “oops I forgot to thaw dinner” meals preferably from frozen to cooked that I can put on my planner for those transition days? Also if you wanna throw in your favorite busy workweek meals, crockpot meals or really any “I got my ish together” tips I’d appreciate it.",

Here is what I have been prepping: pb&j chorizo and egg burritos bean, rice, and chicken bowls frittatas (but without the cheese it did not freeze well, recipe subbed blended butternut squash for cheese) I know I need more veg so anything with extra veg is great too! Not worried about macros I need a lot of protein and a lot of fat right now. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "For me, meal prep is mainly 1 of 2 things: • making it easy • making it healthy I want to freeze my uncrustables since buying them is too expensive. I can't buy them even at aldi. I don't find them healthy, so this is to make it easy and prevwnt soggy bread. It takes like 10 mins to make several. I eat them as snacks, part of a meal, etc. When i make a sandwhich and take it with me, it gets soggy. Will freezing it help prevent this issue? It works well for the store bought ones. I might eat it as a frozen treat. I might thaw it and eat it. Who knows.",

I need inspiration for the work. Mostly I take a salad with me with feta cheese and chickpeas, tomato, cucumber, and paprika, or a sandwich. After a while I am getting bored with those meals. What I need are more research assistants who are vegan or vegetarian whom I can take with me. I do not like to take precooked meat with me to work. I'm open for new ideas and hope you can give me some input. Thanks and have a nice day and happy meal prep.",
