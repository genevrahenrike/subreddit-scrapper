Alam ko na matatanong nyo bakit ako pumirma, pero hear me out huhuh. fresh graduate kase ako non that time tapos few months na akong nattry maghanap ng trabaho pero ito lang yung nagcallback. Kaya no choice ako but to sign the damn contract. Sa bond contract, naka indicate na I should pay a worth my annual basic salary once I filed my resignation. Pero narealize ko na masyadong vague yung contract namin and hindi properly documented like hindi siya naka-notary, merong breakdown bakit ganon yung babayaran namin pero hindi ganon ka specific. tapos mga 1 month lang kami nagtraining that rekta pinagtrabaho na agad, wala ring any certifications dahil manager lang senior co-workers naman ang naturo. Also, napansin ko na ang pangit ng trato ng company samin like laging galit ang manager, nawala na rin ang company dinner, birthday lunch every month, wala rin pagkain sa pantry etc. (too petty reason, but still) Do you think I still have a chance to resign without paying anything? and makukuha ko pa rin COE ko. TIA for your insights!",

Ayaw ko na sa philippines sobrang baba ng tingin sa mga undergrad(nag apply ako sa isang company and nireject ako dahil undergrad ako knowing na sa requirements nila they’re looking for someone na kahit high school grad okay na). I applied a different position kasi and based sa qualifications nila, I know na pasok naman ako. I don’t fear rejections but the way the recruiter tells me na wala akong pag asa sa kanila is so embarrassing on my part. (Parang nakangisi pa sya na sinasabing san mo nakuha courage mo na mag apply dito). Any work abroad would be fine kahit cleaner papatusin ko basta abroad and since matagal ko din naman syang plano. Here are the basic info about me. Male / Just turned 24 Pharmacy Undergrad 3 years experience in bpo(customer service) Some months of experience in sales Has experience working in milkteashops 5’7 1/2 60kg May passport Please yung legit naman sana. Thank you so much sa inyong support.",

      "content_preview": "Just want to share my story and ask for your opinions and views regarding this. I started working right before I graduated from college as a private school teacher. After almost two years of teaching, I decided to explore and do a big shift in my career. I tried applying in bpo companies and fortunately got hired by a known company in BGC. It was a dream come true to be honest. Who would have thought that they would hire someone who has no background in the field? In addition to that, the name of the company is a good update for my CV. Just like what they say, training is indeed the best part of the bpo industry. As soon as we started taking calls, that’s when I saw how arduous and stressful the job is. You have to remain on your best shit while being insulted or harassed by the clients (and I know this is what I signed up for when I applied for this job, pero iba pala talaga pag during calls na). Lately,  nahihirapan ako huminga at the same time inaacid ako sa thought pa lang na I have to logged in na and take calls. Told myself na I just need to survive until November para makaabot ng 6 months, pero hindi ko sure kung kaya ko pa. Hindi lang din ako yung nahihirapan and bago sa lob namin, pero bakit sila parang kaya pero ako hindi na? I feel really bad kasi alam kong pinag-isipan kong mabuti to pero parang nagsisisi ako na umalis sa teaching field. If I will compare my previous salary as a teacher and as a specialist now, halos 3k lang difference sa basic salary. Although may night diff and double pay lang sa corpo. Hindi din ako nakakaipon kahit lumaki sahod ko now sa mahal ng rent ko sa bgc. Everyday ko na naiisip mag resign. 5 times lang ako nag-absent sa previous work ko for personal reasons. Ngayon, thrice na in a span of 3 months. Minsan, naiisip ko magkasakit na lang para hindi makapasok. Since last week puro lang ako iyak pagkauwi from work. What should I do? Is it understandable to quit a job after 3 months of staying?",

Kahit ba part-time, need mag pay ng tax and the benefits? Can't I just choose my full-time job na main payer ng tax and benefits and the part-time be just money? I am not sure if this is possible din. Please enlighten me. What do I need to check and know para mag work po itong gusto ko? Please give me some advice and tips.

      "content_preview": "Background: I am currently a 4th year student Major in Marketing. Initially I really hated this course but tolerated it eventually. Medyo nag-thrive pa nga ako sa class ko and got close to some professor and made friends with lots of people outside my section. I think the main benefit is nag-improve yung confidence ko as well as communication skills. I've always wanted to do study CompSci or IT but due to personal reasons napadpad ako sa Marketing. Only now na na-rediscover ko yung passion ko sa computer related stuff nung nag-volunteer ako na naging bookkeeper sa isang NGO. Right now, I self-study excel and dabble (Macros, VBA, Pivot Tables, Xlookup, etc.). I've also been doing some freelance work with my excel skills, mainly statistics sa thesis especially reliability testing. Also, one of my professors is heavily encouraging me to get a masters and apply to the university I'm currently studying in and become a professor. He probably sees some potential in the way I speak at the front and teach tuwing reporting or recitation. Problem: I don't really think I have enough credentials yet to any for any of this and might just work a desk job, BPO, or anything administrative, sales, or marketing of course. Passion ko talaga ang computers and stuff and would want to be a Data Analyst someday. Also, I don't have any Latin honours or anything remotely noteworthy sa asking academics that might land me a job in any university. One thing I pride myself in though is adaptability and learning any skill enough to be competent about it. My plan: I'll coordinate with small businesses that I personally know of and basically help them with any bookkeeping or in gathering market data. This then I can put in my resume. Continue studying Excel and even maybe Python, work on personal projects to hone my skills and do some freelance work here and there that I can then put in my resume. Ipon Ng Pera while in my first job to support my further studies, MBA or CompSci. I really am scared of my future to be honest when it comes to landing my first job or which path to take, what should I do?",
