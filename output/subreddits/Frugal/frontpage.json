Then everyone packs into a conference room and enjoys their lunch, which is probably costing them $15-20/day.I, on the other hand, bring my lunch. Leftovers, maybe a sandwich, whatever. It probably costs between $1.50-$4 per lunch. Today was the first day I sat in the office and had my lunch instead of heading outside. Probably why it’s on my mind.Is it a status thing? Peer pressure? Or do folks genuinely just not mind spending $100/week on lunches!?I will say, they have relatively healthy snacks available for anyone to enjoy which is pretty great. Just one more thing I don’t have to spend money on!",

That alone freed up $60/month.DIY where possible: Cleaning products, simple repairs, and even coffee at home replaced expensive habits.The focus has been  on constistent microsavings not drastic lifestyle changes.

      "content_preview": "My brother is getting married and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I’ve never been a bridesmaid before and my wedding was somewhat low-key so I kind of forgot about all the stuff regular weddings entail.My soon to be SIL offered hair and makeup services for the bridesmaids and the moms and said it was optional. It was 150 for each plus tip. Figuring I’d be frugal and save a bit of money (plus make the day easier for myself) I declined and planned to do my own hair and makeup. My mother also declined.Well my brother asked us why we didn’t do it and I explained that for x,y,z reasons it would make my day absolutely crazy and that 300 plus tip was a lot of money. My concerns about having a hectic day were allayed (even though the day will still be hectic just differently than I thought) but my brother latched onto the part where I said 300 was a lot of money. I didn’t say I couldn’t afford it or that I didn’t have the money, just that it’s expensive and as a stay at home parent I figured I’d save it by doing those things myself.But he took it to mean that I did not have the money and said he will pay for me. After a ton of back and forth where I tied to refuse, tried to say I will pay for myself and that I COULD, where he and his fiancé both said very nice, emotional things to me I am now getting my hair and makeup done and they’re paying for it because at that point continuing to refuse was just downright rude 😩. And they’re gonna pay for my mom too.I was just trying to be frugal and now my family is paying for me to get this thing done (when they’re already spending money for the wedding itself) and now they also think I’m poor instead of that I was trying to be smart about money. Womp womp.ETA: since I’ve seen it mentioned a few times - my SIL didn’t care that I said no, it was my brother who wanted to understand why only his family declined after seeing the contract that excluded us. He said he wanted to make sure that’s what I really wanted.People suggesting they want to control me, that they care about me looking a specific way (beyond a dress), that I’m not good at hair or makeup and these things are their subtle suggestions or manipulations - this was something my brother offered on his own to be kind, because he loves me, because he is a good and generous person and because he said he views it as paying me back for the financial help I have given him throughout the years.No person is perfect but there’s no covert agenda here. I believe my brother was being honest with me and truly have no reason to believe otherwise.I tried to save myself some money, ended up costing my family money (even if they are happy to pay it) and my little frugality plan backfired a bit. That’s all guys.",

Instead of going out to buy a new one I found a hack!!!Place the empty bottle in hot water and you’re able to twist off the cap! Replace it with whatever cleaning liquid you want.Will this ruin the mop? Maybe, eventually the spraying may stop working due to “clogs” but at that point I’ll just use a spray to spray the floor before mopping.What are you hacks? Share your frugal hack swaps!

But the truth is, I never realized how much the small stuff was eating away at me.A couple months ago I decided to track literally every expense. Not just rent and groceries, but also the $5 snacks, random Amazon buys, late-night takeout. It felt silly at first, like nitpicking.Then the numbers smacked me in the face: what I thought was maybe $200 a month eating out was actually closer to $450.Once I saw it in black and white, it didn’t feel like deprivation, more like plugging leaks in a sinking boat. Brew coffee at home, cook a few more meals, stop the little impulse buys… and suddenly I had way more left over at the end of the month.Now I just do a quick weekly check-in, and it’s wild how freeing it feels to actually be in control.",

She’s been practicing Spanish there every evening after work, and it’s one of the few apps that actually makes her excited to open it. She likes how it tracks her streaks! I could see it’s become a fun daily ritual for her, so I thought it's good for her mental health too.That made me curious: what are the subscriptions you think are genuinely worth paying for?What’s the one subscription you don’t regret buying?",

I can definitely afford it....yet I feel guilty. it's funny. i've spent the last two years spending most of my salary on snacks and impulse buys from target and Ulta. now that I want to buy somethingimportant, I feel guilty? I just feel like someone's gonna yell at me.I feel like my family's gonna judge me, too. I have a history of being bad with money, I grew up with my mom telling me I \"can't save money to save my life\", and I recently bought headphones i've wanted for a while (I used coupons to buy it, too!

I feel stuck in a routine of the same few meals I cook, and when I think about different things to cook: fast food just sounds more appetizing to me. I want to save the money, but also be healthier. It’s kind of ironic though how I don’t want to cook the same rotation of meals, but get the same exact thing from the fast food place I go to.. I’ve thought about marking it on a calendar so I can see it visually how often I get it / see how often I can go without but I’m just struggling!ETA: I’m a stay at home parent while my husband works at least 60 hours a week. Our kids are 10 and 13, and they love to help me cook.My go to is a beefy five layer burrito and a Baja blast from Taco Bell.Thank you to those who actually took the time and gave me some really good advice! To those of you who said “just have self discipline” that’s what I’m trying to do!",

      "content_preview": "There's all these little things I didn't know and wish I did. I learned these all the hard way.What little thing did you learn, that you wish you had known? Things that make things last longer.These are some of mine:Clothes Dryers:Lint kills dryers.Even if you are religious about clearing the lint trap, it's important to occasionally vacuum out the vents.Too many towels in the dryer at once kills dryers. The lint trap may catch the lint, but the blocked air flow from a towel lint will wear your dryer out. This is especially true, if you use towels until they become rags until the rags disintegrate.Air conditioners: Clean your coils! And change the filter monthly. For window or portable air conditioners, clean filter at least weekly. This will make ya cooler when it's hot outside and can help the a/c last longer.Refrigerators: Unplug it and open that thing up from the back, and clean those coils! Brushes for clearing Dryer Lint double as refrigerator coil brushes.  Nothing like figuring out the main issue with a 24 year old refrigerator was 24 years of build-up on the coil. Who knew?! I didn't.Outdoor spigots and hoses: Apply Vaseline to the threads before connecting a hose. Do this with anything you connect the hose to long term, like a nozzle. This way, when you want to remove that hose or disconnect a nozzle later, it won't have corroded together permanently.Vehicles: Properly inflated tires last longer. Battery powered, digital, portable tire inflates are available and affordable. It's easier now than it has ever been to keep your tires inflated.Motorcycles: If it's going to sit for an extended period, empty the fuel tank and put it on a battery tender. Ethanol is deadly, (well... not deadly, but really bad) for older bikes that live in the garage without moving for long period of time.",

My delivery fee is about $150 and I use about $78 worth of power a month. I am already shutting off lights/appliances when not in use, unplugging cords, etc.I have a woodstove for heat, my cook stove is gas, I don’t have a dishwasher, I do run about one load of laundry wash and dried a day (I have a hobby farm, and we try to be low waste so lots of washing)I had the idea of turning off the breaker to the house every day after I finish my chores but a quick google search said that it’s a lot of wear and tear on the breaker box. I’m not even sure if it would be worth it considering most of the cost is from the delivery fee.Is there anything else I can do? At this point I’m convinced I could run my generator for cheaper. The power goes out every time the wind blows and we spend about $40 a week in gas to run the house when it goes out and that’s without me being conscious like I am with preserving power. However I have a few things that would not work with that idea, crockpot, the incubator, and heat lamps for kidding season.",

After taxes , insurance, retirement blah blah blah, its 41, 664 take home. Which is 3,472 a month. After 2k living expenses, I am left with 1,472 a month. Sounds good... 1472-160 for gas-400 for groceries-258 for car payment -128 for auto and renters insurance, no cc debt but medicak and student loan debt -130 a month.  Thats just 396 dollars a month left over. 4,752 a year. God forbid anything happens thats an emergency. I still havent registered and inspected my car, done routine maintenance on my car, accounted for doctor visits, my dog gets sick, who knows ya know? Not to mention-LIVED, done anything fun of any sort. It just doesnt seem feasible to live anymore. My wife is a stay at home mom plus the baby, and dog. I work full time already and need ti be available on weekends for my current job so I cant get a second job. Also my wife cant go back to work yet because our daughter is too new. Any other advice is greatly appreciated.Clarification:I appreciate the advice but I did put in the original post my wife is a stay at home mom not on maternity leave. She will be working part time at least eventually when our baby is older. But we are trying to get by in the now. I used to do rideshare but nowadays Id get chatged so much extra in car insurance it wasnt even worth it and was actually costing me more. Im thinking of putting my foot down with my job that I need to work part time elsewhere too and just wont be available on weekends and nights with zero notice anymore.Further clarification: My wife and I had a very good set up two incomes and cheap rent she wanted ti switch nobs, coukdnt find one and got pregnant. Then my knee got destroyed in a freak work accident and I lost most of my income for 2 mknths recovering feom surgery, git back to work andl a few months latet the landlord increased our rent by over double through raising it from 1500 all expenses paid to 2250 nothing included and randomly demanded we repair her house of flood damage from a faulty furnace she refused to fix that caused all the pipes to burst forcing us to move ASAP. And this is a very short version of all the fuckery that is going on right now in our lives. We have no streaming services. We have downsized as much as we can we are staying with my father in law who has been a blessing.Update: This post has blown up I apologize for some of the key details I left out like what I do for a living and the area I work in. To the 99 percent of people who read my whole post and gave good advice I want to say thank you. The people who took the time out of their day to judge and produce nothing but vitriol to the conversation I have nothing to say to you as you are not worth my time. Again sincere thank you to everyone who has given their advice and shared their stories I cant possibly look at all of them but all of you are appreciated. God bless.",

Because when it comes to long distance driving, I don’t wanna worry about charging it every couple hours. Not to mention the logistics of planning out where to charge it.",

      "content_preview": "A big thing that I have learned recently that has made a difference in my life is realising that sometimes, spending money on things I don’t “need” to is actually the most sensible thing.The most recent example for me is that my wife and I just bought our first house, and need to move out of our rental next month. The rental needs to be deep cleaned before we leave, normally I would just say I could clean it myself for much cheaper, which yes on the face of it is true.However, the time it would take me to clean the place to the required standard would mean I wouldn’t be able to accept an overtime shift on the day I would need to clean the place.The overtime shift I would work would earn me more (even including deductions) than I would lose paying for a professional cleaner.Once I realised that, I booked the cleaner and accepted the overtime shift.Obviously that’s just one example and might not be applicable to everyone, I’m lucky that voluntary overtime is pretty much always available and pays really well at my job (and I actually enjoy my job so don’t hate being there!) , but it’s just more the philosophy shift that has helped me.",

I’m currently in college and my credit score is around 716–718. Given the mileage we put on a car, would it make more sense to buy new, or should we look for a reliable used option (like through CarMax) to get something sooner?We can afford a new car if need be but we are trying to save money but also don’t want a car to breakdown on us like this has.Either way I have to get a loan.I should add I’m getting paid to go to school. My contract company will stop paying me if I fail or drop out hence why I’m leaning into a new car. I get paid 6k a month during school year and 4k a month when school is not in session only and only if I’m maintaining good grades. This is the engineering field and once I graduate I will be getting a 100k salary starting out because of the contract I agree with them on. I rather stress on my hw and exams then on a car but if it’s truly worth getting used I’ll find time to keep looking for a used car. Also they are paying all my books, tuition, and all fees. So I’m going to school for free which is a big thing that no one should take for granted.",

As an innocuous example, buy a $3.50 mother's day card.  You probably should get her flowers as well. What is Mother's day? It's a day on a calendar that someone said you should pay attention to, and coincidentally large corporations make large amounts of money from you following the norm.I realize this sounds something of a rant, and I suppose is.  But the question is so often \"What's the most economic lawn mower?\"  When maybe it should be  \"Why do I need a lawn mower?\"",

It blows my mind how many ‘disposable’ things can be made useful again with just a small, cheap tool. what’s your frugal mvp under $20 that’s paid for itself many times over?",

      "content_preview": "Hey I've just seen a video online of somebody batch making sandwiches with some reduced groceries then freezing them. This would be really helpful to take advantage of the large packets of sandwich meat which are sometimes reduced at my local store that I could never finish before they go off (I know you can, and I do, eat meat past its best before but I'm talking like 20 slices per pack which go off that day). I would be doing just butter and ham but I've checked on the pack of ham I already have and they say 'not suitable for freezing'. Do we know if this is something that can be ignored safely (like the best before thing) or if the people that are doing this are using meat that says it is suitable for freezing? I don't want to waste a whole loaf of bread and thing of ham if the sandwiches make me sick.Asking here rather than like a food safety sub as I presume people here are more likely to have tried for themselves and the video I saw had so many mean comments about how disgusting and embarrassing that was to do and I don't want to deal with that response lolThank you :)",

      "content_preview": "First yard sale in decades. I really don't want to fork around with nickles and dimes. Do you think it would be off-putting to have the cheapest items be $1? Just worried after reading through other yard sale threads that people might immediately be turned off when they see there aren't individual 10-cent options.My feeling is that if I wouldn't pay a buck for it at a yard sale or thrift shop, I'm not putting it out at the sale in the first place. I also plan to sometimes bag up multiple cheap items and sell the bag for a flat price (nice headbands, scrapbooking supplies, etc). And I'm going to do a flat rate for all the clothes they can stuff into a grocery bag.",
