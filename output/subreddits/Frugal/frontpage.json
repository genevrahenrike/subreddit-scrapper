Finally, checked a third item and it was $7 at Costco and $11 CVS, so smaller, but the delta is still around 50%.. moral of the story is do your research!

My feeling is that if I wouldn't pay a buck for it at a yard sale or thrift shop, I'm not putting it out at the sale in the first place. I also plan to sometimes bag up multiple cheap items and sell the bag for a flat price (nice headbands, scrapbooking supplies, etc).

Half the time it doesn't find codes that i know exist, and when it does find them they're often expired or don't actually work at checkout. Really frustrating when you're trying to save money and your main tool keeps failing. Been testing other options and honestly most coupon extensions have similar problems. They either miss obvious codes, show fake discounts, or slow down your browser so much that shopping becomes painful. Some of them are clearly just data harvesting operations disguised as money saving tools. Recently started using minty and it's been way more consistent than honey. Actually finds working codes and doesn't seem to impact browser performance much. Interface is cleaner too, less cluttered with random offers and popup notifications. Anyone else getting frustrated with honey's declining performance? What alternatives are you using that actually work reliably? Getting tired of extensions that promise to save money but waste more time than they're worth. Need something that consistently finds legitimate deals without all the extra nonsense.",

You can entertain an entire family or an entire friend group for a 4-6 hour event with things I promise you already have around your house. If you have a computer or smartphone you are reading this on, you can find dice rolling apps for free. The basic rules of D&D are also available for free from the publisher, as are those for MANY other games, which will have a free quick start adventure or a free copy of the rules called a \"System Reference Document\". ALL of Pathfinder is freely available through their online Archive. I've named some of my favorites, but there are plenty to suit any genre and personal taste. Character sheets and note taking can be done for free on various \"virtual table top\" sites, or on a notebook and pencil, easily gotten for $1-$2. Need a way to entertain a crowd for nearly free? Want a hobby that can last a lifetime for at most, the cost of a book? Try sitting down with your friends and playing an RPG. It's one of the cheapest ways to entertain a group with a structured activity I've found yet.",

I‚Äôve never been a bridesmaid before and my wedding was somewhat low-key so I kind of forgot about all the stuff regular weddings entail. My soon to be SIL offered hair and makeup services for the bridesmaids and the moms and said it was optional. It was 150 for each plus tip. Figuring I‚Äôd be frugal and save a bit of money (plus make the day easier for myself) I declined and planned to do my own hair and makeup. My mother also declined. Well my brother asked us why we didn‚Äôt do it and I explained that for x,y,z reasons it would make my day absolutely crazy and that 300 plus tip was a lot of money. My concerns about having a hectic day were allayed (even though the day will still be hectic just differently than I thought) but my brother latched onto the part where I said 300 was a lot of money. I didn‚Äôt say I couldn‚Äôt afford it or that I didn‚Äôt have the money, just that it‚Äôs expensive and as a stay at home parent I figured I‚Äôd save it by doing those things myself. But he took it to mean that I did not have the money and said he will pay for me. After a ton of back and forth where I tied to refuse, tried to say I will pay for myself and that I COULD, where he and his fianc√© both said very nice, emotional things to me I am now getting my hair and makeup done and they‚Äôre paying for it because at that point continuing to refuse was just downright rude üò©. And they‚Äôre gonna pay for my mom too. I was just trying to be frugal and now my family is paying for me to get this thing done (when they‚Äôre already spending money for the wedding itself) and now they also think I‚Äôm poor instead of that I was trying to be smart about money. Womp womp. ETA: since I‚Äôve seen it mentioned a few times - my SIL didn‚Äôt care that I said no, it was my brother who wanted to understand why only his family declined after seeing the contract that excluded us. He said he wanted to make sure that‚Äôs what I really wanted. People suggesting they want to control me, that they care about me looking a specific way (beyond a dress), that I‚Äôm not good at hair or makeup and these things are their subtle suggestions or manipulations - this was something my brother offered on his own to be kind, because he loves me, because he is a good and generous person and because he said he views it as paying me back for the financial help I have given him throughout the years. No person is perfect but there‚Äôs no covert agenda here. I believe my brother was being honest with me and truly have no reason to believe otherwise. I tried to save myself some money, ended up costing my family money (even if they are happy to pay it) and my little frugality plan backfired a bit. That‚Äôs all guys.",

They actually paid for about $100 of the visit, but the other 900 is somehow on me, even though I'm not supposed to have a deductible. Is this balance billing? I asked the provider if they accept my insurance, and on the insurance website they said in network, so I'm confused by getting my blood pressure checked, temperature check, and a very short examination by hand of my foot equates to a $1,000 bill. I have gone to an urgent care in the past where I got x-rays and everything and it still wasn't even half of that. Is there anything legally that I could do about being medically price gouged? I want to be prepared after the holiday weekend when I can call them. Thank you. Update: so I read the bill wrong. $100 off is from the \"discounted\" negotiated rate. However I signed up for my insurance's online portal and it said the 100 dollars is the provider fee. So did someone switch the numbers around by mistake?",

Then the numbers smacked me in the face: what I thought was maybe $200 a month eating out was actually closer to $450. Once I saw it in black and white, it didn‚Äôt feel like deprivation, more like plugging leaks in a sinking boat. Brew coffee at home, cook a few more meals, stop the little impulse buys‚Ä¶ and suddenly I had way more left over at the end of the month.

I haven't been having trouble with lunches or dinners, but breakfast has been a little harder - what I want in a breakfast is it should - have a bit of protein and fiber - Be easy to grab and go without adding to my morning prep time before work - cost about a dollar (EDIT: also, I eat my breakfast in the break room at work usually, before students start arriving. No limitations like needing to be able to eat it while driving) And so far all I've come up with that meets that criteria is two sticks of string cheese and a banana. A breakfast I've brought to work almost every day as-is, but it gets a little boring. I would appreciate variety. Any suggestions that meets a similar nutrient profile without prep? Maybe it takes some prep but it can be done the night before while I'm putting together my lunch? As an aside, any general tips to someone who'll be paying his own rent for the first time and will need to budget harder, I appreciate. Thank you!",

I am trying to take better care of myself [I am diabetic], but I am on a reallt low income since my hours got cut after I went on leave for 2 weeks. I dont know if it is permanent or if I will have to find another jcc ob. I am looking, but I am unsure. Basically, I am tryinf to cook at home. I have 1 meal I really am enjoying. I dont know if it is just not filling, or if my prednsone is increasing my appetite. It's a fairly high dose that i will step down off of soon. I make an entirelt homemade adobo chicken bowl [It is a knockoff of QDOBA]. I am obsessed and i was buyjng jt there 3 or 4x a week at one point. At 20-23 dollars a pop. Now that i can't, i make it homemade. I use rice, which has 36g of carbs for 3/4 cup. I dont weigh it, i use a measuring cup, loosely filled [I dont pack it]. I add chicken, peppers & onions, sour cream, cheese, hot sauce, and pinto beans. For what I use of each of these things, it isn't much. But i get hungry after like 2 hours. I dont add many pinto beans to a bowl. I might adjust that first since they're hivh fiber, help control blood sugar, etc. What could i add to it to make it more filling or have on the side? As long as per serving it is not too bad, I can consider it from a financial and/or carb content stand point. Note: I will try to cross post in a diabetic reddit later if I remember. For non-diabetics: if a food has fiber, you subtract to get the net carbs, which is what i follow since fiber doesnt affect blood sugar generally. Also, food with high protein or fat content slow blood sugar spikes and dips, so don't be afraid to recommend high fat or protein foods too.  I am explaining because I havr been around diabetes my whole life [lot of fam histpry with my fiagnosis of prediabetes at 20 or 21], so i dont know what common knowledge of the subject is honestly.",

Here‚Äôs what happened: Meal prepping on Sundays = way less DoorDash Actually using leftovers instead of letting them rot Stopped impulse buying junk food I‚Äôd finish in one sitting Cooking became weirdly therapeutic, so I look forward to it now The biggest game-changer was planning ahead. When I know what I‚Äôm eating, I don‚Äôt panic-order pizza at 9 PM. For me the real turning point was when I started tracking what I ate ‚Äî I realized so much of it was just empty calories. I tried out apps like MyFitnessPal and later NutriPal, and both made me aware of how much unnecessary stuff I was buying and eating. That pushed me toward more balanced meals, which naturally ended up being cheaper too. I don‚Äôt track obsessively anymore, but that initial awareness was huge. Anyone else find that eating healthier actually lowered their budget instead of raising it?",

      "content_preview": "There's all these little things I didn't know and wish I did. I learned these all the hard way. What little thing did you learn, that you wish you had known? Things that make things last longer. These are some of mine: Clothes Dryers: Lint kills dryers. Even if you are religious about clearing the lint trap, it's important to occasionally vacuum out the vents. Too many towels in the dryer at once kills dryers. The lint trap may catch the lint, but the blocked air flow from a towel lint will wear your dryer out. This is especially true, if you use towels until they become rags until the rags disintegrate. Air conditioners: Clean your coils! And change the filter monthly. For window or portable air conditioners, clean filter at least weekly. This will make ya cooler when it's hot outside and can help the a/c last longer. Refrigerators: Unplug it and open that thing up from the back, and clean those coils! Brushes for clearing Dryer Lint double as refrigerator coil brushes.  Nothing like figuring out the main issue with a 24 year old refrigerator was 24 years of build-up on the coil. Who knew?! I didn't. Outdoor spigots and hoses: Apply Vaseline to the threads before connecting a hose. Do this with anything you connect the hose to long term, like a nozzle. This way, when you want to remove that hose or disconnect a nozzle later, it won't have corroded together permanently. Vehicles: Properly inflated tires last longer. Battery powered, digital, portable tire inflates are available and affordable. It's easier now than it has ever been to keep your tires inflated. Motorcycles: If it's going to sit for an extended period, empty the fuel tank and put it on a battery tender. Ethanol is deadly, (well... not deadly, but really bad) for older bikes that live in the garage without moving for long period of time.",

      "content_preview": "I know the question sounded strange to most people but, I cook bone in chicken for my dogs, in a pressure cooker, likes of instapot, which makes bones crushable between fingers or through the meat grinder. Then, use the broth to add some rice and add some shredded carrots to make it complete. I do this twice a week on the average for 5 large size dogs. Mix 1 part of this to 2 parts of high quality dry dog food to help with pet food budget. Quality dry food is very expensive. So, right now, I am sourcing my chicken as leg quarters from local walmart at the cost of 79 cents per pound. Since I have a separate freezer in my pantry, I thought I could buy them bulk, say 50-100 lbs at a time and have them shipped if necessary or go pick them up myself, if they are cheap enough. I am wondering if there are any places who will sell chicken less than 80 cents per pound which I can not find via google search. Thanks in advance. PS. Any meat other than pork is acceptable, including organ meats, if the price is right.",

Boyfriend doesn't have a care about money, so I'm not worried about him, this is solely for me. I'm thinking somewhere between $40-60 a week for spending? This will include gas, any random purchases, and if we eat out. We usually eat out maybe once a week and we take turns paying. I get gas maybe once a month, so maybe I shouldn't even include that? My main spending problem comes from random little purchases. Like new eyeliner, more body wash, random craft supplies, an energy drink, etc. Original idea was $30 per week, but my boyfriend said that was way too little considering if we go out to eat that's the whole allowance right there. Again, this is just \"fun\" spending money to try to limit my overall spending.",

I already know I‚Äôm doing turkey & cheese sandwiches for my work lunch, but I‚Äôm looking for ideas for my dinners. I have Crohn‚Äôs so my diet is a bit wacky, and also I‚Äôm allergic to coconut. I‚Äôll have access to a refrigerator & freezer during my stay at the hostel. Originally I was thinking of taking a studio ghibli idea (Kiki‚Äôs delivery service) and just doing pancakes a few days a week but even then I‚Äôll need something else for the other 2-3days. Any ideas? I need to rely solely on my ebt, no cash at all because I need to save up so I can rent a room sooner rather than later. That‚Äôs where being frugal comes in. EDT to add: It has a kitchen but it says just a refrigerator/freezer & microwave. I don‚Äôt know yet if I‚Äôll have access to the rest of the kitchen appliances but I have a dash mini griddle I‚Äôll be bringing. When it comes to what I can‚Äôt eat because of Crohn‚Äôs, it‚Äôs mostly spicy food, onions (unless it‚Äôs in very small quantities) salty foods, nuts of any kind (but I can eat peanut butter)",

I told them the situation and sent them a picture of the inside of the fryer showing it brand new unused and asked if I could buy the handle. Next morning they emailed me back saying they have a spare handle and sent it out to me free of charge, I didn‚Äôt even have to pay postage. It arrived today and I‚Äôm so happy and grateful to them for sorting it and also made me want to make a post here to say that this is the second time I‚Äôve contacted a customer service regarding missing and broken parts and had the part sent out to me. The first time was when my Breville personal blender bottle lid broke and the bottles with lid are ¬£15-¬£20 to replace and I didn‚Äôt want to add the bottle to landfill so I contacted customer service and got just a new lid for ¬£4.

For one, it forced creativity out of me, let me clear out stuff before they expired, helped me rotate my food storage, and saved me about $45. After the challenge I realized there was a big gap between what I actually use vs what I just think I need to buy every time. I am definately revising my grocery list down for this week :) Wanna try this challenge?",

      "content_preview": "I 22 male make 57k a year before taxes as a project manager on salary with no potential for overtime. I am in a New England state and work for a nonprofit. After taxes , insurance, retirement blah blah blah, its 41, 664 take home. Which is 3,472 a month. After 2k living expenses, I am left with 1,472 a month. Sounds good... 1472-160 for gas-400 for groceries-258 for car payment -128 for auto and renters insurance, no cc debt but medicak and student loan debt -130 a month.  Thats just 396 dollars a month left over. 4,752 a year. God forbid anything happens thats an emergency. I still havent registered and inspected my car, done routine maintenance on my car, accounted for doctor visits, my dog gets sick, who knows ya know? Not to mention-LIVED, done anything fun of any sort. It just doesnt seem feasible to live anymore. My wife is a stay at home mom plus the baby, and dog. I work full time already and need ti be available on weekends for my current job so I cant get a second job. Also my wife cant go back to work yet because our daughter is too new. Any other advice is greatly appreciated. Clarification:I appreciate the advice but I did put in the original post my wife is a stay at home mom not on maternity leave. She will be working part time at least eventually when our baby is older. But we are trying to get by in the now. I used to do rideshare but nowadays Id get chatged so much extra in car insurance it wasnt even worth it and was actually costing me more. Im thinking of putting my foot down with my job that I need to work part time elsewhere too and just wont be available on weekends and nights with zero notice anymore. Further clarification: My wife and I had a very good set up two incomes and cheap rent she wanted ti switch nobs, coukdnt find one and got pregnant. Then my knee got destroyed in a freak work accident and I lost most of my income for 2 mknths recovering feom surgery, git back to work andl a few months latet the landlord increased our rent by over double through raising it from 1500 all expenses paid to 2250 nothing included and randomly demanded we repair her house of flood damage from a faulty furnace she refused to fix that caused all the pipes to burst forcing us to move ASAP. And this is a very short version of all the fuckery that is going on right now in our lives. We have no streaming services. We have downsized as much as we can we are staying with my father in law who has been a blessing. Update: This post has blown up I apologize for some of the key details I left out like what I do for a living and the area I work in. To the 99 percent of people who read my whole post and gave good advice I want to say thank you. The people who took the time out of their day to judge and produce nothing but vitriol to the conversation I have nothing to say to you as you are not worth my time. Again sincere thank you to everyone who has given their advice and shared their stories I cant possibly look at all of them but all of you are appreciated. God bless.",

      "content_preview": "I had some questions about this on another thread. To save money on phones, do this: Buy a phone from 2 or 3 years ago. They get updates now for 5+ years, so you can easily keep it for another three years. I've never spent more than $190 on a phone this way, and I buy Samsung flagships. I'm currently using an S22. In fact, I've spent $500 on 3 phones in the last decade -- less than the cost of a single iPhone! Skip the case. To each their own, right? If you need one, get one. I don't bother. I never drop my phones (knock on wood), it saves me $20, $30, even $40, and it's less plastic in a landfill somewhere. Just be normally careful. I use Tello. I was on Mint for $15/month (at 5GB), but I switched to Tello for $10/month (at 2GB) since I never use more than 2GB of data anyway. I have WiFi at work and home. When you're done with the phone eventually, recycle it at an ecoATM since they'll pay you a few bucks for it. Even if it's just around $15, at least your now very old, already pretty heavily used phone is being properly disposed of. Just some tips!",

      "content_preview": "A big thing that I have learned recently that has made a difference in my life is realising that sometimes, spending money on things I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù to is actually the most sensible thing. The most recent example for me is that my wife and I just bought our first house, and need to move out of our rental next month. The rental needs to be deep cleaned before we leave, normally I would just say I could clean it myself for much cheaper, which yes on the face of it is true. However, the time it would take me to clean the place to the required standard would mean I wouldn‚Äôt be able to accept an overtime shift on the day I would need to clean the place. The overtime shift I would work would earn me more (even including deductions) than I would lose paying for a professional cleaner. Once I realised that, I booked the cleaner and accepted the overtime shift. Obviously that‚Äôs just one example and might not be applicable to everyone, I‚Äôm lucky that voluntary overtime is pretty much always available and pays really well at my job (and I actually enjoy my job so don‚Äôt hate being there!) , but it‚Äôs just more the philosophy shift that has helped me.",
