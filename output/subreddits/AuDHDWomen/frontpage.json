      "content_preview": "I'll make this quick. I have OCD but I have suspected myself ADHD or autistic for about a year now. I sat in a cafe this afternoon and I was a bit shaky from the caffeine and I kept trying to write and I got lots of work done but every other sentence I was switching off and daydreaming, having full on imaginary conversations in my head for up to 15 minutes at least before I was brought back. When I walked home I was in total brain fog mode, I'm halfway between disassociation and grounded, dreaming and awake etc, I had a terrible 3 hour sleep last night, I'm on the first day of my period, I forgot the word for nose as in nose of a plane etc I've had these symptoms like daydreaming and power fantasies and fictional worlds in my head since I was a child/teenager but I thought I was just weird. I developed bad OCD when I was 12 and still have it. I'm constantly afraid of dying either from an illness or sudden heart attack/collapse, or in a freak accident. Every time I feel extremely fatigued (like now, I can hardly concentrate on anything, I'm so tired and spaced out and anxious) and I worry if I nod off I won't be able to wake up! Fortunately I am home now and there are people in the house. I'm at the end of my tether, I'm in my 20s now and I need people who understand. I've had so much therapy for OCD but still have it and still struggle with practical day tasks. I feel sensitive to light which just started an hour ago and my health anxiety is going crazy wondering if the mushrooms on my Costa egg wrap were actually poisonous ones due to a manufacturing error. I have been daydreaming in and out for 4 hours and I was happy but tired and now after being somewhat productive im mentally exhausted! I need some help",

      "content_preview": "I told my parents about my ADD diagnosis the other day, wasn't expecting it to go well because they were offended and took it personally when I was diagnosed with autism, but they were very supportive and even apologetic for not recognising it! Big win! So we got to talking about all the signs and how it presents very differently in women and out of no where my dad says \"I knew that Miss G. was full of shit.\" and I was so baffled I had to ask him to explain. Because Miss G. was one of, if not my favourite teacher I ever had. She was gentle and polite with me, never told me off in front of the other students and would privately tell me what I was doing wrong and how to fix it, both socially and academically. She was also just one of those all around cool, funny, chill teachers that all the students loved. So my dad suddenly blurting out that she was full of it years after I even went to school baffled me. For extra context, my parents also taught at the school I went to, so she'd talk to them almost daily about me being the problem child of the class and they asked her to be gentle with me because I they were sending me to psychs and therapy but they didn't know what was wrong yet. My parents told me that she would say stuff about how I'm not disabled, it's my own fault I'm being bullied and that I'm purposely trying to make myself uoset and that not trying hard enough at school or doing my homework. The only reason my parents didn't move me from that school was because they also worked there and were afraid of the repurcussions it might have on their career and they regret it, especially since they ended up working at different schools anyway. All this went on without me knowing for an entire year, several years if you count the years I stayed at the school after that. This really has no effect on me now I suppose, this was 10+ years ago, but it still flips me out that I can never really tell who is a nice person and who is just grinning and bearing me...",

      "content_preview": "Hi there, Feels a bit strange to post this here, but I am just trying to find people who understand this particular struggle. My daughter turned 3 in June. She has been showing interest in and readiness for potty-training for over a year. But it's like it comes and goes. Sometimes she seems very aware of her body and other times it's like she's completely oblivious. Particularly notable to me is that here awareness seems to be getting worse. I understand that it's perfectly developmentally appropriate to not be potty-trained at this age, but somehow every other kid her age we know is - including several who are also ND - and I just keep wondering if I'm missing something or if there's a strategy that we haven't tried that might work better for her brain. She has not been formally diagnosed with anything, but we do have her in occupational therapy for sensory sensitivity, interoceptive issues (including this one), and emotional regulation. We can't really do the pantless method so many people swear by because her daycare requires that they be fully dry in pull-ups at school before they're allowed to wear underwear. I did not struggle with potty training as a kid, but I do have plenty of interoceptive issues which is what made me think that may be at play for her. I guess I\"m just wondering if any of you have found yourselves in a similar place and found good solutions (or just have solidarity to offer).",

Lately things aren't going well, I keep getting rejected from everywhere, even from places where I felt really confident that they would accept me. This year I've been also applying to retail and gastro jobs but I never last long at any workplace. I got bullied at work a lot, also I was constantly overwhelmed > made a lot of mistakes or forgot things due to stress, was accidentally too blunt with customers etc. But I was trying very hard at every job I had, I gave 200% sometimes. Still it's never enough or good somehow. I feel quite terrible and also stuck in this rock bottom because I don't know how to do anything well apart from art. But now it feels like even this is not working. I know art is very subjective and there is an audience for everything but I really have zero motivation left because all I get is rejection. At the moment im 100% dependent on my partner and it makes me feel even worse. I don't even have my official ADHD diagnosis yet so I can't get meds, I got an appointment for the end of this year and who knows how long the process takes. I know basing self worth on being productive/making money is not healthy but I really don't think where could I get some confidence from, I hate myself. Yes I have some good qualities not just bad ones, but it seems like none of this is bringing me anything. I'm so tired of being this way. I want to get out of this downward spiral but without money or confidence it's not really working.  I try to do daily affirmations and take them seriously like \"I believe in my abilities\" and someitmes it kinda works but then I get another \"Unfortunately\" email and I crash again. I wish I could take a break from life, like hybernate or something and somehow be a different person when I wake up from hybernation. I'm not religious but grew up with it and I even started praying out of desperation lately. Hoping that this magically will do something with my life because it seems I can't do anything else.

My biggest trauma around being AuDHD is...I don't even know what to call it. Being misunderstood/misjudged/falsely accused, I guess. Since literally before I can remember as a child, I've had repeated nightmares that someone falsely accuses me of some terrible thing, I desperately try to prove/explain my innocence, they don't believe me, and I spend the rest of the dream running/hiding in terror as they chase me to punish me for the crime I didn't commit. In real life, it happens ALL. THE. TIME. Just in smaller ways. I do or say something, and someone gets mad and says \"clearly you meant this/had this secret agenda/hidden motive.\" And I'm like, no, I really didn't, I meant exactly what I said/my intention was the obvious one, let me explain, and half the time they still don't believe me. I've lost more than one friend over it. It's caused marital problems. My sister got pissed at me because I used the family text thread to arrange sending a gift to her child in the hospital and she thought I was trying to pose as the saintly,  perfect big sister to everyone when I just wanted to send my niece something nice and it made sense to me to discuss it in the family thread so if anybody else wanted to, the info on how to do it was there for everybody, and to keep all discussion in one chat thread so my sister didn't feel overwhelmed or intruded on. It came up at work yesterday where this time I literally was accused of having committed the crime of fraud (not actually being charged, just a person warning me I could be if I do it again) because \"you billed for this amount of time and it clearly can't have taken that much time.\" But it DID take that much time because they're constantly telling me how I'm doing the task wrong in this way or that way, so I developed a system to make sure I'm doing it the way they want and it takes a little longer. I've been an emotional mess since yesterday. I'm terrified, I'm devastated, and I just want to scream, \"I swear I'm being honest and straightforward and I mean exactly what I say and do, please someone just believe me and see me because I'm literally right in front of you showing you who I am, why does everyone assume I'm a bad person and what do I need to do to show you otherwise??\" I don't know what I'm even looking for in posting this. I guess some understanding, or advice, or even if there's like a name for this very specific trauma? I don't know. I'm in therapy and do have an appointment coming up, so I guess there's that.",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm really struggling with what I think are communication issues at work and am desperate for advice about how to approach this. I love my job. I‚Äôve been in this role for about a year now and I thought it was going really well until receiving a very jarring email from my supervisor over the weekend about how we need to have a heart to heart about my future in this position. I like my boss a lot, I think in general she likes me, but a major communication meltdown on a new project has led to her having to step in to support in a way that isn‚Äôt normal. It sounds like now her boss is applying pressure to her about me. The person this communication meltdown happened with is basically the worst case scenario for my brain; he is running a thousand miles a minute with rapid fire ideas, hasn‚Äôt pumped the breaks when I‚Äôve asked, and meanwhile my job is to basically ensure what he is doing is in compliance with a lot of laws and regulations. He refuses to hear answers he doesn‚Äôt like, is now trying to say I never told him things I absolutely did, and this all genuinely makes me feel like I‚Äôm speaking a foreign language. I do think this situation could have been avoided or at least minimized had my boss been better about preparing me for this project. I‚Äôve asked her for that support multiple times in the past and she has repeatedly validated the reasoning behind my requests, agreed it is needed, apologized for not being better about it, and taken ownership for the awkward situations I‚Äôm placed in as a result. Because it isn‚Äôt happening, I keep feeling like I‚Äôm being dropped in the middle of a book everyone else has been reading from page one and somehow I‚Äôm supposed to understand the context. I just don‚Äôt know how to advocate for myself in this situation anymore. I feel like she swung from being on my side to assigning me full blame for all of this and I don‚Äôt understand how that happened or why or what to do next. I don‚Äôt know how to explain where I‚Äôm coming from and I don‚Äôt know how to ask for what I need moving forward and it‚Äôs being compounded by feeling like no one understands anything I say anymore. It‚Äôs making me feel very defensive and frazzled and incredibly anxious. How do you ask for what you need in a way that results in it actually happening? How do you advocate for yourself in a way people are actually receptive to? How do you approach situations where it seems like people just cannot understand what you‚Äôre trying to say?",

      "content_preview": "I try hard to be engaged but relaxed with people around me and I thought I did a pretty good job at it. In fact, I've thought I might be making up my suspicion of autism until recently because I thought I socialized so well. But I recently saw a video my family had taken of another family member where I walk in excited about a cat. I look CRAZY. My eyes are so wide and intense and my smile is way too big and I am speaking like a 12 year old school girl instead of a 30 year old woman. I was being sort of ignored in this situation so I stand there with the same wide eyes and smile like I'm frozen and try again to share my excitement (a stray had leapt into my arms. My family has taken her in haha). It wasn't malicious or anything but they were busy engrossed in getting the cat food and I failed to read the room. I'm standing super stiff and patting my legs with my arms straight and stiff at my sides. I had literally no idea this is how I look when I'm mildly excited about something. I'm extremely embarassed because I look like a total loser and devasted because I've done so much work to fit in and I don't feel I've accomplished much, except that I can speak very eloquently. Most people seem to genuinely like me, but only superficially. I have a very hard time making lasting and deep friendships unless they're also overtly adhd/austistic/both. I can now see I come across as very desperate and odd. Has anyone else experienced this and if so, was it similar? Has anyone had any luck curbing their oddity while still being honest about their experiences and feelings? I don't mind being the \"quirky\" one of the group, but I feel very stressed having such little control over myself.",

      "content_preview": "I remember as a child, I was obsessed with books. I grew up really sheltered with strict parents, so I didn‚Äôt get out of the house much to hang out with friends, etc. Rather than watching movies or TV shows, I preferred reading and getting lost in a book. I would wake up and immediately start reading, even when I was eating, peeing, showering (I would put my book in a ziplock bag and would wipe my hand to take out the book and turn the page, and I‚Äôd do this for like over an hour), and pull all nighters until I finished my book. I‚Äôd often read 1-2 books a day. But once I became an adult, I had way more obligations, responsibilities, and overall less time. And that‚Äôs when I felt the aversion to reading. I have discovered I still love reading, but I can only do it if I know I can finish or read most of it in one sitting. Which is why I would happily start a book while at the airport, knowing I‚Äôd be able to finish on my flight. My husband is the type of reader to nibble on a book. Like read a few chapters before bed, or while at a coffee shop. I want to be like that because I love books and I have so many in my backlog, but the thought of picking it up, knowing I cannot dedicate the next 24 hours to it, makes me have almost an ick to reading. Also, if I start reading a book I like before bed, I will not sleep until I finish it (and I have adult things to do like work, and I truly need sleep in order to not feel overwhelmed or burnt-out), so that‚Äôs also another reason why I avoid it. Does anyone else experience this or something like this? And if so, how were ways you were able to ‚Äúget past‚Äù this?",

      "content_preview": "My niece (6) is a lovely kid but she is intense and always turned up to 11. Very chatty, no impulse control, emotionally sensitive, poor sleeper, poor awareness of her body (falls down a lot, doesn‚Äôt listen to body cues well etc‚Ä¶) and is very sensory seeking. I think she has ADHD but my sister thinks she is just ‚Äòinsane‚Äô but the behaviour is normal. Unfortunately, I think she has been let down by doctors who have said she‚Äôs just high intensity but it‚Äôs normal kid behaviour. Neurodiversity runs in the family (I found out I was AuDHD (she does not know that yet though) as an adult and I suspect others in the extended family might be too) and her cousin has diagnosed autism. She also has a condition that is correlated with ADHD. I‚Äôve made a few strong hints by using language that is in neurodiverse spaces and recommending things that are neurodivergent friendly. I think it‚Äôs falling on deaf ears because she has been told by some well meaning, but uninformed doctors that she‚Äôs normal. I just don‚Äôt want her to raw dog ADHD like I had to and everyone seems to be suffering in the process. Has anyone ever approached this kind of thing with a family member or friend? Is it worth the potential heartache that will come with it? EDIT: Thanks for the insight everyone! I think I‚Äôll keep with the subtle suggestions and seed planting for now and get a book about different brains for Christmas. Still working on the courage to mention my diagnosis but I‚Äôll continue to be supportive of my niece.",

It felt like the emotions came out of nowhere. Afterwards, all I could think was: Why can‚Äôt I just hold it together like everyone else? I didn‚Äôt know what a meltdown was. I didn‚Äôt know there was a reason I wasn‚Äôt noticing the signals earlier. I honestly thought it meant something was wrong with me as a person. It wasn‚Äôt until later, partly through things my (likely undiagnosed AuDHD) husband would say, like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle so many people right now‚Äù that I started paying attention. I realized I wasn‚Äôt alone. I also needed quiet, I also was overwhelmed, I also had limits. That was before my diagnosis, but it was the first time I understood that maybe I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútoo dramatic‚Äù‚Ä¶ maybe I just couldn‚Äôt read my body until it was already too late. That‚Äôs when I discovered the concept of interoception, the sense that tells you when you‚Äôre hungry, thirsty, tired, stressed, or overheated. And suddenly so many things made sense: why I‚Äôd go half a day without drinking water, why I‚Äôd only realize I was exhausted when I was already in tears, why meltdowns seemed to appear ‚Äúout of nowhere.‚Äù I wrote about this experience, and how poor interoception shows up in autism + ADHD (AuDHD), in case it resonates with anyone else: https://camouflaged.substack.com/p/interoception-in-autism-and-adhd I‚Äôd love to hear from others: do you also miss hunger, thirst, or stress signals until you‚Äôve already hit a wall?",

Holy shit that was a little sobering! There have been times that I quit - once was for 2yrs!! - but it's been my faithful companion through everything. I smoke roughly <8 a day, depending on what I'm doing. But my lungs have become angry. I can feel them shrinking, and morning cough has become a daily thing. I'm a shameful smoker, and rediculously respectful to everyone and everything else except for me. I carry a pocket ashtray so I never flick ashes (fire hazard) or litter the butts; I don't smoke if children can see me; I stay away from people and doorways and I'll step off the sidewalk, if necessary; I asked my landlord to not allow me to smoke on the property, to make it harder on myself and it forces me to walk across the street into the woods. I'm so done. And yet, and yet, it's been the only stable thing my entire life; my longest original toxic relationship. It's my start/stop, my transition tool, and I didn't know it. It's my emotional crutch - when my intense emotions hit it's time for a cigarette. I sooth myself with it, it's what I know best. I'm ready to stop listening so much to my completely contradictory brain and listen more to my body, and my body wants something different. Needs something different. So what do you do? Do you do healthier transition techniques? At this point, almost anything is a healthier choice! Ha! Thank you for any suggestions you may have",

She said I won't do well professionally and now I am crying thinking she could be right. She also said I criticize everyone, despite the fact that I only criticized two people I encountered. One of the people I criticized was my brother's former special education teacher who was so bad that all kids transferred to other schools, other classrooms or started homeschooling. Saying I criticize everyone is a bong overgeneralization. She says ADHD is a \"super power\" and she loves loving with ADHD. If that's her reality, I am happy for her, but it's weird to call it a superpower. So now I went back to being suicidal like before. I cried a lot.",

      "content_preview": "Hello All, longtime lurker, first post in here and biting the bullet and seeking help, gets a little TMI in a couple of paragraphs Basically I‚Äôm 49 and after a ‚Äòfun‚Äô few years officially diagnosed ADHD & autistic, basically rolled through life thinking I was a little different until menopause threw me a curveball and knocked me for six. I am medicated for ADHD (thank god for Amfexa) but struggling in a few aspects of my life. I am basically having increasingly bad interoceptive awareness, I‚Äôll go hours needing the toilet doing ‚Äòone last thing‚Äô until I‚Äôm nearly peeing myself! I won‚Äôt drink until I look like a dried up prune, or I‚Äôll put off food until I hit a glucose low and either nearly pass out or get hangry, irritable and lash out at Husband and/or kids. This has also been effecting my sex life, before it all kicked off I had an above average sex drive, that has declined due to menopause but still there. Again the issue is I don‚Äôt seem to realise I‚Äôm horny, I will be literally crawling the walls feeling frustrated, irritable but not realise what‚Äôs causing it. Or it will get to the point where I do realise but literally will need it right there and then, but usually not an option as other people are present or we are not at home. It‚Äôs embarrassing as my husband seems to pick up my needs better than me, he‚Äôs the one making me go to the toilet, giving me a drink, shoving a cake down my throat, or making me go upstairs for ‚Äòself care‚Äô. I feel like as a grown adult I should be able to know what‚Äôs going on, but if anything it‚Äôs getting worse. My medication helps in all other aspects but this, any advice? Also, what‚Äôs with the Ick? My sensory perception is completely off kilter, I have entire wardrobes of clothes I can‚Äôt wear as the feel of the fabric makes me want to be sick, some of my favourite foods I can‚Äôt eat due to the texture (never noticed before) and again my sex life and relationship is suffering as things I enjoyed before are no goes. For example, both husband and I enjoyed giving/receiving oral sex, but now it‚Äôs just ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô, which is frustrating for both of us. Would a change in medication help? Or is it the autistic side coming out more? Any help gratefully received. Thank you K",

      "content_preview": "Been thinking about this since I started substitute teaching and have been interacting with some older coworkers as well as seeing symptoms in children. There are a few who show signs of autism/adhd/audhd, but they could be ok without medication or a diagnosis. But there are others who I just know if they got diagnosed and treated, their lives would be so much easier. But I‚Äôm not in a position to tell either the parents of children or my friends that I think it‚Äôd be good for them to get checked for one of those things. I think ever since I got medicated it‚Äôs just so insane how different my life is, still on hard mode but it‚Äôs no longer on death march. And with new coping mechanisms too it makes things a little easier, but I still struggle with things. So, seeing these kids or my older coworkers struggle w the same things I do, knowing I can‚Äôt really help since we aren‚Äôt close enough for me to make my opinion known. Knowing that there‚Äôs a solution right there for them that they either don‚Äôt know about or haven‚Äôt considered, so they just suffer without help, makes me feel sad. I know they don‚Äôt need pity, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily pity that I feel, it‚Äôs just knowing that feeling that something is just out of reach and seeing it in others is rough. I really hope one day they either realize and get the help they need. No one deserves to struggle as much as they do, or as much as I did",

I‚Äôve been divorced 2 years and I‚Äôve always been transparent about taking responsibility for my ‚Äúside of the street.‚Äù But now I‚Äôm finding that it‚Äôs easy to convince myself that I made everything up it was just overly sensitive. Here‚Äôs what I do know: I am highly sensitive. I am highly sensitive to perceived or real slights, to fearing abandonment, and also to fatigue, hunger, hormone shifts, and more I know my ex guilted me out of going for mental health help for 12+ years. He would say he must be awful if I needed therapy, he must be the worst husband ever. I would cry and apologize and tell him he was amazing and it must be my fault that i was depressed I was easily ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to things like social media - which I‚Äôve finally gotten rid of, validation, alcohol for a while, which I cleaned up when I saw it becoming a problem I could be so emotional, and I know I‚Äôm a LOT I also had so much love to give. Just a max amount. I had a lot of life that I watched slowly fade from me until I was just a shadow He was (and still is as a coparent) pretty easily able to manipulate me, convince me that I‚Äôm remembering wrong, convince me that I‚Äôm being mean / unreasonable/ petty, etc. I‚Äôm starting to finally realize that I‚Äôve only ever asked for the same things and statuses he is allowed to have, but easily convinced that I‚Äôm a terrible person for doing so. I‚Äôm a GOOD mom. I love my kids to the moon and back. I work to study and become better every day and to study them as well to know how best to meet their individual needs I tried to be a good wife. I really tried - stacks of books, introspection, changing myself to fit what I thought would make him happy. I know two things can be true - I can have had an unmedicated condition, and been in a toxic environment. But right now I‚Äôm   really fighting to not bring back a lot of shame toward myself for a past that I want to move to the past. Any words or encouragement or advice?",

Unless the activity is enjoyable during it, I just feel like crap afterwards. Tired, achy, annoyed, like I've wasted my day, bla bla bla. And even if the activity is enjoyable, if it's a chore (like wanting to lose weight, I guess this PDA?) then I still won't like it. Like I looooove swimming, but if I paid for a gym and HAD to go, I'd grow to hate it. Surely I'm not alone in this. It makes keeping fit damn difficult in my current life situation. I tell myself it'll improve when I live alone but I've been saying that for two years",

      "content_preview": "So, at my big age of 26, I‚Äôm finally going to try and be a big girl and try cooked vegetables. I have some major food sensory issues, with a lot of foods causing me meltdowns due to either texture or smell - liquid foods are the enemy, and cooked vegetables have been a long time problem. However, shits expensive to keep buying fresh veg that then goes off cause I forget about it. My partner is going to help me, where he‚Äôll cook it, and be with me for encouragement, and he‚Äôs prepared for meltdowns. But I‚Äôd like to know if anyone else has gone through this, and what veg they found was good, and in what ways was it cooked? How did you go about trying it? How‚Äôd it go? So far my list of things I‚Äôm okay with trying are: carrots, broccoli, green beans and maybe green peppers. Raw veg, I‚Äôm okay with: cucumber, red onion, lettuce, red cabbage, tenderstem. Big nos: peas, sweetcorn and white cabbage. I want to widen my pallet because I eat very bland, no meat, and I‚Äôm also experiencing stomach issues (I think due to gluten) so my already restricted pallet is getting smaller, and in turn more expensive. My life would be a lot easier if I just ate veg. I‚Äôm scared I can‚Äôt lie, and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôll have my partner with me, but man this has been a massive issue to the point I can‚Äôt even go near cooked vegetables so - big scared!",

Now she‚Äôs always so clingy and eager to be with her boyfriend but never acts like that with me. I‚Äôm the one to ask her to do smth together or I have to go up to her room to hang out. She never does the opposite. Of course probably ‚Äúher needs are satisfied‚Äù due to her boyfriend so she doesn‚Äôt need me or my affection anymore. Same with my other friends, they‚Äôre always doing everything with their partner. It makes me think ‚ÄúI should find a boyfriend too then, so I can have someone as well to hang out with all the time and talk to‚Äù, but then I recognize that this is peer pressure and if I would actually have a community who‚Äôs not all relationship centered, I wouldn‚Äôt be needing a man in my life. I don‚Äôt want to be pressured into a relationship because everyone else is. But the other option is feeling lonely. And so the cycle goes on and on and on in society, because someone will see me in a relationship and feel lonely because of it. We don‚Äôt need individual relationships. We need community.

      "content_preview": "Hello! I've been reading study tips from ND subreddits before even getting my own account, and I'm starting to wonder if I might have AuDHD. I'm not formally diagnosed, though a psychiatrist has said I have autistic traits. That didn't really surprise loved ones, because I have hobbies I would delay meals and sleep for, drone one and on about interests, and need to focus hard to read social cues and even that feels a little alien to me. But when I suggested I might have ADHD, they said, \"No! You couldn't! You sit still just fine! You hate changing your routine!\" All those are kinda true, but I don't know. I struggle very hard paying attention to stuff I'm not interested in, and only hold out a little longer when I'm interested. I'm very forgetful (unless it comes to things I'm really interested in), know things are urgent without ever feeling urgent, and change tasks rather frequently though I hate being interrupted and rarely multitask. All this to say, I feel like I might have both or either, but maybe I'm just stereotyping ND traits? Friends and family even compared my traits to what they think counts as ND. I hate loud social gatherings but I survive without earphones. I can't tell when I'm talking too loud or too soft, and my default is loud. I pace or tap my heels but don't feel like running around. I default to sharing and thinking of my interests. Time-blindness. And the list goes on. They pointed out that NTs, especially children have all of the traits I'm struggling with and I just need to apply myself. They questioned why I would want a formal diagnosis when I'll have to learn to cope whether I have it or not. I can't think of a way to explain I don't feel comfortable with a self-diagnosis without sounding like I want an excuse not to apply myself. But perhaps I'm just not trying hard enough? Or maybe my traits aren't severe enough to count as someone who has it? Ah well, even if I don't have it, the tips around here are really helpful, so thanks for those.",

When I have the energy to let my autism dictate doing something the \"right\" way, it's less of a problem - but I'm so fucking burnt out (for years now) and straight up continuing to exist takes everything I have, so when I do get the spark to enjoy myself with a hobby or a fun idea, it becomes immediately overwhelming to even consider doing because my brain says that if I can't do it the \"best\" way then it's not worth doing at all. üò≠ This is also true for things like cleaning and feeding myself, but because those become necessity at a certain point, the bare minimum becomes acceptable. \"Fed is best\" and \"anything worth doing well is worth doing at all\" end up applying whereas I'm unable to apply that mentality to things like, making art, creative writing, etc despite that I view creative endeavors as \"necessity\" it is still ultimate the energy sacrifice I make... Fuck burnout.",

      "content_preview": "Yesterday, my husband asked me a perfectly innocent question. We were at the supermarket and he asked ‚Äòwhen do you want to take the kids to the movies‚Äô. Now, at that point I was face down in our cart figuring out what we already had, to tick it off my list, and what we still needed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. And my brain went fizz pop I almost started crying and this cinema visit suddenly sounded like climbing Mount Everest. Nothing, but nothing up to that point felt to me like I was not ok? Today has been spent lying on the sofa, staring off into space. I‚Äôve been unable to make myself do anything, the hours tick til the family comes home and the pressure of having to do something is increasing. Not that the family requires anything of me, they‚Äôre lovely and understanding, but the guilt of not doing anything when they‚Äôve had a full day‚Ä¶ I think we all know the feeling. Is it possible that we mask from ourselves too? I took myself by complete surprise by not being ok. It worries me because I had been hoping to restart work in the coming weeks but this type of sudden crash and burn is what crippled me a few months ago. Was I fooling myself without being aware of it? I cannot afford to take a teaching position and crash out again.",

I'm currently in the process of trying to figure out if/how I have meltdowns and I feel quite confused. I've had a handful of shutdowns in my life, but I really don't know if I have meltdowns. I have alexithymia, which really doesn't help me with figuring anything out. I've had things that might be similar - intense emotions that I don't know how to handle because I'm so overwhelmed and can't push down - but I never know if that's a meltdown or not because on the outside I look completely fine. I'm not crying, screaming or even stimming. It kinda feels like I'm imploding and exploding a little, but usually after a while I can push the feeling down enough so it doesn't feel that terrible anymore (it's like instead of a giant ball in my chest, it's only a smaller but denser one). The feeling doesn't really have an end but it gets a bit easier to ignore. It usually happens when I'm generally overwhelmed - occasionally even feeling like I'm being choked. Does anyone have similar experiences? If you have meltdowns, how would you describe them?",

      "content_preview": "I have a pretty decent resume. I have a bachelor's degree. I'm almost 30 years old. But I keep running into this problem where every manager I have despises me and it's 100% because of my neurodivergence. When I worked as a media services assistant, my manager was an older woman who called me the wrong name sometimes and got frustrated with me all the time for a very simple $12/hr job, she didn't like my personality I guess even though it was really just me being shy and sometimes confused. When I worked at BJ's Brewhouse as a host right after COVID was at its worst. At first the managers liked me a lot and said I was really nice and calming. But then started saying I should be more friendly and make eye contact or something. Eventually stopped giving me shifts (I wasn't too salty about that one though since they also knew I was moving on to independent work). A sustainability company that worked on commercial sets in LA. So many social problems there! I got into all kinds of things with people for just being myself. People getting mad at me, accusing me of being lazy, asking if I even liked the job (NO I didn't like sorting garbage but I did it). Having total beef with this one girl i worked with and I don't even remember why but we ended up apologizing to each other. Other people I got along with great though... mixed feelings about that job... icky entertainment industry hierarchy. Working at Barnes and noble very part time and my brain got SO confused all the time about where stuff was. I would stand there in front of a book for like 5 minutes and could NOT see it. It really felt like certain people did not like me there at all probably because I seemed stupid and because since I was there temporarily I simply didn't care that much. But I DID do my work, mostly stocking shelves üòÜ PA as Sony Interactive Entertainment which was soooooo amazing except that management was absolutely terrible and hired/fired people constantly. I was only there for a year and watched I think 6 out of 8 other people get hired and fired within weeks or months! And most of them for issues related to their neurodivergence even if management may not have realized that. For some reason literally every single person who was a PA in that job had ADHD üòÇ except maybe one guy... Jason üôÑ... My current situation is that I've been at my job for almost 2 years as an office support associate at a university. My supervisor has been a little toxic from the beginning and we're currently going through another rough time. I could write an essay on this but to summarize, she is being blatantly ableist and very problematic, threatened to remove my accommodation, straight up blamed my autism for our communication issues right in front of HR, accuses me of not doing my job. Now I'm kind of forced to leave again, also because my boyfriend and I just broke up and now I'm gonna have to live alone for the first time in 5 years after financially depending on him. Looking around at all the apartments, I really don't see how I can afford any on my salary, or even a similar but slightly higher salary if I get a different job. And this made me remember the statistic that up to 85% of autistic people with college degrees are unemployed or underemployed.",
