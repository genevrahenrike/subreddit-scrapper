Right now we live in temporary accommodation, which costs ¬£2000/month. That‚Äôs fully covered by Housing Benefit. I also receive Universal Credit, but it‚Äôs barely enough to cover food, bills, and emergencies. I want to start working because UC isn‚Äôt enough, but here‚Äôs the problem: if I earn more than about ¬£800 a month, I‚Äôll lose Housing Benefit. There‚Äôs no way I could pay ¬£2000 rent on my own, so it feels like I‚Äôm trapped ‚Äî I can‚Äôt move forward, can‚Äôt save, can‚Äôt rent privately or mid-market. I feel absolutely helpless. Are there any schemes, pathways, or exceptions that could help me move from temporary housing to private or mid-market while starting work? Do councils offer any kind of ‚Äúmove on‚Äù support in situations like this? Is there a way to earn more without immediately losing all of the Housing Benefit (like a taper, or a grace period)? Has anyone been in this situation and found a way out? Any advice, experiences, or even just perspective would mean a lot right now. Thanks.",

We want somewhere we can afford, is safe and has good school catchments. We also need to be close to the motorway for numerous reasons, so Winchburgh has come appealing. Never did I ever think I'd find myself considering a new build or West Lothian, but here we are. Another option is Kinross but I think that might just be too far for the days I need to commute (to RIE), but is closer to family support.... Looking for experiences from people who have moved or who have friends who have moved - would love to hear your thoughts.",

      "content_preview": "Asda have a system now where you need a receipt to leave. The item I went in for wasn‚Äôt in stock. I assumed that I would ask someone to let me through the barrier and they would open it. They refused and said I had to walk all the way to the other end of the shop and back if I wanted to leave. I asked for a manager who reiterated they couldn‚Äôt manually let me out, by the orders of ‚ÄúAsda House‚Äù, and said I should just leave by following their ‚Äúone way system‚Äù. I asked her to show me and she proceeds to take me to the entrance door and tell me to pull the no entry barrier to leave. She seemed to think this was the obvious thing to do. Apparently if you don‚Äôt buy something you have to leave like a shoplifter. What kind of idiots would implement this system with no reasonable way of letting people who don‚Äôt buy something leave. Plenty of people go into a supermarket and don‚Äôt find what they wanted. Update: I emailed Asda a complaint about this. I wasn‚Äôt going to until I noted the number of disabled people who seem to have been caught by this and the unhelpful staff in these situations. I got a pretty standard we‚Äôre looking into it response with some recognition of concerns about the impact on disabled customers. Just regarding some of the comments. I don‚Äôt know if the system is always switched on. I think sometimes you don‚Äôt need a receipt to exit. They aren‚Äôt push barriers like in Morrisons. They are sliding doors.  I would guess that you can manually push them to the side, but I assume that sets off an alarm. The doors move very quickly. I did try to go out behind someone but they closed. You‚Äôd have to get uncomfortably close to someone to do this. I went to Lidl afterwards and they also didn‚Äôt have what I was looking for but I was able to tailgate someone through their doors. I have also seen the staff in Lidl scan people out who don‚Äôt have a receipt, which is what I thought would happen in Asda. I will reiterate I see that the stores want this system due to shoplifting, I‚Äôm not convinced it would help much but I would think they have data to justify the cost of it. I just think there should be a reasonable way to leave if you don‚Äôt buy something. It is particularly ridiculous in this store as they have a McDonald‚Äôs and Post Office behind the checkouts.",

The 3 of them don‚Äôt flush the used toilet paper down the toilet; instead, they throw it in a bathroom bin. I was shocked when they told me this, I‚Äôve never heard of that. I tried to be polite and told them that what I do (and have always done) is that I flush down the used toilet paper down the toilet. They looked at me really weirdly and told me not to do that, that I would eventually clog the toilet doing that (they told me that UK/Edinburgh‚Äôs pipes are not designed to handle toilet paper). I told them im not comfortable throwing my used toilet paper to a bin. One of the seems very mad at me because of this. We‚Äôre all from different countries and cultures and if I had known this beforehand, idk‚Ä¶ I would have considered other options. I just want to ask, is that a thing in Scotland? Throwing the used toilet paper into a bin? This whole situation is actually making me really anxious.",

One thing that had damage was a 20x24 inch canvas painting of my wife's and my wedding vows painted in the shape of our silhouetts looking at eachother. It was a first anniversary present I gave my wife and it hung over our bed for 10 years. Insurance is a miserable beast and they want a replacement cost for this item. I reached out to the artist I originally commissioned to do it and she was initially responding to my emails, and we had a quick call about it where she said it would be about $500 US. Unfortunately she never wrote this down and hasn't responded to my emails asking for confirmation of the estimate to \"replace\"/i.e. repaint/re-create this original piece. So I'm wondering if I can get an estimate from a local painter instead. So - any painters willing to weigh in on what it would cost for you to produce something like this? Many many thanks.",
