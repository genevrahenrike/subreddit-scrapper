      "content_preview": "So for the freshmen and transfer students, I'm Dr. Josef Velten, a lecturer in the ETE and ME departments.  Since coming to Cal Poly, I've been running weekly repair clinics where I and some student volunteers offer to repair your electronics like cell phones, laptops, electric scooters, corvette ECUs, board games from the 1970s, and other sundry goods. We do so free of charge, but if you need to purchase any replacement parts, that's on you. We also offer 100% money back guarantee, but if you notice, we charge nothing, so really, we can't promise anything.  That being said, I've a formal education in engineering, and I've been doing stuff like this for longer than many of you have been alive, so I've gotten to be pretty good, even on things that are outside my normal wheelhouse. Normally, we run this from 12-4:00ish on Thursdays, but I've had a late start because somebody drove into my car and hit my door hard enough to require me to visit a junkyard to get a new car door to slap onto my car, so today it'll probably start around 2:00 p.m., and go until I need to leave to teach class at 5:30.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! Since the semester is going to start, I wanted to compile a list of things I think you should know about the University Library. As an alum turned staff, I realize that some of the resources provided to us are not actively promoted, so I hope you will find this information useful :) \"We're more than just books\" Starting this Fall semester, we will be closed on Saturdays. Our hours of operation are Mon to Thur 7:30am to 10pm; Fri 7:30am to 5pm; Sun 12pm to 8pm For the most updated version of the library hours, refer to this link For printing, your Bronco ID Card is still REQUIRED. We received word this summer that the Bronco Copy n Mail room is closed indefinitely and the only other place to print would be the ENV Print Lab. If you need to print at school, be sure to bring your Bronco Card. For more information, check out this webpage Our Tech Lending Program is a great resource for those looking to borrow items such as whiteboard markers, calculators, headphones, chargers, and HDMI cables. For a complete list of items we have available, you can refer to this link (click on each icon to know the specifics). In order to check out a technology device, you must fill out the Technology Loan Agreement - Click on this link and press the hyperlink in the light blue box To borrow a Dell laptop and/or a hotspot for the semester, you must fill out the Technology Loan Agreement AND the Care Center's Technology Loaner Request Form (link in the bottom green box). You can check out the devices at the 2nd floor Circ Desk after you receive an email of approval by the Care Center. This process is repeated each semester. Please remember to return your items on time or you will be charged a late fee . It is important to avoid the late fees and ensure all items are returned at a proper manner If you are looking for a book or article that Cal Poly does not have, the library offers a FREE service called \"Interlibrary Loan\" where students, faculty, and staff can request library materials from other libraries. These libraries come from all over the nation, and even worldwide. When you search for a specific title on OneSearch and it's unavailable, click on \"Get it\" and fill out the information needed. The request will be processed and you will be updated about your item via CPP email. For more information, click on this link Once you obtain the ILL books, do NOT (and I mean, DO NOT ) remove the book straps - they are essential to the lending library and its return process Course Reserves are a collection of reserve materials chosen by instructors to support their courses. You can borrow these books for a certain time frame at the 2nd floor Circ Desk. For a list of courses/instructors that participate in Course Reserves, check the link here Remember, Study Rooms are NOT SOUNDPROOF We get many noise complaints (especially on the quiet floors) about the noise levels coming from the study rooms. If you need to talk with your acquaintances, please try to whisper or talk in a quiet manner We are no longer providing announcements via PA system (trust me, we don't like getting jumpscared by the announcements, either). Please follow the CPP Library IG page or keep an eye out on the standing kiosks for fun-filled events at the Library Research Help If you need assistance with Research Help, the availability schedule for an in-person visit with any of the Subject Librarians is here If you would like to meet with a Subject Librarian virtually, you can contact a Subject Librarian and let them know There is a couple more things to add, but this post is getting lengthy so I'll end it here. I hope you found this post useful and send it to anyone who may find this helpful :)",

This is way up from 3x per day. For more transit info, see my mega post: Taking transit to CPP: Everything you need to know!¬†(2025-26 edition) . From that post: Info about Metrolink There are 2 Metrolink commuter rail lines that serve Pomona: the San Bernardino Line and the Riverside Line . The Silver Streak also connects to¬†LA Union Station¬†for transfers to all other Metrolink & Metro lines. Metrolink fare is¬†expensive, but students receive a 50% off discount.¬† If you‚Äôre also low income, you can ‚Äústack‚Äù that discount to receive 75% off with your EBT card. San Bernardino Line at Pomona-North via Bronco Express Metrolink Shuttle The SB Line runs¬†22 round trips/weekday¬†between¬†LA Union Station ‚Üî San Bernardino or Montclair¬†‚Äî much more frequent than the Riverside Line. Stops include Cal State LA, El Monte, Baldwin Park, Covina, Claremont, Montclair, Upland, Rancho Cucamonga, Fontana, and Rialto. All stations include free parking! The train stops at the¬†Pomona‚ÄìNorth Station, served by the¬†Bronco Express Metrolink Shuttle, which makes 10-14 trips/weekday direct to campus. It's free. Stop at CPP: in front of¬†Building 94¬†(quad, across from Building 1). Building 7/Health Center drop-off by request only. Shuttle runs clockwise inside campus ‚Äî always downhill. The shuttle will say \"Metrolink Shuttle\" on the headsign. Stop at Pomona-North: on Santa Fe Street near the east side of the train platform, marked with an A-frame sign. Schedule . Departs Pomona-North at 7:40am 8:40am, 9:40am, 10:40am, 11:40am, 1:40pm, 2:40pm, 3:40pm, 4:40pm, 5:40pm, [Mon-Thu: 6:40pm, 7:40pm, 8:40pm, 9:40pm]. Departs from CPP Building 94 at 8:05am, 9:05am, 10:05am, 11:05am, 12:05pm, 1:05pm, 2:05pm, 3:05pm, 4:05pm, 5:05pm, 6:05pm, [Mon-Thu: 7:05pm, 8:05pm, 9:05pm, 10:05pm.] Other options besides Bronco Express Metrolink Shuttle: Alight at Montclair, take Silver Streak. Or alight Pomona-North, take Route 291 (Garey Ave) + Silver Streak. Future option: Metro A Line + Route 295. Info about the new Metro A Line Extension This is very very exciting : the LA Metro is getting extended to Pomona! And CPP is getting its very own express shuttle to the station. The extension opens on September 19th , missing the start of classes :( A new Foothill bus route (295) will provide direct, express service straight from Campus & Temple to the San Dimas Station every 20 minutes, weekdays from 6am-7pm. You can also use the Bronco Express Metrolink Shuttle to the Pomona-North station, see above. The Metro A Line will have stations in Pomona North, La Verne/Fairplex, San Dimas, Glendora, Azusa, Irwindale, Duarte, Monrovia, Arcadia, Pasadena, Downtown Los Angeles, South LA, and Long Beach. It will take approximately 1 hour from San Dimas to Downtown LA, and 30 minutes to Pasadena. Trains come approximately every 10 minutes during daytime. Service span is approximately 4am-1am. Metro fare is NOT included with the Class Pass.¬† There is a student discount, but you must apply for a special College/Vocational TAP Card. Application here. The fare for the 295 bus is free with Class Pass.  The Bronco Shuttle is free.",
