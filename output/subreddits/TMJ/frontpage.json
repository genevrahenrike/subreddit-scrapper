      "content_preview": "Hello all. First time posting here but I've had TMD for years. I'll spare you all the boring details but basically I have a misaligned jaw, and I've been diagnosed with TMD (xrays) but my symptoms are very mild: no pain (thank god), no clicking, sometimes I have a slight \"crackle\" in my left jaw but that's about it. I also have mild tinnitus in my left ear (same side as my TMD). Thankfully it doesn't interfere in my life much but if I could cure it that would be great. I saw a dentist last week and he said my TMD symptoms were mild enough that he wouldn't necessarily recommend a specialist, but he could send a referral to one if I really wanted to, and I said I would. However looking at the specialist's website there seems to be a lot of emphasis on pain which wouldn't really apply to me ... My main concern is the cosmetics of my misaligned jaw. So I'm thinking maybe I should just go straight to an orthodontist? But the worry there would be that they don't know as much about TMD and I've read some horror stories of people's braces making their TMD worse. I found an orthodontist online that offers a free consultation but there's still the worry they will be eager to sell me stuff. Interested in any input from people who know more about this stuff. Thanks.",

      "content_preview": "This post is aimed at sharing the more intense symptoms of severe, lifelong TMD. When a disorder becomes a sickness. The TMJ is the most used joint in the body, yet one of the most misunderstood and issues with it are often unrepresented. Resources for this condition are often scare, so I want to share my experience in case it may help someone who is struggling with similar issues. I’ve had TMD most of my life. I am in my mid twenties now, but as a kid, I would pop my jaw like a party trick at school. Dentists occasionally noted its sideways shift and my overbite, but besides difficulty tearing food, I never had any pain with it. A failed decompression attempt to correct the jaw in my teens worsened my bite, but I didn’t feel real complications until last summer. Out of nowhere, I developed severe chest spasms, left arm numbness, dips in heart rate, brain fog, and hip/spine issues. Scans revealed hip labral tears + hip impingements and bulging discs. Meanwhile, my chest and neck seized, nerves burned along my scalp, and had difficulty breathing. I have never had immediate pain in my jaw, so I never once thought it was TMD. This lack of direction led to dozens of tests, including heart monitors, endoscopies, autoimmune testing. Every single test came back normal. I had what felt like a dying body, but no one could tell me what was wrong with me. It wasn’t until a dentist mapped my bite at a routine cleaning (it was my first 3D mouth scan) and asked how I wasn't writhing in pain from my jaw. I told her, \"funny enough...\" and  she was the first person to connect the dots. An appointment with a TMJ specialist confirmed that lifelong, untreated TMD can cause significant structural damage downstream. A misaligned jaw can affect the neck, chest, diaphragm, spine, and pelvis in attempt to find temporary stability. They believe it was the main contributor to my hip breakdowns. Currently, I am in a daytime and nighttime guards. Both hips are now surgically repaired, and am I working with PTs for muscle + nerve stretches and myofascial therapists for pain management, but several symptoms persist. The SCMs and Scalenes remain constricted, nerve pain continues to flare in the scalp and left arm, and brain fog that feels like early onset dementia. Pretending to live a normal life with severe TMD and a failing body is a pain I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I've heard \"it's just stress\" or \"it's all in your head\" too many times to count. It is soul crushing. I used to be so active. You wonder what you did wrong to deserve such a debilitating ailment. It is the most excruciating pain and has stolen happiness, peace and hope for the future. For my case, the current plan is braces if the guards can grant enough pain relief. My teeth shifted to compensate for the compressed joint, so when they temporarily push the jaw forward and over to its correct spot, only the tips of my left canines touch. I have a significant gap between the upper and lower teeth, so there is no \"docking station\" for the the jaw to return to. The position of your teeth is critical for your jaw's position. TMD is such an odd disorder that has a wide scope of symptoms that manifest.  It's caused me to look back at my life, and I think the signs were always there. Never jaw pain, but constant muscle knots in the traps, random weeks of heart palpitations or vertigo, etc. Everyone's case is different, and mine seems to be one of the more outlier situations, so this may not happen to you. Regardless of your situation with TMD, I wish you the absolute best of health and healing. Good health is so precious. Please feel free to reach out to vent or ask any questions, you are never alone in your fight ❤️ PS I’m gonna get a shitty ass tattoo one day to commemorate all the times I’ve heard “you’re too young to have all these health problems”",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I have TMJ disorder, recently I got such a severe flare up, hadn’t had before. I would get excruciating pain around my right jaw, mainly at night in bed. The pain would come and go , drinking peppermint tea and taking ibuprofen did give me some pain relief but that didn’t last long. Booked an appointment to see a doctor, was prescribed Naproxen. Started taking it, but it didn’t give me lasting relief, usually within a couple of hours the pain came back. I then decided to take supplements along with Naproxen, to help relax the jaw and further reduce inflammation. Just a a few days of taking these particular supplements along with the naproxen, I am now pain free. For anyone who’s struggling to get pain relief here’s the supplements i took along with the naproxen. Could give it a try. •Papain 300,000 USP and Bromelain 120 GDU •Passion flower capsules  (500mg) • Magnesium Glycinate capsule (500mg)",

      "content_preview": "Hey! For the longest time, maybe 7 years, I’ve had really bad tension in the muscles around my right eye (TMJ side). This includes the right eyebrow, right upper cheek and right side forehead. I catch myself multiple times a day with very bad muscle tension in these areas, and focusing to relax these muscles only helps for a minute or so. (I drew the facial areas here https://imgur.com/gallery/tmj-EBmBPMw ) This issue has also affected my facial symmetry along the years, with the affected areas building more muscle than the other side, leaving my face unbalanced aesthetically. My right eyelid also droops a bit lower than the left and feels like the right eye is a bit higher, and the right eye also has a much more noticable eyebag. My right masseter is also bigger than the left, and chewing feels like it’s only the right masseter being utilized and trained even if i chew on the left side. I have been to countless doctors in different medical fields throughout the years but no definitive diagnosis has been made apart from slight TMJ with jaw clicking. I’m running out of hope and these issues are massively affecting my quality of life. Any ideas or tips would be more than welcome. ❤️",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, I have had TMJ for as long as I remember and was officially diagnosed in 2019 by a TMJ specialist. I have had major headaches needing prescription since I was 6 years old (I was born in Peru and I fear diagnosis wasn’t the best back then). I have had countless splint adjustments (device used to put my jaw on an even plane to reduce symptoms), spent thousands on a TMJ specialist ($5k), spent thousands in Botox in the masseter & trap area (around $7k), and more (massages, constant manual releases, dry needling, chiropractor, etc). I have had so many sleepless nights where I just cry because nothing works and I am in so much pain/tension. I have felt helpless, even to the point where I feared I would eventually fall off the planet (the constant pain felt too unbearable). A couple of months ago, I came across a TikTok where this guy got a frenulum/tongue tie release. His before looked similar to mine… I thought this was normal. Well, I did more research and found that a tie can lead to tension, headaches and possible TMJ. I visited 3 doctors who all turned me away because I wasn’t a “baby” and that only “babies” need a tongue tie release (which is wild - I think the doctors in my area are just older and not caught up in the new findings). Anyway, I finally found a doctor who looked at my case and completely agreed that this could be the cause & he confirmed that my tie was 100% tight & a Grade 3 tie. I finally felt seen. Today was the day I got my frenulum released. I got this done 3 hours ago & I cannot express how happy I am. My tension in my neck and shoulders has melted away, I can turn my neck without strain, my jaw is relaxing and my TMJ already feeling better. I also feel like I can breathe better which apparently is due to my tongue now being able to be in a better position. I hope that as time goes on and I heal it’ll get better and better. I will give an update in a week to see how things are but wow… I think this has already changed my life. I’m so happy I could cry! I also have a post op appointment in 2 weeks to see how I feel & he let me know we can do some touch ups then if I still feel like there can be more tension released on one side or both. DON’T GIVE UP!",

      "content_preview": "So, I have tmj caused by a bad bite and I recently caught a cold from one of my family members. My naso-pharynx has been extremely dry and itchy, as well as a lot of mucus production. With all of these symptoms, started the worst pain I’ve ever experienced with tmj in my life. Altough it is annoying AF at times, it was never so bad that I just literally couldn’t focus on anything. But holy crap. This cold really taught me what real discomfort and pain is. Anyway, as soon as I took some sinus medication and started feeling relief in my nasopharynx(+sea salt spray), my tmj suddenly got better by 80%. Just wanted to share this with y’all.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share my experience after nearly 10 years of constant TMJ pain. My issues included an inflamed TMJ joint, aching muscles on the side of my head (above the temple), and extremely tight masseter muscles that felt like they had knots in them. Over the years, I relied heavily on my chiropractor (which gave me the best short-term relief), jaw stretches, and other treatments - but nothing gave lasting results. Some months ago, I tried the peptides BPC‑157 and TB‑500 for 8 weeks. I finished the course about 2 months ago, and since then I’ve had no TMJ pain or swelling on that side of my face. I’m not saying peptides are for everyone, but they worked for me. If my symptoms return, I’ll use them again - especially since they’re relatively inexpensive compared to ongoing professional treatment. Other things that have helped me: •\tChiropractic adjustments •\tBotox in the masseter •\tMassaging inside my cheeks to release the masseter muscle",

      "content_preview": "I’ve had popping/clicking for awhile, but the deviation has been a development in the last year. I’m about to receive my Urbanek splint which I’m hoping will resolve and/or lessen a lot of the issues. One thing I find curious in my case, is that it doesn’t seem to be a muscle thing for me. If I try to “guide” my jaw down the straight up and down path it doesn’t do that, it’s like I hit a wall and have to deviate around it otherwise it creates an even harder pop which just feels wrong and like I’m forcing it. A lot of the PTexercises I see in here would probably be damaging for me to do in light of that, which is frustrating cause I’d put my all into them if I could. With that said, is jaw deviation one of two types:  muscular and something else?",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys, I've known for years that I clench/grind my jaw in my sleep, and I have recently noticed I do it during the day as well, I suspect as a way to compensate for my hypermobility and subsequent perpetual feeling of physical instability (I am in physiotherapy for this), as I mostly do it when using my arms/shoulders (doing dishes, for instance). Initially, my concern was mostly for my teeth, as I also have very fragile enamel and have needed fillings in my molars a few times now, but lately I have been going insane over the fact that my jaw and neck just feel constantly exhausted and deeply uncomfortable and make me want to mummify my whole head to keep it together. I've been using those heat-moldable night guards instead, until recently, because I actually got the sense they made my jaw so much more tired during the day. My wisdom teeth (ALL of them) came in when I was 18 (31 now), and despite a lot of pain and gum inflammation, I did not have them removed at the time because I was living abroad. However, it's always felt as if there just isn't enough room for all these extra teeth, and I regularly bite my tongue and insides of my cheeks. I remember this especially being an issue when they first came in, but I had to find a way to live with it, so now I wonder, what if I have completely altered the alignment of my jaw because of this? If I move my lower jaw back a bit and bite down, I bite my cheeks. At this point I truly do not know anymore what my natural resting state is. TLDR: longwinded way of saying that I am now concerned that I might never solve my TMJ issues as long as I have my wisdom teeth. Does anyone relate to this/have advice or other wisdom? (pun not intended but appreciated)",

I’ve been doing my exercises and massages the past two days and even took naproxen in hopes of it helping but I’m in a lot of pain and can’t really eat rn and can barely open my jaw. I can go out and but other over the counter meds that might help I just haven’t been able to find any solid info on google so I figured other people who suffer with this disorder might be able to help me? I also have lidocaine patches which I use for my joints but idk if that would come in handy here? I’ve also been doing ice/heat for the past day which has helped but very little :/",

I’m sure I suffer from TMJ but my doctor (GP) not ENT said it could be Globas sensation caused by stress. He did a through exam of my neck (feeling all the way down) looked at the back of my throat and said it all feels normal.  Told me not to worry (haha). Should I just relax about this and just trust my doctor? Also I think I’ve had this before and it did pass but it was months ago. I’m worried it’s something sinister but it’s probably caused by stress??? Any advice, thanks",

My ideas are: Muscular TMJ The process of realising muscular TMJ had progressed to a disc and joint issue Getting taken seriously as a young person What doctors or professionals to see Hypermobility issues and the jaw :') Being told I need a joint replacement at 32 The lead up to the surgery Things I wish I'd known or done differently How recovery is What advice I'd have for others in the situation My disc actually disintegrated and osteoarthritis got so bad that it progressed to ankylosis and fused my jaw 'joint' to my skull. It didn't function as a joint anymore and I couldn't eat, brush my teeth, or even laugh or yawn. Yeah IDK. If any of this seems interesting I'd really appreciate people letting me know what (if anything) would be relevant or useful. Part of my healing process has been to try and reach out and connect with others on here that is going through horrible TMJ experiences. I'm already really grateful to the many people who've had public and private conversations with me. I felt so alone and isolated and like I had gone mad when it was me going through this. It means a lot to me to perhaps help others not have that as part of the horrible TMJ experience. Also... I know a lot of people try to talk to ChatGPT when they're seeking answers about this. If I could be of use instead that would make me really happy lol. I'm sure there's a place for this stuff being shared by LLMs but I think (hope?) someone with real human experience has something different to share.",

      "content_preview": "Long time lurker… I’ve seen some posts about those 25 & younger. I’m 25F & my TMJ for the most part (knocking on wood) has completely disappeared. What did I change? I left a toxic long term relationship. That’s literally it. Found someone who makes me incredibly happy and hang out with them as much as I can. For almost 3 yrs (23-25), my TMJ progressed to where I could barely open my mouth. Eating would have me in tears. Company/family meals left me morbidly embarrassed because I couldn’t bite into anything/fit a fork in my mouth. My jaw would pop & lock up every time I tried to open my mouth. I couldn’t yawn. Intimacy was terrible. Chiropractor didn’t help. Diet changes didn’t help. Changing sleeping patterns didn’t help. Ice/heat/NSAIDs… nothing I could afford gave me relief. I was convinced my impacted wisdom tooth was the culprit for my TMJ, but I didn’t have the $ for surgery for either issue, so I just put up with the pain. Still have my wisdom teeth… I’m not joking, the second I found my new apartment to move out from my relationship, the TMJ went away. And for the last 4 months, I haven’t had any notable TMJ symptoms. My jaw still doesn’t extend the way it used to & will get sore if I try, but I’m no longer crying from pain & scared of food. No popping. No locking up. My biggest piece of advice if you’re young & it’s progressively getting worse with no relief is to examine your life. See what in your life is your largest stressor. GET RID OF IT. Even if you find new stressors (for me, it’s currently money & I’m very worried about it). This feels dumb to post. I think a lot of you will probably roll your eyes, but I’m not joking, I feel the happiest and healthiest I’ve been in years. External stressors weigh so heavily on health.",

Like I’m slightly dizzy and my eyes don’t focus. Like I have motion sickness. I’m having a flare up of symptoms since starting Invisalign to correct my overbite I also have the typical symptoms of neck pain, tight muscles in my head and tinnitus.

Has anyone got any stress relief techniques that have worked for them? Any advice on how to get it unlocked (doctor isn’t hopeful and will only do additional surgeries as a last resort)?

My sister passed and I’ve been in this particular flare up for almost 2 months! It feels like I’m constantly slightly lifting my cheeks and I dont even realize I’m doing it. I have to check in with my body to notice it. It’s almost like breathing. You dont notice it until it starts to cause symptoms. My symptoms are ringing in the ears, that sinus pressure feeling below the eyes, and slight tension pain upper part of the masseter muscles and in teeth. I’m also fatigued. I’ve been trying to do check-ins throughout the day to remind me to relax my face muscles and break the habit. but i forget constantly. especially when im busy at work. Has anyone else experienced this type of tension (not clenching, just holding the muscles in your face too much)? What worked for you? I get TMJ massages during flare ups and I’m trying botox in a couple weeks. Very excited about that. I think I’m a great candidate for it. But any advice before my botox would be great!",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with TMJ last year after noticing my teeth were getting worn out. I always thought the pain in my face was normal and all the headaches and neck pain I just attributed to stress or poor sleep posture. I got a mouthguard made and was advised to start physical therapy. The first sessions were bittersweet. I had tears running down my face from all the pain I was feeling, but I always left feeling so much better. Eventually I could feel the pain subsiding. It was always painful, especially if I didn't go every month, but I could tell it was less painful in each session. About two months ago I was put on Vyvanse for binge eating disorder (and later on diagnosed with ADHD). I had read that stimulants might worsen the clenching so I was weary, but I was doing all I could to prevent it: physical therapy and using my mouthguard religiously. I had my PT session a few days ago and for the first time since I started I can honestly tell you it was not painful!!! Never ever ever did I have a session like the last one. She was applying the same force and I did not feel any pain in my face... Could it be that I was no longer clenching and grinding so hard at night? I had a session with the psych today and I told her this and she says bruxism and TMJ is a common side effect of ADHD. Addressing the ADHD with medication also helps this. I'm not sure if this will last or if it was a fluke or a coincidence, but I can at least celebrate being pain free - even if just for a while - after years and years on tmj pain!",

A lot of people are telling me to see a sleep doctor- and that clenching and grinding starts from having a sleep disorder. I sleep with my mouth open, I have a slight forward head tilt which makes me push my bottom jaw forward when standing/sitting & I’m always congested. If you were a teeth grinder/clencher and you have had positive results of stopping, how were you able to do that? I’m pretty desperate as my masseter muscles are in pain 24/7.",

I’m not sure if there is any relationship between them all? It’s really just annoying and it feels like sharp little pains around my head that lasts a 1-10 seconds and then goes away. Idk, it’s been on the right side of my head and around my temples. It feels like a cramp almost, (I’ve never had these before until taking the meds)",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, my first language isn’t English so please kindly bear with me. I have this problem that I didn’t mind for years now since I don’t find it that awful back then and I loved myself but I do notice though that when I looked into a side mirror of a car with tinted windows, I noticed that my face were uneven. I was so young and was really wondering why is that and then I did my research cuz I was such a curious kid bout it but I also came across this inverted reflections of ourselves in the mirror and how other people perceive us in our inverted selves. Which was a relief for the old me. I can still vividly remember how I asked my lil sister if my face looked uneven and she sad ‘yes’ and laughed and it really hurts because I wasn’t ready for that truth and it breaks my heart cuz. We were very poor and my parents can barely afford our necessities and we’re 6 siblings in total, including me. In our home, we have this big tree of mango on the other side of the wall next to our house, and there was this stack of cement blocks near to that wall. As a kid with a strict father and such a loving mother that never missed to take care of us and always prioritize us, I grew up with such a kind heart and can’t refuse to anything as it will breaks my heart to refuse to anything and my guilt will eat me up. Fast forward, we have still neighbor close to me that can barely go out and play as their grandma and mom were very strict and we can only play on their garage with a wall between us that also connects to my home’s backyard. So we just play from there so they don’t have to go out. They have this older cousin which was 2-3 years older than me and it was a mango season at that time. We planned to eat get some mango on this certain tree that were next to our wall, and the plan was to use the stack up cement blocks and climb to the wall and get some mango. I was very careful as I don’t want my dad to get mad at me and I don’t wanna cause any trouble that can make my mom worry. However, this girl jumped to the other side of the wall to get something I can barely remember but I think it was a mango that fell out. Then she told me to get down to and I can’t refuse and then I jumped. After we took what we have to take, she knew how to climb back while I was left down and she told me I can’t do it but I said ‘no’ many times as I was very nervous and she kept insisting and I got very pressure I guess since I cannot refused (I was so dumbed) because I will feel bad. I tried to climbed up as she hold my hand and when I was almost there, I felt like I couldn’t make it anymore as my palm sweating and I know I’m about to fall cuz I can’t take it anymore and there, I fell back to the ground, and I can clearly remember how my arms supported my body the moment I fell. I literally cried cuz I can’t move it and it hurts so much. This girl be saying I can do it and just act normal or whatsoever like it was so easy for her to say. I know it was my kindest that refused to say ‘NO’ but yk 😔. After that moment, she went down where I fell again and we just walk to that other side of the wall and she walk me home. I was actually hesitating to climb up that wall again cuz I know there was another way to get back home but I just can’t refuse because I don’t wanna feel bad. And yk what I did after she walked me home? I was literally crying while walking and she trynna calm me down but I can’t because I knew I’m in trouble and we can’t afford any medical care. So I went home, act normal and I literally took a shower again that day😭😭. Which made it worse and it started to smell which made my family noticed it and one of our siblings tried to threw a cup at us and I react differently as I can’t move my other arms already and there, they figured it out. LMAO. Not funny though. After it, my mom and I went to a traditional healer that involves deep massage techniques, herbal remedies, and chiropractic-like manipulation to promote physical, mental, and spiritual balance in our country as it is the only remedy we can afford. He told us everything, the problem and it’s caused to my body over time. As I kid, that has faith in God, I know I can overcome that effects and Ik God won’t let that happen to me. However, as I grow older, I can’t deny the truth. I find my self ugly and insecure, as my skin became not that saggy but I can see Skin Laxity on the other side of my face and the uneven of my face features is so noticeable and it affects my whole confidence. I’ve facing this insecurity for years now and it’s making me feel awful. I wanna do some treatments but I’m so scared of the amount a surgery could cause in my country. I do have work now as a 19 years old but I just started and my salary isn’t enough yet as I just started working this June and I can only cover the consultation fee. I also stopped studying this year as I can’t afford tuition fees and my other siblings has a family now and they cannot support me that much other than foods and such. I’m wondering if there’s anyone here who would help me out on finding an affordable treatments or a doctor or anything that you call a practitioner who can help me with this in Visayas, Philippines. I wanna get a treatment even if I had to save money for this because over time, this will affect my body as the ‘manghihilot’ or traditional healer told us that I had a joint problem that could lead to poor posture and just as I’ve mentioned, I have an uneven face and my jaw were not align. I hope you guys can help me out and it would really means a lot to me. I know this is my own problem but I have no one to help me out or someone to talk to about this that really shows interest or care towards me. I tried talking it out to my mom and eldest sibling but they act uninterested haha as they probably know it will cost a lot but at least yk, show some care. Well my mom cared to asked some questions and I really cannot blame them too because I know life is tough and we do not have budget for this, but please guys, your help would really mean the world to me 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼",

      "content_preview": "Sorry, don't know what flare should I choose. So, I am diagnosed ADHD. On 10 mg, long lasting. I had issue with TMJ from the age of 17 and that was propably when the pain was the worse. I also started exercising heavily at that time and I think the mental and physical pressure from exercise made me musle stiff even after exercising. It kind of calmed down, but always came back at the worst time- like huge stress, sickness, life changes etc. Dentist once told me it looked fine from teeth percperctive, except muscle tense and my TMJ being too \"hypermobile\"(I hope I translated this right). So, now at the age of 21, I once again expierence TMJ issues. The pain expending toward right side of skull and sometimes nose. My teeth hards and my face(body, but specifically face the most) is stiff. Anyone expierence this, while after meds? Should I consider botox?",

      "content_preview": "Well after 2 full years of miserable 24/7 pain i can now say that im almost fully recovered from this. I never thought i would see a end to it but im so happy and thankful that im doing better. What i have done these past 2 years is get multiple scans,blood work,test ran on me by multiple doctors that never found anything and i had no hope. I saw so many dentist and tmj specialist and wasted thousands of dollars on splints and arthrocentesis that didnt change a single thing. Took countless of meds and nothing helped. It wasnt until i saw maxillofacial surgeon who told me it was due to me clenching, at first i didn’t believe him and didnt think all of this could be caused cause of that, but a few days later while brushing my teeth i decided to look into my mouth and found red spots of blood and these deep white lines on the sides of my cheek. And after some more research i found out that because of the panic attacks that i used to have before this tmj issue it led to my muscles constantly tightening up because of the fight or flight reaction of the body and it caused a loop causing me to feel pain 24/7 over and over again nonstop since i would still clench at night but even though i had no symptoms of anxiety it still led to messing up my body and its way of function even after i had stop having panic attacks. Since then i saw a new neurologist who prescribed me Amitriptyline which was the game changer and started helping my nervous system relax and help reset it self over time. But i still felt like something was missing as in i still felt pain but just not as bad and so then i started physical therapy where they did acupuncture and it helped alot. From there i started noticing minimal to no pain and some days i wake up without any blood spots or white marks on my cheeks. I also started doing the exercises they teach and it has helped support my muscles. I believe there is a solution for it, its just a matter of finding whats right for you and having patience although i know its hard but tmj is just one of those things where it cant go away with a cure or within a week its a process and everyones issue is different. And its hard i know,i was very depressed and suicidal because i was in so much pain everyday. Tension headaches,eye pressure, nausea, ears feeling full, ears aching,neck tension,and gerd 24/7.With every test and scan result coming back fine i become more depressed and hopeless. I even one day decided to take a walk in the park to think about my life because i really was on the edge of contemplating suicide. I know not everyone is a believer but i kid you not this strange man walked up to me during my walk and told me if i was a believer of christ and even handed me a brochure that mentioned a couple bible verses. I always have been a believer of god but was losing faith since i kept praying and questioning asking why was this happening to me and i truley believe that was a sign for me to keep pushing and to keep having faith. And you can even check my profile and see all my previous posts i have made in this subreddit that reaches back to a year ago. Edit: forgot to mention my pain was mainly muscular but i had issues chewing from time to time,yawning and even bending over that could be felt in my jaw.I even had clicking but doctors always told me it wasnt a big issue. i have never received a mri either.",

      "content_preview": "I’m a 28-year-old woman and I’ve had TMJ for about six or seven years. It started as occasional popping on one side, then both. About five years ago, my jaw dislocated for the first time while brushing my teeth. It scared me, but it always went back into place on its own, so I never considered it an emergency. Fast forward to the beginning of this year: I somehow threw out my neck worse than ever just from sitting up in bed. I mean completely immobilized crying in bed, needing my partner to help me with even the tiniest tasks, like lowering my head onto a pillow. I started acupuncture, and honestly, it changed my life. I went from having to turn my whole body to check my blind spot to turning my neck like a normal person same day. At first, I thought my neck problems were totally separate from my jaw, so my acupuncturist focused mostly on my neck and shoulders. Then one day, she mentioned my pain could actually be coming from my TMJ. About a month ago, my jaw started dislocating more often just from yawning, eating, or other normal daily movements. It would always pop back into place, but every time it happened, my shoulders and traps would seize up. I’d rush to acupuncture to prevent my neck from locking up again. Then last week, it happened during dinner and this time, it wouldn’t go back. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. My partner drove me to the ER, and I sat in a chair with my jaw open for about two hours. Luckily right before they were about to inject me for the pain, I started crying so hard that my jaw finally popped back in. (Still had to pay the ER bill.) As expected, my shoulders and traps tightened right after, and I threw my neck out again before I could make it to acupuncture. Today, I saw my first TMJ specialist. I told her everything, and she recommended Botox for my jaw (which I’ve had before) and a jaw splint to correct its posture. $1,500 for the Botox and $3,750 for top and bottom splints. Now I’m wondering: after a full jaw dislocation, is a splint really necessary? Some people I've seen talk about their own jaw dislocations have been ordered to get an MRI. I live in LA and know prices are high, but I also know this is a business. I just want to be sure they’re exploring every option before I spend thousands of dollars on what could go toward an actual surgery. Right now, I’m drained. I can’t eat without fearing my jaw will lock. I’m self-conscious about my breath because I can’t open my mouth wide enough to brush my teeth or tongue without risking another dislocation. I can’t get ready in the morning because my neck is locked up and I’m in constant pain. I feel like a shell of myself. Would appreciate any advice, thoughts or own personal experience. Thanks.",

It’s a nerve inflammation and it was gone from the first day I was given steroids (medrol, cortisone) I can’t fucking believe that a chronic pain where I had for 6 months is gone, hopefully forever.

      "content_preview": "So I just really wanted to share this just in case it will help somebody else because I am so fricking happy it's gone! I had a popping jaw for about 2 years, i have a disc displacement so pretty much every time i would open my mouth you could hear a LOUD pop and a quieter pop when i closed my mouth. I developed this when I was getting a dental impant and had to chew on the other side for months to let the area heal. I tried all videos on yt that promise to stop/help, I was doing exercises daily, been all over tiktok and insta but nothing worked...I was becoming desperate because i have a date coming up with somebody important and I can't kiss with the crazy popping 😱 So I went down the rabbithole again and tried my facial cups that I already had just dragging them up and down in the tmj area while opening and closing my mouth and already while I had the cup on the popping stopped. I went a bit hardcore because I have a small bruise in the area but the popping is GONE!!!! This is the 3rd day I have been doing it, in the morning I had silent pops again, meaning I could feel the disc slipping back to place when opening my mouth but there was no pop but when I did the cupping again it went completely quiet. Not gonna lie it's supersore at the moment but it's working and I can kiss 🤣😭 I'm just doing up and down motion in the tmj area with strong suction using a regular facial cup while opening and closing my mouth and for some reason it works. Not sure if the disc will actually go back to place with this but i dont care as long as there is no pop.Also noticed now my jaw only slides to one side slightly, rather than doing the weird zig zag motion left and right,so who knows, it might fix it in time, it's only been 3 days after all!!",
