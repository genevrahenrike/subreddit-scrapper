And no hate on them, I get they are here to make a living and are just trying to work. But that doesn’t take away from the genuine frustration of going through 5 years of schooling and taking a state test and having to do continuing ed just to make the same as these guys. And it’s not just this data center. My home local has another data center going on close by and they brought on 40 book 4 guys just on their first job call. Instead of throwing money at the job (like it obviously needed) they just went straight to book four and said fuck all of the other near by locals that would travel to help if it paid just a bit more. I’ve only been turned out since last May and I never saw this going through my apprenticeship. Is this normal?",

      "content_preview": "Today being labour day, I decided to dig out my shirts from different locals I've received over the years. I had settled on two. One from my home local, 105 Hamilton(the oldest chartered local of any union in the country) they gave me for my first labour day parade. The other from 353 Toronto, the place I currently work and pay the highest monthly dues in the country. This shirt, I bought with my own money when a friend was being sworn in. I weighed them careful against eachother. Checked for damage. Looked for the tags. It's a habit I picked up in Hamilton. We're taught to hold the local to the highest standard. They should be our example. My experience in Hamilton taught me to look for two tags. One from the original factory and one from the UFCW when the embroidery was done. Toronto's shirt curiously has no tags. A quirk I've notice in all the apparel Toronto gives or sells. I can't even tell you what material the shirt is made of or it's country of origin. The 105 shirts also lacks one tag. There is no UFCW embroidery tag. However, the shirt itself is made in Canada out of bamboo. It's a material growing in popularity but would have been very unusual a decade ago when the shirt was made. It's because the shirt is made by Jericho. They're an interesting company. While I believe they're not signatory to the UFCW collective agreement, it's because they treat their employees well enough they don't feel the need for it, and that's their right. They spin and weave their own textiles on Canadian soil and choose bamboo over cotton because the global cotton industry is dominated by slave labour. I made the obvious choice. In one shirt, ethical choices were weighed carefully at every step from manufacturing to procurement to distribution. The other's supply chain brings the local so much shame they hide it even from their own members. There are so many problems with the nature of the shirt from Toronto,  I don't even know where to begin. I think it points to much larger problems with the local. It points to deep wounds infested with anti-worker rot. A belief that we can rise from the ranks and pull the ladder up behind us. It's a rot that prevades all levels of our brotherhood. This labour day please remember, our fight is a fight for freedom, equality, and justice. Not just for ourselves. Not just for electricians. Not just our own countries. It's the fight for freedom and justice for all people, and we need a union that will stand behind us in that fight.",

I was willing to give him a chance because that’s all that working men and women needed, what the members of the IBEW needed. A chance. I saw enough in his first term to make up my mind that there were better options for the IBEW. But nothing, I mean nothing, in his first term — nothing in my more than 60 years as an American citizen — comes close to the budget bill he just signed as a betrayal of everything I believe government should be for. Not only will this bill kill hundreds of thousands of jobs that would have been IBEW jobs, but it will rip the rug from under a generation of would-be apprentices and billions of dollars of our wages will evaporate. This isn’t just about the elimination of union-friendly tax incentives for clean electric generation jobs. This is the wholesale abandonment of a project to electrify our economy that would have made us the competitive marvel of the world with the kind of blue-collar careers we haven’t seen in generations. Now it’s in tatters. And why? What is it all for? They’ll say they made overtime tax-free. But it isn’t true. You still pay payroll taxes on overtime, and the maximum deduction is $12,500, getting smaller the more you make. But who’s working overtime when they’re sitting on the bench? And it excludes rail workers. And it ends in 2028, after the next presidential election. You know what doesn’t have a $12,500 maximum? The deduction they left in to alleviate the struggle of owning and operating a private jet. And you know what doesn’t expire? The $960 billion tax cut for the wealthiest. Their tax cut is forever. Wages will fall, and tariffs will drive prices up. The average family’s energy bill will go up significantly over the next half-decade, and more than 300 rural hospitals will shutter. This so-called One Big Beautiful Bill is the greatest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in our nation’s history. So many of our members wanted to believe that Donald Trump was different. An elite who would betray his own in favor of us for once. This is the great betrayal. Trump and the Republicans betrayed you and me. The billionaires and their families? They’ll be fine. Kenneth W. Cooper International President",

The plant will be shutting down soon and I am looking for a new job. Do I have any options as far as finding a job at other IBEW organized facilities. Does IBEW have a board of jobs that would be similar to what I am doing now even if I have to start at the bottom? Thank you.",

On one hand I understand the travelers wouldn’t be willing to travel if it meant taking a $15 an hour pay cut on the check but I also see the local hands frustration that guys are being paid more to be a groundman for a lift than a foreman for the job.

I wear my PPE, kneepads, make an effort to eat healthy (meal prep, coffee no energy drinks), get enough sleep except when I decide to work hella OT. I’m still in the 1000lb club, completed a marathon last month, still working 40-60 hours a week. Don’t get me wrong I’m not invincible, I’ve had my fair share of injuries but as soon as something is wrong I go to the doctor and do what they say. Overall life has been good, this trade if anything has made my body stronger rather then destroy it. Hopefully in the next few years I land a controls/PLC/automation type of job",

      "content_preview": "Please remove if this violates Rule #6. My father was in Local 134 for well over 20 years and had nothing but good things to say about the Union. He unfortunately passed whilst on the job a few years ago and the support Local 134 provided me and my family is something I’ll never forget. As the title states I’m considering a career shift into the Union. I have a Bachelor of Science in Marketing and graduated in December 2019 right before COVID. I was unemployed for a year, got re-hired at a local plumbing contractor until I landed my professional role that I’ve been in the last four years. My main reasons for considering a career shift are: pay, feeling unfulfilled in my work, ability to learn a tangible skill, union benefits (healthcare, pension, representation, etc.) In my current role I work from home, essentially have unlimited PTO, health insurance is provided, 401k match, Work/Life Balance is great and I have a decent amount of autonomy. I am on salary making $44,000 and after taxes my hourly rate is $16.43. Everyday my father told me to work with my brain and not my body. I’ve seen and experienced the toll that construction can put upon one’s body. I seen my dad struggle to find work after being laid off, sitting on the books for years; and having to go back to the railroad for a short time before getting called up. I’ve also seen him work well over 40+ hours a week and not have any time to enjoy himself or his earnings. My main reservations I have about the career shift are: Economic Uncertainty and Work/Life Balance. Will the pay and tangible skills I gain from joining the union outweigh the benefits my current job provides? Has anyone been in a similar situation and if so, can you offer an insight into your decision making process?",

It’s turned out to be a dead end and doesn’t pay enough to warrant what they ask from me. I’ve been weighing my options to see what path I could take, and the IBEW popped up as a suggestion while I was searching. I’m 28 years old, studied software engineering and finance and got pretty good grades (Deans list quite a few times) all through college, from which I did graduate. I’m in pretty good shape, though I could stand to lose about 15 pounds, and I’m pretty strong. I guess I’m being a little long winded about it, but I suppose what I’m asking is whether or not you as people who work in this field would suggest pursuing a career as an electrician, and do you think it would be a reasonable expectation that someone could successfully make a change like this? I see the pay is quite good once you put in a few years, and the job itself seems like a rewarding profession where you can feel valued for what you do. I’d love to know what you think.",

I'm also waiting on a call back from Con Edison here in NYC for a substation mechanic position in the upcoming weeks (not IBEW, but still union). Couple of questions for those who know the trade: • Who generally gets paid more when comparing straight time 40 hrs vs 40 hrs? (From my research they make close to the same journeyman rates) I often hear linemen \"make more,\" but is that mostly because of travel pay, storm work, and overtime rather than base pay? -For those familiar with Con Edison, would you take a union substation mechanic job there over an IBEW inside wireman or lineman apprenticeship? Appreciate any insight trying to make the most informed decision I can before committing.",
