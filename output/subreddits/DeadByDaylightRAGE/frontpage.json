They were able to loop me for 3 gens ( i dont play ghoul very often so pls dont be rude) and also they were able to blind me, even when i was locking to the ground ( something very suspicious) i ended up snowballing them and got a 4K. and they got very angry. Except the Claudette , the other 3 were a failed bully squad. And omg, they were really mad. In the end, just one of them stayed and it was so pathetic that i decided to ragebait him with all the well know american stereotypes ( i know the schoolshooter one is rude, i perfectly know, im sorry, i dont support all of that , but i had a reason, and nobody is going to be harmed so... ) . Also , i forgot to take a screenshot ( because i though i alredy have a lot) but he told me to buy a rope and a chair from amazon. So yeah, his account seems in danger because im alredy reporting him PD: again, i know that the \"school shooter\" message its bad. I dont support those masacres. I was just ragebaiting an ashole.

      "content_preview": "This happened 2 weeks ago and I jsut now remembered because I got the ban card telling me the person got banned. I was playing a match on Crotus Prenn Asylum where I belong when I realized we were playing against a trapper with a full hex build. Luckily my teammates were fighting over who gets the smallest braincells, so he downed the first claudette 1 minute into the match. She dc'd immediately. You know, if your that bad at the game, dont even bother DCing. You don't deserve it. I looped the trapper for a solid 2 minutes, you know, enough time to complete 3 gens. I fealt like jumping out the window next to my winderator 3000 air conditioner, blaring cold air into my dry eye sockets, when I saw the big number 5 next to the generator icon. Turns out the clanker was stuck, or gelking it in shack and the other two were pouting in wide open spaces because the trapper got 4 hook states in before they were able to pop the first 2 gens. Then apparently the person who dc'd typed the trappers ip address in the endgame chat. Bro if your like this just please take a break. Everyone gets burned out. Stay save and good luck in the fog 🪝☠️",
