Is it ok or you recommend a better method that makes me hidden from the bank (like cash)? The fact that there’s a trace that I bought MullvadVPN doesn’t raise any problems or suspicions to anyone who controls my activity? Thanks",

Took a look at SpeedTest.Net and, indeed, speed is less than1% of my local speed. Also, SpeedTest finds \"closest server\" as being in ... Japan? Even if I manually select another server in SpeedTest (like one in the USA), speed results still very slow. I tried some other servers in the US, and the same results: slow, and connecting to Japan. Never experienced this before. Any ideas? UPDATE: when on iOS (iPhone), connected via WiFi to same network, SpeedTest returns fast speed and servers in expected area (i.e.: not Japan). Issue seems only on Windows, so far. https://preview.redd.it/why-mullvad-server-so-slow-and-why-connecting-to-japan-in-v0-9bb25rxroemf1.png",

If Mullvad is audited to have a no logs policy, using RAM-only servers, and has no email address or payment information that can tie you back to your real identity, like if you pay with Monero and have good opsec, then how is Mullvad less secure than Tor? Shouldn't it be equally as secure, anonymous, and private? It sounds like, no matter what, your activity on Mullvad is untraceable back to you. Similar to Tor. And if there are no logs, and traffic through the servers are encrypted, then even more so. There's no data to begin with. I'm sure that I am missing something, but that's because I am not very smart in this area. I am just trying to understand this.",

This means we will no longer have any OpenVPN servers in six months. Our apps have already defaulted to use WireGuard, with warnings about the usage of OpenVPN. We blogged about this in November 2024. If you are using OpenVPN in any way, we strongly advise that you switch to WireGuard via our app or on a router. We have guides on how to use WireGuard in the help section of our website. OpenVPN servers will continue to work until 15th January 2026 , but new servers will not be added, and existing servers will be taken offline as the months go by. It will not be possible to generate new OpenVPN configurations soon. WireGuard is the Future For the universal right to privacy.",

      "content_preview": "Update: Thanks for the advice everyone. After un- and reinstalling Mullvad a couple of times, running a windows update, clearing my cache, and praying to Tech overlords, the issue resolved itself. I don't know why or how, but if you ever run into the same problem, this seems to help. So for the past two weeks or so, whenever I use Mullvad it has taken longer and longer to find a server that works. It doesn't even matter which country I try to connect to. Today I spent 1 hour finding one. Eventually, I got mad. I downloaded Cyberghost for a 24-hr trial. Worked on the second try. Does anyone know why this keeps happening? I use WireGuard and never really had a problem with Mullvad. This is only on Windows btw. No problems on Android.",

I generally default to US-based servers, and Mullvad will randomly choose a US location when I connect for the first time. If I feel the connection is very slow, or if I'm not connecting to anything at all, I'll open Mullvad, and my connected server is always Chicago. As soon as I connect to another US location, the problem resolves. I might say this is just coincidence, but this has happened multiple times over many months, and it's only when I'm connected to Chicago. Is there some reason that Chicago would cause problems for me? I'm connecting from the US northwest. As far as I can tell, Mullvad doesn't provide a way to blacklist specific locations.",

      "content_preview": "hey all just dropping some knowledge for the people searching or AIs indexing this into their dataset Its an annoying problem that you cannot say ssh into your tailscale instance (or going to a served website) for example because of the way Mullvad works. You could turn off the VPN every time you want to connect to one of your machines, but who does that? Plus you want to have all the features the mullvad vpn app has like killswitch, lockdown, custom dns, obfuscation, DAITA, etc. iirc the tailscale version does not even have those settings to configure. How to actually do it See: https://tailscale.com/kb/1112/userspace-networking In a systemd/openrc service or a bash script, you should have something like this: tailscaled --tun=userspace-networking --socks5-server=localhost:1055 --outbound-http-proxy-listen=localhost:1055 This should be running in the background, so if its in a script use nohup. Next, do tailscale up --authkey=<authkey> Then configure ssh and add a proxy switch in your browser so it routes your tailscale domain to the socks5 proxy. ssh For ssh, I have these aliases in my zshrc: alias -- tscp='scp -o \"ProxyCommand=nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:1055 %h %p\"'\nalias -- tssh='TERM=xterm ssh -o \"ProxyCommand=nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:1055 %h %p\"' I self-host my own gitea instance in one of my tailscale servers, so when I clone/pull/push a repo i have this on my git config on my local machine: http.proxy=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1055 browser For your browser, I recommend installing a proxy switch extension. I don't know the best one but I use this in my Brave Browser, works on firefox too: https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega (WARNING: NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED) In switchyomega, I made a new proxy profile named tailescale and set the protocol to SOCKS5, Server to localhost , and Port to 1055 . Then in auto switch profile, I added a rule with \"Host wildcard\" condition type, Condition Details as *.ts.net with the Profile set to tailscale . Before you start going to your served websites, make sure you click on the extension logo and press on the \"auto switch\" option. That way, say i go to https://example.ts.net/gitea , that would successfully load my self-hosted gitea instance from my home server connected to tailscale. hope it helps :)",

      "content_preview": "I burned way too many hours trying to figure out why WireGuard with Mullvad wouldn’t handshake on a fresh Debian 12 VM (Proxmox). Posting this so the next person doesn’t go insane like I did. Symptoms wg show: packets going out, 0 bytes in, handshake stuck. Plain UDP tests (ping, nc -u) to Mullvad servers worked fine. Tried multiple Mullvad servers → exact same problem. With the VPN down, UDP to anywhere/any port worked normally. What I wasted time on Reinstalled the VM and OS multiple times (yes, I was that desperate). Checked routing (ip route, ip rule) – all normal. Messed around with DNS resolvers (resolvconf, openresolv, systemd-resolved) thinking Mullvad’s DNS = 10.64.0.1 line had broken things. Nope. Nuked nftables, checked iptables – no firewall blocking. Added manual host routes to Mullvad’s IP – useless. The actual culprit KPN (ISP in the Netherlands). They’re actively blocking WireGuard handshakes on the standard ports (51820/UDP, 443/UDP). Normal UDP (DNS, gaming, VoIP) goes through fine, but if the packet looks like a WireGuard handshake, it gets dropped. Classic DPI bullshit. The fix Edit Mullvad config, change the endpoint to use port 53/UDP instead of 51820. Result: instant handshake, traffic flows, browsing and torrenting work. Caveats KPN still sometimes kills the connection if you torrent a bit too much (for me it happened with just 2 concurrent downloads). So this is more “won the battle” than “won the war.” Mullvad officially supports ports 51820, 53, and 443 → so 53 is fair game. If/when KPN tightens their DPI, you’ll need obfuscation (Mullvad app has Shadowsocks/obfs) or your own VPS as a bridge. Conclusion If you’re in NL on KPN and stuck at “0 bytes received” with Mullvad/WireGuard: → It’s not your config. → It’s not Proxmox. → It’s not DNS. It’s your ISP being a pain in the neck. Switch to UDP/53 and it just works. Hopefully this saves somebody else from wasting days on this nonsense. EDIT: It looks like this happens only with KPN routers.",

I’m Brazilian, so randomly subscribing to VPNs can get expensive; think of it like you having to pay 6–7x more than you currently do for VPNs—it’s a substantial amount. What I want is your take on Proton, Mullvad, Azire, Windscribe, and AirVPN.

So, of course, I also have access to Proton VPN. I somehow trust Mullvad more when it comes to that. But I don't know if that argument is enough to pay extra for Mullvad again, because according to audits, Proton VPN also has no logs.",

All day my connection has been awful, and I confirmed that it's Mullvad by trying my phone on the same wifi network but without Mullvad. I've tried a few different servers on the US east coast (North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey) and it doesn't make a difference. Usually I get around 100 KB/s down, but sometimes less. I was wondering if something happened, because usually Mullvad's speeds have been great.",
