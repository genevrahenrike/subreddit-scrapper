I immediately joined and the only class available this week was a yoga class. Which no big deal I took yoga for a semester in college.. how bad could it be? Ooh boy. It was not the yoga that I have ever known. It was called recovery yoga. So lots of stretching and slow movements but again… I thought that would be good for a beginner like me with anxiety.. immediately when we walked in she started burning incense. she said it was similar to sage but it started with a p?? I’m honestly not familiar. She was waving the incense all over the room in between each of us on our mats… I felt so conflicted. Part of me just wanted to run out of that class because I felt really overwhelmed with the smell and my anxiety.. honestly typing this out… it was pretty much the smell that made me feel uncomfortable. The class itself was great and she had relaxing music on which she called healing music because of the frequencies. I’m a Christian but do not feel a conviction to not do yoga. So to each their own… idk I stuck it out because there are benefits to it. But idk if I could do that class again. Part of me wants to take it again because I feel like I need to overcome this discomfort. Another part of me just wants to accept this class wasn’t for me.",

Somehow the presence of an instructor and other people push me to work harder.Did anyone experience the same? Did you manage to find an effective home practice?Conclusion: thanks for the comments! I think I should just keep trying and eventually might find an effective home practice.",

      "content_preview": "Hey all, kind of just want to vent about this, but also curious what you all would have done.Went to a vinyasa flow class today and arrived about 10 minutes early. Immediately I already get weird vibes from a certain guy because he’s sitting facing the entry door (not the front of the room like everyone else there) and is trying to make eye contact with everyone that enters. Then, I notice he introduced himself to the one girl by him kinda aggressively (like with a forced handshake). I didn’t hear their entire conversation but he was definitely like complaining to her. One thing I heard specifically was him saying “you’ve never heard of crazy yoga??” And she just kept saying no and she was obviously getting uncomfortable that he wouldn’t drop it.Then, during the class this dude literally didn’t follow anything the instructor was saying. Doing his own thing the whole time. I didn’t once see him following the flow. There was a segment where we were on our backs and this guy just tried to hold a headstand as long as possible. And get this, he fell directly onto that same girl he was talking to. And then he DID IT AGAIN like 5 minutes later. So he fell on her TWICE. He was so weird about it too like he walked over to the top of her mat and tried giving a long apology while we were in the middle of a flow. The girl actually left the class early during savasana and while this is speculation I’m pretty sure she didn’t want to be around this weirdo any longer.After class ends he very loudly goes “hey teacher lady can I stay in here and keep practicing?” in a disrespectful tone and our teacher uncomfortably goes yea sure. I go shower and such and about 15 minutes later I go to leave and this guy is still in there just standing still with his eyes closed.I’m not going to lie I was really bothered by his behavior. It actually threw me off the whole class. I know I know I shouldn’t let him distract me but he was seriously the worst case of a selfish student I’ve ever seen and he was clearly bothering everyone around him.I imagined myself saying “dude this isn’t a headstand class what are you doing??” And was so close to doing so but figured it’s not my place as just another student and it should be the studio doing something if they feel it’s warranted.Have you all come across people like this before? Would you have called him out or done anything?",

Mentally it’s been a rough patch, and physically I’ve had discomfort in my lower body, pain in my knees, tightness, tension… just feeling kind of stuck.Today I finally rolled out the mat and did a gentle Hatha yoga session — and I’m honestly blown away by how much it shifted something in me. I forgot how powerful yoga is.It’s not just about stretching or fitness. It’s like this all-in-one wellness tool that touches every layer:It relaxes the body but also strengthens it.It opens up tight joints and stuck areas.It helps with focus and concentration.It helps to improve balance and resilience.It helped me feel my breath again - and actually be with it.And maybe most importantly… it reconnects me to myself.There’s something about yoga that’s subtle but so profound. A quiet reset for the nervous system. A chance to hear your own body again.Every time I return to it after a break, I wonder why I ever stopped.So if you’ve been putting it off too… maybe this is your little nudge.Would love to hear how yoga’s been part of your journey too - or if you’re just starting out.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all,I'm presenting this here to hear the opinion of other yogis on this matter as I don't quite know what to make of it myself, so first some context.I have been practicing for a bit over two years, and my yoga practice is now something very important and I consider it sacred for me, I've had the fortune and opportunity to practice with various teachers in different locations and I strive to keep an open mind and overall have a learning mentality when it comes to listening to whatever the instructor I have at the time saying to me.I'm also at times skeptical of some of the information that is presented about some of the more 'fantastic' or 'ungrounded' claims that you may hear about some practices, not attempting to dismiss anything outright, but at least trying to align things to my understanding of the world.Now, I've been practicing in an ashtanga studio for close to a year now close to my home (honestly it's more like power yoga imo) and I have a lot of respect and appreciation for both my teachers there, I think they are great instructors and people, and believe that they are quite knowledgeable in yoga and very capable in their asana practice, with all that said here's where my dilemma comes now, soon one of their teachers is coming, and to simplify I'll just post a translated (google) version of the post advertising his class.\"DNA Manipulation and Cleansing Through YogaDNA is the link between the astral and physical realms. It is composed of a fluid, crystalline element interconnected to the apparent reality you perceive. DNA promotes symbolic archetypal data. Such structures constantly produce electromagnetic radiation through the matrix of illusory reality. These, in turn, originate holographic prototypes, made of mental tissue. Here, they take the form of material and spatial substructures produced by mental laws.The secret encoded in DNA externalizes the collective unconscious field to which we are all connected, the field of perception, enslaving the soul with deep feelings of duplicity. DNA strands are correlated with what is mentally perceived. In this way, this dual reality you perceive is conjugated.To escape such programming, you must reformulate the original, nonspecific disposition that you have unconsciously created from your unique, free originality.\"I'm attempting to be open minded about this, and realize that my knowledge of yoga is still fairly superficial, with that said these claims seem a bit difficult to accept to me as they are, and that's where I'm interested in hearing more opinions of the matter, and whether these claims align with the knowledge or practice that anybody else has.Thank you for any input, as I said I mean to be open about this and deal with my skepticism by gathering more informed opinions if I can.",

      "content_preview": "During my migraines, I only breathe through one side of my nose. I don’t mean that my nose is stuffy on one side, I mean that only one nostril is actively breathing. This is natural, and the body switches what nostril is dominant every 2 hours or so on a normal cycle.My thing is, I KNOW a migraine is coming because one side will be dominant for a long time. The blocked side will inevitably be the migraine side, and sometimes if I’m lucky I can use yoga breathing to change the dominant nostril if I catch it early. It literally feels like that side becomes deprived of oxygen over time and that causes the migraine. (I know if is most likely a symptom not a cause, but it FEELS that way) And I know from experience that if I can switch it back I can stop the migraine before it happens.I have tried everything to switch nostril dominance during this time (single nostril breathing/breath holding, pillow or crutch under the armpit) and nothing changes. I have also tried to research a link between migraines and nostril dominance and there is just NOTHING. But it feels like the key to fixing my migraines! I am wondering if anyone else has experience with this or has even just noticed it happening. Or maybe what I’m experiencing actually is not migraines and is something else all together and I should look at a different treatment plan. Any help or acknowledgement is appreciated!",

I’ll go straight to it: there’s someone who flatulate a lot spreading a really bad smell in the room during the lesson. It’s been 3 lessons now and I’m not sure who is it but I don’t wanna say nothing for respect of other people who might do this because of disease or anything I don’t and I’m not supposed to know. Still the smell is so bad I can barely breath and today it’s been awful, it happened 5 time during the lesson and the smell lasted for long. I don’t wanna hurt nobody’s sensibility but also I feel I’m entitled to go through a lesson without having to breath full lungs the bad smell of someone else. I think that if you know you’re doing it too much you could have some respect and go to the toilet. The point is: how can I do (if there’s anything I can do) to change this stressful situation? Moving place doesn’t seem to help since I don’t know who I should stay away from!Thanks for your suggestions!",

My background is more on the Buddhist side of things.\"Mindfulness meditation\" is broadly presented as being good for you in various ways, stress reducing, etc. There are different strands of this that vary in this, but more or less I think people know the type of mindfulness I'm talking to. I'd contrast that with something like Rinzai Zen koan practice, which is often presented more as being definitely transformative but also intense and disruptive. Or something like wrathful deity practice in the Tibetan tradition which is likewise generally thought to have a lot of transformational potential but is also somewhat dangerous and something that needs to be approached with caution.I'm wondering if there are parallels (in vibe) in contemporary yoga (as practiced in the West -- I'm sure there's lot of very interesting tantrikas teaching in places like India). I don't think I'm asking purely about traditional vs. less traditional practice communities. Even more traditional groups still seem to have some kind of framing of yoga being \"good for you.\" And I think I'm curious about a vibe that is something more like, it's transformational, but doesn't fit into the general understanding of what \"good for you\" tends to mean.And finally a couple notes:I've gotten a lot out of \"good for you\" yoga spaces, so I'm not asking this because I don't think that's valuable. I'm just curious about the yoga parallels of what I see as something like less wellness leaning strands in contemporary Buddhism. (I still don't know exactly the right language to use around this, but, I hope I've explained somewhat.)I also want to acknowledge that what I'm asking about could be places with more cult-y dynamics. But I don't think it has to, and I feel pretty confident in my ability to navigate places with respect to safety.I appreciate your time!",

It feels like teachers are just trying to do as many poses as possible and never actually letting you settle in.I love Yin but sometimes just want a little more flow. Not looking for power yoga and holding plank for 10mins. Just normal paced practice.“Take 4 deep breaths here”5secs later“Now moving on”My normal ujjayi is 8secs. How long do you think a breath should take?",

      "content_preview": "I've recently started visiting a new yoga studio whenever I'm in town visiting my boyfriend. I've gone about five times now and noticed that even with different instructors, the class is exactly the same every time. Out of curiosity, I asked one of the instructors, and she confirmed that all the classes (about 8-10 a day) at this studio follow the same set sequence, with the only variation being a mat Pilates class offered every other day. I've been practicing yoga for a few years and totally get that some studios or class types follow a fixed format (like YogaSix's \"Hot\" class or Bikram-style classes). But I wasn't expecting all the classes to be identical. While I do feel like I'm building strength and refining my practice, I can't help but feel like it's a bit limiting, especially for students who only go to this studio. There's so much variety and exploration in yoga, and it seems like they'd never get to experience a lot of poses or styles. Is this a common thing at some studios? Or is it more of an exception? Would love to hear if others have experienced this and how you felt about it.",

I have been doing yoga for around eight months now, and I am having some issues with sun salutations.For background, I have POTS and regular lower blood pressure, so probably not a surprise that these get to me. I am also practicing in PA during the summer, meaning it can definitely get warm in the studio.The worst part for me is coming up from my forward fold and then stretching my hands over my head. Nearly every time I do this, I have to work very hard to hold myself upright. Some days are better than others, and I just get starry vision. Other days are worse, and I get very light headed and nauseous. Usually only subsides once I put my arms back down and I move into more seated positions.Sun salutations are a staple in class it seems, and I generally like doing them. Just not feeling the after effects 😣 advice would be appreciated!",
