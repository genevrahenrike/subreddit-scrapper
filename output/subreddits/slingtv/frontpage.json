      "content_preview": "I have been watching ESPN and ESPN2 for US Open tennis coverage the past week, and there is a recurring issue where what I am watching live eventually starts over again, maybe halfway through what I have just seen, rather than advancing normally in time. I have missed parts of the next matches showing because of this. Going to a different channel entirely and then back to ESPN or ESPN2 fixes it, and whatever is currently airing live is showing. But, it will do this again eventually. Very annoying. My app cache was cleared already and it still does it. Is anyone else having this issue with ESPN channels, or other channels? A long time ago this happened to be elsewhere on Sling and it went away on its own.",

Am I missing something or is Sling about to become obsolete for me and perhaps millions of other viewers?

Again I don't watch any TV other than SEC football games, so I should be covered by the ESPN channels plus my antenna.",

The guide could be better but when you get used to it isn't to bad. I wish they would have a way to just see what channels you get in one guide menu instead of having to do a favorites. I'm not big on dvr so the 50 hours is fine with me. I mainly have it for sports so the Orange w/sports pak is the way to go with me. I get locals on an antenna so getting them on sling isn't a big deal. I see many people frustrated with sling guess I have been lucky.",

Sling could work with Walmart (they already work with walmart owned Vizio integrating vizios ota tv connection with the Sling guide like what is done with air tv already) to sell air tv devices next to the Antennas in the Walmart Electronics department, sling also needs to update there deal with antenna maker Winegard. I feel they need to even promote Air tv more. Like Tablo is being promoted. This would even get more people to come to sling with Directv and other live Streaming services doing the skinny bundle thing. The day and week sub capabilities help but. Watching free local TV with your cable channels is very attractive to cord cutters. Plus it puts Echostars Sling media patents to good use.",

The main reason I started and always had DTV was for their uncompressed picture quality, but that all went away many years ago.  To be fair, it could be stations sending them compressed feeds now, but that seems doubtful.  Anyways, it looks just like streamed content now, so that advantage is gone.  They also offer almost nothing in 4K, and I now have a 4K TV. So three questions: How is the PQ on Sling? What is offered in 4K? I really like being able to have a PIP window when looking at DTV's guide page so that I can watch what I am currently on while looking (I know...).  It seems like most services do not have this.  Does Sling? Any other general comments from those who have switched are appreciated.  Thanks.",
