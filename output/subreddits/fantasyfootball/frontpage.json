Hampton went right after him. Tyler Warren was drafted as the TE5. And it seems like when the choice is between a mystery box rookie receiver and a reliable veteran, everyone is going for the former all the time now.IDK, I just think it’s a huge overreaction and a trend that’s going to backfire, like when people were drafting all WRs in the 1st round in 2015 and 2016. I think many championship teams are going to be the ones that are stacked with household veteran names.",

      "content_preview": "While Henderson’s hype spiraled out of control over the summer, I think it was justified for Omarion Hampton to go up a few spots after the preseason. One reason was because of how little we had heard about Najee Harris all camp.But now with the season right around the corner, Harris is practicing in full. I don’t believe that Hampton has a clear workhorse role in this backfield and he probably won’t all season with Harris there.Harris is a good all-around back that doesn’t fumble the football. Chargers aren’t going to entrust Hampton with 250+ carries as a rookie and Harris will certainly take on a role as a pass catcher + LA is likely to try to open up the pass game more with Greg Roman calling the plays.For Henderson, it’s simple, his role is just as unknown to start the season as RJ Harvey, but for some reason, Henderson is going rounds ahead of Harvey. Rhamondre Stevenson isn’t going anywhere. The guy is good and also, like Najee, has youth on his side still.Add in Antonio Gibson, that’s a clusterfuck of a backfield. People are hoping Henderson gets half the backfield touches, but it’s more likely that it’s around 30 percent or only a few ticks above that for at least the first month, possibly the first half of the 2025 season.We got to the point of drafting Henderson over guys like Kenneth Walker, James Connor and Alvin Kamara. Surely, he isn’t going to return that type of value that those backs will this season, not due to his own talent but the opportunity share.",

But I’m commissioner in one of my leagues and I’ve got a good amount of influence in my other league.We’ve had a lot of discussions around the future of kickers. Both leagues are adamant about keeping kickers involved mostly because they’re “funny” which I honestly kind of agree with.The tricky part is, in both leagues, kicker scoring is pretty standard 1 pt per 10 yards. However that has always been 50+ = 5pts.We have entered an age of 60+ yarders being more frequent, and Cam Little went ahead and made everyone ponder the 70+ yarder this preseason.I personally don’t think a field goal should ever be equivalent (or more!) than a TD since that just doesn’t make sense. But it also doesn’t make sense for a 65 yarder to be equal to a 50 yarder.What are people doing about this? Apologies if this has been asked before as I imagine it has. Can’t stress enough I’m not a frequent redditor here! Thanks!",

Fantasy QBs are a streamable commodity outside of the top 5-8 guys anyway. So these downside seem easy to mitigate.He's available in 75% of leagues. That's about the highest availability of any clear #1 QB. He's not special but is in the post 5-8 pack on a per start basis with many better liked QBs. He's got great weapons and no secondary. Achane led the league in catches, receiving yards and receiving TDs among rbs. The offense is designed and roster built for him to win through the air.Miami has the skill players to score a lot of points and a defensive backfield to require a lot of points.  We'll know if he's injured or playing outdoors in the cold. So why is everyone so low on him?",

      "content_preview": "Another new year to get excited, opinionated, and generally riled up......about the one fantasy position that NFL teams make every effort to AVOID using!Welcome to STREAMING KICKERS IN 2025!!!!!!!!!Streaming kickers is another part of the fantasy season that can add real fun.  Oh we're sure gonna cry along the way, believe me-- just like for the rest of our roster.  But you shouldn't be in this game, to begin with, if you don't enjoy the process.Enjoy the excitement, right now, before the first coin flip.  We're looking at a season full of potential-- swiping left to find kicker bromance. And if we're lucky, sometime around mid-season, we might even choose a kicker \"sole-mate\"..Kicker ContextMy intro sentence wryly refers to Kickers as \"Plan B\", but I'd like to use a moment on why I love this crazy position.Kickers are the one fantasy position that's truly, intimately tied to the entire game script.Sure, your RBs and QBs will do their \"matchup proof\" thing. If that doesn't get too stale for you.  But making your weekly kicker selection?  That takes thinking about the whole game.  Which team will build up an early lead?  Will they stall upfield, or will big plays get near the end zone?  Is the coach aggressive to go for it?  Is the defense bending but not breaking?Plus, Kickers have only become more interesting!No dodging or breaking tackles or hail marys-- not on a normal day.  But have you seen the recent70 yard FG?  Whether a fluke or not, it's indisputable that elite kicking has been only growing steadily, year-on-year.Is there a risk of choosing wrong?Always!  But with kickers, the weekly risk usually turns out to be equally big for \"top tier\" options, as for our weekly streamers.  A glance at my weekly \"Kicker Walls Of Shame\" shows that.  So if you decide to stream, you might as well play the field-- Assuming it's a calculated gamble..Recap 2024Kickers had relatively high predictability last year.  The first month was bad-- but after that, we had a great ride.  (Accuracy report was here.)2024 was a welcome return to the levels of the saner '16-'21 era, after the spine-chilling low-point of 2022..Who's this guy, making too-big a deal out of Kickers?If you don't know me, definitely start by reading my longer introduction, inmy recent D/ST post!Fast summary: Starting 7+ years ago, I've beensharing with Reddithow I apply predictive stats to test fantasy trends, and to understand patterns in the data, which ultimately help us make informed fantasy picks.Idescribemy machine learning, methods, and models. I share analytical studies. I track top sources, and I share my accuracy results (2024 summary here).What separates my Kicker models?It's how they're developed scientifically, including rigorous testing by cross-validation.  I don't cater to biases (even it would be better for my mental health).   The computer decides-- not me-- which data has really mattered in the predicting the past results..Streaming KickersAdvantages of Kicker streaming.Kicker streaming isn't quite the same as D/ST streaming.Yes, I love D/ST streaming: they provide a \"relatively predictable\" chance for a boosted scores.  But league-mates are more prone to hoarding defenses (not too clever btw).   The good thing about Kickers, though, is it's MUCH more likely that one of my top-5 ranked Kickers will be unclaimed and available to you.  (Most weeks.)  Even though the point-differences between kickers are smaller, your pool of candidates is probably larger than you see for D/ST.Wait, what is streaming?Oh, right!I just talked about this in my D/ST post, 2 days ago.  Repeating:  \"Streaming\" means not feeling stuck to the same Kicker all season.  You’re open to flipping them, maybe even weekly, to find a better prospect. Add/drop. You separate, like the S in theD.E.N.N.I.S.system, and you similarly exploit the circumstances-- much easier if you have plenty of options.Here are the key points:The opposing team matters-- the matchup, the weather, the circumstances.  We exploit these differences among all the kickers on waivers.Now-- after the draft-- you should pick a Kicker that can start you off well for week 1.Unless you're attached to your kicker (which is okay!) you'll generally expect to grab a different one for week 2.Later (after 4-7 weeks), we'll hit bye weeks and it's okay if you find a kicker you want to hold.  Try if possible to consider future week forecasts.The expected point differences are smaller, for kickers, so you shouldn't stress about the perfect hold.Really, don't get all up in a hissy, just because your favorite kicker is projected like 0.2 points below some no-name.So spend some time exploring differences.  Other things might mean more to you than one-tenth of a point. Is it a kicker you like? Do they have 2 weeks of good outlook?  Do you have other players on the same team?  Do you agree with the pros and cons?https://preview.redd.it/i-know-its-literally-the-last-thing-you-need-but-heres-the-v0-m0rko8lfq4nf1.jpgKicker Picks for Week 1Here’s the current list of top choices for week 1.  Don’t  overthink “ranks”, because there’s so much uncertainty now.Tier 1:Shrader, Ryland, Butker,Bass[EDIT: BEWARE ONGOING NEWS, BASS MIGHT BE OUT]Tier 2:Moody, Gay, Koo, McPherson, Little, McLaughlin.Where the heck is Aubrey and Dicker, and \"My Favorite Kicker\"?They'll get theirs.  Don't drop them... just ride through week 1.   And we're talking streamers here-- it's not tiers for season holds.I know they're not all who you expected.  (I might be known for that!)   Here are some perspectives:Some great season-long kickers just don't have a good matchup this week.(Well, we don't really know. It's the best guess we have.)My research finding was that teams tend to use their Kickers differently in the first month or so.So some surprise kicker candidates will float to the top, based on the analysis, especially earlier in the season.  It can feel a bit weird!We're still guessing about team strengths and weaknesses, before we learn.Anyway, regardless-- no matter what ranking list you use-- maybe 30% will feel like relative busts, in any given week..Beyond RankingsIs that it?No way, man!  The whole point of what I do is to look deeper!The \"Subvertadown project\" isn't just for turning data into “rankings”.What I'm REALLY interested in is that my analysis helpsinterpretthe projections.Because interpretations help you make your decision.My posts this year are going to reflect that idea more.  You shouldn’t just blindly grab \"whoever's at the top\".  There’s more to consider.  In my future Reddit posts, I will be grabbing from more insights like these:1. Future week forecasts.If you look atmy front webpage now(as a non-subscriber) you’ll see an example of what the 17-week forecast charts look like.  A lot of the fun of streaming is trying to plan weeks ahead!If you want a kicker \"good for 2 weeks\", then some of the Tier 1 and 2 candidates include: Ryland, Moody, McLaughlin, and Koo.2. Pros and Cons(\"Why so high?\"  \"Why so low?\")At the moment, the entire unorderedKickers Pros and Cons list is free on my website (linked here)!Think of it like “running the model working in reverse”.  We take the projected Fantasy points, and it spits out which inputs were most key for that specific team.Regardless of whether you use an alternate kicker ranking source, these pros and cons are still a good supplement, to help you think through your selection.  The point is: your thought process might sway you to end up with a different Kicker than you expected.3. \"Kicker Utilization Curves\"This might honestly be my favorite tool I've developed.  It's meant to show at what yard lines the team is likely to end drives.Each drive can end without kicker points: by a turn-overs, punts, failed 4th downs, or even missed kicks.  Still, the usefulness of the tool is helping us question whether the outlook of team field advancement is aligned with our expectations.Future “Here's the Kicker” Reddit Posts :Reddit posts are the main weekly source I give, aside from the Pros/Cons list mentioned above.  My aim is Tuesdays, but I'll also adjust how much I do, if things seem stale after 6 weeks.I'll focus more on the \"interesting bits\", beyond just \"who's at the top\".  I'm hoping the community can bring useful perspectives in the discussion.  Let's see how it goes!Oh, and just a little teaser before the release: I expect some of my posts to showcase the new model I've been developing: forDecimal Kicker Scoring!Stay tuned.We are so ready! Let's kick into gear!/Subvertadown (All the above examples are visible right onsubvertadown.com)",

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/hayden-winks-week-1-rb-rankings-half-ppr-v0-78b2cqemi6nf1.png Week 1 RB Rankings (Half PPR) 1. Christian McCaffrey His last 20 games as a healthy 49er: 22.0 half PPR points per game. The 49ers project for the 14th-most points of the week (23.0), which is a lot lower than their season-long projections. The Seahawks defense was 6th in EPA and success rate allowed after their Week 10 bye last year and are widely-viewed as a top-5 defense this year after adding DE Demarcus Lawrence this offseason. 2. Saquon Barkley This is an eruption spot. The Eagles project for the most points of the week (27.5). Saquon averaged 146 total yards in 13 regular season wins last year, including 169 and 78 total-yard outings vs. Dallas in 41-7 and 34-6 blowout wins. The Cowboys traded away Micah Parsons because their run defense is so bad on paper that they wanted a DT instead. Let's see if DT Kenny Clark is ready one week ahead of the season. From Bill Barnwell : \"Over the last four years, the Cowboys are the league's best defense with Micah Parsons on the field by EPA per play. Across a 1,039-play sample, they're the league's second-worst defense over that same stretch by EPA per play when Parsons isn't on the field.\" https://preview.redd.it/hayden-winks-week-1-rb-rankings-half-ppr-v0-fwg7tfyki6nf1.png 3. Bijan Robinson This is a rough matchup with the Buccaneers, who were 7th-best against fantasy RBs last year. It's also the first game without C Drew Dalman (Bears) and RT Kaleb McGary (IR), meaning a new center will be facing DT Vita Vea. Bijan was the RB4 on RB4 usage last year, so there's room for a dock in projected efficiency here and to be a locked-in elite RB1. 4. De'Von Achane He's practicing after a minor calf strain in camp. This assumes he is at near full strength with elevated re-injury risk, and 7th-round rookie Ollie Gordon is operating as the backup. Achane averaged 19.3 half PPR points on 6.1 grabs in 11 Tua Tagovailoa games, which would've made him the RB4 last year. The difference right now is the Dolphins are middle of the pack in projected points this week. https://preview.redd.it/hayden-winks-week-1-rb-rankings-half-ppr-v0-5p7r22toj6nf1.png 5. Derrick Henry The Ravens project for the 8th-most points of the week (24.5). The Big Dog had 84 yards and a score against the Bills in their playoff loss last year. Baltimore is a rare underdog here (2.5 points on the road). For context, Henry averaged 70 rushing yards on 15 carries in 5 losses last year compared to 131 rushing yards on 21 carries in 12 wins. Expect him to finish between that in a projected close game. 6. Josh Jacobs While the Lions defense is good against fantasy RBs, Jacobs did get them for 108 scoreless yards and then 66 yards with 3 rushing scores in their matchups last year. Expect Lambaugh to be rocking against a rival with the juice of the Micah Parsons trade pulsing through the Packers' bodies. Okay, that's a bit dramatic. The Packers project for the 5th-most points of the week (25.0), and Jacobs had the most rushing TDs inside the 10-yard line last year. He was the RB4 from Week 7 on with Jordan Love in the lineup, averaging 19.0 half PPR points per game. https://preview.redd.it/hayden-winks-week-1-rb-rankings-half-ppr-v0-e1azd784k6nf1.png 7. Jahmyr Gibbs The Lions project for the 17th-most points of the week (22.5), which is 10 points fewer than they averaged last year (33.0). In 7 games when the Lions scored under 30 points, Gibbs averaged 14.9 half PPR points. That was 24.1 half PPR points in the 11 games when they scored over 30 points. 8. Bucky Irving The Bucs project for the 8th-most points of the week (24.5), despite having elite LT Tristan Wirfs on the sideline. It won't be surprising if Irving's efficiency dips down without him and elite play-caller Liam Coen, but Irving can catch passes in the wake of Chris Godwin, Jalen McMillan, and Cade Otton injuries. Irving's short- and long-term value will be reliant on just how many snaps he plays. Irving averaged 19.6 opportunities in the 5 games before starting the final 3 games of the year, leading to 21.3 opportunities. The Falcons lost DT Grady Jarrett and drafted two undersized EDGEs in Round 1. They should be vulnerable on the ground. 9. Jonathan Taylor The Colts project for the 12th-most points of the week (24.25). In his 14 games with Shane Steichen when the Colts scored somewhere in the 20s, Taylor averaged 15.1 half PPR points on 18.9 carries. The main difference is the Colts are now without C Ryan Kelly and RG Will Fries. The Dolphins will be one of the biggest pass funnels based on their personnel. Their edge rushers are amazing and they added 331-pound NT Kenneth Grant in Round 1, while watching their top secondary options leave this offseason. https://preview.redd.it/hayden-winks-week-1-rb-rankings-half-ppr-v0-ws32sqzmk6nf1.png 10. Chase Brown The Bengals project for the 2nd-most points of the week (26.5) and are 5.5-point favorites vs. the Browns. In his 5 wins without Zach Moss last year, Brown averaged 18.8 half PPR points on 20.8 carries. That's probably the max for him now that Samaje Perine is around to spell him. 11. James Conner This is an eruption spot per the chart. The Cardinals project for the 8th-most points of the week (24.5) as 6.5-point favorites versus the Saints. Conner averaged 116 total yards on 20.8 opportunities in 7 wins last year, compared to 77 total yards and 15.3 opportunities in 9 losses. That's 18.0 half PPR points in 11 wins under HC Jonathon Gannon, too. Last year's RB13 on RB15 usage, and the offense has both OTs healthy now after they combined for just 20 games last year. 12. Ashton Jeanty The Raiders project for the 6th-fewest points of the week (20.5) in an early east coast start for the west coast elites, but Jeanty basically didn't leave the field with the 1st-team offense throughout the preseason. The Patriots defense added coach Mike Vrabel, DT Milton Williams, LB Robert Spillane, and other starters this offseason, so beware using last year's stats for this year's projections. 13. Alvin Kamara Last year, Kamara was the RB1 overall through September. He starts out a lot better than he finishes, at least looking at previous game logs. The Saints project for the 3rd-fewest points of the week (18.0), and it's unclear if he'll be the goal-line back ahead of Kendre Miller with a new coaching staff. The good news for Kamara is Kellen Moore has been top-10 in pace in every year he's been coordinating offense in the NFL, and the Saints OL looks better than it did last year with 9th-overall pick LT Kelvin Banks looking good in camp and preseason. In 9 losses last year, Kamara averaged 14.9 half PPR points despite the team scoring only 16.5 points in them, thanks to scamming 5.2 receptions. The Cardinals look a lot better on defense this year. 14. Kenneth Walker III He missed practices while managing a foot injury in training camp, but he was never out long term, signaling that this was just maintenance to get ready for the season. I'm not making any injury adjustments for now. Walker was the RB14 on RB12 usage last year in half PPR but even flashed receiving chops, too. Those may come in handy as 2.5-point home dogs against the 49ers. The Seahawks project for the 6th-fewest points of the week (20.5), so his projected touchdowns and carries are a bit lower than normal. I'm excited to watch 1st-round LG Grey Zabel and the return of RT Abe Lucas in this new zone scheme. They dominated in the preseason, and Walker has never had positive blocking in front of him in his young NFL career. Despite that, he led the NFL in forced missed tackles per carry. Insane accomplishment. There should be multiple long touchdown runs this year. 15. Kyren Williams The Rams expect to start Matthew Stafford and LT Alaric Jackson. That's big news, as Kyren's yards per carry dropped to 3.5 when Jackson hasn't been on the field over the past two years. It's 4.6 YPC over that time span in general. I do expect Kyren's snap counts to drop from 87% with Blake Corum and 4th-round rookie Jarquez Hunter performing well in the preseason, however. Sean McVay has hinted at that this offseason, probably after watching Williams' efficiency drop on a too-heavy workload. The Texans were the 3rd-best defense against fantasy RBs. 16. Chuba Hubbard In 4 wins, Hubbard averaged 22.3 carries. In 6 losses by 15+ points, that dropped to 12.0 carries. This is expected to be a close game, with the Jaguars favored by 3.5 points in Jacksonville. That defense allowed the 2nd-most fantasy points to RBs last year, so this is generally a good matchup. I expect the Panthers to try to establish the run instead of letting the Jaguars' elite edge duo wreck a backup left tackle. Icky Ekwonu (appendix) is at best questionable to play. 17. Tony Pollard No Tyjae Spears (IR). In 5 games without him last year, Pollard averaged 24.2 touches per game on 85% snaps. With the OL and QB looking much better this year, hopefully that means a lot more than 12.8 half PPR points per game. The Titans project for the fewest points of the week (17.5). Offenses playing in Denver in September have averaged 15.1 points across 9 games since 2020. This defense is stacked, and the altitude during the summer weather is a lot to deal with for visiting teams. It's expected to be 81 degrees a mile up in the air. 18. James Cook The Bills project for the 3rd-most points of the week (26.0), but the Ravens are a very difficult defense. They allowed the 3rd-fewest RB carries and 4th-fewest fantasy points last year and might be better this year on paper after adding CB Jaire Alexander (questionable) plus two top-20 consensus draft prospects at FS and EDGE. He'll be fighting regression this year after scoring multiple 40+ yard touchdowns last year -- TDs from 65, 49, 46, and 41 yards out to be exact -- but the entire OL returns and no Khalil Shakir (ankle) could mean some manufactured receptions trickle down to him. Cook was half PPR's RB9 on RB20 last year. https://preview.redd.it/hayden-winks-week-1-rb-rankings-half-ppr-v0-t42dt2d4m6nf1.png 19. Breece Hall Braelon Allen subbed in for short-yardage opportunities in preseason action. Hall might be forced into a pass-game and explosive-runs role, while projecting for fewer scores than the rest of the fantasy RB2 range. He averaged 10.4 half PPR points on 62% snaps in his final 5 games once Allen was actually mixed in last year. The Jets were scoring 21.6 points in those contests, too. This week... The Jets project for the 2nd-fewest points of the week (17.75) as hosts to the Steelers, and now stud RG Alijah Vera-Tucker is out long term with an arm injury. Brutal. 20. Omarion Hampton Najee Harris (eyeball) is questionable and \"there's a possibility\" that he plays Week 1. He's at least been cleared for contact and dodged the NFI list. It's still more likely that he sits or has a very small workload after just starting to run a couple weeks back. This Hampton ranking assumes Harris suits up in a reduced role. If Harris is out, then Hampton bumps up to the RB16 range. We'll know on Friday night in Brazil. The Chiefs allowed the fewest fantasy points to RBs last year (14.4 HPPR). For reference, the league median was 20.0, so that's a big difference. 21. TreVeyon Henderson Like just about every non-1st-round rookie, expect Henderson's December numbers to be better than his September numbers. He will need some explosives to make up for the potential goal-line vulturing of Rhamondre Stevenson, who has a good 20 pounds on him. Hosting the Raiders is as clean of a matchup as it gets. They lost DT Christian Wilkins, S Trevon Moehrig, LB Robert Spillane, SCB Nate Hobbs, and LB Divine Deablo this offseason. It's one of the worst front sevens in the NFL. 22. Isiah Pacheco He only averaged 36% snaps after returning from a *checks notes* broken leg last year. His numbers were bad, as expected. He broke his damn leg as a reminder! So let's rewind the clock to see if there is a path to real upside. In the 17 games before that broken leg, Pacheco averaged 14.7 half PPR points on 68% snaps. We'll learn a lot more on how much the Chiefs want to use him versus Kareem Hunt and 7th-round rookie Brashard Smith. I'm guessing Pacheco lives in the 50-70% range as a low-end RB2. The Chiefs project for the 11th-most points of the week (24.5) against a Chargers defense that was 5th-best against fantasy RBs last year. DC Jesse Minter is the truth. 23. Aaron Jones The Vikings' neutral pass rate is about to get more balanced this offseason. That's what JJ McCarthy was used to in college and matches the personnel changes the team made when they signed/drafted an entirely new interior offensive line after adding thumping RB Jordan Mason via trade. That's both good and bad news for Jones. The good news is he'll be more efficient with his touches. The bad news is Mason profiles for the majority of goal-line looks and the 4-minute drill when they've established a lead. Facing the Bears on the road makes this a neutral situation; 1.5-point favorites on an average 22.5 point total. 24. J.K. Dobbins The Broncos project for the 5th-most points of the week (25.0) and are 7.5-point home favorites. This is RB game script, and Dobbins might be the more trusted rusher to close the game out. RJ Harvey is a real threat on early downs and in the manufactured reception department, but he is working through a scheme change, vision issues, and pass protection right now. Dobbins is also heavier (212 vs. 205 pounds), so he gets the nod at the goal line early in the year most likely. I'm leaning into the veteran early until we gather more information. 25. Jaylen Warren Mike Tomlin on Jaylen Warren this Tuesday, \" His progress has been very evident and he's to be congratulated ... Certainly he'll be our featured runner. Certainly you'll see [Kaleb Johnson/Kenneth Gainwell], but at what time and at what degree [will depend week-to-week]. \" That said, Warren has never passed 15 carries in a game and has been in a committee for years. He signed a two-year contract extension through 2027 to be a legit committee member. Warren is expected to at least handle the passing downs, with Kaleb Johnson profiling as an outside zone rusher who has more size in short-yardage situations. Through the preseason, Warren has been ahead of Johnson in drills and 1st-team snaps. He deserves a higher ranking than the 3rd-round rookie until proven otherwise. The question is if it's too much of an even split to overcome the lackluster play and point projections from Pittsburgh. The Steelers project for the 7th-fewest points of the week (20.75). 26. D'Andre Swift As of last Monday, the Bears were without Travis Homer (IR), Roschon Johnson, and 7th-round rookie Kyle Monangai due to injury. We'll learn more about their statuses on Thursday, as the Bears don't play until Monday Night Football against the Vikings. This assumes both are available to steal short-yardage situations because the Bears didn't add a back after 53-man roster cutdowns. In Swift's last 10 games with OC Ben Johnson on the Lions, he averaged 10.8 half PPR points on 37% snaps, while the offense scored 28.0 points per game. The Bears only project for 21.0 points this week, but it's hard to see him playing that few of snaps given the depth on the roster. The Vikings were 8th-best against fantasy RBs last year and added DT Jonathan Allen this offseason. 27. Travis Etienne This is an eruption spot if he can get the volume. The Jaguars project for the 5th-most points of the week (25.0) as 3-point home favorites to the Panthers, who easily were the worst rushing EPA defense and fantasy RB defense last year. It won't be as bad this year after adding multiple starters up front, but Carolina allowed 28.0 half PPR points to RBs last year. The second worst defense was at 24.2. Huge gap. 28. Rhamondre Stevenson It's Week 1 with a rookie competing for touches, and the Patriots are 2.5-point home favorites. If not now, then when? The Raiders lost DT Christian Wilkins, S Trevon Moehrig, LB Robert Spillane, SCB Nate Hobbs, and LB Divine Deablo this offseason. It's one of the worst front sevens in the NFL. 29. David Montgomery The Lions project for the 17th-most points of the week (22.5), which is 10 points fewer than they averaged last year (33.0). In 12 games as a Lion when they scored fewer than 30 points, Montgomery has averaged 12.9 half PPR points per game, but we should expect Jahmyr Gibbs to continue eating into his work as he enters the prime of his career. 30. Tyrone Tracy The Giants project for the 4th-fewest points of the week (19.75), and it's unclear if he's trusted near the goal-line with Devin Singletary and thicccc rookie Cam Skattebo available to vulture. Tracy should be the starter and touch favorite, but it's unclear if he'll be more of a trap back who cedes valuable touches in a committee. 31. RJ Harvey The Broncos project for the 5th-most points of the week (25.0) and are 7.5-point home favorites. This is RB game script, and Dobbins might be the more trusted rusher to close the game out. RJ Harvey is a real threat on early downs and in the manufactured reception department, but he is working through a scheme change, vision issues, and pass protection right now. Dobbins is also heavier (212 vs. 205 pounds), so he gets the nod at the goal line early in the year most likely. I'm leaning into the veteran early until we gather more information. 32. Austin Ekeler The Commanders project for the 4th-most points of the week (25.75) and are 6-point favorites vs. the Giants. Ekeler only averaged 2.3 receptions in 7 wins last year, so game script ironically works against him unless he's given 4-minute drill touches without Brian Robinson Jr. available. Expect those grinder touches to be split between Ekeler, Chris Rodriguez, and Bill Croskey-Merritt. It's not a great situation until we get clarity. 33. Javonte Williams The Cowboys project for the 5th-fewest points of the week (20.0) in Philly. The Eagles were 2nd in rushing EPA allowed from Week 10 last year and allowed the fewest points to RBs across the entire season. It's a terrible matchup. 34. Nick Chubb The Texans list Chubb as the starter, but he'll be part of a committee approach most likely. There are two receiving options for pure passing downs, plus scheme-fit Dameon Pierce. Before a minor injury for Pierce, he was actually pushing Chubb as the starter. Behind a bad offensive line, Chubb can't afford to lose many early-down snaps to Pierce. This brand new OL, including 2nd-round LT Aireontae Ersery, will be facing off against bully DE Jared Verse on the road. Houston is 6th-lowest in projected points this week (20.5). 35. Dylan Sampson In the Preseason Week 3 dress rehearsal, Sampson started and played on 3rd-and-longs ahead of Jerome Ford. That's rare for a 4th-round rookie and points to his underrated projection while Quinshon Judkins is sidelined. 36. Jordan Mason 37. Tank Bigsby This is an eruption spot if he can get the volume. The Jaguars project for the 5th-most points of the week (25.0) as 3-point home favorites to the Panthers, who easily were the worst rushing EPA defense and fantasy RB defense last year. It won't be as bad this year after adding multiple starters up front, but Carolina allowed 28.0 half PPR points to RBs last year. The second worst defense was at 24.2. Huge gap. 38. Jerome Ford He played behind rookie Dylan Sampson in the final preseason game, which doesn't happen often versus a veteran incumbent. Ford was replaced twice in the past draft, too, so they're clearly trying to move on from him. 39. Zach Charbonnet 40. Braelon Allen 41. Cam Skattebo 42. Rachaad White 43. Kaleb Johnson 44. Ollie Gordon II 45. Jacory Croskey-Merritt",

      "content_preview": "You don't like my rankings?  Fine man. But you know what? Like, go blame the actual players, dude.  I don't think you really cared anyway.  Whatever, it’s not my fault.Andc’mon it’s not that big a deal.  What,you think you can do better?Sorry guys, that was just practice being “Defensive” , to get into the theme.  And yes, I’m a dad, so sometimes you get dad jokes....  Alright, Let's go--WELCOME TO STREAMING DEFENSES IN 2025!!!!!!!!!!!!Most of you have just finished your drafts—congratulations!  You’re finally feeling the pride of your picks, and you've emerged with a clear head to think of your next roster updates.  So let’s take advantage of that post-strut clarity.D/STs today, and then Kickers soon.Streaming D/STs is one of the fun parts of the season.Except in 2022.  I never want to live that again.Basically we all get the chance to play a \"mini-DFS\" each week.  It's your weekly chance for strategic planning, to take a calculated gamble that might significantly boost our advantage over opponent.What's not to love?Recap 2024Every season I think \"this season is going to be the best\":  In 2024 I was right!  Those of us who were streaming were gifted with the most predictable year-- It was the highest accuracy for D/STs that I have seen over a 15 year period (11 shown below).  (Accuracy report was here.)Last season 2024 was overall great for streaming, after some worse years.  I know because I measure predictivity.  The week 17 Colts tragedy was the main blemish to that season, but let's put it in perspective: It was a reminder of the \"normal\" randomness of any other season, after we had 16 weeks to forget the busts of the past!Quick Introduction-- What am I even doing here?If you still don't know me, then... well, then actually you know what’s weird? Maybe you were in grade school when I started doing this, 8 years ago.So 7 years now already passed… Wow guys-- that’s gotta be a record for a Redditor obsessed with posting about D/STs or Kickers!I use predictive stats to test fantasy trends and understand them.Idescribemy machine learning, methods, and models. I share analytical studies. I track top sources, and I share my accuracy results (2024 summary here).My overall aim, all these years, is to add insights and encourage discussions, which might question our assumptions so we make better choices.I'm especially focused on how you can best strategize for the streaming positions. If you need bedtime reading:You can catch up with every post I’ve ever made, here.As more recent examples, I’ve written analyses ofdrafting for upsideandde-risking for downside.When it comes to my projection models, what separates them is how they’re developed scientifically, including testing by cross-validation.That’s all I’ll say, for today, I don't want to get technical....  I guess the main point is that I stand in contrast to hodge podge methods, where some rankers make “coefficient cocktails”— combining stats they happen to like.  Like “Let me mix a bit of sacks rate, with a dash of passing efficiency… and BAM! My newly invented QBSTAT2000!”I don’t build models from my personal biases.I run hundreds of little “studies”, so the computer tests what data are “actually predictive”.  Maybe only a dozen parameters remain, but they span everything from pace of game, turnovers, weather, byes, Mondays, consecutive road games, turf—you name it!  But they're only included if they pass all the tests.https://preview.redd.it/defensive-maneuvers-2025-welcome-to-week-1-v0-phz23h1oqqmf1.jpgStreaming D/STsBut what is “streaming”, you ask?If you're asking, it also tells me maybe you really WERE in grade school, when I started out!\"Streaming\" means not feeling stuck to the same D/ST all season.You’re open to flipping them, maybe even weekly, to find a better prospect. Add/drop. You separate, like the S in theD.E.N.N.I.S.system, and you similarly exploit the circumstances-- much easier if you have plenty of options.Here are the key points:Usually don’t expect to hold the same D/ST all season.Unless you’re in a 16-team league or people have a hoarding habit with D/STs.D/ST is the fantasy position that makes it easiest to exploit matchups, because it’s easier to predict opposing offenses than to predict defensive prowess.Now after the draft, you should pick a D/ST that can start you off well for week 1.You'll probably count on getting a different D/ST next time, for week 2.D/ST Picks for Week 1Luckily, a number of you Redditors also appreciate the comfort of making decisions based on solidly tested, data-driven models.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have anything to share.  We'd have nothing to talk about.  Here’s the current list of top choices for week 1.  Don’t  overthink “ranks”, because there’s so much uncertainty now, so it makes sense to consider just 2 tiers:[EDIT: Updated 30 minutes after posting-- now based on actual Vegas lines and not my own score models.  It's the \"last\" thing I need to do when switching to the new season.  All good now!]Tier 1: Broncos, Commanders, 49ers, CardinalsTier 2: Steelers, Jets,  Rams, Bengals, Jaguars, EaglesTier 3: If the above all taken? Chiefs, Vikings, or Patriots.FYI, today I’m not differentiating between the two different D/ST scoring setting (ESPN settings vs. Yahoo etc.).Beyond RankingsIs that it?No way, man!  The whole point of what I do is to look deeper!I know that many people think of \"Subvertadown\" as turning data into “rankings”, especially for D/STs and Kickers.  But I’m firmly stuck on the idea thatmy analysisreallyadds the value when it helpsinterpretthe projections.My posts this year are going to reflect that idea more.The point is, you shouldn’t just blindly grab the top-ranked D/ST.  There’s more to consider what’s right for you.  And besides, a lot of teams are gonna be projected just mere decimals away from each other.  You want to feel better about your decision, so you should consider these additional insights.Here are examples of insights I'll be grabbing from, in future Reddit posts:1. Future week forecasts.If you look atmy front webpage now(as a non-subscriber) you’ll see an example of what the 17-week forecast charts look like.  A lot of the fun of streaming is trying to plan weeks ahead!  Maybe you can avoid a fight on waivers for D/ST, and instead just focus on the week 1 breakout?Look at the forecast of scores in future weeks. You can clearly see that Commanders are a good option for week 1, but not week 2.  If you want to hold a team for more than 1 week, it’s gotta be the Broncos instead.  Good for at least 3 weeks.2. Ranges of outcomes.Do I have to remind you how random it gets in fantasy?  That was a stupid question; Yes, of course I need to remind everyone.  I have to remind myself, too.  Everyone forgets, before week 1.Example in 2024: Last year, most of the top expert D/ST rankers had Bengals as the #1 option in week 1.  Result? You probably got2points from their D/ST, to start week 1. These busts are totally normal, in fantasy football!So let’s look at the tool I built to display therange of possible outcomes, to feed into your decision process.  You can also find these exampleson my front page:The way this works is just so cool to me.  The algorithm searches past 10 years of NFL games and picks out say 50 games that are “most similar”.  What makes a game similar?  The Vegas lines should be close.  The QBs should be similar.  The weather, the fantasy point prediction itself.  Then, I take those closest games and find their actual D/ST outcomes.  This is a great way to visualize the boom/bust potential of your pick.3. Pros and ConsWhenever you see little \"up-down arrows\" on my webpage, it's there to tell you “What are the pros-and-cons that drive this D/ST ranking?”Think of it like “running the model working in reverse”.  We take the projected Fantasy points, and it spits out which inputs were most key for that specific team.The point is: your thought process might sway you to end up with a different D/ST than you expected.4. Fantasy Score ConstituentsI hope you’ll love this—I’m announcing a new feature we just released!  More on this, later.These bar charts tell you “how the D/ST is expected to earn its fantasy points”.  You should know, you’re not looking at mere “averages”.  It’s not just showing the historical “Fumble Recovery” rate.  It’s running a separate, dedicated predictive model for FRs, based on a number of inputs.ReflectionI hope this is the kind of stuff you're interested in, but totally okay if you're not.  Maybe I should also mention-- and it's gonna sound weird-- but I'm feeling a little \"bored of rankings\".  Don't get me wrong-- this off-season I optimized the heck out of those models-- with upgrades I've wanted for years! The models might actually be in \"final form\" boss mode. So I do care about this a lot.It's just that, after years of observing the discussion, I think some people might be missing the interesting bits, beyond just \"who's at the top\".  Honestly, showing projections feels like a low-effort way to share.  And plain rankings always seem to inspire knee-jerk reaction in the comments-- rather than useful perspectives in the discussion.  Let's see how it goes-- I'll be gauging all your interest to see how much effort I put in.Future “Defensive Maneuvers” Posts :This year, I’m moving back to the Reddit posts as the main free source.  Every couple years, there’s a shuffle in how I share information.  As described above, it won’t always be “rankings”, but sometimes it might. Whatever it is, you’ll find useful insights to help your decisions every week.  My aim will be to post Tuesdays.  (But I will also adjust how much I do, depending how much attention it gets.)The Pick6x6 game is back for a 3rd year!The game is simple to play:You guess the fantasy scores for 6 listed teams.No subscription needed! (Just registered and logged in.)  Prior year winners got a free website subscription-- I think we should do it again, no?Crowd-sourced D/ST projections. Your \"votes\" become an aggregate opinion, for the 6 most top-ranked D/STs each week.  Soon (after enough votes) you will see a table on the webpage, which live updates according to community votes.We got this! Let’s do it!Let's make 2025 an awesome year. I can't wait to share throughout the season. Extra bonus if we can console each other too./Subvertadown(All the above examples are visible right onsubvertadown.com)",

      "content_preview": "My time this offseason has been mostly spent researching players and helping people prepare for their drafts. Building a solid squad on draft day is only one part of thechampionship-winning equation, and I've had seasons where I've had to dig myself out of a hole early on by trading or working the waiver wire hardIn the first two parts of this series, I outlined my favoritehigh-upside players in the mid-to-late roundsand why I favored theHero WR Strategyin PPR Leagues(Full Content Hub Here)This next installment begins by identifying trends that have been common for players on playoff and championship-winning teams over the last two years.Two things stood out to me when analyzing the last two seasons:Many of these players had an \"outlierishly\" slow start (relative to their second half of the season production and talent level), while others saw a massive production bump after their Bye WeekMost saw some overlap between the twoBy examining the situations and factors that led to the above two trends, can we confirm some similarities between these players?Will there be markers or identifiers we can use to predict similar cases in 2025?Thanks to Ron Setwart on X, we already know that there is a common trend among rookie WRs that fits in line with this exercise:Since 2010, 21 rookie WRs have posted 16.0+ FPG from Week 9 onwardWe saw this fit alongside the two above trends withBrian Thomas Jr.andLadd McConkeyin2024We also saw it fit withJayden Reed,Tank Dell, andRashee Ricein2023TLDRBased on two overlapping trends(slow start + post bye week production bump)that we've seen among championship-winning players over the last two years, I believe we can identify similar cases/players to target in trades, hold, or keep an eye on throughout the 2025 seasonhttps://preview.redd.it/the-art-of-building-a-championship-winning-team-identifying-v0-fnn1r0p2l6nf1.pnghttps://preview.redd.it/the-art-of-building-a-championship-winning-team-identifying-v0-vkadckh3l6nf1.pngSlow Start & Post-Bye Production Bump Players (2024 Championship Winners)-[Rookie] Bucky Irving(\"Slow\" Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)- #4 player on championship rosters at 19.3% -- #48 player on playoff rosters at 45.5% -Bucky Irvingwas drafted in the 4th round in 2024 (125th overall) as an explosive RB who had early opportunities to outshine the Buccaneers' inefficient incumbent RB1(Rachaad White)Bucky inspired confidence very early on that he would eventually earn a larger role in this Buccaneers offenseIn Weeks 1-5:5.61 YPC, 9.1% Explosive Run Rate, 0.25 MTF/Att, 2.95 YACO/Att, and only8.5 FPGNot only was he displaying top-tier rushing metrics across the board, but he was passing the eye test with flying colorsWe then saw Bucky's snap share increase from 36.3% in Weeks 1-5 to 44.9% inWeeks 6-10(14.9 FPG), and eventually to 50.7% inWeeks 12-18after his Bye Week(18.3 FPG)It may have been tough to pry Bucky away from owners in those first five weeks, but he was certainly undervalued compared to his potential fantasy ceilingSo, we are looking for an explosive RB with a solid draft profile and who is on a team with a less-than-talented lead back (preferably with a solid OL as well)Comparable 2025 Players: TreVeyon Henderson | RJ Harvey | Bhayshul TutenTreVeyon Hendersonhas seen a massive jump in cost over the last two weeks, and there is the consensus belief that he will unquestionably be better thanRhamondre Stevensonright awayI think Henderson is very likely to outplay Stevenson, but I don't know if he'll have the clear \"lead back\" role early on, and may sit around a sub 60% share over the first several weeksIf that's the case, where we see Henderson receive only 10-15 touches a game early on, but he's outplaying Stevenson handily, I may be willing to pay the price to acquire him before he earns a much larger roleRJ Harveyis in a similar situation, butJK Dobbinsshowed some decent explosive play ability last season with the Chargers and may be the \"lead back\" to start the year in DenverHarvey also wasn't a great pass-blocker in college, nor was he used as a receiver out of the backfield very often (this is something that we hope Sean Payton can \"coach him up\" on)He was extremely explosive and effective on all types of runs and against all defensive fronts, and now has one of the best O-lines in the leagueI can see him in a more minimal role than drafters expected early on (45-55% snap share), but if he looks better than Dobbins or is used more as a receiver out of the backfield, I would look to acquire himBhayshul Tutenhas a much steeper climb to the RB1 role in his respective offense, but faces competition in the form of an inefficient rusher(Travis Etienne Jr.), and an RB with little prowess as a receiver out of the backfield + ball security issues(Tank Bigsby)He had a boom or bust rushing style in college, but was highly explosive and shifty, and could offer the best of both worlds as a pure rusher and receiver out of the backfield-Josh Jacobs(\"Slow\" Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)- #22 player on championship rosters at 15.5% -- #19 player on playoff rosters at 54.4% -Many were fadingJosh Jacobslast season because of the historical lack of success that older RBs moving to new teams typically see, but Green Bay was situational better for Jacobs in every way (compared to Vegas)Jacobs was only one year removed from an RB3 overall finish in 2022, and it was clear that his disappointing 2023 performance fell on the Raiders offense more than Jacobs himselfJacobs still started the 2024 season out a little \"slow\", recording the following inWeeks 1-7:17.1 Rush Attempts/G, 4.50 YPC,1 TD, 48.3% Zone Concept Success Rate, 49.2% Man/Gap Concept Success Rate,13.2 FPG, & 13.7 XFP/GJacobs was hardly utilized in the red zone in this span, seeing only 1.3 Rush Attempts/G inside the 10-yard line (11.1% TD Rate)It was a groin injury toJordan Lovein Week 8 that would cause the Packers offense to shift to a run-heavy scheme over the remainder of the season (35.8 Pass Attempts/G for Love to 24.2 Pass Attempts/G)FromWeek 8 onward, Jacobs would record the following: 18.1 Rush Attempts/G, 4.36 YPC,14 TD, 47.4% Zone Concept Success Rate, 61.9% Man/Gap Concept Success Rate,20.3 FPG, & 17.0 XFP/GHe would average 3.1 Rush Attempts Per Game inside the 10-yard line in that span (41.9% TD rate)So, we are looking for an RB who is likely to be in a bell cow role, but may not see extremely high utilization or success rates in the red zone or goal line early onComparable 2025 Players: Ashton JeantyAlthoughAshton Jeantyis a rookie RB, I think there are some parallels between him andJosh Jacobsin 2024We expect the Raiders to be run-heavy, with Jeanty seeing the majority of the rushing volume (20+ touches), but this is an OL with 3 \"new starters\" compared to the beginning of last seasonI have confidence that Jeanty starts the season out productive right out of the gate, but if we see this offense take a few weeks to mesh with a new HC, OC, OL Coach, and QB, Jeanty could potentially be bought at a slight discount early onHe has absolutely no talent behind him on the depth chart, so his bell cow role should never be at risk-Trey McBride(\"Slow\" Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)- #6 player on championship rosters at 18.7% -- #17 player on playoff rosters at 55.1% -Trey McBridewas a massive draft target for a lot of people in 2024 based on how well he performed the year prior from Week 6 onward (13.8 FPG)He started the 2024 season a little slow in comparison, with just9.4 FPG in his first Four Starts(suffering a concussion in Week 3 and missing Week 4)Were there telltale signs that he was a screaming buy at this point in the season?In that span, he recorded 7.5 Targets/G, a 25.9% Target Share, and12.2 XFP/GOne of the things I always look for when drafting or targeting a TE in a trade is whether or not they can finish top-2 in targets on their respective teamMcBride was already outpacing MHJ in Target Share during those lackluster first four startsWere there telltale signs that McBride would explode after his bye week with19.1 FPG in Weeks 12-18?The following metrics went up measurably fromWeeks 1-5toWeeks 6-10: Route Share (77.6% - 89.3%), YPRR (1.68 - 2.81), and 1D/RR (0.058 - 0.157)So, we are looking for a TE that showed he could command a large target share based on what we've seen from him in a previous season and become the focal point of his offenseComparable 2025 Players: Evan EngramWith the deep threats that the Broncos have at their disposal(Sutton, Mims, & Franklin), the middle of the field could see lighter defensive coverages, allowingEvan Engramto excel in that sub-10-yard aDOT slot receiving role over the middle of the fieldI think there is a real opportunity for Engram to become a focal point of the passing attack, and easily finish the season top-2 in targets on this teamEngram struggled with injuries all last season, but is only one season removed from a TE2 finish(13.5 FPG), where he commanded 143 Targets(2023 with the Jaguars)He'll be in a new offense, but one with a talented QB(Bo Nix), fantastic HC(Sean Payton), a top-tier OL, and minimal competition to his type of receiving role (slot)-Bijan Robinson (\"Slow\" Start)- #7 player on championship rosters at 18.6% -- #22 player on playoff rosters at 53.4% -Nobody hated Arthur Smith more thanBijan Robinson'sowners during his 2023 rookie season (some even called him a fantasy football terrorist)Despite being taken 8th overall, Bijan was criminally underutilized, averaging only 12.6 Rush Attempts/G, finishing the season with14.7 FPG in 2023One of the reasons that Bijan's draft stock rose so much in the 2024 offseason was because the Falcons hired a new HC (Raheem Morris) and OC (Zac Robinson)Morris stated that their goal was \"to get Bijan the ball as much as they could and in as many ideal situations as possible\"So, why did Bijan get off to a lackluster start in thefirst 5 Weeksof the 2024 season?(14.2 FPG)The two main culprits are his lack of scoring (1 TD) and Rush Attempts/G (13.4)The former was due to his only getting 3 Rush Attempts inside the 10-yard line, resulting in -3 yardsThe Falcons also leaned heavily toward Zone Rushing Concepts (82.1%), where Bijan was mediocre (4.51 YPC & 52.7% Success Rate), while he was also ranked dead last in Man/Gap Efficiency (on only 11 Rush Attempts on those Concepts)We finally saw paydirt with Bijan inWeek 6against the very lowly Panthers defense (sometimes that is what it takes), and he would go on toaverage 22.8 FPGover the remainder of the seasonHe scored 14 TDs in that 12-game span, largely thanks to his newfound success rate inside the 10-yard line (31 Rush Attempts for 11 TDs)He also ranked 1st in Zone Rushing Concept Success Rate and 2nd in Man/Gap Concept Success Rate during this spanSo, we are looking at a 2nd-year RB who was incredibly impressive in his rookie season, is expected to see a larger role, and may have some OL/Scheme issues to deal with in the first few weeksComparable 2025 Players: Bucky IrvingThis is a very comparable situation to whatBucky Irvingfaces this season. Bucky was one of the most impressive and efficient RBs in the league as a rookie in 2024, and was clearly deserving of a high-volume lead back roleHe now has a new OC(Josh Grizzard)and will be without one of the best linemen in the league for the first several weeks(Tristan Wirfs)I could see a world where the Bucaneers' offense sees some regression in the first few weeks compared to their impressive 2024 season, with Bucky possibly only putting up solid RB2 numbersIf that is the case, as soon as we hear Wirfs andChris Godwinare near returning, I am buying Bucky anywhere I can-[Rookie] Brian Thomas Jr.( Post-Bye Production Increase)- #9 player on championship rosters at 18.0% -Brian Thomas Jr.was drafted in the 1st round in 2024 (23rd overall) as a big-play alpha receiver with deep threat and explosive play ability (he led the nation in TDs in 2023)I wouldn't say the 2024 Jaguars room was \"wide open\", as BTJ would have to compete for targets withChristian Kirk, Gabe Davis,andEvan Engram, but BTJ's draft profile and capital made him a great value pick regardlessBTJ immediately showed his big-play ability as a deep threat in thefirst 8 Weeks, scoring 5 TDs in that span and15.5 FPGHe hit a slump inWeeks 9-11withTrevor Lawrencegetting injured, who would combine with Mac Jones to average 139.3 Passing YPG and ZERO TDs in that span(BTJ averaged 7.7 FPG)Were there any telltale signs that BTJ was going to explodeafter his Week 12 Byefor22.9 FPGover the remainder of the season?The injuries to Davis, Kirk, and eventually Engram would give BTJ a massive boostWe also saw BTJ's Route Share (77.2% - 91.7 %) and Slot Share (25.7% - 33.3%) increase measurably after his Week 12 ByeIt's impossible to predict injuries, but when the talent is there, a player like BTJ will take advantage of  any additional volumeSo, we are looking for an Alpha X Receiver with high draft capital, in an offense desperately in need of that player type, who can outplay his target competition early onComparable 2025 Players: Tetairoa McMillan | Matthew GoldenTetairoa McMillanis in a slightly better situation at the start of the 2025 season than BTJ was in 2024. McMillan is the clear WR1 with very minimal target competition after the departure ofAdam Thielen, alongsideJalen Cokermoving to IRIf it takes several weeks forBryce Youngand McMillan to develop solid chemistry, he'll remain on my radar as a trade targetMatthew Goldenis in a more comparable situation to BTJ last season, where he faces some decent target competition in a crowded WR room (but with a better QB and coach)One thing I want to note with Golden is thatJayden Reedis dealing with a foot injury that may linger all season, and is at risk of reaggravating it to the point he will need to miss time-Jonnu Smith (Slow Start)-#14 player on championship rosters at 16.8% -Jonnu Smithwas one of the most surprising players to land on that percentage of championship rosters after his first 10 games on a new team last seasonIn Weeks 1-10, Jonnu recorded 18.0 Routes/G, 4.9 Targets/G, 1 TD, 2.14 YPRR, 0.130 1D/RR, a 20.5% Designed Target Rate,8.2 FPG, & 7.8 XFP/GJonnu was seeing a low route share in the first half of the season, but showed signs of high efficiency (High YPRR & 1D/RR)We saw the injuries toTyreek HillandTua Tagovailoacause HCMike McDanielto shift his offensive scheme, as well as the fact that teams were playing two-high safeties much more often against them (16.6% Cover 2 in 2023 vs 22.7% Cover 2 in 2024)This led to a higher need/desire for a reliance on short pass attempts over the middle of the field, utilizing their most efficient chain movers (Jonnu)From Week 11 onward, Jonnu recorded 29.3 Routes/G, 8.1 Targets/G, 7 TDs, 2.29 YPRR, 0.145 1D/RR, a 20.0% Designed Target Rate,18.7 FPG, & 14.8 XFP/GIt was clear, even at times in the first 10 Weeks, that Jonnu was giving them the best chance to move the ball down the field,earning First Downs Per Route Run at the 5th highest rate in the league (among all receivers)Comparable 2025 Players: Jonnu Smith[Insert Spider-Man Meme]History repeats itself and all that, and I would not be shocked ifJonnu Smithrepeats as one of the better waiver wire TE pickups this yearPat Friermuthis no slouch, but OCArthur Smithis notorious for loving Smith, and there is a serious lack of target competition on this Steelers team right now, especially in the slotWithAaron Rodgersat QB, and the likelihood that this offense is more pass-heavy compared to recent years, there should be a serious need for an efficient chain mover who does his damage on a shorter route tree over the middle of the field-[Rookie] Bo Nix(Slow Start)- #41 player on championship rosters at 12.6% -Bo Nixwas the 6th QB taken in 2024 (12th Overall), and it was a mixed bag as far as the community consensus on this selection (he was seen a \"too old\" by many)I don't think he was on many people's fantasy radars to start the season (QB23 ADP), especially with the lack of weapons that Denver had at WRNix was pretty unremarkable as a passer in thefirst 9 Weeks(especially in Weeks 1-4), recording a 33rd-ranked \"Highly Accurate\" Throw Rate in that span (43.9%)Nix recorded the following inWeeks 1-4: 34.5 Pass Attempts/G, 165.0 Passing YPG, 1 Passing TD, a -6.8% Completion Over Expectation Rate, a 67.4% Catchable Throw Rate, 62.5 Passer Rating, &12.4 FPGNix also recorded 5.8 Rush Attempts/G, 27.5 Rushing YPG, and 2 Rushing TDs in that spanHe would fully turn around his passing ability fromWeek 10 onward, recording the 2nd-best \"Highly Accurate\" Throw Rate (59.3%) over that span, and would also be a fantasy-relevant starter from Week 5 onward (thanks largely to his rushing upside)Nix recorded the following fromWeek 5 onward: 37.5 Pass Attempts/G, 239.6 Passing YPG, 28 Passing TDs, a 4.1% Completion Over Expectation Rate, a 77.4% Catchable Throw Rate, 103.2 Passer Rating, &21.5 FPGNix also recorded 5.3 Rush Attempts/G, 24.6 Rushing YPG, and 2 Rushing TDsComparable 2025 Players: JJ McCarthy | Michael Penix Jr.JJ McCarthyis essentially a \"rookie QB\" this season (first-year starter after missing all of 2024 to injury), but he has everything he could need to be successfulHCKevin O'Connellhas been a QB whisperer as of late (he was also the 2024 Coach of the Year), and McCarthy will have top-tier weapons around him, plus the Vikings massively improved their OL this offseasonMcCarthy will be withoutJordan Addisonfor the first 3 games, then has back-to-back international games before his Week 6 ByeIf he starts slow for whatever reason, I could see him having a similar second-half-of-the-season turnaround like Nix did last yearMichael Penixwas impressive in his first three starts last season (regardless of what the stat sheet says). He looked incredibly calm, fluid, and poised in the pocket for a rookie thrust into a starting role at the end of the seasonEach of his three interceptions was faulted to his receiversPenix will be without his blind side right guard (McGary) for the entire season, and may also be without a 100% healthy Darnell Mooney for the first few weeksHe still has one of the more favorable QB schedules in the league (9th-easiest), and if he starts slow, he'll be someone I keep an eye on based on what we saw from him as a starter in 2024-Other Notable 2024 High Performers-Courtland Sutton(Slow Start)Courtland Suttonwas finally able to stay healthy for a full season in2023, looking relatively solid in a dysfunctional Broncos offense led byRussell Wilson, scoring12.1 FPGThe departure ofJerry Jeudyhelped to solidify Sutton's WR1 role heading into 2024, but his outlook was still murky with the Broncos drafting a rookie QB(Bo Nix)Sutton was almost droppable after thefirst 7 Weeks(8.7 FPG), with Nix struggling mightily as a passer in that spanIt's no surprise that a rookie QB took a month or two to adjust to the NFL level, but you needed extreme patience in holding Sutton through this periodSo, what changed for Nix from Week 8 onward?It could have been an adjustment from HCSean Payton, Nix establishing chemistry with his offense, or perhaps it was the lowly Panthers defense (Week 8 matchup), giving players the confidence they desperately needed once againAlongside Nix and the Broncos offense, Sutton had a massive improvement in the second half of the 2024 season, andfrom Week 8 onward, he recorded the following:49.0% Air Yard Share, 8.7 Targets/G, 80.4 Receiving YPG, 2.64 YPRR, 6 TDs, 4 \"Hero Catches\",18.1 FPG, & 17.2 XFP/GSo, we are looking for an Alpha X WR1, who has shown deep-threat big play ability, who has minimal target competition, and has a QB who may start the year a little slowComparable 2025 Players: Calvin RidleySimilarly to Sutton in 2024,Calvin Ridleyhas rookie QBCam Wardtaking over in 2025, and both face some tough matchups at the start of the season (including the #1 defense in the league in Week 1)I've only heard good things about Ward since he was drafted, and I have confidence in him over the course of the seasonIf the Titans struggle early on against some of the tougher defenses in the league, there could be a great buy-low opportunity on RidleyThe bar set by Ridley's last few QBs has been set incredibly low, as he leads the league in Uncatchable Air Yards over the last two years (1,158 Yards)Ward should be an ideal fit for Ridley, as he led the nation in Completions of 20+ Yards and had the 5th-highest PFF Deep Passing grade in 2024There is still a serious lack of target competition for Ridley on the Titans, and I believe that the synergy between Ridley and Ward's play styles should yield favorable fantasy production-Jaxon Smith-Njigba(Slow Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)Nobody hated OCShane Waldronmore thanJaxon Smith-Njigbaowners in 2023 (maybe Bears fans in 2024), and the new OC,Ryan Grubb, wasn't much better for JSN at the start of the 2024 seasonJSN was typecast into this drink and dunk, short aDOT, minimal impact role early on in his career, and would finish with only8.8 FPGin2023His volume was measurably better at the start of the 2024 season compared to 2023, but his utilization and route tree were not, leading to volatility and mid-tier productionJSN inWeeks 1-8:36.6 Routes/G, 7.6 Targets/G, 48.5 Receiving YPG, 1 TD,11.2 FPG, & 14.2 XFP/GIt would take an injury toDK Metcalfand a subsequent breakout game for JSN in Week 9 (37.0 Fantasy Points) for him to start consistently putting up WR1 numbersAfter his Week 10 Bye(Weeks 11-16), JSN would record the following: 32.5 Routes/G, 8.3 Targets/G, 86.8 Receiving YPG, 3 TDs,19.2 FPG, & 14.7 XFP/GHe then fell back down to earth in Weeks 17 & 18 with two disappointing performances in the fantasy playoffs (FML)So, we're looking for a young WR (2nd Year) who wasn't properly utilized in his rookie season, and is likely to start the 2025 season in the WR2 role, but can expand that role as the year goes onComparable 2025 Players: Rome OdunzeRome Odunzeis in a similar situation to what JSN experienced in 2024. Odunze had a disappointing rookie season(8.5 FPG), lacked a connection withCaleb Williams(61.2% catchable target rate), and was second or third fiddle in a dysfunctional Bears offense (largely thanks to the same OC that JSN had,Shane Waldron)Williams was awful as a rookie, but he's not entirely to blame, and there are plenty of reasons to believe that he can improve in his sophomore seasonThe Bears have massively upgraded their OL, added additional offensive weapons, and hired the best OC in the league as their HCI think the target competition Odunze faces is similar to what JSN faced in 2024, and if he can establish a better connection with Williams, he can carve out a larger role and be a viable weekly fantasy starter-[Rookie] Ladd McConkey(Slow Start)Ladd McConkeywas one of my favorite players to select in both Dynasty and Redraft Leagues last season. His draft profile felt like a perfect fit forJustin Herbert, the Chargers offense, and as the heir apparent toKeenan AllenAllen finished top-12 in FPG in all four of his seasons on the Chargers with Herbert at QBSome growing pains are always expected for a Rookie WR, especially on a team with a new HC, OC, and offensive schemeInWeeks 1-7, Ladd recorded 25.0 Routes/G, 6.3 Targets/G, 44.2 Receiving YPG, 2 TDs,10.4 FPG, & 11.2 XFP/GHerbert wasn't particularly pass-heavy or productive in that span either: 30.2 Pass Attempts/G, 194.0 Passing YPG, & 6 Passing TDsWhile his utilization and efficiency metrics did not jump off the page in the first 7 Weeks, his ability to get open at a high level didLadd recorded a 0.134 Average Separation Score (ranked 20th) and 20.8% Route Win Rate (ranked 11th)Herbert, Ladd, and the Chargers' offensive scheme started to mesh a lot better in Week 8 onward, and Ladd began to put up WR1 numbersWeek 8 onward: 30.5 Routes/G, 7.8 Targets/G, 98.8 Receiving YPG, 6 TDS,19.4 FPG, & 13.9 XFP/GSo, we're looking for a talented player, in an offense with a solid QB, that may have new coaching, and can play himself into a larger roleComparable 2025 Players: Travis HunterTravis Hunterhas largely gone undervalued and underprojected because of the uncertainty surrounding his potential Snap Share in the Jaguars offense as a two-way playerAll indications right now are that Hunter is expected to play the majority of snaps on offense, and could see as high as an 80% Snap Share as a WRThis is a player who played 1,483 Snaps last season in college with a 94.4% Offensive Snap Share and 92.8% Defensive Snap ShareHunter recorded the most TDs (16), the highest Separation Rate (93rd percentile), and the fewest Dops (3) of all the first-round rookie WRsWe also sawLiam Coen'soffense produce multiple highly productive fantasy WRs last season(Mike Evans, Chris Godwin,andJalen McMillan)Slow Start/Post-Bye Production Increase (2023 Championship Winners)-I won't go as in-depth on how and why these players bounced back from a slow start, or saw a sizable increase in production after their bye week in 2023, but there are just as many guys who fit this criteria in that seasonCeeDee Lamb(Slow Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)- #1 player on championship rosters at 30.6% -InWeeks 1-6,CeeDee Lambrecorded 31.2 Routes/G, 7.0 Targets/G, 1 TD,14.0 FPG, & 13.7 XFP/GLamb held out of training camp before the 2023 season while negotiating a contract extension, likely contributing to a slower startAfter his Week 7 Bye, Lamb recorded 37.0 Routes/G, 12.5 Targets/G, 11 TDs,28.7 FPG, & 23.8 XFP/GEventual Comparable 2024 Player: Ja'Marr ChaseMuch like Lamb did, Chase held out of training camp while negotiating a contract extension and started the season out slow in the first 2 Weeks(9.8 FPG)He then went on to finish as the Overall WR1 and Triple Crown Winner in 2024Comparable 2025 Player: Justin Jefferson | Tyreek Hill | Terry McLaurinJustin Jeffersonalready has an Overall WR1 finish under his belt, and his situation is comparable to 2023 Lamb simply because of the amount of time Jefferson missed during training camp due to his hamstring injuryTyreek Hillhas multiple Overall WR2 finishes to his name, and one of the few comparisons to him and 2023 Lamb is that Hill missed several weeks in training camp due to an oblique injuryTerry McLaurinis very unlikely to finish as the Overall WR1 based on his usage and the fantasy receiving value thatJayden Danielscan generate, but like 2023 Lamb, McLaurin missed the majority of training camp and may start slow in 2025 as a resultI still think McLaurin is in line for TD regression based on his outlierishly high End Zone Target Conversion Rate last season, but he could still be a great trade target if he starts slow-Kyren Williams(Post-Bye Production Increase)- #3 player on championship rosters at 23.2% -InWeeks 1-5, Kyren recorded 15.4 Rush Attempts/G, 3.87 YPC, 5 TDs,17.9 FPG, & 17.8 XFP/GThis was by no means a \"slow\" start, but there were two games where he scored under 10.0 FPG, and some may not have been fully buying in after he got injured in Week 6After his Week 10 Bye, Kyren recorded 21.8 Rush Attempts/G, 5.25 YPC, 6 TDs,24.3 FPG, & 21.7 XFP/GEventual Comparable 2024 Player: Kyren Williams (again)Many were not sure that a a 2nd-year 5th round pick would have a bell cow role in aSean McVay-led offense after how he ran his backfields in the post-Todd Gurley eraPeople then doubted that Kyren would see that same role in 2024 afterBlake Corumwas drafted, and reports came out that Kyren may return punts (lol)Comparable 2025 Player: Omarion Hampton | Chuba HubbardThere is the narrative thatNajee Harriswill earn an impact role on this Chargers offense, possibly cutting intoOmarion Hampton'svolumeHarris is a solid back on a one-year deal, and is coming off some sort of ambiguous eye injury that has kept him out of the majority of training camp for the last two monthsI would not be surprised if Hampton starts the season with a bell cow role and retains it for the majority of the seasonThere has also been a narrative thatChuba Hubbardis at risk of losing his bell cow role with the addition ofRico Dowdleon a one-year contractHubbard had league-low YPRR metrics last season, leading to the belief that he will no longer have three-down back upside in 2025Hubbard was the best player the Panthers had last season and was largely responsible for four out of five of their wins-Breece Hall(Post-Bye Production Increase)- #8 player on championship rosters at 18.9% -InWeeks 1-4, Hall recorded 8.0 Rush Attempts/G, 2.0 Targets/G, 6.56 YPC, 0 TDs,7.6 FPG, & 7.1 XFP/GAfter his Bye Week 7, Hall recorded 14.3 Rush Attempts/G, 6.6 Targets/G, 3.62 YPC, 7 TDs,19.2 FPG, & 18.2 XFP/GEventual Comparable 2024 Player: Bucky IrvingHall may have been a 2nd year RB coming off an ACL tear, but he still showed high levels of efficiency at the start of the 2023 seasonHe would eventually finish as the RB2 on an abysmal Jets offense, thanks to his high utilization as a receiver out of the backfield (Zach Wilsoncheck downs)Bucky was a rookie in 2024, but showed high levels of efficiency and explosiveness early on before earning a larger backfield role and being a highly rostered player on championship teams at the end of the seasonComparable 2025 Player: De'Von Achane | Alvin KamaraDe'Von Achanewill have a lingering injury (calf), much like Breece Hall did in 2023, but he has almost unparalleled receiving upsideEven if the Dolphins fall flat again this year, or deploy a subpar OL, I think that Achane will continue to be peppered with 6+ targets a gameAlvin Kamarais in a similar situation, in that he always has some sort of lingering injury issue, and is likely to be on one of the worst offenses in the NFLLast season, whenSpencer Rattlerwas at QB, Kamara averaged 7.5 Targets/G-DeVonta Smith (Slow Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)InWeeks 1-9, Smith recorded 36.0 Routes/G, 6.4 Targets/G, 4 TDs,13.3 FPG, & 11.3 XFP/GAfter his Bye Week 10(excluding his injury-struck Weeks 17 & 18), Smith recorded 33.7 Routes/G, 7.8 Targets/G, 3 TDs,17.2 FPG, & 13.9 XFP/GAn injury toDallas Goedertwould allow for Smith to become a slightly larger focal point of the Eagles' offense in those six weeksEventual Comparable 2024 Player: Jauan JenningsJauan Jenningsis the closest player I could find last season to Smith in 2023. Jennings had a massive career game in Week 3 (before his Bye Week), but had some injury issues in the middle of the season, and would have his best stretch of games after Aiyuk was injured and after his Bye Week 9Jennings averaged14.1 FPGand 13.7 XFP/G fromWeek 10 onwardComparable 2025 Player: George Pickens | Jameson WilliamsGeorge Pickensis on a new team (Cowboys) and will no longer be the WR1, which may end up benefiting him in the long runI could see him having a little bit of volatility early on, with high target competition fromCeeDee Lamb, and some moderate target competition fromJake FergusonIf Pickens can avoid any meltdowns and become a reliable red zone target for the Cowboys, he will have great weekly upsideJameson Williamshad his breakout season in 2024, but will continue to face tough target competition fromAmon-Ra St. BrownandSam LaPortain an offense no longer led byBen JohnsonStill, HCDan Campbellhas vocalized that Williams will be even more involved this season, and we may be able to expect thatJared Goffairs it out deep more often-Joe Mixon(Slow Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)- #28 player on championship rosters at 13.3% -InWeeks 1-6, Mixon recorded 16.0 Rush Attempts/G, 3.5 Targets/G, 3.80 YPC, 1 TD,11.5 FPG, & 15.8 XFP/GHe had a 0% TD rate on rush attempts inside the 10-yard line (11 attempts)After his Bye Week 7, Mixon recorded 14.6 Rush Attempts/G, 3.9 Targets/G, 4.15 YPC, 11 TDs,18.0 FPG, & 17.2 XFP/GHe had a 29.6% TD rate on rush attempts inside the 10-yard line (27 attempts)Eventual Comparable 2024 Player: Josh JacobsThe entire Bengals offense suffered at the start of the 2023 season, withJoe Burrowsuffering from a wrist injuryThe Bengals would subsequently lean on Mixon more, and after Burrow went on IR in Week 12, Mixon would see higher success rates near the goal lineJosh Jacobsexperienced something similar in Green Bay in 2024, seeing low utilization and success rates near the goal-line in Weeks 1-7 (before Jordan Love's groin injury)He would go on to score 14 TDs from Week 8 onwardComparable 2025 Player: Tony PollardBased on the Titans' schedule over the first few weeks, and the fact that they have a rookie QB(Cam Ward)leading the team, I could seeTony Pollardstarting a little slow, despite having a bell cow role withTyjae SpearsinjuredIf Pollard still displays some of the improvements in efficiency that he did last season, and the Titans struggle to score early on, I may look to buy low under the belief that better days will be ahead when their schedule lightens up-James Conner(Slow Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)- #15 player on championship rosters at 15.8% -InWeeks 1-13(4 games missed), Conner recorded 14.3 Rush Attempts/G, 2.0 Targets/G, 4.89 YPC, 4 TDs,11.6 FPG, & 12.0 XFP/GAfter his Bye Week 14, Conner recorded 19.8 Rush Attempts/G, 3.3 Targets/G, 5.18 YPC, 5 TDs,24.2 FPG, & 17.0 XFP/GEventual Comparable 2024 Player: Jonathan TaylorJonatahn Taylorwas a talented RB in a run-heavy offense, who struggled with some injuries before his Week 14 Bye (nearly identical situation)Taylor would have that extra week to get healthy, and would then face three of the worst defenses in the league in Weeks 16-18, and win the few people that made it to the fantasy playoffs with him, a championshipComparable 2025 Player: Kenneth WalkerKenneth Walkeris a player who struggled with injuries last season, but is an extremely talented RB who should retain the lead back role throughout the seasonI expect the Seahawks to be more run-heavy than in years past, and they have the 2nd-easiest playoff schedule (Weeks 15-17)-Rookie WRs in 2023-[Rookie] Tank Dell(Slow Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)InWeeks 1-5, Dell recorded 24.8 Routes/G, 5.6 Targets/G, 2 TDs,12.9 FPG, & 10.9 XFP/GAfter his Bye Week 7(excluding his games missed from Week 13 onward). Dell recorded 33.6 Routes/G, 9.4 Targets/G, 5 TDs,20.1 FPG, & 19.0 XFP/G-[Rookie] Jayden Reed(Slow Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)InWeeks 1-5, Reed recorded 22.0 Routes/G, 5.2 Targets/G, 2 TDs,9.6 FPG, & 10.7 XFP/GAfter his Bye Week 6,Reed recorded 22.5 Routes/G, 5.9 Targets/G, 6 TDs,15.4 FPG, & 11.9 XFP/G-[Rookie] Rashee Rice(Slow Start + Post-Bye Production Increase)- #33 player on championship rosters at 12.6% -InWeeks 1-9, Rice recorded 16.1 Routes/G, 4.4 Targets/G, 4 TDs,10.4 FPG, & 8.1 XFP/GAfter his Bye Week 10, Rice recorded 30.4 Routes/G, 8.7 Targets/G, 3 TDs,17.1 FPG, & 14.8 XFP/G-Eventual Comparable 2024 Players: Ladd McConkey | Brian Thomas Jr.Ladd McConkeywould see similar utilization in the first part of the season, but like so many rookie WRs in the last 15 years, would see increased usage in the latter half of the season, and a subsequent uptick in fantasy productionWe still saw flashes of McConkey's talent in the first half of the season, giving us confidence that his workload and production would eventually increaseBrian Thomas Jr.was a different type of WR than the above 2023 rookies, but also had a similar path to increased production in 2024We saw him show incredibly big play ability right away, but it took a few injuries to his WR counterparts, and a post-bye increase in utilization to propel him to WR1 productionComparable 2025 Player: Jayden Higgins | Kyle Williams | Luther Burden IIIJayden Higginsis comparable toTank Dellin that they play for the Texans, and Higgins should have some deep-threat big-play abilitiesHiggins is a comparable WR toNico Collins, so it will be interesting to see what role he plays early on, but he'll have to climb overChristian Kirkon the depth chart in 2WR sets, most likelyWith Kirk currently injured, this may be more obtainable for Higgins nowKyle Williamshas a fairly steep climb up the Patriots depth chart, but outside ofStefon Diggs, there is a lack of experienced talentWilliams is a player that many were excited about this offseason based on his college tape, and should be someone to keep an eye on if he earns an expanded roleLuther Burdenfaces a lot of target competition on the Bears and may not have a solidified or extensive role early onBased on his draft profile and the expectation that he could potentially be the Bears' main slot WR, Burden is someone I would also keep an eye on throughout the season",
