I turn 62 on February first of next year. The customer service person at SS said I could apply 3 months before my birthday, or November of this year.  ChatGPT said it was 4 months before my birthday, and waffled between September and October of this year.  It did mention that, because I was born on the first of February, I was \"officially\" 62 in January 2026 and not February.  If that is really the case, can I apply in October 2025?",

I thought I was easily paying my monthly bills with money left over. This past year I had increases in most of my regular monthly bills such as my Medicare supplement, Spectrum, utilities, etc. as you have all experienced. Today I sat down and totaled all of my monthly bills and found out I only have $92.00 left at the end of the month! Fortunately, I have a job at home at which I earn about $5,000 per year which I use for non-related home expenses.  I’m 79 and I guess I have to keep this job for the rest of my life, for expenses will be sure to increase every year. How are you all getting along regarding expenses vs SS income?",

Our Lawyer is saying no. We have to continue or we will be denied and he will never be able to get benefits. We think our lawyer is being shady and just trying to keep us paying. Anyone know the answer or have dealt with a similar situation? We could really use some help. EDIT: He is applying for SSDI. His disability is childhood autism, and he is 27 years old.

      "content_preview": "The U.S. DOGE Service uploaded a copy of Americans’ social security data to the digital cloud, risking the security of critical personal information for more than 300 million people, a whistleblower in the agency alleged. Chief Data Officer Charles Borges raised concerns that DOGE staffers bypassed safeguards, circumvented a court order and created a copy of the Social Security Administration’s entire collection of data on the U.S. public on the cloud. Borges said the SSA had no oversight of access to the file. Borges did not allege that the cloud had been hacked or compromised but warned that hosting a copy of one of the government’s most sensitive datasets on a cloud without security controls substantially threatened the safety of Americans’ information. The data includes peoples’ names, birth dates and other information that could be used to steal their identities. The cloud is an online storage space via a server or network of servers. Borges’s concerns were first reported by the New York Times. DOGE’s access to Social Security data has been a point of controversy since Elon Musk’s group of young technologists first gained access to the agency, leading to internal clashes, The Washington Post has previously reported . SSA spokesman Nick Perrine said the agency was “not aware of any compromise” to the storage of Americans’ Social Security information. “Commissioner (Frank) Bisignano and the Social Security Administration take all whistleblower complaints seriously,” Perrine said in a statement. “SSA stores all personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information. The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet. High-level career SSA officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by SSA’s Information Security team.” The White House referred The Post to Social Security for comment. The disclosure was sent to the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistleblower complaints, as well as the leadership of several House and Senate committees.

She has a rare genetic brain disorder that has resulted in diagnoses such as autism, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, etc.  She has never had a job.  She will likely never be competent enough to have a job.  She is physically aggressive when overwhelmed, so I have a good paper trail of psychiatric inpatient medical records, police cases, etc. I processed her application and used my own email address as a point of contact.  I got to the receipt at the end that asked me to send in paper documents supporting the case. Here is my question: Is there any way for me to track the status of the application online?  When I login to the ss website using my email, I only see my own status and nothing about my daughter's application.  The re-entry code I was using during the application process stopped working when I completed the application.",

My wife and I have two kids that are both autistic in California. Both of my kids got approved to receive ssi , thanks to that we were also able to quit our jobs and care for them full time as there live in provider through IHSS . Last week we got a letter from the SSA for a redetermination appointment for my kids benefits. Today I was on the phone with the case worker from the SSA and she asked me all kinds of questions of how much I get paid through IHSS and how much money is in my account. I had no problem explaining to her what she asked but I also told her that our income is exempt from the redetermination and shouldn’t affect my kids benefits . The lady proceeded to tell me that the money we get paid through IHSS has to get spent that we can’t save it or have too much money on our accounts. I explained to her how IHSS works and how we get paid that maybe she was getting confused with my kids benefits . She said that we can’t save money that the way we get paid the money also has to be spent for the reason being that we get paid by the federal government. I explained to her again just to make sure I was clear about my pay and how IHSS works , she then proceeded to say that yes our money can’t be in a savings account and can’t be saved because it has to get spent that we can’t have thousands of dollars saved at a time, then she proceeded to say cause we were getting paid by the state now. I’m confused, are we not allowed to save money ? What if I want to save money to buy a house or if I ever need emergency funds ? Can anyone explain a bit better to me cause I’m new to all this , sorry if I ranted too much I just wanted to be transparent and clear and explain better my situation thank you for your help",

I’m unsure if I should: Let the system truncate my legal given name to fit, Split my full given name so the excess spills into the Middle Name field (First name -AAAAAAAAAA, middle name -BBBBBBB (or) First name -AAAAAAAAAA BBBBB, middle name -BB) , Or use an abbreviation (which might not match my legal documents). Based on some research, the Social Security system in the US only allows a maximum of 16 characters per first and last name field in digital records, though up to 26 characters can appear on the SSN card when combining first and middle names on the card’s first line. The staff cannot override this at an in-person appointment. Questions for others who’ve been through this: Did you let the system truncate your given name? Did that cause problems later (with the DMV, employers, IRS, etc.)? Was splitting the given name between first and middle name fields an issue for identity verification? Any advice for keeping your identity consistent in government/official U.S. systems? Is there a way to add an explanation or note about the name truncation, or is it just something you have to live with?

To answer your question, you need to know the month and year you will die. This will determine the exact date when you should claim social security. People need to realize they are playing in Las Vegas against the government. The government thinks it knows when you will die and therefore indicates how much money you can claim based on certain ages. You think you'll live into your '90s? You should claim as late as possible. But if you're diagnosed with lung cancer at age 60, you should claim at age 62. Not financial advice. Just life advice.",

      "content_preview": "I am disabled and was receiving SSI benefits up until a few months ago when my husband was able to return to work. Today, I received a letter dated August 25th, 2025. It says “Second Request” and “Things We Need From You” but the rest of the letter is completely blank. I never received any first letter. I called the number listed in the letter, which is to my local office. What followed was one of the strangest and rudest interactions I’ve ever had. I explained that I received a blank letter and was confused about what I was supposed to do. The man on the phone told me I needed to refer to the letter. When I reiterated that the letter was blank under \"things we need,\" he proceeded to tell me \"You are an adult, figure it out.\" I was left speechless for a second. When I pressed further, asking how I was supposed to figure it out, he said: *\"*I mean its fine, you can just go to jail then\" at this point, I legit thought I had gotten a scammer or the letter was fake. I asked his name and when he hung up on me, I automatically assumed this HAD to be a fake letter. So I called my local office again, got the same guy and asked to speak to someone else, and was told: “I am the supervisor here, there’s no one above me.” After going back and forth again, he hung up a second time. The letter is legit and the number IS our local field office so I am incredibly baffled and confused. . I don’t know how I’m supposed to proceed Has anyone had an interaction like this? Should I just call back on a different day and hope to get someone else?",

My parents don’t speak English, don’t understand technology, spend most of their time in their home country, and heavily rely on myself and my brothers to figure this stuff out for them. I’m not financially exploiting my dad lol. Plus you have to admit this is a lot of trouble to go through just because the country we were born in doesn’t exist anymore. I helped my dad apply for his social security retirement income a few weeks ago and we just received a notice in the mail that he something was incorrect on the application and so they are requesting he brings all his legal documents into a social security office before September 18th otherwise the application will be denied. The only thing that I can think could be incorrect is the place of birth, as the country he was born in doesn’t exist anymore (Yugoslavia) so we put Croatia on the application since thats where his birth place is currently located. We did the same for my moms application last year and had no problem. My dad is currently in Europe and won’t be able to return in time for the September 18th deadline, it would be really difficult to get him here because hes dealing with some health issues that affect his mobility. Does anyone know of another way that we can solve this issue? The closest social security office to him is located in Greece and its hard to get an appointment there. I tried to call this week but wasn’t able to get through to anyone. When they requested more documents when my mom applied we were able to mail them, did they get more strict in the last year to where mailing or faxing documents over isn’t allowed? If it’s denied and the deadline passes, can we just redo the application?",

My application was recently approved for survivior benifits for my son, and there will be two months of backpay. But we cant use that? If I'm reading/understanding correctly? It has to go into a different account? With school just starting, and my son's fee's and specialized school needs (vocational school for welding), it would be great if I could use a little of the backpay to help mitigate the financial bill crunch. I'm also reading that there will have to be annual reports, but then that because I'm the natural mother there won't be annual reports? Also, once my son turns 18, any money saved will have to go back to SS, just to be re-given to him? I've read the booklet and it seems to leave me more confused on what we can and can't do. If anyone can explain this to me like I'm 5, I'd appreciate it, so much. It's been a heck of a past couple of years, we lost everything when I left his father (very bad situation) and we're having to rebuild 15 years or our lives. His father died from an OD in June and he took everything from our son (his savings, any valuables, etc), and being a single mother has been hard.

In the event of my passing, how is his SS payment calculated?  Based on his age (64) when he started his benefit?  Based on my age when I start my benefits? I understand he gets his amount, plus a portion of mine.  I’m just trying to determine if delaying my benefit will further raise his benefit, in the event of my death.  This may influence my decision regarding when to start drawing my benefits.  No input is needed regarding my benefit while I’m living, I understand how age impacts my draw.  I just don’t know if my choice will impact the amount he draws.",

      "content_preview": "I was approved for SSDI a few months ago. I think it was mainly because of a severe 2-year manic psychotic episode that landed me in jail and then in a state mental hospital, since that’s what the judge seemed to emphasize the most in my fully favorable decision letter. My award letter says I’ll have a CDR in 18 months. I still deal with issues that my therapist and provider consider serious, but I have such bad luck that I worry SSA won’t see them that way and might cut me off. Without these benefits, I’d be in serious trouble. The most crippling symptoms I deal with now are a wide spectrum of catatonia, including: Stupor - being stuck, paralyzed, unable to move my body Negativism – involuntary mental resistance to doing things like sitting down or holding objects like dishes, papers, my phone or purse. Catalepsy – my right hand gets stuck on my neck almost every time I go out, and I can’t move it away. It’s so upsetting and frustrating. I also struggle with anhedonia and apathy – I can’t feel motivated or enjoy things I used to. Even simple tasks feel mentally exhausting, like climbing Mount Everest. I’m stuck in bed most of the time, I struggle to take care of basic needs, and when I force myself to act, my catatonia symptoms often flare up. I just can’t function like a normal human being. I’m so sick of it all — I wish I never had this illness. I don’t like that my life depends on the government system to survive. This is not the future I wanted.",

Those limits have never been adjusted for inflation — not once in over 40 years. That means what was once meant to affect only higher-income recipients now hits millions of disabled Americans living on fixed incomes. In today’s economy, people are being taxed on benefits that were never meant to be taxed at their income level. This outdated policy is putting unnecessary strain on SSDI recipients and their families, many of whom already struggle to afford housing, food, and medical care. I’ve started a petition calling for Congress to update SSDI tax thresholds to reflect today’s cost of living. https://chng.it/ZC5qvmpnB7",

Wife is 68, plans to retire at 70 then claim her SS benefits. The Seminar implied I could apply for Spouse benefits NOW and get 50% of spouse Full Retirement benefits. For the next 5 years. Then when she turns 70 and applies she gets her Full Retirement amount + 24% for waiting 3 years. Then when I turn 70 - I CHANGE and stop spouse benefits and get my benefits + 24% for waiting 3 years. Does applying for Spouse benefits hurt/cause problems for either of us when we apply for our individual benefits at 70?

My dilemma is that our calculated combined income, using **50% of the total of my yearly payments, plus her yearly AGI** puts us in the bracket where 85% of my SS income should be taxable. I'm pretty sure about that; our combined income for this year will be about $56,000 using the IRS calculator. So I fill in all the lines, and at the end of it all it tells me that we are \"already having too much tax withheld and can expect a refund of $359 this year\" when we do our taxes. Sorry if that's confusing, it was typed with a spinning head. I find it hard to believe this calculator is accurate. Will my local SS office help me do this over the phone, or do I need to ask a tax consultant or something? Our situation isn't really complicated, but trying to figure THIS stuff out certainly is!",

      "content_preview": "I’m 53 now and plan to retire at 58. I plan to start collecting social security at 62, the reason being so that I can avoid pulling that amount from my IRA and allow my investments to continue to grow and compound. When I run the numbers this way, it seems like there really is no difference between starting at 62, 65, 67 or 70. The compound growth from my investments makes up for the reduced benefit by starting SS earlier. And so given there is no difference, all that matters is how long I might live, and if I die early I’ll benefit by starting SS at 62. If I live to 100, I expect my investments to have grown to a level where my heirs receive a large sum. Am I thinking about this right?",

      "content_preview": "I’m asking this on my half brothers behalf. When he was 13 his dad died. My mom began receiving social security payments on my brothers behalf that were set to be finished when he turned 18. It totaled about $20k. Two years later my mom died, and there was still $15k to be paid out. My dad became my brothers legal guardian, and thus started receiving the money. He told my brother he would save it all and give it to him when he turned 18. When he turned 18 he gave him $5k and said that he put the rest of it in a trust that would be accessible when he turned 30, unless my dad felt he had made good decisions in life, at which point he would give some or all of it in 5 years time. It has been 4 years, and my brothers car is completely crapping out. He needs his money back to put a down payment on a new car. He approached my dad for the money, who just admitted that he doesn’t have the money anymore, but would pay him back when he does. However he prefaced it with “to be clear it was never YOUR money, but I will pay you from my money when I have it”. My question is this: is my dad right in saying that the money was never my brothers, and that he isn’t entitled to it? We are debating whether this should be brought to small claims, but before we do something drastic, we want to know where we stand. Is the money my dads by virtue of being my brothers guardian? Or is my brother inherently entitled to any leftover money that wasn’t used to take care of him? Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.",

I recently submitted the online application for SS retirement benefits and received a confirmation of my application.  I have a child who is under 18.  If I understand correctly, my child will be entitled to dependent benefits until HS graduation (which should be just after turning 18). Do I need to make a separate application for dependent benefits for my child?  If so, how do I go about doing this?  When I did my application for my own SS benefit, the form asked if I had any dependents under 18 but didn't make clear whether the application for the dependent benefit would be automatic or not. For what it's worth, I'm currently overseas, but I get back to the US a couple of times each year, so I can do an in person appointment if it is necessary. Thanks for your help on this!  I could try calling SSA, but spending a lot of time on hold with a questionable overseas connection is something I'd like to avoid if I can.",
