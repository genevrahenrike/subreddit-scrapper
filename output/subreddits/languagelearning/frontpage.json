      "content_preview": "Alright, hear me out. I know this subreddit is always hearing questions about learning because duh.For context, my learning process is greatly helped when I know why I’m learning what I’m learning at the stage that I am at. With language learning though, I struggle to “understand” how I may learn how to form sentences and so on when I am learning words.I mean, I understand that I need to learn pronouns, prepositions, verbs, nouns, to string a sentence like “she and I are building this table”, but whenever I’m learning verbs and pronouns, my brain just keeps telling me to “learn how to learn” first, which I know is counterintuitive. I understand this may be helped if I get a tutor but I’ve no current means to do that now so I’m relying on self-study.I really want to get out of this helpless mindset as I know it’s hindering me from learning. This is also my first time actually learning a language. I already know three natively (Asian here!) but I’ve grown up speaking them so I don’t “know how to learn”.Any advice? How did you guys view your learning journey?",

      "content_preview": "Hello everybody! This is my first time posting here, but I have this internal dilemma and I'm curious to get your takes and if you've ever experienced anything similar.For context, I'm an English native living in Japan, fully fluent in Japanese but I've also dabbled in a few languages including Chinese (HSK3) and Swahili. Considering the \"advantage\" I'd have learning a language that is considered more practical and widely spoken in my area like Chinese or Korean, I struggle finding motivation to learn these languages even though I know learning these languages would open huge opportunities in my career and everyday life. On the other hand, I took a short trip to Kenya and Tanzania earlier this year, and spent a few months before that learning Swahili, and managed to have some painfully simple but satisfying conversations with the locals.I know that Swahili would offer few practical benefits in terms of career and availability of speakers, but I genuinely enjoyed learning the language and think it's one of the most beautiful languages I've heard. It's not overly complex or difficult compared to when I first studied Japanese, and it's a really fun process, even though resources are very scarce. In comparison I've studied Chinese and I'm personally not a huge fan of the way it sounds, nor do I have any serious motivations for traveling in China even though I know there's a wealth of opportunities and interesting places to visit. I have a ton of Chinese speaking friends and coworkers, but a grand total of TWO swahili speaking friends who live here.Any of you ever experienced this dilemma? I guess it comes down to enjoyment vs utility and your reasons for learning the language, but I can't help but feel more drawn to a language I'll have very few chances to use in my daily life. Curious what you guys think!",

I previously studied French, which was much easier for me since I could switch between English and French with some ease in my head and find patterns or make up similar sounding words for concepts, helping me actually think in the language much sooner.But Turkish is a different beast. Aside from some loan words that I recognise, the roots for the words are all different from what I'm used to and I'm forgetting words much more quickly than I would like. And of course I still haven't reached the critical mass where I can actually explain myself in Turkish.So does anyone have experience with learning languages that are very different from your native tongue and how to approach them differently to more similar languages?",

Its not even cause some people are more talented.The real killer is doing it solo. No one there to check you. No one to point out mistakes. You end up stuck in the same loop thinking youre making progress but youre really not.When you actually have a tutor or someone giving you feedback it feels different. They fix your bad habits on the spot. They tell you what actually matters instead of wasting time. Progress just moves way faster.Anyone here ever tried a personal tutor. Online or in person. Did it actually help or is that just hype?Feels like this is the hidden hack that nobody really talks about.",

I have ADHD, but I tend to have a nack for learning languages mostly because I enjoy it and put a lot of effort into it (I've studied French, Russian, and German on top of this.).In my first semester with this school I actually was voted by my teacher as best in my class. Whether that was true or not, it goes to show that I put in hard work, spoke up, and tried my best.But this new teacher I have... I get irritated because I feel like she straight up info dumps. She gives us a huge list of vocabulary, then a lesson about verb endings and sentence structure. And usually in a week, she moves on and gives us a whole other massive list of vocab and a whole new group of things to learn. I understand that we need vocab to learn to speak, but I feel like by the time it really starts to sink in we're rushed into someone else as quickly as possible and I don't have enough time to really grasp the materials.But I don't find a purpose in just turning in homework and getting points just to pass if I don't recall the information. I was hoping to take a conversation class but I just can't keep up.Am I tripping unfairly? Does anyone have any ideas on how to handle this?",

      "content_preview": "It's always bothered me that so many language learning YouTubers (not going to name any) have, after learning one or two or half a dozen languages, treat their own method of learning as some sacred tool or The Method To Use. I've watched dozens of \"how I learned ______\" and what I find remarkable is that although there are some common threads, different people have used vastly different ways of achieving their language learning goals.It got me thinking about gym/lifting YouTube, and how a similar thing happens there where a handful of successful fit and buff men and women have taken that what worked for them as the way everyone ought to go, and then there's a bunch of pointless back-and-forth about the best position to do a lateral raise or something.The common thread between both of these disparate disciplines (languages and fitness) is that the discourse has developed to a point that both have a developed and accepted “bro science”. Obviously there is a real and legitimate base of research and developed theory surrounding both learning a language and fitness, but often built on top of that, at least online, is anecdotal experience elevated to the same authoritative status. The most harmful example I can think of is the “it didn’t work for me therefore it straight up won’t work for anyone”, mostly applied to things like school/college language classes or [insert textbook or app here].For me, the elephant in the room is that there is no one tried and true and only way to learn a language, and so many YouTubers, big and small, struggle to acknowledge that. Often the reason for not doing so is tied into needing to support sponsors or their own products, and I think it’s really unhelpful. I now find more value in the small, no-name channels who just document their journey with no grand claims about their method or their insight. I found navigating this whole space so exhausting that I decided I’d just go ahead and try something based on my meagre knowledge even if it’s not perfect. Who knows, I might even learn a language along the way.",

The logic went like this… we could take as many pictures into the exam as possible, so he carried a huge comic strip into the test to help jog his memory.I remember laughing a lot when he took a massive stack of papers detailing out this incredibly complex comic strip into an exam.My “hack” was to memorize lists of words intensely a few days before the exam.We both passed. A week later, we both forgot everything.Basically - we both concluded that we are just both equally “bad at languages”.Fast forward to today: I’m living in Quebec as the only English-only speaker in a tri-lingual family (my wife Venezuelan, my son Québécois).Out of desperation I have been following spaced repetition training. Something recommended on almost all adult language learning forums…Surprisingly it seems to work well… I understand that the brain needs time to re-wire itself and so I totally accept that learning a language takes time and dedication…Here’s my question… I’ve never seen SRS used in classrooms.Is that just because of curriculum/testing pressure, or are there other reasons? Or is there something I don’t know about? I’d love to hear it from somebody actually in the classroom?",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone,I’m currently learning Russian and I’d say I’m around A1.2 level – not a complete beginner anymore, but still at a basic stage. I also have about a B1 level in Spanish. My main goal is to reach B1 in Russian as quickly as possible, because I want to be able to communicate with my Russian family. Spanish is less urgent, but I don’t want to lose it.I mainly use comprehensible input, since grammar books don’t really work for me (my brain gets too chaotic with them). So when I’m reading or watching something, I usually look up unknown words or sentences and ask ChatGPT to explain grammar rules and vocabulary. Sometimes I even spend 3 hours in a day doing Russian this way. But afterwards I feel drained and demotivated, especially since I also have daily responsibilities (family, social life, work, other goals, etc.).At the same time, I have many hobbies like reading and expanding my general knowledge (I’m especially into history). Sometimes I try to combine this with language learning by reading about history in Spanish or Russian, which feels efficient. But honestly, I sometimes just need to enjoy my hobbies in my native language to really relax.So here’s my dilemma: How can I balance everything? How can I push Russian to a higher level as fast as possible, keep up with Spanish (maybe even improve it), and still enjoy my hobbies and general knowledge expansion—without feeling overwhelmed or burning out?Any advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation would be amazing.Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "My kids are in a dual language school in the US. Currently they are learning Spanish that will be incorporated into their curriculum Preschool all the way through 8th grade. My Kindergartener is showing interest in learning another language as he is loving being able to speak two. Being in the US and being in an English-speaking home, they are not exposed to other languages regularly like in other parts of the world. My question is is there another language that makes sense to learn next? Like an order where you can leverage knowledge already gained? From what I have read it is easier to learn language at a young age, but I obviously do not want to force them. Just trying to be a supportive parent and educate myself as it is definitely a skill I wish that I had! TIA!",

I am travelling the world and very passionate about languages. I speak Dutch, English, and my Spanish is getting better and better. Also i speak some German.As is mentioned, I just started out and I had to record a video to introduce myself. I would like to make more videos in the future about language and also just for fun to share on social media. This was my first time in front of the camera. Can you guys give me some feedback on how I did and what I can improve? That would mean a lot to me!And of course, if you are interested in taking classes, you will find the link below!The link to my YouTube video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQo-BZPyNAQThe link to my Italki profile:https://www.italki.com/en/teacher/28246216Thank you guys =)",

      "content_preview": "I’ll be moving to a foreign country in about a year. I did this once before and it didn’t go great. Seeking advice on strategy.So my first time moving to a foreign language country: I studied the language of the place I was going like crazy before. Just independent study: reading, writing on Lang 8, drilling verbs. When I got there, I couldn’t recall any of it. I understood the grammar and even complex tenses. But I didn’t understand when people spoke, and I wasn’t able to recall anything to be able to talk. It seemed like all my studying was wasted time.Now, as I prepare to move to a different foreign country, I’m Leary about self study, even taking classes. All I have been doing to passive listening every day to tv shows. Is that dumb? Should I still be trying to memorize vocab and tenses etc? Or taking a class?(First time I moved it was to Barcelona, after I studied Spanish. Spanish isn’t as widely spoken in the city as I thought, so that may have affected things. The he second place I’m moving to, in a year, is Luxembourg, so I’m attempting to learn french. If any of that background helps. I know, there are really easy languages compared to others!)",

      "content_preview": "So, about 10 days ago I shared my little project , a site where you drop in a YouTube link, and it spits out a flashcard deck.I thought maybe a dozen of you would check it out. Instead, literally thousands of you visited the site. Y'all gave me some love, brutal feedback, and ran up my API bill.In the process you also exposed every bug I had buried in there. Thanks for that.So, I’ve been pulling late nights, breaking things, fixing them, breaking them again…and here’s where we are now:LanguagesChinese learners:pinyin support is now built-in.Japanese learners:the system now recognizes Japanese videos and builds full decks with interactive transcripts. They don’t always line up perfectly, and honestly, please don’t ever ask me to touch Japanese again because it's janky.Turkish learners:Turkish is now a supported languageHindi learners:Hindi is now a supported languageEnglish learners:This works as long as you have your native language set in your profile, otherwise it returns Albanian flashcards. Don't ask me why.https://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-6g3b2pn484nf1.pngFlashcards & DecksYou cansuspend cardsyou don’t care about, and re-activate them later.Addeddeck sorting(by date or language).Added adelete deckbutton (finally).Addedmanual card creation & editingso you can make your own.Addedcopy/paste supportlong-press to grab text straight from a card without flipping.Flashcards now havebetter status indicators(new, learning, mastered).https://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-r0d4iu5b84nf1.pngStudy SessionsTheSRS scheduling got a total overhaul: tricky words repeat until they stick.Theprogress baronly goes up when you hit “Good” or “Easy,” so you get a real picture of mastery.The spacing between reviews for “Good” and “Easy” is smarter now.You can pick betweenclassic SRS reviewand agamified review mode.Fixed the bug where clicking “Again/Hard/Good/Easy” too fast would mess up counts.Progress & TrackingAddedstreaksand daily activity tracking.You now getvisual charts(line chart for study activity, pie/bar chart for mastery breakdown).On the “My Decks” and “My Progress” pages you’ll see clear breakdowns of new, learning, and mastered cards.https://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-vks18sdl84nf1.pngTranscript & Word SelectionWord selection in transcriptnow translates full strings, not just single words. You can also jump straight to that moment in the video or add it to your deck.Improvederror handlingwhen YouTube doesn’t share transcripts - you now get actual instructions on how to grab it manually and still generate your deck.https://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-l1i4us0w84nf1.pnghttps://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-j35dhpac94nf1.pnghttps://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-uh0mu5ii94nf1.pngUser Accounts & AccessGuest modeis live: you can now make decks, save them, and keep progresswithout an account.Fixed the bug where guest mode was throwing a 403 error.General ImprovementsWebsite is now way moremobile responsive(so it doesn’t look like hot garbage on your phone).UI tweaks: better tooltips, cleaner loading states, footer cleanup.Staying FreeI completely f***faced myself with costs. So I added two cheap subscription tiers. The free version is still fully usable (deck creation, progress tracking, etc.), but if you want to support the site and keep it alive, and get way more vocab decks every month to learn real vocab in context that’s how you can.That’s the current state of the app. Still scrappy. But its ours and now slightly less broken.What I’d love from you all:What’s still missing? what would you love to see?I was thinking of adding book/PDF support.What about a section where I add movie screenplays that you can go through and get it based on your language?I was also thinking of paying for whisper api access so this works on youtube videos without captions and also podcasts.What would make you actuallystick with itfor daily study?Thanks again,Vocablii.com",

I wanted something more like where I could post in Korean every day and exchanging comments with native speakersI think I downloaded almost 20+ apps trying to find something like that… and finally I found it in an app called LoquThere are quite a few people learning Korean/Japanese/English, and most importantly, no creeps so far 🙏 Honestly feels like a blessing.But seriously… how did all the other language exchange apps end up like this?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all. I grew up speaking a couple of Asian languages and learnt English at 10 years of age. English is now effectively my mother language (spoken it for decades). I'm trying to learn Spanish. 15 years ago I did a 2 year evening class in it. Got to basic level. For the last 4 years, I spend 3+ months every year in South America. I've taken intensive classes. I've done 1-2-1 private conversation classes, I've tried online tutors, including from Babbel. I've watched dozens of telenovelas, YT documentaries in Spanish. But im at A2 level at best. The problem is understanding what people are saying. Recently at my hostel in Colombia, I listened to two locals speaking - after 5 minutes of listening i had no idea of what TOPIC they were talking about. I felt so frustrated, that I heard my self say out loud \"I f@@king hate Spanish\". I literally understand almost nothing when people talk. What my ears hear is \"patha patha patha patha\".I've now built up a negative association with Spanish and have almost given up even trying to learn. For now anyway. But I need to learn it cos my future is in South America.So, my question : do i have some sort of a mental deficiency for Spanish? (I'm a software engineer by profession, so very logical thinking.) Can anyone offer any advice or feedback? Other than \"practice, immerse yourself\" etc cos I've done that but nothing is sticking.",

But even with closed captions I feel like I just couldn't get the flow of the language right and just never could understand anything. My ears would hurt straining to decifyer sounds and I was fully lost if I didn't have subtitles.I think it was about a year ago that I was watching an anime dubbed in my TL that I finally had things just click. Now by no means will I even pretend like I can follow a native speaker 100% of the time, but I've continued to see improvements! I'm specifically pushing more to listen to content without subtitles (something I can't even do in my 1st language because of Audio Processing Disorder), and even in just the last week I'm starting to hear even more clearly.Now I feel like my listening skills are getting closer to my reading skills. I still absolutely struggle with unfamiliar content but I can easily follow along things I'm previously familiar with. It seems most of my listening struggles just come down to being unfamiliar with specific vocabulary or grammar.Since my issue is I do pretty unstructured learning I'm now focusing on split practicing, where I watch some content (10-30mins daily) of content aimed for beginning language learners to get some proper practice in and then I continue doing what I did before of watching TV shows and music in my target language.",

I plan to move to the country sometime in the next two years and I would like to be at an C1 level before I do so. I live in white suburbia so I don't have anyone to practice with nor do I have the finances take classes, unfortunately.Some of the practices I have been doing are: book lessons, being the most obvious, watching shows and movies for active listening, using AI to translate english phrases into Português, and my passion is samba and bossa nova, so also studying lyrics and poetry.I am struggling with active recall in forming sentences through speech and comprehending coloquial speech. I am bilingual in English and Korean but this part of the language learning process feels impossible to grasp. If you may have any suggestions for practice or strategies to add to my repertoire that would be much appreciated.Obrigado :)",

Honestly, that’s not what beginners should focus on. What actually made a difference was building vocabulary.Think about how we all learned our first language. Nobody sat us down with grammar books as kids. We just picked up words, tried them out, and figured things out along the way. Same with French kids learning French, same with anyone anywhere.You can memorize 100+ grammar rules and still freeze up when you try to speak. But if you know enough words, you can get your point across even if you mess up the grammar. People will still understand you.TL;DR: Vocab first, grammar later. Words let you actually talk. Grammar will come naturally with use.",
