I’m now learning Japanese and Korean and I want to improve my pronunciation, for those who have used it, does shadowing actually help or is it a waste of time?",

I previously studied French, which was much easier for me since I could switch between English and French with some ease in my head and find patterns or make up similar sounding words for concepts, helping me actually think in the language much sooner.But Turkish is a different beast. Aside from some loan words that I recognise, the roots for the words are all different from what I'm used to and I'm forgetting words much more quickly than I would like. And of course I still haven't reached the critical mass where I can actually explain myself in Turkish.So does anyone have experience with learning languages that are very different from your native tongue and how to approach them differently to more similar languages?",

      "content_preview": "I kind of count as a multilingual. My native language is Mandarin, English is my working language, and I speak Russian (B2-ish), and beginner German.But most of that came from grinding exams. Memorizing. Test prep, vocab lists, textbook dialogues (classic Chinese learning path :(So yeah, I \"know\" the language, but for years, I couldn’t speak it freely. Especially in Russian, I'd freeze even when I knew exactly what I wanted to say..I met this friend who speaks six languages fluently on Rednote clubs, and he's never studied abroad, never taken formal language exams (except for English), and yet he sounds incredibly natural. We’ve been chatting on and off for a while, and I slowly came to understand his core mindset:Here’s what he told me that changed everything:Change the target language to your muscle memory. Do you think about grammar when you speak your native language? No — because you've already trained your reflexes in everyday scenes. It’s the same for any new language.I’ve been trying to follow his way of practicing, not for exams or work, but just as someone who enjoys learning languages. If that’s you too, this is the simple routine that helped meFirst, pick native content you enjoy. It could be a YouTube vlog, an audiobook, or a casual podcast. The key is: it should be about life, not grammar, not serious learning topics. For me the first content I tried was listening one of my favorite books on Nooka - The Courage to Be Disliked. While listening, I can pause and speak with to share and log down some ideas.The goal: find 1 or 2 phrases that feel super natural to you. Things you wish you could say like that.Then, make up a real-life scene. It could be ordering food, chatting with a friend, texting someone. Now try to use those 1–2 phrases in your own short sentence. Don’t write it down. Just say it.Next day, say it again — but different. Change a word. Add a detail. Use a different mood. The structure sticks. No need to be fancy. It just has to be you saying it.Has anyone else tried building a reflex like this, instead of memorizing grammar first? Happy to swap tips or hear what worked for you.",

      "content_preview": "It's always bothered me that so many language learning YouTubers (not going to name any) have, after learning one or two or half a dozen languages, treat their own method of learning as some sacred tool or The Method To Use. I've watched dozens of \"how I learned ______\" and what I find remarkable is that although there are some common threads, different people have used vastly different ways of achieving their language learning goals.It got me thinking about gym/lifting YouTube, and how a similar thing happens there where a handful of successful fit and buff men and women have taken that what worked for them as the way everyone ought to go, and then there's a bunch of pointless back-and-forth about the best position to do a lateral raise or something.The common thread between both of these disparate disciplines (languages and fitness) is that the discourse has developed to a point that both have a developed and accepted “bro science”. Obviously there is a real and legitimate base of research and developed theory surrounding both learning a language and fitness, but often built on top of that, at least online, is anecdotal experience elevated to the same authoritative status. The most harmful example I can think of is the “it didn’t work for me therefore it straight up won’t work for anyone”, mostly applied to things like school/college language classes or [insert textbook or app here].For me, the elephant in the room is that there is no one tried and true and only way to learn a language, and so many YouTubers, big and small, struggle to acknowledge that. Often the reason for not doing so is tied into needing to support sponsors or their own products, and I think it’s really unhelpful. I now find more value in the small, no-name channels who just document their journey with no grand claims about their method or their insight. I found navigating this whole space so exhausting that I decided I’d just go ahead and try something based on my meagre knowledge even if it’s not perfect. Who knows, I might even learn a language along the way.",

Honestly, that’s not what beginners should focus on. What actually made a difference was building vocabulary.Think about how we all learned our first language. Nobody sat us down with grammar books as kids. We just picked up words, tried them out, and figured things out along the way. Same with French kids learning French, same with anyone anywhere.You can memorize 100+ grammar rules and still freeze up when you try to speak. But if you know enough words, you can get your point across even if you mess up the grammar. People will still understand you.TL;DR: Vocab first, grammar later. Words let you actually talk. Grammar will come naturally with use.",

      "content_preview": "I have been doing language exchange (English/Japanese) for 2 years, and it really helped me lose my nerves when speaking. (my English still isn’t good though...)I have used HelloTalk, Tandem, and about 5 other apps. After all that, I realized it’s soooo hard to find a regular language partner.Here’s why:Too much texting. Many people do not want to speak right away. We text for days or weeks before calling. By the time we finally speak, I already feel tired. Sometimes the call never even happens.Scheduling is very hard. Because of time zones, the overlap in active hours is usually only about 2–3 hours. Every time we suggest times, we have to confirm the time zone again and again… It feels like too much work just to meet once.Keeping the relationship is hard. At first it feels exciting. But later, topics run out. I feel awkward starting random small talk. I worry my partner is busy. Many times, ghosting happens.Recently I tried something new. I shared my Google Calendar with some of my language partners. They could see all my available times and just book a slot. This way, they did not need to start small talk just to practice speaking. Even if the overlap was short, because there were many options, we could always find a good time. This was the best experience I have ever had with language exchange.But I am not satisfied with only this. I want to increase this style of language exchange more. That’s why I started a schedule-sharing project with sincere language learners here. The waitlist is already open if anyone wants to try it out.That’s it. This is my tip.This problem is something I really want to solve. So even if your comment isn’t directly about my story, please feel free to share your thoughts and your own tips for finding regular language partners.",

      "content_preview": "Hello everybody! This is my first time posting here, but I have this internal dilemma and I'm curious to get your takes and if you've ever experienced anything similar.For context, I'm an English native living in Japan, fully fluent in Japanese but I've also dabbled in a few languages including Chinese (HSK3) and Swahili. Considering the \"advantage\" I'd have learning a language that is considered more practical and widely spoken in my area like Chinese or Korean, I struggle finding motivation to learn these languages even though I know learning these languages would open huge opportunities in my career and everyday life. On the other hand, I took a short trip to Kenya and Tanzania earlier this year, and spent a few months before that learning Swahili, and managed to have some painfully simple but satisfying conversations with the locals.I know that Swahili would offer few practical benefits in terms of career and availability of speakers, but I genuinely enjoyed learning the language and think it's one of the most beautiful languages I've heard. It's not overly complex or difficult compared to when I first studied Japanese, and it's a really fun process, even though resources are very scarce. In comparison I've studied Chinese and I'm personally not a huge fan of the way it sounds, nor do I have any serious motivations for traveling in China even though I know there's a wealth of opportunities and interesting places to visit. I have a ton of Chinese speaking friends and coworkers, but a grand total of TWO swahili speaking friends who live here.Any of you ever experienced this dilemma? I guess it comes down to enjoyment vs utility and your reasons for learning the language, but I can't help but feel more drawn to a language I'll have very few chances to use in my daily life. Curious what you guys think!",

      "content_preview": "I made this post because I always appreciate seeing users likeu/xanthic_strathpost about their long-term reading and listening projects in their target languages. There also aren't very many posts like this for Asian languages. I want to encourage others hoping to read a lot in their TLs!Why did I bother to read 100 books in Japanese?I love to read. I learned Japanese because I wanted to read untranslated manga and maybe some light novels and poetry. I discovered that reading in the original language was way better than a lot of translations, and that the light novel versions of a lot of manga were available that weren’t translated into English, so I ended up reading quite a few light novels in the end. The breakdown is 57 light novels, 30 novels, 7 nonfiction prose books, and 2 children’s books. I've also read 217 volumes of manga.How are my reading abilities now?I can read novels, light novels, and manga without errors in comprehension and with minimal lookups (~1 per every 15-20 pages for more difficult books). Poetry is still demanding, although it also requires further thought and consideration in English, my native language. Academic books and articles are doable with lookups for academic jargon.I know a fair amount of idioms, can understand the nuance of different words, gendered speech styles, and levels ofkeigo, and can read for fun with very few issues. If I encounter a word I don’t know, I can usually guess the meaning from thekanjiused and sometimes the reading as well.While manga is a distinct format with its own stylistic challenges, it’s generally smooth sailing for me. Light novels are quite easy. Novels vary depending on the year published and the degree of literariness. For example, I recently read お探し物は図書室まで (What You're Looking For is in the Library) by 青山 美智子 (Aoyama Michiko) and it was a very smooth read. In contrast, reading Natsume Sōseki onhttps://www.sosekiproject.org/index.htmlfeels approachable but not quite as easy. With the gloss, it’s less a matter of vocabulary and more one of sociocultural background information from the time period the works were written.How long did this take?I read 2 books in 2021, 10 in 2022, 26 in 2023, and 34 in 2024. As I write this in August 2025, I’ve read 30 books so far this year.How did I approach reading (intensive vs. extensive, etc.)? What technologies and tools did I use?I used my Kindle, the built-in Japanese-English dictionary, and the monolingual (J-J) dictionary. I also used physical books and theJishoapp. I hadSatori Readerfor about a month (~January 2021). I used some freeTadoku graded readersbefore that. I listened to a lot of audiobooks while I read long light novel series, in particular, which was helpful for simultaneously improving my listening skills. This method helped reinforce readings of words passively. I also made extensive use of a site calledNatively, where you grade books you've read against each other based on how difficult they feel to you. It's great for finding books at your reading level.As for the reading itself, at the beginning it was decoding. I looked up every word and grammar structure that I didn’t know. It was very slow. I made the mistake of not reading every day (in fact, I probably had points where I wasn’t reading every week or even month), so it took me six months to finish my first novel. In retrospect, I should have chosen something lower level, with fullfurigana, and made sure to read a few pages every day. It adds up, even if it’s only 3-5 pages per day.In general, even after moving past the decoding stage, I primarily read intensively, looking up most words I didn’t know. This lasted until I learned the words or could guess the meaning from context and didn’t have to read extensively any more. It definitely took at least 10,000 pages - maybe 20,000? But now I can read general fiction and literary fiction very comfortably.Honestly, I have a high tolerance for looking words up, even in physical books, so this approach worked for me. It will not work for everyone. For Korean, I’m reading a lot more level-appropriate material (middle grade and YA novels with the occasional light novel equivalent novel thrown in). It’s a lot easier and I’ve made more consistent progress, since I also made the effort to read every day.Crucially, I can read more every day because the material is easier.This is all to say: It doesn’t matter what you read. 10,000 pages gets you far either way. However, reading easier stuff is going to get you there faster.(And yes, I didn’t really do this with Japanese, because Natively didn’t exist in 2020, or I didn’t know about it, so I went for harder stuff I knew that I liked. This isn’t wrong, but it was very, very slow.)When did I feel like I saw sudden increases in my reading ability?Books 1-2: I was decoding, not readingBooks 3-10: I knew most of the basic vocab and things felt a lot easier; I built a reading habitBooks 11-30: I felt quite confident with light novels but less so with literary fiction; I did lots of reading along with audiobooksBooks 31-50: I felt confident with modern literary fiction in addition to light novelsBooks 51-100: I diversified my reading to different registers and genres; late 19th/early 20th century fiction became possible, but required some scaffolding for historical context and somekanbunknowledgeWhat advice would I give to others who want to do the same thing?Build a habit of reading every day.Even 5 pages a day will get you somewhere way faster than 30 pages once a month.Read narrowly at the beginning.Stick to one author or series for the first few books, perhaps something that you’ve already read in another language and are familiar with.Read widely as you progress, particularly after the 10,000 page mark.Read popular fiction, fantasy, romance, literary fiction, manga, poetry, nonfiction, historical fiction - literally whatever floats your boat. This will help expand your reading range, as well as your vocabulary.Don’t be afraid to quit reading a book that’s too hard or simply too boring.It’s better to switch to something that you’re actually interested in picking up even if it means not finishing the book you’ve started.Keep a working list of different books you’re interested in.Read the Kindle samples to find one that works for your level and reading tastes. Use sites like Natively to find books at your level and see other learners’ reviews.Listen to audiobooks as you read.This helps with reinforcing correct pronunciation and readings forkanji, as well as improving your passive listening skills.Set little goals.Start with 1 book, then 3, then 10, then 20 and so on. Even if you eventually plan to read more than this, it takes time to build up reading skills and stamina. Setting huge goals will often feel demotivating.Would I recommend doing this for your target language?If you like to read, 100%! It was a fun long-term project for me, and I am by no means done. There are many more books for me to read.More seriously, this takes time, but it’s more than worth it if you want to gain linguistic and cultural knowledge about your target language. Reading was essential for me to build a large passive vocabulary. This knowledge transferred over to listening and I’ve been able to convert some of it to speaking as well.Thank you for reading! Feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer them.",

      "content_preview": "No, I don't mean learning morphosyntactic terms or what an agglutinative language is. I mean learning about how language actually works.Linguistics is descriptive, which means it describes how a language is used. By definition, a native speaker will always be correct about their own language. I don't mean metalinguistic knowledge because that's something you have to study, but they will always be correct about what sounds right or not in their idiolect.No, you do NOT speak better than a native speaker just because you follow prescriptive grammar rules. I really need people to stop repeating this.No, non-standard dialects are not inherently \"less correct\" than standard dialects. The only reason why a prestige dialect is considered a prestige dialect is not linguistic, but political and/or socio-economic. There is a time and place for standardized language, but it's important to understandwhyit's needed.C2 speakers do not speak better than native speakers just because they know more words or can teach a university class in that language. The CEFR scale and other language proficiency scales are not designed with native speakers in mind, anyway.AAVE is not broken or uneducated English. Some features of it, such as pronouncing \"ask\" as \"ax\" have valid historical reasons due to colonization and slavery.I'm raising these points because, as language learners, we sometimes forget that languages are rich, constantly evolving sociocultural communicational \"agreements\". A language isn't just grammar and vocab: it's history, politics, culture. There is no such thing as \"inventing\" a (natural) language. Languages go through thousands of years of change, coupled with historical events, migration, or technological advancements. Ignoring this leads to reinforcing various forms of social inequality, and itisthat serious.",

      "content_preview": "So, about 10 days ago I shared my little project , a site where you drop in a YouTube link, and it spits out a flashcard deck.I thought maybe a dozen of you would check it out. Instead, literally thousands of you visited the site. Y'all gave me some love, brutal feedback, and ran up my API bill.In the process you also exposed every bug I had buried in there. Thanks for that.So, I’ve been pulling late nights, breaking things, fixing them, breaking them again…and here’s where we are now:LanguagesChinese learners:pinyin support is now built-in.Japanese learners:the system now recognizes Japanese videos and builds full decks with interactive transcripts. They don’t always line up perfectly, and honestly, please don’t ever ask me to touch Japanese again because it's janky.Turkish learners:Turkish is now a supported languageHindi learners:Hindi is now a supported languageEnglish learners:This works as long as you have your native language set in your profile, otherwise it returns Albanian flashcards. Don't ask me why.https://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-6g3b2pn484nf1.pngFlashcards & DecksYou cansuspend cardsyou don’t care about, and re-activate them later.Addeddeck sorting(by date or language).Added adelete deckbutton (finally).Addedmanual card creation & editingso you can make your own.Addedcopy/paste supportlong-press to grab text straight from a card without flipping.Flashcards now havebetter status indicators(new, learning, mastered).https://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-r0d4iu5b84nf1.pngStudy SessionsTheSRS scheduling got a total overhaul: tricky words repeat until they stick.Theprogress baronly goes up when you hit “Good” or “Easy,” so you get a real picture of mastery.The spacing between reviews for “Good” and “Easy” is smarter now.You can pick betweenclassic SRS reviewand agamified review mode.Fixed the bug where clicking “Again/Hard/Good/Easy” too fast would mess up counts.Progress & TrackingAddedstreaksand daily activity tracking.You now getvisual charts(line chart for study activity, pie/bar chart for mastery breakdown).On the “My Decks” and “My Progress” pages you’ll see clear breakdowns of new, learning, and mastered cards.https://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-vks18sdl84nf1.pngTranscript & Word SelectionWord selection in transcriptnow translates full strings, not just single words. You can also jump straight to that moment in the video or add it to your deck.Improvederror handlingwhen YouTube doesn’t share transcripts - you now get actual instructions on how to grab it manually and still generate your deck.https://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-l1i4us0w84nf1.pnghttps://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-j35dhpac94nf1.pnghttps://preview.redd.it/10-days-later-your-feedback-my-sleepless-nights-and-a-lot-v0-uh0mu5ii94nf1.pngUser Accounts & AccessGuest modeis live: you can now make decks, save them, and keep progresswithout an account.Fixed the bug where guest mode was throwing a 403 error.General ImprovementsWebsite is now way moremobile responsive(so it doesn’t look like hot garbage on your phone).UI tweaks: better tooltips, cleaner loading states, footer cleanup.Staying FreeI completely f***faced myself with costs. So I added two cheap subscription tiers. The free version is still fully usable (deck creation, progress tracking, etc.), but if you want to support the site and keep it alive, and get way more vocab decks every month to learn real vocab in context that’s how you can.That’s the current state of the app. Still scrappy. But its ours and now slightly less broken.What I’d love from you all:What’s still missing? what would you love to see?I was thinking of adding book/PDF support.What about a section where I add movie screenplays that you can go through and get it based on your language?I was also thinking of paying for whisper api access so this works on youtube videos without captions and also podcasts.What would make you actuallystick with itfor daily study?Thanks again,Vocablii.com",

My Kindergartener is showing interest in learning another language as he is loving being able to speak two. Being in the US and being in an English-speaking home, they are not exposed to other languages regularly like in other parts of the world. My question is is there another language that makes sense to learn next? Like an order where you can leverage knowledge already gained? From what I have read it is easier to learn language at a young age, but I obviously do not want to force them. Just trying to be a supportive parent and educate myself as it is definitely a skill I wish that I had! TIA!",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone,I’m currently learning Russian and I’d say I’m around A1.2 level – not a complete beginner anymore, but still at a basic stage. I also have about a B1 level in Spanish. My main goal is to reach B1 in Russian as quickly as possible, because I want to be able to communicate with my Russian family. Spanish is less urgent, but I don’t want to lose it.I mainly use comprehensible input, since grammar books don’t really work for me (my brain gets too chaotic with them). So when I’m reading or watching something, I usually look up unknown words or sentences and ask ChatGPT to explain grammar rules and vocabulary. Sometimes I even spend 3 hours in a day doing Russian this way. But afterwards I feel drained and demotivated, especially since I also have daily responsibilities (family, social life, work, other goals, etc.).At the same time, I have many hobbies like reading and expanding my general knowledge (I’m especially into history). Sometimes I try to combine this with language learning by reading about history in Spanish or Russian, which feels efficient. But honestly, I sometimes just need to enjoy my hobbies in my native language to really relax.So here’s my dilemma: How can I balance everything? How can I push Russian to a higher level as fast as possible, keep up with Spanish (maybe even improve it), and still enjoy my hobbies and general knowledge expansion—without feeling overwhelmed or burning out?Any advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation would be amazing.Thanks!",

I know this subreddit is always hearing questions about learning because duh.For context, my learning process is greatly helped when I know why I’m learning what I’m learning at the stage that I am at. With language learning though, I struggle to “understand” how I may learn how to form sentences and so on when I am learning words.I mean, I understand that I need to learn pronouns, prepositions, verbs, nouns, to string a sentence like “she and I are building this table”, but whenever I’m learning verbs and pronouns, my brain just keeps telling me to “learn how to learn” first, which I know is counterintuitive. I understand this may be helped if I get a tutor but I’ve no current means to do that now so I’m relying on self-study.I really want to get out of this helpless mindset as I know it’s hindering me from learning. This is also my first time actually learning a language. I already know three natively (Asian here!) but I’ve grown up speaking them so I don’t “know how to learn”.Any advice?

But all that would be rather normal changes. But their gamification is not.Since when is it acceptable, to motivate people through emotional blackmail? Especially as a part of Italki's users are children?You get a digital pet fish, to gamify your learning. You give it more water, that you receive for completed lessons, so far it's ok, just a cute gamification tool, we've seen plenty of those. But then: either you keep paying regularly, or your fish will die.Plus as most bad gamifications, it doesn't focus on achievements, on having learnt something, on good performance. It is not meant to help you learn, it is a direct reward for paying and a punishment for not paying for a while.The \"reward\" for paying is supposed the service I pay for. Focus on the quality and convenience of the main service, and I'll happily pay.

Just independent study: reading, writing on Lang 8, drilling verbs. When I got there, I couldn’t recall any of it. I understood the grammar and even complex tenses. But I didn’t understand when people spoke, and I wasn’t able to recall anything to be able to talk. It seemed like all my studying was wasted time.Now, as I prepare to move to a different foreign country, I’m Leary about self study, even taking classes. All I have been doing to passive listening every day to tv shows. Is that dumb? Should I still be trying to memorize vocab and tenses etc? Or taking a class?(First time I moved it was to Barcelona, after I studied Spanish. Spanish isn’t as widely spoken in the city as I thought, so that may have affected things.

Mastering every single aspect of any 3 languages as in being able to write beautiful essays on basically any topic, can speak eloquently and easily express yourself very well, and essentially be a walking dictionary of those three languages. On the other hand, you'd know 50 languages of your choice to an early middle school level, you can understand most of everyday conversation and have a basic ability to read, speak, and write, and you have a decent range of vocabulary.You keep languages you already know. If you choose to master 3 languages, you can either build upon your current languages or master an entirely new one. If you choose 50 languages, you can also improve to a middle schooler level on a language you are currently learning, and keep what you already have.Which option are you choosing?",

      "content_preview": "My advice for language  learning ( Learning : 🇨🇵🇩🇪🇪🇸🇪🇬)I have created some tips that have worked for me that may help some of you too. * They're in random order btw*{Edited - to provide some examples}Learn it RIGHT from the beginning. Make sure you learn things right at the beginning. Don't be lazy with spelling , pronounciation ect as it will be demotivating having to go back to learn what you should've learned 8 months ago.Keep a journal. You'll learn phrases that are most  relevant to you and your life. As a result ,speaking will become more spontaneous and natural overtime. {You can talk about your day, your week so far , the weather, what you ate , what's going on in the news ,how your feeling ect , even if it's only a few words. Whatever you can't write , that's what you need to learn}Use the \"grouping method\" Learn groups of words  ( Ie days of the week , months , animals (a few that are relevant to you and your environment) , time phrases, formalities, rooms in a house ect ( I can provide a list below if you are interested lmk)Listen allllll the time (passive or active) it all helps. {Use a radio app you like and listen while you commute , exercise, clean ect. I would say use a radio app as you get a broad range of topics and natural/native speakers.}Make use of SRS (spaced repetition) {try Goldlist method , and or flash cards}Use apps to talk to natives or practice with DuoDon't try to match native pace when talking, it will only cause problems (ie mispronunciation, ect)For Vocab  use \"Opposites\". A great way to learn lots and lots of vocab is by learning opposite words  you can put them on  flash cards and basically learn 2 words at once. (Ask chat gpt for 70 pairs of opposite words in your TL) ie (safe / dangerous) (loud/ quiet) (rich/poor)(weak/strong) (silver /gold) ectSleep/rest /breaks - sleeping , rest and breaks are so important. Go to bed earlier , give your brain a rest and a chance to consolidate what you've learned. Even take a few days off from study.Stay consistent- even if you're not doing a day of studying, try to at least engage with the language (music /radio / TV )Mistakes - never be afraid to make mistakes . As they say \"you never make the same mistake twice\". {For example if you say \"estoy embarazada\" , which means \"I'm pregnant\" , instead of \"estoy vergüenza/o\" I'm embarrassed, you will most likely remember it}Reddit - some good pages to speak to native speakers if you don't want to use a language app.Conjugations - learn them in the beginning and create sentences so you can see show they're used .Create recordings of your spontaneous speech in response to made up questions ( ie what's a funny story you remember?, what was the last movie you watched about?) you will see what phrases you dont know and what you phrases are most relevant for you to learn.{if you'd like a list of prompts lmk}Target language first- for example if you're speaking to someone in your house , you may answer them in the TL first ( or think of the answer in your TL) before you answer in your native tongue. { For example your friend asks you \" do you want the red or blue t-shirt?\" You answer \"Azul, por favor\" before answering \"blue, please\".}3 X3 method - only stick to the same 3 pieces of media/resources . Too much causes confusion and overload and possibly lack of motivation. So for example stick to 3 YouTube channels for CI , 3  reading resources and 3 websites  ( if you get bored change your choices every few months )Pick accent / dialect n stick to it !!Hope this helps !!Also plz feel free to add any more tips I may not have mentioned",

I’m learning a lot but sometimes I feel like I don’t understand what I’m learning. I’m still a beginner so it’s all so hard. Some days I walk out of the class like “what just happened?”I guess this is just a minor vent/searching for others who can relate. Trying to make friends in a foreign country, struggling to learn the language and making mistakes as an adult, it feels like you’re a kid but in an adult body. Does the feeling ever pass when you reach an intermediate level or does it stay like this forever?I wouldn’t trade living here for the world. I’m so happy here. But living overseas is never sunshine and rainbows. I think many foreigners think it is. Maybe this will be a light to those who think moving overseas is a piece of cake. Even for a housewife like me, it can be hard!",

When you watch the video you see that the guy is clearly lying and realize that he started studying the language years ago, but yet he makes the statement that he learned the language in 2 months. But in reality you need to study for years to get to that level. These people lie to get clicks.Please, if you are currently learning a language just accept that it will take years to get good at it and dont be too hard on yourself if you arent making quick progress. You are not supposed to make quick progress, improvement that sticks takes a very long time.",

People often times mock me because there’s no need for me to learn it. And I could be doing better things (I’m 14 so the better things are just pretty much video games). What makes it worse is new Korean media coming out (Squid Game S3, kpop demon hunters etc) even though I started learning before these came out (mid June) so people assume I’m learning it to watch them only and they think it’s cringe. Some kid ripped a section of my textbook while screaming ‘Ching Chong’ (I don’t mind it when my friends say it but this was a rundown kid I’ve never talked to). I also made a post on TikTok which I rarely ever use making a table of verb endings, all comments are just making fun of the post. Hopefully someone here can relate. It doesn’t help I’m already being made fun of for other reasons. I’m still not going to quit because I’m making good progress.Edit: Another thing I should have said is that I’m from one of them most racist countries in the world.",

I noticed that this coworker always used the audio button when I showed her my phone. Long story short: she can’t read Spanish anymore than she can read English. She’s a bright girl and a hard worker, so I’m pretty sure it’s just a lack of opportunity.

      "content_preview": "Hi all. I grew up speaking a couple of Asian languages and learnt English at 10 years of age. English is now effectively my mother language (spoken it for decades). I'm trying to learn Spanish. 15 years ago I did a 2 year evening class in it. Got to basic level. For the last 4 years, I spend 3+ months every year in South America. I've taken intensive classes. I've done 1-2-1 private conversation classes, I've tried online tutors, including from Babbel. I've watched dozens of telenovelas, YT documentaries in Spanish. But im at A2 level at best. The problem is understanding what people are saying. Recently at my hostel in Colombia, I listened to two locals speaking - after 5 minutes of listening i had no idea of what TOPIC they were talking about. I felt so frustrated, that I heard my self say out loud \"I f@@king hate Spanish\". I literally understand almost nothing when people talk. What my ears hear is \"patha patha patha patha\".I've now built up a negative association with Spanish and have almost given up even trying to learn. For now anyway. But I need to learn it cos my future is in South America.So, my question : do i have some sort of a mental deficiency for Spanish? (I'm a software engineer by profession, so very logical thinking.) Can anyone offer any advice or feedback? Other than \"practice, immerse yourself\" etc cos I've done that but nothing is sticking.",

      "content_preview": "So,about a year ago I was laying in bed with my at the time fiancé, watching some Star Trek.And while watching we kept having to pause and go over the vocabulary between what was said and the subtitles. We're a bilingual household, and so much of what was said in the video we, obviously, don't use on a daily basis.And I just thought. Wow, it sure would be fucking nice if I could take a link to a video I want to watch, get the vocabulary for it, and build some flashcards so I can build useful fluency based on the media we're consuming together.I check the internet because surely something like this exists. It doesn't.Surely I can figure this out. Right?I get started trying to get something simple working.And thenI lost my job.Had to go freelance.Got married.Got a new job.Moved.And now we're expecting a baby.Well, I can't accept that I'm going to have bilingual child without me being perfectly bilingual as well. So I get busy again.And here's what I have to show for it.On this website I can drop-in any youtube link in the language I want to learn and crate a custom vocabulary deck based off what's being said.https://preview.redd.it/my-dream-language-app-didnt-exist-so-i-made-it-v0-eeddoam2k4lf1.pngI can choose to ignore basic vocabulary and names, and it will even save the words I already learned and not pull those words when building a new deckhttps://preview.redd.it/my-dream-language-app-didnt-exist-so-i-made-it-v0-wwch0gkai4lf1.pngIt will show me the most used words in order of frequency, show an interactive transcript of my target language, with word translation on mouseover, and on click take me to that exact section of the video. The translations aren't always perfect right away, but it's close enough and I can edit them on the fly.https://preview.redd.it/my-dream-language-app-didnt-exist-so-i-made-it-v0-fqgjaskzi4lf1.pnghttps://preview.redd.it/my-dream-language-app-didnt-exist-so-i-made-it-v0-8vilintpq4lf1.pngAnd ofcourse, it builds me a deck of video specific flashcards for spaced repetition style memorization. And even has some matching/fill in the blank vocab mini-games to keep things freshSo that's my dream language learning site. Up and running. It's a little janky. It doesn't work with Netflix. But it's mine.My ex-fiancé wasn't that impressed, but I figured since it's useful to me, it will be useful to someone else here as well.Due to API stuff I can't exactly leave it completely open or I'd get charged more money than I have to spare at the moment. But if you visit the site you can use it to make 2 decks for free, and if you register your email you'll be able to make 10 decks, and you can share your decks with other people. All I ask atm is for your feedbackI'm hoping ya'll would be able to help me tease out any issues with it. And if there's a killer feature you'd really find useful let me know.See you atvocablii.comEDIT:Aug 26 - Per feedback selecting words in the transcript now translates the selected string, allowing you to either translate an individual word or see it in context of whats around it, it also pops up the option to either goto that point in the video or add the selected string to your vocab deck.Removed word difficulty ranking.Japanese is now available. Sort of. The system now recognizes japanese language videos and it will build cards and provide a fully interactive transcript, and all the good features. You might notice words in the frequencylist for japanese dont always lineup 1to1. Some jank in there but its good enough please dont ever ask me to touch japanese again because it will break.Functionality to suspend cards you know or do not want to learn atm added in global vocab and in flashcard practice mode.Added delete deck button.Added native language sub-translation to card B-sideEdit: I broke guest usage. If you add a video without an account you'll get a 403 error. Logged in users have no issue. I will try to resolve this tomorrow, it's 4am for me.Edit: Fixed guest access issue. You should not have an issue generating decks as a guest.Fixed bug where clicking the card buttons (Again,Hard,Good,Easy) too fast would mess up your review count.Totally revamped how flashcards are scheduled. You get to practice tricky words until they stick.Study session progress (the bar at the top) now only goes up when you hit \"Good\" or \"Easy.\" This gives you a much clearer picture of what you've truly mastered.The spacing for \"Good\" and \"Easy\" cards is much smarter too. Revamped time to show you card again.Deck generation now has the option to generate the 100, 200, or 300 most frequent words, generate only the specialized vocabulary from the deck, ignore basic words, ignore words you already know.Alright, I've had to upgrade my memberships and API subscriptions. I appreciate all the support, but ya'lls site traffic is eating me alive. To make this sustainable I've added thecompletely optionalability to subscribe to support the site. It's less than Duolingo and gives you access to more advanced features and MORE VOCAB DECK GENERATIONS.The site is still COMPLETELY FREE TO USE.But I have to cap the generations. I'm already somehow spending $120 a month on this.If you want to support, please consider subscribing so I can keep improving the site and keep it online.",

But when I logged in again after years, it felt like every app had basically turned into a dating app.A few years ago I remember there being a lot of serious learners. So I thought I’d tryr/language_exchange, but the problem is that it’s not so easy to chat every single day there. I wanted something more like where I could post in Korean every day and exchanging comments with native speakersI think I downloaded almost 20+ apps trying to find something like that… and finally I found it in an app called LoquThere are quite a few people learning Korean/Japanese/English, and most importantly, no creeps so far 🙏 Honestly feels like a blessing.But seriously… how did all the other language exchange apps end up like this?",

      "content_preview": "For me it took several, SEVERAL dozen hours of listening for things to stop sounding like gibberish.I don't have a teacher and I have an extremely loose style of studying. But even with closed captions I feel like I just couldn't get the flow of the language right and just never could understand anything. My ears would hurt straining to decifyer sounds and I was fully lost if I didn't have subtitles.I think it was about a year ago that I was watching an anime dubbed in my TL that I finally had things just click. Now by no means will I even pretend like I can follow a native speaker 100% of the time, but I've continued to see improvements! I'm specifically pushing more to listen to content without subtitles (something I can't even do in my 1st language because of Audio Processing Disorder), and even in just the last week I'm starting to hear even more clearly.Now I feel like my listening skills are getting closer to my reading skills. I still absolutely struggle with unfamiliar content but I can easily follow along things I'm previously familiar with. It seems most of my listening struggles just come down to being unfamiliar with specific vocabulary or grammar.Since my issue is I do pretty unstructured learning I'm now focusing on split practicing, where I watch some content (10-30mins daily) of content aimed for beginning language learners to get some proper practice in and then I continue doing what I did before of watching TV shows and music in my target language.",

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks",
