      "content_preview": "Today my co-worker walked into work and he kept hovering around my desk but looking really gloomy. And I mean like cartoon gloomy, hanging his head and whimpering. So I asked him, \"What's up, Brian? Have you eaten?\"He suddenly got down onto the floor by my desk and actually started to cry. He told me his cat, who has been with him since he was 11 (Brian is in his 30s) died today, and that was his last living family member. I immediately put my arms around him and this poor man just curled up into like an almost fetal position and sobbed in my arms like he's never ever cried in his whole life. He kept repeating \"Kitty's gone\" and \"I don't have Kitty anymore.\"I toughed it out and didn't cry the whole time including when I and another coworker walked him home - and my other coworker stayed with Brian to have dinner and watch a movie with him, cause he knows Brian likes Pok√©mon and he likes Pok√©mon too.But yeah now I'm at home and bawling my eyes out too. That was genuinely the saddest thing I have ever had to do. Poor Brian. He must have loved that cat so, so much.EDIT: Y'all, Idk what to say, I feel slightly embarrassed reading all of the nice things everyone's saying. Thank you for all the nice compliments but I wasn't doing anything special üò≠ I just did what anyone would do. Oh and also, I'm sorry to all the parents with autistic kids who are now worrying about their kids because of my post üòû",

      "content_preview": "I (30F) seem to have friends who love to declare they are ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to do anything anymore. I‚Äôm not even talking about a raging club night - I‚Äôm talking about grabbing a meal together, going for a walk in the park, going to a concert, any variety of cost effective things to get out of the house and experience the world a little bit. But instead they‚Äôd rather sit with Netflix in the background, scrolling their phones.I‚Äôm also not even talking about friends with kids - they obviously have a pass. But it makes me so upset to see people just want to rot their lives away on the couch, and it‚Äôs also pretty lonely as someone who likes to go out and do things from time to time. I understand the need for a movie and takeout night too - I‚Äôm not a raging extrovert. And I do go to things alone but it‚Äôs more fun to do things with friends.30 is not old. Hell, even 70 doesn‚Äôt have to be old. When you stop moving and stop doing things, your brain shrinks, your body gets stiff and sore, and you end up stuck. I wish my friends knew that or cared, but they don‚Äôt.Anyways, I‚Äôm sad and lonely and wanted to vent a bit.",

      "content_preview": "I (22F, Black) am in an interracial relationship with my boyfriend (23M, white). We have been together for about 2 years. A couple nights ago we had the weirdest argument. He wanted to hang out with friends, his car is in the shop, so I drove him to the gas station, bought him some beers for the party, got myself wine to relax and play RDR2(i‚Äôve been obsessed), and dropped him off. I was invited but I do not like his friends.Later he ubers home drunk, throws up, and I start playfully teasing him about it. Then he tries to exit my game. I thought he was joking so I ‚Äúfought‚Äù back and saved, but then he completely shut off the PC. It was so random and out of character that we just went to bed.I asked him why and he started saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not like Arthur Morgan‚Äù and bringing up insecurities about his looks. I said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre being dumb and I love you regardless‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt know what else to say, i was so confused as to where this was coming from. He didn‚Äôt like that and was still being pissy, saying that i was calling him dumb, so I went to sleep on the couch.When I came back later, he was passed out. I had a gut feeling and searched my name in his messages. I found texts from six months ago, when we briefly broke up, where his best friend told him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs the one for you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the things she‚Äôs pressuring you to do.‚Äù I have no clue what that means. I feel our relationship is even. I like going out to bars and restaurants with or without him. If he comes along, sometimes I pay and sometimes he does. I also do most of the cooking and cleaning and even prep his meals for the week while working and keeping the house clean. y‚Äôknow the ‚Äúwoman‚Äù work üôÑ.I also saw him saying it was ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù that I was ‚Äúbecoming obese‚Äù after birth control. I am not obese, I just went from severely underweight to midsize (size 0 to size 6). Then I checked his group chats. His friends are all white and already make me uncomfortable by saying the n-word and making insensitive comments in my vicinity the first time i met them. Never wanted to be around them since. In the chat they were sharing appalling memes like George Floyd jokes, Jewish jokes, and using the n-word casually. My boyfriend even sent a meme of a Pok√©mon card saying ‚Äúcatching a negress.‚Äù His best friend, the one who said those things about me in the texts and who I felt more comfortable around because he has biracial siblings, was in there too sharing offensive memes.I wish I never would have seen it because now I cannot unsee it. But I am also glad I did. How could I ever marry him or bring a biracial child into this world knowing their father is like this behind the scenes? I am sure if I brought it up, he would apologize and try to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it. But I do not know if I could ever look past it. I am gutted.We live together with his family who lets us stay for free. We have two cats together. It will take me a couple months to save and move out. He can tell something is wrong, but I am completely turned off by him now and I do not know when or how to tell him what I saw.!UPDATE! Today‚Äôs confrontation:So after spending a couple of days away and being with friends, I finally opened up about the situation despite feeling embarrassed. I think it really comes down to a complete difference in morals. I view my partner as an extension of me. I view my friends the same way. If anyone in my circle spoke like his friends do, I‚Äôd be disgusted and cut them off immediately, whether it was in private or in front of me. My boyfriend says he never heard his friends talk like that near me. I don‚Äôt remember if he was there when it happened, but I know I called them out in the moment; kind of joking to lighten it, but still uncomfortable and grossed out. I didn‚Äôt want to flip out and look like the angry black girl, especially since they‚Äôre already racist. One of them did apologize after i said something, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they‚Äôre all complicit. He knew exactly what his friends were like and still chose to bring me around them.Do I think my boyfriend is racist? No. Do I think he‚Äôs spineless with no moral code? Absolutely. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what the meme he sent was because I was a bottle of wine deep and already upset after our fight and seeing him and his best friend talking shit about my weight. I had to scroll a bit in their group chat to even find something he sent, and I‚Äôm not sure how old it was. it could‚Äôve been a year ago or just a few months. Still, the fact that he‚Äôs in that group at all means he‚Äôs again- complicit. Almost every day someone‚Äôs saying the n-word.When we talked, I also brought up that if we were ever to get married and have all our friends and family together, I would never allow his friends anywhere near the people I love, especially if there were kids in the mix. He agreed and said he‚Äôd never consider having them at our wedding or around future children. But that just makes me wonder‚Äîif you agree they‚Äôre that bad, why would you ever bring me around them in the first place? I truly haven‚Äôt accepted any invites to be around the friends who did/said the really vile stuff since the first time I met them about two years ago. There are some I don‚Äôt mind as much (except for the BFF who joined in on the weight comments and ironically has biracial siblings), but at the end of the day, they‚Äôre all still complicit.After talking to my friends, a lot of them were disgusted too and encouraged me to break up with him. They even reminded me that I‚Äôd have places to stay if I needed it. I thought about it on the drive home and just broke down. The thought of ending things, moving, and untangling my life from his feels overwhelming. I‚Äôm not in the best financial situation, and it would take months to get my ducks in a row. I was already feeling pressure to confront him because I couldn‚Äôt keep pretending everything was fine to his face.I came home planning to break it off, I started the convo already breaking down couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say explicitly that i wanted to break up. I did start by calling him out and admitting to snooping, and I told him how appalled and disappointed I was. He doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his fault that his friends say these things and hopes I wouldn‚Äôt assume he agrees with them just because they‚Äôre ‚Äúdumb.‚Äù He admitted he doesn‚Äôt really see them as friends, just ‚Äúdrinking buddies,‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt make it any better. They only hang out a few times a year (besides the bff and some guys i don‚Äôt mind), but they‚Äôve known each other since childhood, and he says he‚Äôs scared of being friendless. He also said they make fun of him too, and he‚Äôs bad at defending himself, but still‚Äîwhy would you keep people like that in your life??He told me one of them made him uncomfortable that same night I saw the messages. Apparently, everyone was drinking and one friend sexually harassed him and asking my bf to sleep with him, and some other guys made ‚Äújungle fever‚Äù comments about him dating me. He says he spent a lot of the night alone in the pool to avoid them. I told him I understand being non-confrontational to a point, but I would hope that even if he doesn‚Äôt respect himself enough to stand up to them, he would at least respect me enough to do it for me.I‚Äôve stuck up for him before‚Äîonce when his friend was talking shit about him in the same group chat, he showed me, and I grabbed his phone and went off on the guy right then and there. But here I am, feeling like he wouldn‚Äôt do the same for me. I told him flat-out, ‚ÄúYou told me you think me gaining weight is unattractive, and I‚Äôve been working on it (I‚Äôve lost 15lbs since he said that 6 months ago) and on the flip side, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs attractive to have no respect for yourself or for me, and to be complicit in this friendship while dating a Black woman.‚Äù He said that he would confront/talk to them, but regardless, why did it take all of this for him to make that decision??Right now, I feel disgusted and embarrassed that this is the person I chose. I‚Äôm terrified about my living situation and feel like I‚Äôve backed myself into a corner. Yes, I could crash with friends, but that would delay me getting my own place. Living rent-free here has been helping me pay off credit cards and repair my credit (which is already bad thanks to 18-year-old me). My car is also barely hanging on, and I‚Äôve been trying to fix it before moving. Breaking up sounds simple on paper, but for me it‚Äôs complicated. For now, I‚Äôm keeping things cordial just to have a roof over my head while I figure out my next steps. Trust me, I‚Äôm just as disgusted and disappointed as anyone else reading this.TL;DR: Took time away, talked to friends, and realized my boyfriend‚Äôs lack of backbone with his racist friends is a dealbreaker. He says he wouldn‚Äôt have them at our wedding or around future kids, but still brought me around them in the past and stays in their group chat. He‚Äôs going to confront them. I haven‚Äôt broken up yet because I‚Äôm stuck living with him while I sort out my finances, but I‚Äôm still disgusted",

I (30F) was very confused, I had just gotten off of work and picked him up to go to my house to swimming. I reluctantly pulled over to the side of his parent‚Äôs house, and kept my foot on the brake. He began with something along the lines of ‚Äú..me and my mom were not having a mom and son day, we were both at court with my ex regarding a restraining order.‚Äù I could feel my heart in my stomach. He goes on to tell me that his ex also has a baby boy who he could potentially be the father of, at the point I put the car in park. Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 7 months at the point. I ask how old the baby is, he says the baby is 5 months old. The ex was pregnant when they broke up and he apparently didn‚Äôt know for 100% accuracy if he was the biological father. He isn‚Äôt on the birth certificate, was never informed when the baby was born, never asked for child support, never helped the mom or the baby through the pregnancy or his 5 months of life. This man has lied to me for 7 months and the emotions I feel are so intense.",

I throw in my clothes, I sit on the floor scrolling my phone, sometimes I read a book.But because I bring the same book every week (it‚Äôs a huge fantasy series, one of those thousand-page monsters) and sit there for an hour in the empty laundry room, my upstairs neighbor has convinced herself I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ running a cult?Her exact words: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want recruitment rituals happening in the building.‚ÄùI laughed at first because I thought she was joking, but no. She‚Äôs dead serious. She told people I ‚Äúchant quietly‚Äù while waiting for my clothes. I‚Äôm literally just mouthing along to music with my earbuds in.Now half the building looks at me like I‚Äôm plotting some spiritual uprising.I wish I could say this bothers me, but honestly it‚Äôs kind of funny. I‚Äôm just the tired dude who doesn‚Äôt want to fight for a washing machine at 6 p.m., and somehow I‚Äôve been promoted to laundry-room cult leader.Should I lean into it?

Personally, I don't really converse with females from my class except if it has something to do with projects, group activity, and studies. I don't wanna make my girlfriend think that i'm out here in college being all friendly and outgoing with random girls from my class although my main purpose is to study and take my college life seriously.Now, there's this one time where my section took a group picture‚Äîin that photo was me and this unfamiliar girl sitting right next to my chair. My girlfriend saw the picture being uploaded in the group chat and she was not having it, she thinks i'm being friendly with other females just because of that picture, when the truth is that I don't even know the girl and neither do I have a plan to be close with the females from my class. I know she's probably upset despite me explaining my side, she told me that even if she told me to stay away from them I'd still be keep talking to them, she thinks i'm sticking around with females just from that photo alone. I need some advise on how I can properly communicate with my girlfriend relating to this matter.",

My husband hasn't had sex with me since our son was born. Our son is 8 months old. I've tried initiating but my husband always has an excuse. It hurt. I thought he wasn't attracted to me any more but that's only half the story. I found condoms in our truck. When I confronted my husband he admitted to having sex with other women but there's no feelings. He says he's not attracted to me but it's not because of how I look. He flat out told me he doesn't want to have sex with me because I'm a mother. He thinks sexual activity of any kind is too degrading for me now. He told me he loves me more than ever but woman shouldn't have sex once they become mothers. I don't know if he's lying or what. We've been married for 8 years and he casually admitted to seeing other woman like it was nothing. When I told him I was going to stay with my sister he was surprised. I can barely sleep. I can barely concentrate at work (I'm a personal trainer and need to be focused). I feel like I'm in a bad dream. I don't know what I did to deserve this.I have turned off the chat feature so people can stop sending me messages calling me a liar or a troll. You can also please stop sending reddit cares messages.

      "content_preview": "This might get me downvoted to hell, but I need to get this off my chest.A couple of years ago, my mostly estranged brother got drunk and high before driving his car straight into another vehicle, killing not only himself, but a woman and her two young children. They were just on their way home from school. His dog was in the car and survived but my brother died on impact as did the occupants of the other car. The story made headlines where I live because of how senseless and heartbreaking it was.The woman left behind a husband and two other kids who weren't in the car. I can‚Äôt even imagine their pain. It‚Äôs horrifying and tragic. I am genuinely sorry for what happened to them.But I'm really sick of catching misdirected anger, blame, and pressure to support the surviving family members  because I'm his sister and have a well paying job.My brother went off the rails as a teen, while I went to law school. I‚Äôd been estranged from my brother for three years before the accident after he got sucked into right wing conspiracy theories and started becoming very sexist. The only contact we had in the year leading up to it was when I messaged him ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù to appease my mother who despaired a lot at our bad relationship with each other.But because we share a relatively uncommon last name and because I have a well-paying job, a lot of people think I should somehow be stepping in to help support the surviving family. The widowed father actually even reached out to me and asked me to contribute financially to raising his remaining kids.I get that he‚Äôs desperate, and I do feel awful for him. But I'm not responsible for my brother‚Äôs decisions. I said no - as gently and respectfully as I could - and now I‚Äôm apparently an asshole. He has continued showing up at my workplace with his kids telling me everything they now go without because I am selfish. I don't even know how he found it.I‚Äôve had strangers message me. I‚Äôve had coworkers awkwardly dance around the topic. I feel like I walk around with a scarlet letter on my forehead just because of my last name. I didn‚Äôt do this. I didn‚Äôt ask for this. And I‚Äôm over it.It‚Äôs like people want me to carry the moral and financial burden of someone else's crime. It's like people think someone needs to pay and if the killer's dead and died in debt rather than with an estate, then the lawyer sibling with the good job is the next best thing.But I‚Äôm not a replacement villain or compensation scheme. I have my own life and my own responsibilities. I have compassion, but I also have boundaries and saying no to something I never should have been dragged into in the first place shouldn‚Äôt make me a monster.I'm exhausted. I want to live my life without being judged for a tragedy I didn't cause. I want people to stop suggesting I have to make right a tragedy I didn't cause. I just want to be left alone.",

She cheated, and I feel like I‚Äôve run through every emotion under the sun. Twice now I‚Äôve sat across from her, looked her in the face, and tried to say,‚ÄúI want a divorce.‚ÄùBoth times I‚Äôve choked. The closest I‚Äôve gotten is, *‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be with somebody like you.‚Äù*She breaks down, cries, and shows genuine remorse.We‚Äôve got our first couples therapy session next week, but honestly, my heart isn‚Äôt in it. I‚Äôve already done four sessions of individual therapy, which have been helping me process, but the truth is: I don‚Äôt want to work on this anymore. I feel guilty because she does. She hurt me, broke me, and I‚Äôve lost complete trust in her. The resentment is overwhelming.At the same time, she‚Äôs been trying harder than I‚Äôve ever seen before. More affectionate. Constant updates. Hugging, kissing, telling me she misses me. She‚Äôs even asked a couple of times if she could stop by when I‚Äôm working just to see me, and I lied, saying I wasn‚Äôt around. A month ago, I would have eaten all of that up. I would have loved to do couples therapy. I think it could have transformed us. But now? Too much damage. Too much betrayal. The more she tries, the further I push away. And that kills me because I‚Äôve wanted that stuff for so long, and I do still love her so much.If I could somehow forgive and move past the resentment, maybe there‚Äôd be a shot. But what she did, I did not deserve. She disrespected me, disrespected our marriage, and shattered something inside me that I don‚Äôt think can be put back together. I haven‚Äôt cried like this since I was a kid.And yet, I‚Äôm torn. I‚Äôve never been a quitter. I‚Äôve always had the ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to kill me to stop me‚Äù mindset. So pulling the plug feels like failure. I feel guilty knowing I‚Äôll be the one ending our marriage. What if I regret it? What if I can‚Äôt forgive myself for walking away?",

Have you taken coffee breaks with people?‚Äù Why should I? Are they benefiting my life in anyway? Are they enriching my soul? Are they adding any value? No. They are just a bunch of alcoholics. They even drink at the office DURING WORK. For someone who doesn‚Äôt drink I don‚Äôt want to be around it. I wish I could just got to work, get out the general pleasantries, a brief overview of how you‚Äôre feeling today and then move the fuck on.My time is the most valuable thing that I have and will ever have, and I feel like people don‚Äôt understand that. I don‚Äôt live to work; I work to live. There‚Äôs a BIG difference.Thanks for attending my Ted Talk, have a great night! üëç",

I remember wanting to be outside, in the sun, where people could see. I apparently called my aunt, told her I was scared. Who then called my mom, who came to get me. I was lucky, i stayed in public so I don't think anything happened. The bride recently told me how guilty she felt, how other members of the wedding party just told her \"i got kicked out of the bar\" (apparently a waitress was concered about me). They told her not to worry, it was her night. I just feel sick because they left me there. They didn't care. It makes me feel burning in my chest. I was so scared before I blacked out and thinking about it all makes me sick. I'm lucky I had my mom to come save me. But how can I trust the average person?",

      "content_preview": "I've never really had a girlfriend in my 25 years, but a year ago now I went to smoke a cigarette behind my apartment complex and met a really nice, yet very shy girl. We talked for a bit and ever since then, we'd randomly meet multiple times on that bench behind the house when we both was outside smoking, and every time we had small conversations about stuff. I learnt she has a boyfriend who lives in the same complex as me, and that made me see her way more as just a friend because I didn't wanna ruin that for her.During these months of randomly meeting on that bench, I got to know a neighbor of mine who was also good friends with this girl, and through my neighbor I learnt that this girl's boyfriend was a real dickhead, he was manipulative, mean and constantly ignored her.We all became very good friends and began spending more and more time with eachother. I mostly talked to my neighbor because this girl was still very shy and wasn't too easy to talk to most of the time, while my neighbor was super easy to talk to.A bit more than a month ago, we all started planning on going on a trip and booking an AirBnB somewhere. We decided on a very nice little place like 1.5 hours away so we went there. During this time I found out she had broken up with her boyfriend.The trip was awesome, lots of fun, we had a bike ride that lasted 4 hours, she got a ride from me the whole time and we started talking more and more, we came back to the AirBnB at like 11pm and we all sat down to watch a movie. At this point me and her had kinda started feeling a connection, like something was there, and suddenly, during the movie, we started holding hands. Then when my neighbor went to bed, we kissed.After this trip, me and this girl have been seeing eachother every single day. She sleeps in my apartment, she's opened up to me about stuff she hasn't told a lot of people, and we've told eachother multiple times how much we like one another.I really like this girl, I don't wanna rush into anything but this honestly feels different from anything else I've ever felt. She is so genuine, kind and thoughtful and I feel nothing but respect and love towards her.Sorry for the long post but I just really wanted to share this, thanks for reading if you did! :)",

Thought about how I would get into my parents locked bedroom door where the guns are. Thought about how I should probably go in the backyard to do it so l wouldn't leave a big mess for my family to come home to. Thought about how my brother would be home soon to pick up his lawn care equipment in the back and would probably be the one to find me.Got discouraged, took another shot, got ready for work. Hung out with my niece for a bit after she got in from school. Got to work and laughed and cut up with all my coworkers/supervisor for 9 whole hours like nothing was wrong. ate lunch with my favorite coworker, talked about planned trips and vacations l'd like to go on as if l'll make it to that point, had a seemingly great day like everything was fine. Clocked out and came back home only to end up in the same thought process as this morning.No matter how bad life hurts you still have to clock in. Still be attentive to friends and family. This sucks. Thanks for coming 2 my ted talk",

Under normal circumstances, I would be there for her. I feel awful.She did nothing wrong. You see, she‚Äôs my brother‚Äôs child. My brother is a deadbeat so she doesn‚Äôt live with him (parents not together). He‚Äôs completely irrelevant to this story. She lives with her mom, we‚Äôll call her Heather.A year ago Heather and her boyfriend (call him Creepyrapist) went to Target with my GF. Long story short, Creepyrapist sexually assaulted my GF in the car and Heather did nothing about it and laughed about it. They both told my GF not to call the police.I confronted Creepyrapist about it, got into a fist fight with him, and he ran in his house to grab a weapon. It makes my blood boil that this inbred had the nerve to do something like this and now doesn‚Äôt want to stand his ground without a weapon.But nonetheless, police were called, nothing was done to due to lack of evidence, and three months later Heather‚Äôs daughter (my niece) was diagnosed with cancer.I feel bad for her I really do. I don‚Äôt want my niece to die. I care about her enough to say this and I know it wasn‚Äôt her fault.But I don‚Äôt want anything to do with these people. My family judges me and says ‚Äúhow could you not be there for your own niece‚Äù?Why tf would I support someone‚Äôs daughter when that same person laughed while my GF got assaulted. And stayed with the piece of trash who did it.It‚Äôs especially annoying that the same family members that say this didn‚Äôt give a shit when my GF got SA‚Äôd. Do you realize the lifelong trauma that can cause a person to have? I hate my family.Fuck these weirdos. Anyone who shrugs off sexual assault probably is a rapist themselves.Edit: forgot to add ages I‚Äôm 20 my gf is 19. Heather is 30 and Creepyrapist is 40! Gross.",

There was one picture where she is sitting on a chair wearing a very short gown and her feet and legs are out. I saw the picture and saved it on my phone. Whenever I looked at it I would get hard feeling guilty wanting to jerk off to it. So beginning of this year I was at home and decided to jerk off to that picture of her. It felt so good and I did again a few days later and I have been jerking off to that picture of her probably 40 times especially after I gym and in the toilets. I also saved a picture of her sitting at a pool wearing a bikini on holiday and I have jerked off to that picture as well plenty times as well. Even when she changed her WhatsApp profile picture of her sitting down wearing heels and leather pants, I saw it and did the same jerking off to her profile picture mostly after gym. She makes me explode my semen every week I can‚Äôt help it! I have not seen her in a couple months and fear I will behave and feel awkward around her when we meet next time. Any advice and if this is normal? True story by the way!",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôve been working at this office job for three years. It pays the bills but it‚Äôs boring and soul draining. A year ago I started a side hustle reselling weird vintage stuff I find at flea markets. Old cameras, strange toys, random collectibles. I never told anyone at work about it because it‚Äôs not really their businessLast week my boss came into my office holding this little 90s handheld game console. He said he bought it online for his kid and then he smiled and said the seller‚Äôs name looked familiar. It was meThe second he said it I felt my stomach drop. I don‚Äôt use my real name on the store but apparently the shipping label gave me away. He laughed and said he thought it was cool. But since then he keeps bringing it up in little comments like so how‚Äôs the black market empire or guess we don‚Äôt pay you enough if you have to hustle Pokemon cards on the sideI can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs joking or if he‚Äôs annoyed. Now I‚Äôm paranoid every time I clock in. It was my safe little escape from this job and suddenly it feels exposed. The stupid part is the side hustle makes me more money than the job does but I can‚Äôt quit yet because I need the health insuranceI just hate that he knows. I feel like a part of my life that was only mine got dragged into the fluorescent lights of the office. It‚Äôs making me resent him even though he didn‚Äôt technically do anything wrong. I just needed to get that off my chest because I can‚Äôt exactly vent about it to coworkers without it blowing up more",

      "content_preview": "My bf (29m) is a fucking loser and i (24f) can't leave him for some reason. When I met him he was so kind and romantic, he showered me with gifts and thoughtful dates. A couple months in we became an official couple, and he started sleeping over at my house so much he pretty much fully moved in.I later found out he only works part time. he eventually got a full time job and got fired from that one, and would go months without working. He then got another part time job, but only works 4 hour shifts on-call. He then got fired from his original per diem job due to attendance issues. His car almost always has car problems, so he relies on his friends and I to get to work and other places. He pretty much spends all day playing video games and smoking weed. I work a heavy schedule, 10 hour shifts, and sometimes come home and he hasn't cleaned or cooked, just sitting there gaming. He does help with some of the rent, but even then, the energy bill and grocery costs pretty much even out whatever he is paying. To be honest, I don't even think i'm physically attracted to him at this point. I have tried gently telling him countless times that he needs to get a drivers license and a stable job, he always just says he's trying and that he's never had a reliable car to take his drivers test.He has a sad backstory- mom died of cancer and father abandoned them, so he was raised by his aunt. He claims his childhood is why he is so far behind in life. As more time goes on i'm finding it hard to feel sympathy for him, as I also had a very traumatic and abusive childhood, ran away from my family and went no contact, yet have worked hard to sustain myself. I'm five years younger than him and physically disabled- yet have managed to get my own car and housing by the time i turned 21.I'm finding it hard to leave him because while he is lazy, he does at least keep my dog company and take him out while I work my long shifts. This helps me feel calmer knowing that my dog isn't being neglected while I work. He is also still so kind and understanding with me, and still does the kindest gestures for me when he can ( buy me flowers, coffee, etc). His has a strong bond with his family and friends, and they've all welcomed me as their own family. I don't know- just all of this is making it hard for me to let go. I fear that even if i find a more motivated stable man, what if they don't treat me as well as he does emotionally?",

      "content_preview": "Currently cancer free (as long as the upcoming scan is still clear). Around a year ago I had an auto stem cell transplant to stop my cancer coming back. I had non-hodgkins lymphoma (I‚Äôm 25m) which had already come back once.I was lonely during treatment as many of my friends ghosted me after my initial diagnosis. I had my family with me of course, but seeing them sad made me feel guilty. My closest friends visited when they could, but they live far away and have jobs and relationships. So I only ended up seeing them every few months.And during this whole period, I wished that I had a girlfriend. Someone who I could hold hands with. That I could cry with. That I could laugh with. Someone to hang out with. Someone who I didn‚Äôt have to be strong around.I tried to meet people on dating apps, but the only matches I got were either accidents or people telling me how I shouldn‚Äôt be on the apps cause I had cancer. I got some horrible messages during that time.And as treatment continued, it started to show. I lost my hair, I gained weight, I got paler, weaker. I looked sick. So naturally, no one was gonna give me a chance and get to know me. I wasn‚Äôt well enough to socialise in general. And even if I was, I didn‚Äôt have anyone to go with. My only option was online. Christmas 2022, I caught an infection that almost killed me. I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly and was put on high pressure oxygen that kept me alive. I was in hospital ICU from Christmas Eve to January 4th. I thought I was going to die there.I wasn‚Äôt scared of death really (I‚Äôm not religious), but I felt so alone. I wanted more than anything, to have someone to share love with.After I survived and got over that infection, I started radiotherapy in March 2023. It tired me out and gave me fatigue, which hasn‚Äôt gone away since. However, the treatment worked and I was cancer free by June 2023.That summer I decided to work on myself. I‚Äôd survived, I wanted to see people and find a relationship.I joined a swimming pool to lose the weight I‚Äôd gained. I attempted to see friends. But no one really had time. Especially seeing as I was cancer free, they didn‚Äôt need to see me anymore. And the after effects of my treatment hit me, so I couldn‚Äôt swim or exercise without pain all over my body. Not to mention, my hair didn‚Äôt come back the same way.I never got the cute curls you see people get on TikTok after chemo. No. I got tufty hair and bald patches. Hair growing in different direction and some of it feeling burnt, like straw.So there I was, fat, bald, pale and weak. But no excuse anymore cause I was cancer free. Plus tons of PTSD which I was in therapy for. Not that I‚Äôve ever found therapy that helpful.Well in March 2024 I had a follow up scan which highlighted something in my chest. They deflated my lung during surgery to get a biopsy. And lo and behold, cancer was back. So I started even more aggressive chemo. And then had the stem cell transplant.The chemo this time gave me brain fog. Which might not sound bad when written here, but it was horrendous. I can take pain, I can take nausea, weakness and other physical changes. I can take those things because no matter what, I had my mind to fall back on. I had that safe space that I could escape to.The brain fog took that from me. I was confused and slow. And my brain has never felt the same since. I think things through slightly slower. I stammer more. I lose my train of thought often. It‚Äôs a constant reminder of what I‚Äôve endured. I hate it.I don‚Äôt even want to start on the stem cell transplant period. It was horrendous. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say. So many side effects in the worst places.After all that, I‚Äôm left with even more long term after effects of the treatment. Like even more body pain and fatigue. But now I have a heart that skyrockets in heart rate when I do anything. And it feels like I‚Äôm going to collapse every time it does.So can‚Äôt even lose the weight. Still patchy burnt hair. Still pale. I look hideous.I have a compromised immune system thanks to the stem cell transplant. Thankfully I‚Äôll get my childhood vaccines starting this month. (I‚Äôm not antivax lol, stem cell transplants wipe your vaccines away so you have to get them all again. Even childhood ones). So, thanks to the immune system I can‚Äôt socialise much. But once again, who would I socialise with? I can‚Äôt get a job due to my health. I‚Äôm on disability. My friends are either too busy, live far away or don‚Äôt care.I get so jealous seeing my friends‚Äô lives on social media. Their lives didn‚Äôt stop. They kept going. Now they‚Äôve got houses, relationships, nice jobs. It feels like I‚Äôve been left behind.I saw my best friend make a joke on Twitter about potentially getting engaged soon. And I should‚Äôve felt happy for her. But I felt jealousy and resentment. If I hadn‚Äôt gotten cancer, would I have a normal life too? Would I be busy with a job and living somewhere else in the country? Would I have a long term relationship with someone?I‚Äôm so so lonely. And I don‚Äôt know what to do that‚Äôll make it better. If my cancer comes back I‚Äôm not doing treatment. I‚Äôd only be doing it for my family‚Äôs sake. And I can‚Äôt do it again.Life after cancer sucks. I‚Äôm just thankful I live in the UK so the treatment was free.I think that‚Äôs my vent over.I‚Äôm in therapy, so please don‚Äôt tell me to get therapy lol.",

Sure he has a temper, and he‚Äôs punched holes in doors and broken things on occasion, but he‚Äôs never hurt me before.Last night he was drunk, he has been drinking since noon, and it was late and he just started yelling at me‚Ä¶ literally for over an hour. He was just not giving up so I was basically just letting him get it out.I was super exhausted from such a long day (we had just attended a work party that was over 7 hours long) but he kept insisting that I sit up and solve this, or get it through my head or whatever. I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore at a certain point it just felt like it wasn‚Äôt going to end, so I told him I was going to call the cops. He laughed at me and said ‚Äúno you‚Äôre not‚Äù and he was right, I was just feeling really stuck, so I said I was going to call his mom and I picked up my phone and he climbed on top of me and smacked me really hard. It made my ears ring and my hearing went away and never fully came back in that ear. He started crying and so I just held him for a long time. Idk I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.I got checked out today. The eardrum was damaged and my husband has been treating me like a princess all day and begging for forgiveness. I just feel really off and spacey. Maybe I‚Äôm disassociating? When he brought me flowers and cleaned the house I told him ‚Äúshit, you should hit me more often!‚Äù And we had a good laugh, but I definitely don‚Äôt want him to hit me anymore and part of me feels ‚Ä¶ broken? I love him. I don‚Äôt think I ever won‚Äôt, even if he kept doing this‚Ä¶ but like‚Ä¶ how do you cope with this? Is this statistically likely to happen again? Do you think he‚Äôs actually sorry or do you think this is a show? He does keep bringing it up and hugging me‚Ä¶ but it also kinda fucked with me that he yelled at me so much and said so much shitty stuff and denied he was drunk like 10 times‚Ä¶ it made me think he wasn‚Äôt drunk and he just was just finally telling me the truth.",

      "content_preview": "I went to my uni friend‚Äôs birthday dinner recently and honestly, I didn‚Äôt even want to go. I‚Äôm not a fan of big social events because they get really overstimulating for me, and I don‚Äôt exactly have the biggest social battery. But he invited me, and since it was his birthday, I didn‚Äôt want to say no out of politeness.The thing is, me and him are complete opposites. We‚Äôre both gay, but in totally different ways. He‚Äôs super open about it, very social, high maintenance, and honestly loves the attention (which is totally fine and i have no problem with that). Meanwhile, I‚Äôm much more private and introverted, I don‚Äôt like broadcasting my personal life, and I‚Äôd rather stay lowkey. He also has this habit of clout-chasing by telling other people things I‚Äôve told him in confidence, which just makes me not want to share anything with him anymore. He did it again at his birthday dinner, and it was so uncomfortable. I‚Äôve tried pointing it out politely before, but he always brushes it off.On top of that, I‚Äôve basically become his unpaid therapist. He‚Äôs always venting about his boyfriend and personal drama, and I feel like I have to listen even when I‚Äôm mentally drained.Now, to be fair he‚Äôs not a bad friend. He‚Äôs actually helped me a lot, like giving me rides to home, and even being there for me when I was hospitalized. So I do appreciate him, and that‚Äôs probably why I feel guilty about wanting distance. But at the same time, all of this has been coming at the expense of my own mental health.I also felt so awkward going to the dinner because I didn‚Äôt have any nice clothes for it. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone if he didn‚Äôt ask to use my place to get ready, of course, I couldn‚Äôt say no (me being the people pleaser I am). So I went, sat through the dinner and karaoke, and just felt awkward and out of place the whole time.The worst part is that since we‚Äôre studying the same degree and have same classes, I can‚Äôt really avoid him. I don‚Äôt want to be close with him or his circle because we‚Äôre just too different, but it feels impossible to create distance without being the ‚Äúbad guy.‚ÄùNot really asking for advice just needed to let this out because keeping it in has been eating me up.",

      "content_preview": "Pay + ExploitationI worked in the testing department across all their IPs, hopping from brand to brand at short notice. I‚Äôd even moved countries for the position.The salary was meagre. I signed the contract anyway because, like a lot of young professionals, I wanted to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù in the industry. But the highly specialised skillset they demanded was worth far more than what we earned.Most new staff literally starved the week before payday. One October, I had to live on ‚Äúsurvivalist food‚Äù just to get by. When the living wage increased, they were forced to give everyone fake ‚Äúpromotions‚Äù just to stay legal.Sexism + Double StandardsThere were only four women in the entire office. My female superiors were pushed into admin tasks that men didn‚Äôt have to do, and they often faced lewd comments behind closed doors.One colleague made a sexual remark about me. Everyone laughed at my expense. Totally normal in male-dominated tech spaces. Unsurprising.Rules were also different for me. The men would take hour-long paid coffee breaks at 3pm with no issues. If I split my 30-min lunch into two 15-min breaks? I got penalised.Medical DiscriminationI have a health condition and take medication. I was upfront about this from day one.Still, I was treated differently. When everyone else earned the right to WFH, I was denied. They said they didn‚Äôt ‚Äútrust‚Äù me because I was on medication. I should have left then, but I stayed because I loved the field.Later, HR demanded I disclose every detail of my condition, including exact names of meds - or risk being fired. Pretty sure that‚Äôs illegal. I even paid for a doctor‚Äôs note.Music + JealousyOutside of work, I wrote, produced, and performed electronic music. Lots of us had side gigs, and it was allowed contractually.My music started to gain traction. My flatmates once heard me mixing and called me ‚Äúthe next Radiohead.‚Äù I was happy about my fresh, unique sound.Then word spread at work. The new head of department, a man in his 40s, seemed weirdly threatened by me. I think he resented that I was a woman making my own music while also excelling technically. Insecure men often lash out when women ‚Äúupstage‚Äù them.Retaliation + FiringThat same week, he bad-mouthed me to my manager behind my back.I got disciplined for learning a languageduring my lunch break. Then, the day after my first (unpaid) live gig, I was let go on the spot. No severance. No notice. They even mentioned my live gigbeforefiring me.My manager even wrote in the company chat about my strangely sudden departure from the company.‚ÄúDO NOT RESPOND. DO NOT REACT.‚ÄùInstant isolation. My friends and colleagues were terrified to talk to me for fear of losing their jobs.CollapseThe stress wrecked my health. I unintentionally started starving. I was so traumatised and embarrassed I avoided public places in case I bumped into ex-colleagues. I was terrified of retaliation from the man who slandered me.Somehow, I still landed a much higher paying role while literally going weeks without food. My sodium levels dropped so low I ended up in the ER. But sadly the hospital staff also neglected me too.Eventually, I lost all hope. I sadly attempted to end my life. The pain was too much. My father found me just in time. I was 29.AftermathIt‚Äôs been a year of fighting my way back. I‚Äôve lost critical opportunities, future earnings, and confidence. I spent 14+ years of my life dedicated to music, only to be cut down violently just at the very moment before I could bloom.Why Am I Sharing This?I don‚Äôt want pity. I just want people to know how exploitative, sexist, and discriminatory certain companies within the industry can be and how quickly they can destroy you out of spite or jealousy. Especially if you don't fit the mold. Watch yourself out there.If you‚Äôre going through something similar please, protect your health first. No job no \"dream\" is worth losing that. Professional sabotage is much more common than we want to think.",

      "content_preview": "A long time ago, my boyfriend and I shared our locations with one another as it made it more convenient. iPhones. It was nice to be able to see if he was on his way home without having to text him and distracting him. Or hey, he‚Äôs at the store still, let me call him to ask to pick up something. And partly because of past insecurity to because he was texting other women when we first got together and lying about petty stuff.Never had an issue until about 6 months ago, it said ‚Äúlocation not available.‚Äù I asked him about it and we went through his settings to see if it was something simple, tried unsharing and resharing, and honestly I haven‚Äôt thought about it much. I didn‚Äôt really want to because every thread I find says it was done on purpose and I don‚Äôt want to fight about it. I don‚Äôt think he is cheating on me, or else I would have left him years ago.It just kind of upset me he didn‚Äôt care I couldn‚Äôt see his. If I call, he always has some attitude about me calling him to ask.Like dude, I just want to know if you are coming home because I stayed up to cook dinner because you were supposed to get off an hour ago‚Ä¶. and you still haven‚Äôt messaged me back about coming home and I was supposed to sleeping because I have to get up in, now, 5 hours and you STILL ain‚Äôt on your way and I‚Äôm hungry‚Ä¶. lolIt never once worked whenever I checked so one day, just 3 days ago, I turned my location off since whatever, I don‚Äôt know if he still utilizes it. Like I said, I haven‚Äôt used his in 6 months, and I haven‚Äôt had much of a problem minus not knowing what hospital he was being transported to one time and small stuff. I only asked the one time and mentioned it an offhanded a few times since when I call to ask where he is, that‚Äôs it. About 3 days later, he asks me why I turned mine off and his magically started working again despite swearing he didn‚Äôt change the settings at all.He hypothesized it is because he has 2 phones, one without service. But he has connected to the WiFi every single day and it legit has never showed so. I don‚Äôt know. Any clarity from anyone? I don‚Äôt want to believe he did it intentionally, but it does hurt my feelings he never cared until I turned mine off",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone!I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know how to start this post. I‚Äôm afraid people might blame me, because I keep blaming myself for everything that‚Äôs happening.I‚Äôm 25 now, but when I was 19, I started talking to a man online. He was 48 at the time (he‚Äôs from another country, which makes me feel a little better about it). Looking back, I know I never should have started talking to him, but it went on and off for about two years before I finally ended it. He had started to scare me, he got possessive, acting like he owned me. I told him clearly that I had no plans to take things further, and after that, I blocked him on every platform.That‚Äôs when he began sending me multiple emails a day, threatening that he‚Äôd ‚Äúsend something‚Äù to my house if I didn‚Äôt respond. I ignored him, never replied, and eventually deleted that account. A month later, he started reaching out to my siblings on social media, asking about me, even writing poems for me. It scared me, but thankfully they never replied either. Then, for about a year and a half, he disappeared.But just a few days ago, he contacted my siblings again. This time it was through email, he sent a photo and wrote that he misses me. And that really shook me. It made me realize he still hasn‚Äôt let go. Some of my friends think he does this out of boredom, maybe late at night when he can‚Äôt sleep. Either way, it unsettled me. He‚Äôs a coward, in my eyes, especially since he has kids my age.I know I could send him an anonymous message, threatening to tell his employer and even expose him to his kids and their friends. But I won‚Äôt do that, because I know what he really wants is a reaction.So, I‚Äôm just going to wait it out and hope it fizzles again. Still, I can‚Äôt stop feeling disturbed and guilty. I keep blaming myself for ever talking to him in the first place. Back then I was vulnerable and leaned on him, and now I feel bad that my family is being dragged into this mess.",

      "content_preview": "Neurodivergent individual who feels like life is crumbling bc I don‚Äôt have many close relationships.Friend cancelled on me twice, didn‚Äôt apologize but said we couldn‚Äôt do activity because we didn‚Äôt have enough people (even though it was one of those activities where they combine smaller groups). Rearranged schedule and stated that I was feeling frustrated and asked why the group size was important? Left on read and when I followed up, I asked what was going on and how I felt a bit frustrated as the ability to activity was ending soon and would‚Äôve appreciated more heads up if size was bigger deal. Halfway through conversation, they started spouting personal life things and being short, which I didn‚Äôt know or had clue and has expressed I was sorry those things were happening. Felt bad for saying I was frustrated but at the same time, they never communicated so. In that friendship, they were stubborn and sometimes self-centered but it was my longest friendship.I feel like I can‚Äôt keep friendships that well. If I express that I‚Äôm frustrated, they always get offended. I get mixed signals and sometimes I wonder if I should never mention anything.There was one that decided to go on a trip with someone else instead of me and when I wrangled it out of them and asked for them just to be honest next time, they said they wanted to end friendship for years and brought up things from years past that I had no clue. One asked me to be a reference for them cause I knew them so well, but then got mad when I wished they would celebrate my birthday like their other friends. Even smaller things where people flake on me last minute when I had to buy something for event, and I said it was ok but asked for more advanced notice. It feels like everyone is always mad I expressed a feeling and instead I should just ignore it and let things fade out.Also, my most stable relationship is my partner who is figuring out whether they are trans or genderfluid. There was some hint they were in the LGBTQIA spectrum and encouraged they go to therapy but dragged their feet until recently. Have always been there for them but felt burnt out as a partner for emotionally supporting them all the time.Basically, just wanted to rant and feel less alone and sad.",

One day I even saw him eating my leftovers like it was no big deal.I never told HR, never made a scene. Instead I started cooking pasta with an absurd amount of chili paste mixed into the sauce. To me it was edible, I like spicy food. To anyone else it was basically poison.I left it in the fridge with my name on it and waited. Sure enough it went missing. About fifteen minutes later I heard choking and gagging from the break room. He came out sweating, red face, guzzling milk straight from the carton.Nobody ever knew it was me who set that trap. The food thefts stopped cold after that day. I never told anyone at work, and honestly I still laugh about it when I think back.",

      "content_preview": "Recently, I was on a video call with my mom. She noticed the background of my room and said, ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs a lot of shoes!‚Äù I laughed and even turned the camera so she could see more, like I was showing off. Then I joked, ‚ÄúWell of course, when I was a kid, I didn‚Äôt have any shoes.‚Äù She went quiet. Her smile faded. In that silence, I could feel the guilt and sadness creeping in. She was probably remembering the times when she just couldn‚Äôt afford to buy me a pair. After the call, I cried.I remembered my primary school graduation. My mom had to borrow shoes from my cousin because she couldn‚Äôt buy me new ones. They were too big, so I had to wear extra socks just to make them fit. I remembered my first day at McDonald‚Äôs as a service crew. My shoes were ripped at the front, so I patched them with black electrical tape to hide it. And maybe that‚Äôs why now, as an adult, I buy shoes. Maybe too many. Not to brag, but because each pair feels like proof that I‚Äôve healed that little boy who once had none.But here‚Äôs the painful part: it was never really about the shoes. It was about my mom‚Äôs face that day. That sudden sadness in her eyes. Because I know she was thinking, ‚ÄúIf only I could have back then‚Ä¶‚Äù If she could have bought me decent shoes, she would have. But she couldn‚Äôt. So every pair of shoes I own now isn‚Äôt just for me. It‚Äôs for that little boy who once taped up his broken sneakers just to get by. And it‚Äôs for my mom, for her sacrifices, for her quiet pain, and for the love that made me strong enough to walk forward, even when I had nothing on my feet.",

We're all in our early 20s, pretty attractive, but all single. At first I didn't think anything of it, but I'm starting to realise that this guy was right and we really are keeping each other single. Every time one of us meets a guy, it seems like all the girls jump at him and tear him to pieces. \"Oh he's a huge red flag\", \"you can do better\", \"he sounds abusive\" etc etc. I admit it, I've done it too once, but it was only because this guy was 43 and was going after my friend who at the time was 22. But the other girls will literally tear any guy apart for even stupid reasons. Every guy I was ever interested in, they would be okay with it at first but as soon as the guy showed interest back, they'd immediately say something bad about him and how I'm better off single.And now I can't stop thinking about what this guy told me about how single girls keep girls single. I'm not telling any of them the next time honestly. I'm tired of this. Sorry, just wanted to take it off my chest.",

      "content_preview": "So hmm it all started on the drive home with my dad. To note I've been really really sick lately to the point I've had terrible migraines, my voice completely disappeared and I also had a terrible day at work yesterday. On the drive, my dad always listens loudly to these Christian videos or shorts on YouTube and I told him the volume is really loud. He proceeds to tell me I got devils in me and I correct him on saying I don't care what the content of the videos are its loud, my head hurts can he turn it down. He proceeds to berate me still saying I've got devils in me and starts questing my belief in God, how I don't pray ect. Out of frustration I tell him again its on the volume and said he should shut up (I regretted saying that). He called me a devil and put the volume so high it caused my headache to get so bad.We got home I immediately got out of the car, went to my room took some pain tablets and got ready for bed. He then went to my mother saying I was disrespect, telling him to shut up. She confronted me and when I wanted to say my side she told me she doesn't want to hear anything. I then started to shout (my voice is completely gone at this point you cannot hear me if I talk normally) what he had done and they both shout at he they don't want to hear my side. He tells me to stop shouting and shout back how he's wrong in this situation. He then gets up in my face and starts pointing in my face, tapping my nose mockingly. I smack his hand out of my face and told him not to do that and treat me this way. He then shoved me into the corner of my room (he's quite a large man, 58 did bodybuilding when he was younger) and says little girl you better stop this (I'm 28F and small built ) and out of fear I smack him. He said do that again and I smacked him on the neck, he stuck back and I almost tumbled to the side. My mother finally gets in and back him away from me. I shouted at him to get out of my room, saying how he has no right to treat me like this, how I'm in pain and he just replied I'm defiant.I slammed my door shut and got into bed, my mother came in a while later still defending him and I shut it in her face closed. She told him what I did and I came out my room telling her she wouldn't hear me out I won't hear her out and she's not allowed in my room I signed a lease renting the room and I've paid my month's rent.I fell asleep and heard the two of them talking how I have a defiant rebellious spirit in me and after that I just zoned out and went to sleep.I couldn't get up to go to work today so I called in sick and am going to the doctor. I have a fever again and my voice is barely a whisper. I know I'm old, I've been staying here because I'm finishing my law degree and they're that old school parents of me getting married out the house. I want to leave but am not in a financial situation to leave and my little sister is still in the house I can't leave her. I'm questing if I'm wrong... I don't know.I'm bad at telling stuff, English isn't my first language, sorry.",

This is another way in which you'll continue being here with us. I'll take care of them.They keep saying me you're with mom now, but it doesn't make it easier.

      "content_preview": "I need to share something that‚Äôs been weighing on me. Recently, I experienced harassment near my campus that left me feeling unsafe and targeted. This is the first time I‚Äôve dealt with anything of this magnitude, and it has affected me deeply.This isn‚Äôt just about the incident itself‚Äîit‚Äôs personal. I‚Äôve lost three close friends under traumatic circumstances, worked as an EMT abroad seeing life-and-death situations, and I live with PTSD symptoms. All of this made the harassment particularly overwhelming and emotionally difficult to process.I‚Äôm sharing this because I want others to know that experiences like this are real and can happen to anyone. I hope that by telling my story, it can help someone else recognize when behavior crosses the line and encourage them to document it and seek support. Writing this feels like a step toward processing it and reminding myself that it‚Äôs okay to reach out for help.",

      "content_preview": "So I(20m) have been working for a food joint for a while where I work with a couple people in the back room making sandwiches and salads. Well about a week ago I started feeling a bit weird but just talked it up to a general stomach bug because they're really prevalent right now in my area. Well I get to work and I'm feeling a bit rough and I'm working there for about 2 hours before my coworker comes in, let's call him jacob. Jacob is a really weird guy, pretty antisocial and doesn't really know how to talk to people, but if you can't pass his really dry humor is a pretty good guy. I've hung out with him outside of work a couple times but I'm not 100% sure I'd say we're close. Well he's also incredibly observant, obsessively watches and listens to true crime and scary stories and has in fact the saved the company thousands one time when he could tell one of our ovens was going out just by the way he felt the heat unevenly when he pulled out a sandwich. Well whenever he came in he started looking at me weirdly and was staring. Again he's weird so I kind of ignore for a little while and keep up my work. About 20 minutes later he comes up to me and tells me to exhale in his face. This is probably the most weird request I've ever had in my life, but I was caught so off guard I just lean forward and exhailed in his face. This man takes a deep breath for a moment rubs his nose and then his eyes suddenly go wide and tells me I need to get to a hospital. I do not take him seriously at first, thinking it was some weird joke but he's incredibly insistent and calls in the manager then drag me out to his car and drives me off to the hospital about a street over. Guys, I've diabetes. I had no idea, but apparently he just saved my life because I was on the verge of going catatonic. He says that apparently he could tell my skin was slightly off color and apparently my breath was sweet smelling? I had no idea that was really a thing, but apparently he was able to tell that I was diabetic and got me to the hospital and saved my life. I honestly have no idea what to do with us, I've been mostly dealing with the diagnosis and everything that goes along with it and haven't really seen him since took some time off to deal with it. But like, do I just say thanks for saving my life bro? Do I get him a meal? He saved my life!",

      "content_preview": "Stumbling upon some information online, I came to understand that I have COMPLEX TRAUMA. Experiencing love and finding someone who reciprocated my feelings was exhilarating, yet it caused me to lose my sense of purpose and direction. I invested everything into the relationship, only to end up losing it all. My partner, who likely carried some trauma of her own but was still clinging to life, struggled to navigate our situation and ultimately broke my heart when I was at my lowest point. I don‚Äôt hold any resentment towards her; I just wish we had both been aware of what was unfolding, as we were both blinded, which ultimately impacted us both in the end. From my perspective, I lost the woman I cherished deeply and all my financial stability, having spent all my money on the relationship and other coping mechanisms. On her end, she will face challenges in finding genuine love again, but I won‚Äôt delve into specifics.What truly frustrates and saddens me is the necessity to relearn life. For eight years, my overachiever syndrome shaped me into the best version of myself. However, once I entered the relationship, I let my guard down, believing I was beside a brave, strong, and authentic woman. The inner child within me gave everything, only to lose it all. I‚Äôm certain she witnessed it unfold in slow motion and allowed it to happen, knowing she would eventually leave me. Now, as I sit here at 2:34 am, wanting to purchase something but falling short by a few dollars, I feel a wave of sadness wash over me. I remind myself that I have to relearn everything about life from scratch, including all the systems that define adulthood. I used to have plenty of cash, nice cars, and would buy extravagant gifts for my ex. Now, I find myself alone since she left, with no material possessions to my name. This situation has been the most challenging of my life.Complex Trauma is a serious matter. My life has been tough since childhood, and I hadn‚Äôt truly examined my experiences until recently. Yet, I possess a big heart and am a kind person. It‚Äôs disheartening, but I must mature while navigating adulthood. If you‚Äôre reading this and it resonates with your past relationship, I want you to know you're not alone.",

      "content_preview": "I 24M recently broke up with ex girlfriend 21F a little over a month ago in July and I regret it. Not seeking advice or comfort and it's all entirely my fault. My ex and I were together for 1 year 7 months. We have a baby together 1F and she has a baby she had in the relationship before ours 2F. It started out wonderfully where we met on a dating app where neither of us expected either of us to respond since we both really liked each other from the start so I initiated our first conversation. I was afraid she didn't like me from the start like I did but turns out she fell in love with me immediately as did I. We became a couple a few days after first meetup and we became physical about a week later. She got pregnant within that same week. Our relationship was great leading up to the birth to our baby given she almost died in the process of giving birth. Our daughter was born preemie but she's extremely healthy and happy. During our relationship we've been evicted 3 times, I lost 2 vehicles and 4 jobs. Ill skip to the 3rd eviction. My girlfriend and I were living separately at the time and she had both girls. I was working at Amazon for the 4th time and the stress of the living conditions was getting to me and I was getting aggravated so I broke one of the monitors on one of the stations I was working on becuse it wasnt working and I was upset which led to me getting put on a paid suspension. After getting suspended the pay I was gettting was helpful towards our new apartment which she was using her taxes to pay for the deposit and first month's rent. I was able to sustain the suspended payments for rent for about 4 to 5 months before they stopped. After the payments stopped my girlfriend got a job at a Waffle House right next to our apartment. This is where I make the biggest fuck up. While my girlfriend was working I was at home taking care of the girls and looking for work as well. Eventually I did get a field sales job which looked promising so I agreed to it and successfully made it through all 3 interviews. The sad part is that my girlfriend had to quit her job since the waffle house she worked at only did delivery only and wasnt 24 hours so there was no night shift. I worked there for 26 days and never got paid until I demanded a payment after I got fired which eventually led us up to our 3rd eviction since the payment I got was shitty. Not even 500 bucks. After the 3rd eviction I knew we were getting separated again so I broke up with her. I initiated the break up because I didn't want to keep putting her and the kids in these situations that I caused. She wanted to take a break instead for a year so we can get ourselves together and get our lives on track with being more financially responsible and getting jobs we can keep and I declined because I didn't want to burden her with having to wait for me to get my shit together when she could find a more suitable man that can give her what she needs when she needs it. Fast forward to today. It's been a month and I'm still single but my girlfriend has already moved on and found another man who coincidentally has the same name as me. I did get a new job working in logistics as a broker and I've been working there since the beginning of August about a week after the break up. Now I spend most of my time throughout the day thinking of my daughter and missing my ex. My love for her is still as powerful as it was when we first met. This is all my fault. Fortunately I get to spend time with my daughter this weekend after a month of being a way from her. Sad thing I feel about it is I don't think she remembers that I'm her father. I want to keep spending time with her but it's uncomforting trying to talk to her on video call with my ex on camera with her current boyfriend. When I can afford it. I'm going to a therapist. Hopefully it helps. Thanks for reading.",
