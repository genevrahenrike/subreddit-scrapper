      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I have been feeling bloated and terrible since stopping taking birth control a couple months ago. The main reason to take is to control my cycle that had never been regular due to a prolactinoma disorder and the reason to stop was elevated bw levels. Since then I have been feeling terrible and gained 10lbs in six months. I have always struggled to maintain a healthy weight despite being very athletic and going to the gym 5 times a week. I have an endocrinologist but he always told me that that’s the reality for people with hormonal conditions. Hoping to get answers and trying to see if there was anything else going on with me, I decided to try Allara Health. I went to the initial visit where I was requested to do labs, not a lot of information. Everything looked fine on the labs, but in my second visit I was told I have Insulin resistance and should be started on Zepbound. They even checked and seemed that my insurance would cover. Of course I am tempted to start the meds and relieved to knowing that may be a reason behind all my failed attempts of loosing weight. HOWEVER, the provider told me it can take years to be off of meds so I declined the prescription. I stopped the pill because I want to be healthier and less dependent of meds and I just feel in my heart that I shouldn’t go down this route. I guess I am looking for solace and hoping to learn from others that got normal or better naturally….",

When I’m paying attention, I have a 55g protein shake for breakfast and fast 12-16 hours, I try to get 25-30g of fibre in and calculate my carbs to fibre math (where you divide your fibre into your carbs to keep it below 5, don’t know the name of it). I don’t count calories. I’ve definitely made baby steps to forming healthier habits but I feel like it’s not enough. I’m trying to cut more of the sugars from my life but I just keep going back to them. I’m too old to eliminate them all together so please don’t suggest it (although I know if you do then you don’t crave them). Anyway, just looking for some advice on how to take my IR more seriously so I can fix it. Thanks.",

      "content_preview": "I had seen many doctors over the past year and none of them ever tested me for insulin despite me being concerned that I was gaining weight so fast. I was skinny all my life, and then in my 3rd year of college I randomly started putting on weight. It’s been increasing since no matter what I did and dieted, when it used to be so easy for me. My family has a history of diabetes. Yesterday I went to see an NP and for the first time she actually went into my records and chart and looked at the trends. I was having a difficult time dealing with the fact I had gained so much weight in such a short period of time. I’m 24, and I had asked to inquire about ozempic. She then looked at my previous tests and saw everything looked good, but I had never been tested for insulin before. I guess everything always looked good so providers brushed it off as me overeating too much—but I feel I was eating relatively fine and exercising enough. Turns out my insulin was at 28, which is high. And it’s why losing weight was so hard for me these past years. I feel frustrated that it took so long for someone to figure out what was going on or even bothered to carefully assess and listen to me. But im also relieved I caught it early in my 20’s. Anyways, now im hoping to start medication to help lower my insulin, and hopefully get back to weight I had before when I was 20-21. I had gained about 60 lbs and no one bothered to question it, even when I was concerned and wondering why I kept putting on weight easily when I never had this issue before.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all! Didn’t know if anyone has/had similar experiences to this. Recently diagnosed and in the “early stages” of IR. I was on 500mg ER of Metformin for about 2 weeks. Ended up deciding to stop because I am struggling to eat and subsequently losing weight (I’m only 135lbs). The only things I could stomach to eat in the beginning were the BRAT diet. Stomach issues the entire time. I felt nauseous but never threw up. But I’d have to go to the bathroom a lot. Then after almost a week I took Metamucil and didn’t go at all for days. It did slowly get a little better but eating was still a struggle. I’d have a protein shake for breakfast, maybe some applesauce and yoghurt with berries and granola for lunch (all I could stomach most days, but I didn’t enjoy the sweetness anymore) and then by dinner I’d get so hungry then I’d eat the meat portion of a meal and a few bites of whatever on the side and that’s all I can finish. I get full so much faster. Then of course if I had anything with sugar or carbs I’d crash soon after the meal. Well I’ve been off the metformin for 3 or 4 days and the last few days particularly in the morning have been rough. I wake up exhausted, weak, like my limbs can’t support me, I feel so heavy, and when I’m in the shower I’ve had to sit otherwise I see spots (even with warm/cool water). I was crying on the way out the door and looking at my boyfriend like “there’s something wrong but I don’t know what”. But once I got to work and ate breakfast and had something to drink it got better, but still fatigued. I went to bed hours early the past few nights and have had zero energy to do much of anything except relax. I went to my primary care and they chalked it up to being dehydrated from the Metformin. I didn’t think it was that but after some water and electrolytes I do feel better. Showered last night so I wouldn’t have to this morning and I feel better today than I have in days which is nice. I guess what I’m getting at is does anyone else struggle in the morning? I feel like I don’t feel good at all until I eat. My goal is to start keeping water at my bedside table and drink a whole bottle before I leave for work and have something sort of healthy snack/breakfast as soon as I get up otherwise my body hates me. It’s just annoying. Like you can’t wait an hour for me to get to work when I’m able to eat? Since stopping Metformin I’ve been taking 250 berberine to slowly ween into it. Haven’t gone to the bathroom in about 2 or 3 days which is frustrating. We’ll see if it gets better.",

      "content_preview": "I’ve always been a plus sized person, but I always fluctuated around the same weight. A year or two ago I went on a weight loss journey, and I was able to lose an incredible amount of weight, but it was WAY harder than it should’ve been. After a year or so I simply stopped losing weight, everyone said I was in a plateau. I waited several months for this “plateau” to end and it never did, so eventually I became discouraged and told myself I’d give myself a break and just “maintain”. Even with the “maintaining”, I somehow gained all the weight back and then some. I am now the heaviest I have ever been. I started trying to lose weight again, and I couldn’t, I always just seemed to gain. I finally spoke to my primary who didn’t seem to take me seriously and tried to prescribe me ozempic, and my insurance denied it. Then I ended up with high blood pressure, I now take a medicine every day for that. Recently I started noticing a brown ring around my neck and knew it was a sign of insulin resistance, I wanted to see an endocrinologist but unfortunately the soonest appt isn’t until December, so I went to my primary and asked him about it, also told him about some other symptoms I’ve been having (fatigue, brain fog etc) My fasting insulin was 48.1. Hemoglobin A1c was 5.4. Thyroid was 4.35. Estradiol was 46 (and my dr had me get the labs done when I was menstruating so this would be at its highest). Progesterone was 0.5. My doctor was essentially saying everything looks fine and this was expected for someone who’s overweight. I told him I was worried about my insulin levels and he ended up giving me metformin 500mg and it’s making me feel extremely sick. Idk. I just don’t know what to do. Maybe this is all normal for someone my size, but I just can’t help but feel like my weight gain is a symptom, not the cause. I was wondering if anyone has been through something similar and what I can do",

Today I just feel crappy, like a hangover with aches, fatigue, and some nausea. I have some liquid B-complex coming in the mail, as suggested by my PC. I already know about avoiding sugar and fats. My main question is: Will Tylenol or something help with the aches? Also: what do you do for the nausea? Peppermint? And: How long did it take your body to become acclimated? My IR symptoms besides weight gain and elevated glucose are some foot neuropathy and very severe exertion intolerance. I can’t walk more than half a mile without stopping to vomit. I remember that happening when I joined the track team in high school, but only after running hard for miles. I really want to get moving again!",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys hope you are doing well. I wanted to see if anyone else here is dealing with a mix of conditions like POTS, MCAS, histamine intolerance, migraines, and insulin resistance . How you’ve been managing or improving insulin resistance (diet, lifestyle, meds, supplements, etc.). Things you’ve tried that worked versus things that didn’t work . Whether you’ve noticed that viruses or infections affect your blood sugar (I’ve been wondering if there’s a connection). How food intolerances/migraines fit into the picture for you. I’d really appreciate hearing from others who are navigating this mix of issues—what’s helped you, what hasn’t, and how you’re managing day to day. Thanks in advance 🙏",

Until last year, my fasting glucose would hover around 100-102. Now, it's usually between 93-97. I had no idea I was supposed to check actual insulin levels too, so last year I tested it to be 24.1. This time it reduced slightly to 23.26. It's been very hard for me to lose weight, but I have been doing IF and basically given up dinners for good. I can't remember the last time I ate something past 5 PM. Been taking berberine for some 5 months now. Overall, HOMA-IR reduced from 6.1 to 5.6, but my HbA1c is stabilised at 5.6% for a while now. This feels too little improvement for a period of 1 year. Please give me hope and tell me it's still good enough :(",

All I'm doing is eating small, more frequent meals and low GI foods. For exercise, I do about 10-30 minutes of walking/dancing/pilates or whatever I'm in the mood for after eating. Following this routine I have been slowly loosing some weight. My mother in the other hand does not support me. She keeps buying me sweets, offering me meals which I should be avoiding and telling me I shouldnt lose more weight, I'm already skinny, it's unhealthy to cut out sugar etc. I'm 183cm and 86.6kg so I am overweight, even if not by much. She does not understand that I'm finally taking my health seriously. What should I do to make her understand that I'm doing this for my health and get her to stop trying to undermine my progress?",

I wanted a second opinion so I went to my GP and showed him my results. He said that everything looks good and I have nothing to worry about. He said that the insulin resistance number didn’t matter and the AC1 was all he was focused on. I am now confused. I trust both doctors and definitely felt like I had some insulin resistance. Apron belly, struggle to lose weight, ovarian cysts, fatigue… I’ve been told I have endometriosis but haven’t had surgery to prove it. Anyway, I just needed to rant. I have definitely cut back my carbs anyway but I’m not going keto or being super strict about it. Not really sure what else to do! Edit: thank you all so much for your advice.

      "content_preview": "After years of trying to get my doctor to test my insulin levels I got a result of 72.7 mcIU/mL when the normal range is meant to be between 2.6 - 24.9. My endocrinologist is who ordered my labs. I already am gluten free for my Hashimotos and PCOS and I don’t eat sugary foods or sodas. I typically don’t have more than 20g of added sugar per day. I understand that what typical doctors will tell you is probably just that I need to exercise more and eat less, but with my already existing health conditions that’s basically impossible without an intervention.",
