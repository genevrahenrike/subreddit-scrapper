We’ve been talking about making a big move out of state sometime next year, and Plano has really caught our attention. We’ve heard wonderful things about the schools, the family-friendly atmosphere, and how beautiful the area is. We know moving from California would be a big culture shift, but we’re really ready for a change. Right now, we’re paying $1,700 a month for a studio apartment, which just isn’t ideal with a little one on the way. We’d love to hear your thoughts: Do you think Plano could be a good fit for a young family like ours? Are there particular neighborhoods you recommend—or areas we should avoid? What should we keep in mind when looking for an apartment? We do plan to visit before making any decisions, but we’d love to hear from people who actually live there. We also have some family in both Oklahoma and Dallas, so we wouldn’t be completely on our own. Thanks so much in advance for any advice or insight you can share!",

And I've realized outside of work; I am spending the evenings/weekends not doing much. I've dabbled a bit in the rec-sports area but it seems to largely be people who show up, play a game, go home. I guess broadly my interests are: Sport: Play lacrosse, play hockey (badly), skiing/snowboarding (obviously not applicable to this area but if anyone wants to travel somewhere this winter hit me up). I'd guess you'd also say soccer but it's always been more a of a schoolyard sport for me. Art: Film, music, theatre (but I am kind of shy, I'd probably have to be pushed to recapture that). Other dabbles: I like working in events.... want help putting on some art event, I'd love to help out. Also, scuba (see note about skiing/snowboarding). Maybe more, but that's all that's coming to me at the moment. Anyways looking to be part of something, perhaps centered around some sort of activity where people also down to get the occasional pint or have the occasional social",

      "content_preview": "I have what used to be Verizon FIOS and is now Frontier. So still presumably fiber optic. Anybody know if power outages affect it? I work from home and had several power outages this week. My son saw somebody working on the green box across the street. Power was only out for a minute of two but long enough to have to power the computer back up, wait for the router to reconnect, then reconnect to work. Re-establish the VPN, and a remote desktop connection. Just annoying and the boss is buying me 3 UPSs. One for my ONT, one for my router, and one for my computer. The question is, even with this, does that guarantee the internet still works? Or is there equipment along the way of the fiber optic cables that might also require power and disconnect me anyway if there’s a loss of power? And the answer might be that it depends on the reason. Maybe it’s ok if the reason for the outage is very local, like the guy working on the green box across the street. But if it’s a larger outage, then the internet is down.  Or that they’re on a UPS as well, but that only lasts X amount of time. I guess having the UPS on my computer means not having to boot it back up. And not loosing unsaved documents. But I 99% work on a computer across the country. So if the internet isn’t going to be up, I probably don’t need a UPS for the router or ONT. I’m not trying to ride out several hours or days. At least an hour or whatever my battery life is. As it reaches its end, if the power is still out, exit and shut down gracefully. Save anything I need to. And head to an internet hotspot that’s still got power if work can’t wait.",

      "content_preview": "I just saw a video ranking the easiest places to drive in Texas… and apparently Plano was at the top of the list. I don’t know what year those stats were taken, but it definitely wasn’t this one. If you live in Plano, work in Plano, or even just pass through Plano, you know there are maybe 3 streets left that aren’t buried under construction cones. And lucky me— I’m dumb enough to live here and dumb enough to work here. Double punishment. South to North: Plano Parkway, 15th, Park, Parker, Legacy East to West: Ohio, Coit (aka Dante’s Inferno), Independence, Custer, Alma Every. Single. One. has construction. Sometimes in one spot, sometimes in five. And it’s always the same scene: 👉 1,000 orange cones 👉 8 guys in neon vests staring at the ground 👉 (or sitting under a tree with a cigarette) 👉 traffic moving slower than dial-up internet Plano isn’t the friendliest place to drive in Texas. It’s a live-action game of Traffic Cone Simulator 3000. The real mystery? I can’t tell if the city is just run this poorly… or if tax revenue is so high that someone said: “Let’s put 90% of the traffic flow under construction. We can afford it.” At this point, Plano isn’t a city. It’s a construction-themed escape room with a $400,000 entry fee.",

In 11th grade, he decided to join ISIS and was planning on shooting up the school and Stonebriar mall. The FBI pulled up to our school in black Suburbans, burst into MY class since we were in the same one, and got arrested and carried out.

I'm 51f (fit, love to walk, gym, hike, get outside, go to restaurants/lounges, find events/things to do, and my best buddy is my doggo. I'm looking for a safe area with walking trails closeby and preferably the option for a garage (as I hear auto thefts happen around the Dallas area). Would like to be in proximity to shops/grocery stores as well, but only if I don't have to sacrifice peace & quiet to some extent. I work remote but want the option of a booming job economy (if ever needed, hence the move). I'm aiming for a 1 bedroom, hopefully from $1100-1500. Seems like a broad range, but the less I pay on rent the more I can save. (I live in an expensive New England state right now... I have lived in the south before, for 10 years, so yes I know what it's like and appreciate change/growth) Some of the apartments I'm considering for me and my doggo are The Calvin, The Vincent, The Gio Apartments, The Monte, Dorian & Encore (read not so good reviews about that), Colonnade at Willow Bend. I've also read good comments about Legacy North and Windsor Preston. Would love input on the pros and cons of any of these, to help put weight on my decision. Help! :)",

Few days later I go to start my lunch break at work and see a bunch of missed calls and texts from them saying “the technician is here, call them back, open up for them to complete the service”. I just texted back “I definitely never asked for this service today” The company is DuctMastersPro - curious if this has happened to anyone else and should I be concerned?!
