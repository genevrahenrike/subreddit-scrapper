      "content_preview": "I m a highschool senior. Despite being in my last year of school, I honestly dont like my school. Most people I have been with always excluded me and would make me feel like a complelte alien. I havent had long stable friends mainly because the people I would desperately try to hold on to simply never saw me as friends. Now that I m a senior, I have some classmates that I consider friends. I like them all but I found out yesterday that not everyone feels the same. One of the girls I m close with at school told me that they didnt want me to feel bad so they didnt tell me that a month ago, but apparently one of the girls (M) was angry with my social media posts and they were sort of criticising me. This came off as a surprise because my ig stories arent meant to be taken seriously and I just never thought of them as people who'd judge me based on my stories. This convo happened that day because at school, all of them sat together in one place and didnt leave out any space for me. I know sitting anywhere is fine. But they all specifically sat with their close friends and I didnt feel welcome at all. I had to sit far away and I was particularly sad too so I tried so hard to not cry. I have always felt lonely and leftout in school. I just didnt want to feel like this in my last year of school too. They got annoyed because I felt bad and started talking shit about me. 2 of the girls tried to change the convo but I could still hear the other 2 speak. I felt bad. I still do. M starts gaslighting me whenever I tell her I felt leftout because to her, I m overreacting and she wouldnt give a fuck if her close friend didnt keep a seat for her (that's a lie). yesterday, I just ended up spilling my thoughts to the 2 girls I m close with and they said they shouldnt have made me feel like that. M suddenly came in and started saying how it was long ago and I m still bothered about it. M thinks I m too loud and dont listen to her. I also particularly am not fond of her anymore because I cant see her the same after she has justified fucked up things infront of me. I dont hate her however. But I find it so hard to accept that I m not liked by everyone. I dont want to interact with her that much anymore because she also genuinely doesnt care about me, along with her bestie. But yes, I m tired. How do I learn to not feel like an alien when I m alone at school. Please help",

      "content_preview": "I used to be super awkward and naive untill this year, i’ve worked so hard to grow out of it so here are some lessons I’ve learned along the way: 1- I used to take judgment seriously until I realized people who judge you are usually projecting their own unhappiness. Remember happy people are too busy living their lives, not judging others. 2- confidence takes time and practice: The more you do it the more natural confidence becomes. confidence is attractive and inspiring 3- not everything is a life or death situation. Learn to chill and stop taking everything so seriously. The less you take things seriously the more you have fun. 4- social skills are practice not a talent. The more you socialize with people the more you get better at it. 5- people can be selfish and its why learning to put yourself first is important. Protect your energy and put yourself first. 6- its 100% okay to walk away: Some people wont respect you or your boundaries and thats their problem not yours. 7- learn how to detach from people who dont help you grow. It’s going to save you from a lot of heartbreak. Some people are not worth crying or being sad over. 8- final and favourite tip: maybe youre not healing because youre in the same place that made you sick. Thats all. I hope those tips were helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read all that, bye now.",

      "content_preview": "I grew up in a family that expected a lot from me in terms of my physical and mental pace, and this caused me to grow up with a slave consciousness. It made me constantly doubt myself, talk fast, walk fast, and try to get things done fast. After I got rid of the repetitive and unnecessary self-doubt in my head with a tactic, I realized that this was next. Talking, walking and acting slowly. It makes a huge difference. Because in today's world people don't judge you by how much you do, they judge you by how much you carry what you do. So it's not your use value, it's the exchange value that you negotiate that is respected in society. Unfortunately this is how capitalism works. So in order to be respected, you have to speak slowly, walk slowly and behave slowly. Because doing otherwise will send the message to many of your contacts that “this man is ready to do anything already”. Even if no one uses you from the start, this will cause you to do more than you should and forget about yourself, and those who want to take advantage of you will see you as suitable for milking like a cow. No one gives this leverage to others but you. Of course, the daily grind sometimes forces us to be hasty. It is one thing to have collegiate living conditions. But if you have a collegiate consciousness, you have put the chain on yourself, which is a sucker move.",

Seems like a few people unknowingly use a technique called elicitation. Its basically making a false statement for the target to correct it and reveal more information in the process. Knowing this might really help you either catch when someone does this to you or you can use it on others if you want to speak with them dropping barriers or making them feel like you are having an interview with them, when all you are trying to do is get to know them. It really amuses me how small changes to the structure of a sentence can get totally different replies Did you guys have similar experiences ? or already use this with/without knowledge ?",

      "content_preview": "I 18 (F) am currently a college freshman and recent high school graduate. During high school I made a total of 0 friends. I talked to the people I sat next to in class, sat next to and talked to girls at lunch, joined clubs, and talked to just about anyone else I could. Every time I would go up and sit next to or talk to people on the first few days they would give me a judgy look. I tried my best to be nice and make conversation but they just didn’t care to and would often just leave after i sat down with them. I am now in college and i am struggling to make friends again. I have went to various school events for welcome week and talked to girls there, talked to the girls around me at a scholarship orientation, and walked around and said hi to people in my dorm. I tried to do everything i could this time. Compliment girls and start conversations with “I love your top! where did you get it?” or “omg your room is so cute! where did you get that from?” I would try to sound extroverted and be very energetic and bubbly just like every other girl around me. I continued to ask questions and make conversation. The results: “well it was nice to meet you” even though i only met them two minutes ago and barely got a chance to actually talk to them. or “well we are going to bed now, bye” even tho they had their door open?? or they simply respond with one word and just walk away and show NO interest at all. What the hell am i doing wrong?? I’m doing EVERYTHING i should be. Being nice, open, starting conversations, complimenting. I Don’t understand why It just seems impossible for me to even get a single friend. I am beyond lonely and it’s becoming so hard maintaining my self esteem. I asked one of my only good friends from middle school back home if she knew of any reason and her response was: “Your like the most normal person, I get intimidated by how casual you are in social situations.” I don’t know what i’m supposed to do anymore. I’m doing everything i’m supposed to but nobody wants to be my friend or even give me a chance.",

      "content_preview": "I’m almost 27 and feeling frustrated trying to build meaningful friendships. I’m shy, neurodivergent (NVLD), and have always struggled to connect easily with people. I don’t like sports, and I’m more comfortable in thoughtful, intimate, or creative settings than in loud, competitive environments. Adding to the challenge, my mom is extremely outgoing and pushy — she’s the opposite of me — which has made me feel like I’m “doing friendship wrong” or not social enough. College was by far the loneliest time of my life on par with middle school socially. I experienced a lot of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. I felt so unwelcome and out of sync with my peers that I would go home on weekends — first to escape a really unhealthy roommate situation, and later because I had resigned myself to not having friends on campus. I also studied abroad in Madrid for a period, which was amazing, but otherwise I struggled to find my people. Now, I live at home but I’m trying to actively put myself out there: I’ve gone to brunches, book clubs, alumni mixers, and I’m even reconnecting with old friends. I want real connections, not just acquaintances. I get nervous, feel awkward, and sometimes retreat, but I’m trying not to let that stop me. Does anyone else in their mid-to-late 20s struggle with finding friends due to shyness, neurodivergence, or family dynamics? How do you meet people you actually click with as an adult, outside of work or school?",

It doesn't work if they ask you a question, but if they're just talking about themselves like people do 80% of the time it's pretty great. Maybe your social skills aren't great, or maybe you're an introvert who stays at home a bunch and you just don't have an amusing anecdote to reply with. Either way... say someone is talking: Them: So I had my daughter's bat mitzvah over the weekend, it was fun. It really felt like a wedding almost. You: A wedding? Or..... Them: I love this burger it's so delicious. It's really the pickles that do it. You: The pickles? The other person will keep talking and will also be engaged seeing you were listening and showed interest instead of changing the subject. You can't do it all the time, it's just a tool to be used.

I said to this woman “if this is such an issue for you, why don’t you start a charity that assists those with children with their bills so a parent can afford to stay home?” No response. Someone calls you unhealthy, ask them what healthy recipes they’d recommend, better yet, let’s go shop for those ingredients.  They may try to retort with “that’s not my responsibility!” Then you say “then you shouldn’t have said anything to begin with.” This makes you seem more assertive and is the best repellant for people who want to shit on you. That being said, please use this method with caution because it can backfire. You don’t want to end up pushing away someone who is genuinely trying to help you. This is more for dealing with shitty people who project their insecurities and negative thoughts onto you and projecting it right back to them. If something is actually your fault and is affecting other people, take accountability. Only use it on people you don’t mind walking out of your life.",

      "content_preview": "Just want to ask for insights and opinions on this kind of situation. I haven’t spoken to this friend in years. Bumped into him at a wedding. Catched up very briefly. Agreed to catch up some other time. Several days later. He texted me. I thought he was gonna invite me to have coffee or something. However, he basically asked for a favor from my company that I own. Honestly I really got turned off from this. Im not looking to connect with a business partner, I was just looking to reconnect with an old friend. Proceeded to not reply anymore to this guy. If we had coffee or a drink first, I would have been more receptive to his favor. Part of me feels guilty but a part of me is just indifferent as well. What do you all think of this?",

      "content_preview": "They are so easy to talk to. They can make a friend group anywhere they are. They say the coolest(by cool I mean natural and not pretentious) things at the right time, as if it is a movie script. Words just flow out of them. Everyone seeks them to hangout with. People mention their name when they are not around, wondering where the hell they are. They like them so much, and from a third person perspective, they are always never alone. I know what you will say, they have their own battles and what you see is not the whole picture. I understand that. But I want to fight my battles while being like them. They have friends, if not close friends. At least they are willing to reach out to them and ask them to have lunch or dinner together. I myself are always excluded. In any new environment, any new people I meet I fail to be apart of a community or a group. The worst part is people just don’t care. You could be standing right next to them and they act as if you are not even there (I am talking about grown adults btw, not high school or some cringey phase). They don’t care to ask what you are up to or at least suggest to come along with them. All I do is be friendly to people. But I never receive it back. Or even in some cases I might receive ridicule for being friendly. I honestly don’t understand. Do people just decide to not like you in the first place? If that is the case, how is it that in every new environment I am excluded? Seriously, I try my very best to be friendly and always smiling. I never say the wrong things. What is it that the words that come out of my mouth and the charming person’s words so different? What is the mindset? To be yourself? I have tried that, it didn’t work. To be pretentious? I don’t want that. From what I wrote you might wonder I am being stingy or angry. You might even think I am someone to come off too strong to people, or try too hard, but I don’t. I really don’t. I try to be myself but at the same time talkative. I guess I am a bit frustrated because I have been in situations like this for many times. And seriously, how do they make friends so easily?",

I’ve met people through college and work, social dues have been suggested but I just make excuses never attended my school prom or university graduation It’s not because of shyness or anxiety…I just don’t care. I hate social activities and only mingle with people when it benefits myself or my family. I’m a multimillionaire at a young age through selling my business back when I was 23. I have a ton of connections when I need something but again, they are merely acquaintances and not friends. I’ve had many relationships and haven’t struggled with women the last few years or so and otherwise I am happy with my life. Rich young healthy….I just hate social things I find the idea of doing social things with people just pointless and it’s not something I enjoy at all. Is this really abnormal???

One teacher at school noticed this and gifted me one book on helping introverts be more social because she thought I had potential like most of us do which I kept hidden. Somewhere along the lines the book suggested do to a small talk with a stranger even if it meant saying hello or making a simple comment if you were in elevator or shopping groceries and what not. At first it felt awkward but after some time it got easier and I started having these short random convos with people everywhere like on the bus or in line at the store and even at the park. What I noticed as well was that it didn’t just make me better at talking to strangers but I was also more relaxed and confident when talking to women too like once you stop overthinking the first hello the rest just came natural.",

It’s like once school or college ends and everyone gets busy with work or relationships or moving to new cities the whole friend making process becomes weirdly formal and awkward. I try putting myself out there when I can. I’ll go to events or say yes to invites or try talking to people at work. But it always feels like everyone already has their established group and I’m just this extra person trying to squeeze in. I miss how easy it was when friendships just formed naturally because you sat next to someone in class or saw them every day. Now it feels like everyone’s got a full social calendar and there’s no open spots. I’m not looking for a hundred friends or anything just a few real ones. People I can hang out with without it feeling like a networking event or small talk practice. I have 2 good friends only with whom I play dota 2 with and some grizzly's quest here and there. I just want that casual \"come over and do nothing\" kind of friendship again. But I genuinely don’t know how people are finding that after 25. If you’ve managed to build solid friendships as an adult what actually helped and was it just showing up consistently somewhere or was it putting yourself out there even when it felt awkward because I’m open to trying whatever but right now it kind of feels like I missed the window and now I’m just hovering around the edges.",

      "content_preview": "There's this person at work who will corner me in the break room and talk for 20+ minutes about random stuff. They're nice enough but I just want to eat my lunch in peace sometimes. I've tried saying \"well I should get back to work\" but they just keep talking. What are some polite but firm ways to extract myself from these conversations? Like yesterday I went to heat up my leftover pasta and then I sit down to play some jackpot city and they immediately launched into this story about their weekend camping trip. I'm standing there with my food getting cold and nodding along but I could tell they were just getting started. When I tried the \"back to work\" line they said 'just 1 more thing' and they kept going for another 10 minutes. I don't want to be rude or anything because they're genuinely a nice person and I think they're just lonely but I really value my lunch break as my quiet time to decompress. I've started eating at my desk sometimes just to avoid the situation but that's not really a solution that I'd want to have. Has anyone dealt with something like this?",

I want to be a fun person to be around, and I want to be funny and say things that make people laugh. Normal is a way easier goal. Fun and funny, well, it might as well be rocket science. I’ve heard people say that funny people come from funny families. My family was as funny as a hacked up dead body. Other people say being funny comes from trauma. While my life is definitely not short on trauma, unfortunately it was never the kind any humor could be found in. And then the worst I hear is that people are either funny or they’re not; quick witted or not. What do you think, good people? Is normal the most I can aim for, or could I become someone people wanna hang out with because I’m fun and make everyone laugh?  I’m not talking stand up or anything like that.

I'm having a hard time to have sensible and fun conversations with other people. I can start a conversation with a stranger but I cannot keep it going like normal person. I find it hard to have an interactive conversation with others.Even when I was a kid I had hard time making friends. I think the reason for my inability to interact with people in society properly is because my parents didn't used to take me to any social events like meeting their friends families or collegeaus so i was not able to improve my social skills since childhood. Even my father did not used to speak much in home. He also doesn't have any friends or good social skills. So I might have got his genes. So how can I improve my social skills and build friend network have a good communication skills and be more interactive and be able to talk to anyone and keep the conversation going so the opposite person is also interested in hanging out with me?",

      "content_preview": "I (40m) have noticed a recent uptick in people showing signs of disliking me and I truly have no idea why. My nature is to be on the introverted side, but I can be extraverted and socially outgoing as well. I've had several interactions with three-four people, over the last couple of weeks alone, who made it clear that they either don't like me, don't respect me, or both. The last straw that made me post this happened last night at a social gathering. This girl I had met only twice before walked in and excitedly greeted people around me. I made eye contact and did an enthusiastic heyyy! and a wave, and she just looked at me coldly, said nothing and then turned away. The last time I saw her we were joking around for a while about different possible names for my new dog. Her reaction to seeing me totally took me by surprise. In general I try to give everyone I socialize with warm greetings, ask them about themselves, have genuine interest in their lives and getting to know them when talking. But there are certain people that just outright don't like me and I have no idea why. It comes across in little things like making eye contact with everyone else around me besides me, following back everyone else who they met that night on social media except for me etc. One of these guys that I had to see last night, who's friends with my close friends, actually texted me \"I don't like you\" a while back. What makes this particularly frustrating is that just when I feel like I've finally gotten over one experience with this, I'll be feeling like I finally \"cracked\" it and then a situation like that girl last night will happen and set me back to this horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach like, what the fuck did I do to warrant that? I have no way of knowing what it is about me that is causing this. Any time I've ever tried to broach it with certain people it only made things worse. I don't wanna be the friend who's always bringing drama around by talking about people who don't like me. TL;DR - How do you deal with being actively disliked by random people when you have no way of know when it will happen or what causes it? It's getting to the point where I'm almost expecting people I meet to have a negative reaction toward me.  It's a total mind fuck. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",

Including doing this activity I’m writing this post about. 95% of the time, I enjoy doing things alone. However, this is an exception that I’ll elaborate below. I have a “busy season”, and I want to do something to celebrate the end of it. This is a business local to me does amazing cake decorating classes. They’re pricey though with most being around $160. They done some “happy hour” classes that are around $75 and much more lowkey. I did one and while I enjoyed the activity and LOVED the cake, it was a very awkward experience being alone. I was the only one there alone, some of the patrons were rude to me, and it just made me feel unwelcomed and kinda sad. With that in mind, I really don’t want to go again, especially because it’s like a 3 hour class vs the 1 hour I did before. However, I’ve asked several friends and none of them seem interested. I’m so conflicted about it, because I really want to go, but the first bad experience scared me away. I know I could pay for a friend, but I’m not really in a financial position to drop an additional $160. What should I do? Is there anyway to make it more enjoyable? My only consolation is hopefully there are other people there alone since it is more expensive",

      "content_preview": "Many people's journeys start with small, everyday moments. In front of the class, an instructor calls out a mistake. \"Don’t embarrass yourself,\" a parent says. When you say something awkward, your friends laugh. These seemingly insignificant moments have a profound impact on a child's mind. Over time, the brain learns to expect danger in social situations. Even when nothing bad is happening, you might still anticipate judgment, embarrassment, or rejection. As we grow older, those patterns don’t simply disappear. They shape the way we approach conversations, friendships, and even work. That’s why something as simple as saying “hello” or “good morning” can sometimes feel like climbing a mountain. The good news is that social anxiety is temporary. The brain can update its predictions and relearn them. New, healthier patterns can gradually take the place of those old ones with the help of counseling, encouragement, and gentle practice. Giving your mind tiny, regular evidence that connection can occur fearlessly is more important than becoming self assured overnight.

      "content_preview": "I had my last day at work recently before going on maternity leave. Nobody said anything to me except for one colleague who nicely had lunch out with me. I had to actually ask another colleague I was kinda close to have a coffee and she suggested an afternoon tea with me and another colleague whom we talk to quite often. During the afternoon tea they gave me a present and card from one of our bosses. The previous lady who went on maternity leave had a very big present, card signed by everyone, and a grand send off. Another two had a nice send off where everyone gathered and the boss said their well wishes. It is not about present or cards but the whole experience and the different treatments left me feeling weird and overlooked. I am a quiet and keep my head down at work type. But I always help out and am polite. I wonder if there is a thing where people just assume you don't want some big send off or want to be included so they just don't even ask? Its the same with group coffees etc too. People round each other up and leave me out. I always had to join but I honestly feel not wanted there. People - if you are organising something would you reach out to the quiet one and ask if they want to be included? Or just assume they don't and don't even ask? I do like to keep things low-key but it is the feeling of exclusion here that nobody even bothers to include or ask me that hurts.",

Maybe there's something about you that intimidates people, or, makes them feel a little insecure around you. Are you very tall? are you unusually intelligent? is your voice loud and booming? do you remind people of Ser Gregor Clegane lol? we tend to not notice things that are really obvious to other people, because we're just used to them and think well if we could get used to them, why wouldn't anyone else? So maybe we could do an exercise you know? what if we all talked to one another here, or paired up in the comments, and reported back to the other person things that felt *most obvious* to them about the other person? I think we'd all learn something than just complaining. It's just an idea I'm floating for all of us here, because we all deserve to be friends with someone else.",

I can make good jokes, add conversation, ask questions, etc. Same with if I see someone younger or as/more shy. But when I see someone more funny, more attractive, more smart, more confident, or more popular, I cannot socialize anymore. I get anxious and self conscious and think I’m not as good as them. While I’m anxious talking to them, I feel like I freeze and all my thoughts go blank. I literally cannot think of anything to add and become so awkward because of it. I was going on a few dates with this guy. I was completely fine the first 5 dates!! I could be myself and was making us both laugh and holding conversation. But the last time we hung out he was talking about his older friend group and I realized how much better he is at socializing than me. I thought about how we’re different and how he’ll realize I’m not that good at conversation with others. I ended up getting so anxious because I realized I’m weird and awkward around a lot of people and he isn’t. I ended up being so awkward throughout the rest of the night. What the hell is wrong with me? I hate that I’m like this. I know it isn’t an issue with my social skills, I can socialize well when I’m not anxious or not feeling inferior. But the second I see someone more confident or popular I freeze up, get a blank mind, and become so awkward. I am only awkward when I’m anxious and see myself as insuperior. How can I fix this?",

It has been over a month since I’ve seen her and she lives 2 hours away so I really wanted her to have a good time and I was so excited. But I think I fucked it up. She went home today and I just feel so deflated. I don’t think she’ll be trying hard to visit again any time soon. Here’s what I did right: I cleaned up the house LOADS. Mopped, scrubbed, clean sheets, fresh flowers on the table. I got food for her. She has a lot of dietary restrictions, and I bought her own selection of food for her to eat while she stayed and she seemed to enjoy it. I brought her to a market that I thought she would like and I think she did like it. And I think that’s it. What went wrong: I don’t have a car so we had to use public transport and walk in the wind and rain sometimes. I have insomnia and the stress of the weekend made it so hard for me to sleep so I was getting hardly any sleep at all. we didn’t do any of the fun laid back things I wanted to do because we had to constantly go out to do all the things we had planned. It felt like a let down. no pictures. We usually have lots of fun pictures when we’re together but she took none and I only took a few. because she came at a weekend, everywhere we went was so crowded and it killed the vibe. she was tired and didn’t really want to stay up and chat as much. I felt like I was awkward sometimes and came across wrong. I asked her if she was okay because she seemed like she wasn’t enjoying herself and she said I didn’t have to keep asking her which made me feel guilty. I helped her to the train station and she thanked me for a lovely time but I’m just sitting here wanting to cry. It wasn’t a lovely time. I feel like she’s so happy to be away from me. What can I do to fix this? Maybe I should distance myself so she can forget about the bad vibe and see me with fresh eyes?",
