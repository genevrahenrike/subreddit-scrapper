      "content_preview": "I keep catching myself doing something I do not like. In conversations I notice classic anxiety signs in other people: rushed speech, apologizing for nothing, lots of hedging like “if that’s okay,” fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, self deprecating jokes, and my brain instantly labels it “low self esteem.” Once that label lands I feel less respect and disengage, as if I have already “figured out” their personality. I know this is not fair or helpful, and I am probably missing the context: stress, culture, neurodivergence, a bad day, or just a different style. If you have worked through a similar bias, how did you change it? I am looking for practical cues to keep respect front and center: mental reframes, questions that shift me into curiosity, ways to spot strengths first, and small behaviors that show warmth without being patronizing. Scripts would help too, like what to say when someone over apologizes or downplays themselves. I want to get better at reading anxiety without downgrading people in my head, and to relate to them in a way that is supportive and adult to adult.",

It makes a huge difference.Because in today's world people don't judge you by how much you do, they judge you by how much you carry what you do. So it's not your use value, it's the exchange value that you negotiate that is respected in society. Unfortunately this is how capitalism works.So in order to be respected, you have to speak slowly, walk slowly and behave slowly.Because doing otherwise will send the message to many of your contacts that “this man is ready to do anything already”.Even if no one uses you from the start, this will cause you to do more than you should and forget about yourself, and those who want to take advantage of you will see you as suitable for milking like a cow. No one gives this leverage to others but you.Of course, the daily grind sometimes forces us to be hasty. It is one thing to have collegiate living conditions.But if you have a collegiate consciousness, you have put the chain on yourself, which is a sucker move.",

      "content_preview": "This is a small rant, but I want to actually ask for advice on this. I am so tired of being surrounded by people who cannot stop talking and can’t take the hint that I am not interested in the conversation. The situation that I will describe happens often with other people too. It’s always in situations where you can’t really “flee” or make an excuse to leave.So I am currently in a rehabilitation center for an illness that’s irrelevant for this post and share a room with a guy. I am staying there for 12 days and it’s supposed to be a relaxing environment. I like to converse with people that are interesting. It’s not that I am loner who never socializes. On the first day, I went with him to the cafeteria to have lunch, I started by asking him about the illness we both share. He answered and talked for like 10 minutes while I was nodding along. Then he directly segwayed into another topic. And I’m still there nodding along. And then another and another… he talked for the whole lunch.. 30 minutes of me nodding along, every time I try to say something, he just continues talking. Exhausted, I go back to the room which we share, so of course he follows me and keeps on talking. At this point, I’m not even nodding anymore and have no idea what he’s talking about anyway, but he talks anyway. I’m in my bed and he’s still talking. I am writing this post and he’s still talking /s  The guy monologued for I think one hour. And this was not the only time. I’ve been here two days and he never stops. How am I supposed to last 12 days like this?How can I politely let him know that he talks too much without making things awkward? Like I said, this happens in a lot of places, previous flatmates, people on the seat next to you on planes, etc. why can’t people take a hint if their conversation partner hasn’t said a word in the last 10 minutes that the person is not interested anymore. Sorry for the rant.",

      "content_preview": "[Reposted because original was too long.]Some years ago, a high school friend insisted on coming to visit. We lived 800 miles apart. At the time, car and money problems made this a bad idea and I told her so. But she was pushy. She stayed for nearly a week, and once she left, I resolved to cut all ties. It took her a couple of years to get the message.I spent a long time resenting her for this, until it finally occurred to me that I had done the same thing in previous years to friends who seemed to have lost my contact information after I went home. It was only after I did some hard reflection that I realized that my friend's visit to me was nothing short of karma.My advice: If someone invites you, completely unprompted by you, say yes, but only if you can afford to treat them to meals, gift cards, etc. If they say ten days, make it four. They are not an Airbnb and you are not a charity case.  Sometimes the best friendships thrive at a distance.",

      "content_preview": "For years, I’ve really struggled to maintain close and deep friendships, and they always seem to end up being one-sided, which I’m absolutely sick of. I’ve got to an age where everybody already has their group of friends, but I don’t and I just feel so behind, and it really plays with my mental health. It also seems that past friendships I’ve had are situational (school, sixth form, work, uni) and there’s no true connection going on. In person, everyone tells me I’m funny and a great person, yet this is clearly proven to be false if people aren’t gravitating towards me.I am ALWAYS the one to put the most effort into the friendship, meaning I text first, call first, arrange plans first etc. and I get barely anything back. If people cancel on me, they don’t consider rearranging the date and just leave me hanging, or they might just leave me on read and I’ll have to text again. I want to delude myself and claim that these people are introverted and want to have a low-maintenance friendship, but said people are on the same level of extroversion as me, maybe even more, because I see them putting in way more effort with others and they leave me out.People I want to be good friends with are always busy with others continuously and don’t think to invite me, which stings. I could just stop initiating contact, but I know full well the so-called friendship will be over, but that would mean I have nobody to talk to, and eventually I’ll resume contact due to the desire for social communication. It doesn’t help that I’m neurodivergent (ADHD and Autism) because I always seem to weird people out or be too much for them, and my energy is never returned, yet they can put that energy back with millions of other people, however, when it comes to me, it’s a problem.I’d really like some genuine advice. Am I doing the right things but in the wrong day? Am I genuinely just too off-putting as a person? Or is it simply the case of am I just not meeting the right people, although i feel as if i’ll never actually find my people because i offer no true value.",

      "content_preview": "I have a friend who is constantly glass-half full. I feel for them, and want them to find joy in life. But there is never any joy. Also, when I tell them any piece of new information they always ask me clarifying questions. I’m beginning to realize that they just don’t believe me on anything. My word means nothing and they always know more than I do on a topic. Anything I share is questioned, dismissed or their excitement is withheld until they’ve seen some sort of greater proof. I’m an honest person, I do not lie to this friend. I think they suffer from childhood abandonment (mother abandonment) and they just can’t trust anyone.I’m trying to make this friendship work for a couple years now. But it’s just so difficult to spark any happiness in them, and they don’t seem to care about bringing happiness to me they just judge/question everything I do, it’s often just a pity party for them. They’ve had hard things in their life, but they hold little space for what others are going through, and others priorities. They are the type of person who first complains about the restaurant food and never gets around to saying anything positive about the experience or time spent together. Everything is a critique, and it feels like it’s impossible to make them happy.They have had a string of friends who end up distancing themselves from this friend over their adult life. But they’ve done the same too. They are very quick to cut someone off, or block them on social media “because they aren’t being a good enough friend.” Their spouse has remarked this friend “struggles with wanting everyone to be their best friend.”I’ve had this issue in only one other previous friendship, where I was never available “enough” for a friend because they tried to talk to me at length every single day and I didn’t have time for that, and they would tell me I wasn’t being a good enough friend. Both of these friends keep such strict guardrails on what qualifies as a “friend” to them. All of it adds up to being very needy and judgmental of me. I hate to say that. If they value very close friendships thats great, but it becomes really demanding to keep up and always be there for them through the glass-half full always upset trauma dumping. I wish I could be the person they want, but it’s too much. I also fear getting burned by them when they finally decide I’m just not a good enough friend to remain in their life at all.",

It doesn't work if they ask you a question, but if they're just talking about themselves like people do 80% of the time it's pretty great.Maybe your social skills aren't great, or maybe you're an introvert who stays at home a bunch and you just don't have an amusing anecdote to reply with. Either way... say someone is talking:Them: So I had my daughter's bat mitzvah over the weekend, it was fun. It really felt like a wedding almost.You: A wedding?Or.....Them: I love this burger it's so delicious. It's really the pickles that do it.You: The pickles?The other person will keep talking and will also be engaged seeing you were listening and showed interest instead of changing the subject.You can't do it all the time, it's just a tool to be used.

This doesn’t make it okay, but I feel like the context makes it sound less like I just didn’t care enough to show up, and more that I am running on empty and out of it. However, I’ve heard that giving justifications when apologizing ruins the apology. If I just say “I’m so sorry I was late, it won’t happen again”, what if next class I’m still not sleeping or eating properly and something similar happens again? I can’t guarantee I won’t get sicker, maybe need to stay home, and if the professor isn’t aware of that then I’m not sure what I’ll do. I am going to try my very best but I’m worried.",

They say the coolest(by cool I mean natural and not pretentious) things at the right time, as if it is a movie script. Words just flow out of them. Everyone seeks them to hangout with. People mention their name when they are not around, wondering where the hell they are. They like them so much, and from a third person perspective, they are always never alone.I know what you will say, they have their own battles and what you see is not the whole picture. I understand that. But I want to fight my battles while being like them. They have friends, if not close friends. At least they are willing to reach out to them and ask them to have lunch or dinner together.I myself are always excluded. In any new environment, any new people I meet I fail to be apart of a community or a group. The worst part is people just don’t care. You could be standing right next to them and they act as if you are not even there (I am talking about grown adults btw, not high school or some cringey phase). They don’t care to ask what you are up to or at least suggest to come along with them. All I do is be friendly to people. But I never receive it back. Or even in some cases I might receive ridicule for being friendly.I honestly don’t understand. Do people just decide to not like you in the first place? If that is the case, how is it that in every new environment I am excluded? Seriously, I try my very best to be friendly and always smiling. I never say the wrong things. What is it that the words that come out of my mouth and the charming person’s words so different? What is the mindset? To be yourself? I have tried that, it didn’t work. To be pretentious? I don’t want that.From what I wrote you might wonder I am being stingy or angry. You might even think I am someone to come off too strong to people, or try too hard, but I don’t. I really don’t. I try to be myself but at the same time talkative. I guess I am a bit frustrated because I have been in situations like this for many times.And seriously, how do they make friends so easily?",

One teacher at school noticed this and gifted me one book on helping introverts be more social because she thought I had potential like most of us do which I kept hidden. Somewhere along the lines the book suggested do to a small talk with a stranger even if it meant saying hello or making a simple comment if you were in elevator or shopping groceries and what not. At first it felt awkward but after some time it got easier and I started having these short random convos with people everywhere like on the bus or in line at the store and even at the park. What I noticed as well was that it didn’t just make me better at talking to strangers but I was also more relaxed and confident when talking to women too like once you stop overthinking the first hello the rest just came natural.",

      "content_preview": "I’m in my late twenties now and honestly making new friends feels way harder than it used to. It’s like once school or college ends and everyone gets busy with work or relationships or moving to new cities the whole friend making process becomes weirdly formal and awkward. I try putting myself out there when I can. I’ll go to events or say yes to invites or try talking to people at work. But it always feels like everyone already has their established group and I’m just this extra person trying to squeeze in. I miss how easy it was when friendships just formed naturally because you sat next to someone in class or saw them every day. Now it feels like everyone’s got a full social calendar and there’s no open spots. I’m not looking for a hundred friends or anything just a few real ones. People I can hang out with without it feeling like a networking event or small talk practice. I have 2 good friends only with whom I play dota 2 with and some grizzly's quest here and there. I just want that casual \"come over and do nothing\" kind of friendship again. But I genuinely don’t know how people are finding that after 25.If you’ve managed to build solid friendships as an adult what actually helped and was it just showing up consistently somewhere or was it putting yourself out there even when it felt awkward because I’m open to trying whatever but right now it kind of feels like I missed the window and now I’m just hovering around the edges.",

I love talking to people, I go to church and other events to meet new people. I love talking to people I don’t know much but at the same point I have some “triggers” that completely ruins my confidence. After an event I ruminate a lot (for hours). I sit and think about how strange I look, I think about every joke, comment and look people gave me. This continues until I make myself believe that actually I act like a fool and everyone thinks I’m strange and would love me not to be with them. Usually during the conversation I don’t have time to ruminate so it’s kinda fun. The scary thing is the part when everyone is talking and I am doing nothing, not listening and not talking. When the party divides into groups of 2-4 people and talks about anything. I’m just standing there and thinking that I probably look extremely awkward. I also have troubles with starting a conversation. Previous week after the church meeting all the “young people” went out for a walk to some park. People were just talking and I couldn’t force myself to talk to anyone. I feel extremely uncomfortable to just come to a person and say something like “so you play guitar right, did you take any courses or you learned to play at home?”. Two girls told me this day that I should “talk to people and socialise” (another thing to ruminate about). So now when I provided some context, I wonder how I can get rid of social anxiety as an extrovert?",

My eldest takes after his mother and has a pretty easy time making friends.  My youngest is much more like me.  I didn’t want to see him take the same path as I, so I try to provide coaching.  Try.As an incoming college freshman, we dropped him off at college a couple weeks ago.  It is a good school and I was taken aback by how nice everyone seemed to be.  Like legitimately nice.  My son commented about just putting his headphones on and going to class and keeping to himself.  I had to stop him right there.  “Look around.  We are not just paying for you to just take classes.  We are paying for the opportunity for you to be here…among the students and people here.  Otherwise you could just go to the community college.”  I talked about the possibilities and experiences for him.  BUT…he had to do it.  We won’t be here.The college had activities for parents separate from students which kept us busy throughout the weekend.  As our time to depart neared, I could see my son was anxious.  He knew he would be on his own.We gave him a lot of assurance that he had support.  Ask for help, don’t suffer in silence, people want to see him succeed, he’s not alone.  But he has to make it happen.  Put yourself out there.  Smile.  Say hi.  Introduce yourself.  Simple questions to ask others.  Friendship takes work.  Reach out.  Over and over.  Each time you say no to an experience lessens the chance of being asked again.  Say yes, but be smart.Driving away was heart wrenching.  The last thing I said to him was that I was proud of him and to call his mother.  He was farther from home than I was in college and I knew a few people.  On the car ride home I still thought things could go either way.  Good or bad.After two weeks he is doing well.  He is not just hanging out with his roommate, but has found some people in class to hang with.  This was important to him because he didn’t want to be a “leech” on his roommate.  He was invited to a party this weekend and was genuinely excited.  Listening to him talk about both stress and fun made me smile.  That’s what I hoped for him.I know there will be ups and downs.  He needs to stay vigilant.  He needs to continue experimenting with putting himself out there and meeting people.  But…oh boy…he looks to be doing it.",

I haven’t really had time to make friends given that doesn’t happen overnight, but a lot more people than I expected know me, talk to me, or reach out. The problem is I’m super reliant on other people starting conversations with me, or asking me to hang out. Even when people make an effort I still worry that I’m bothering them. I want to talk to people to show that I like them and I just want to be social, but I seek to stop myself every time because I’m terrified of being a burden. My inner voice starts telling me that they’re hoping I don’t speak to them so they don’t have to talk to me.I really want to be more social but I don’t know how to get past the feeling that they secretly are bothered by my presence. No matter much I try to talk myself out of it I still feel a block when I try to start conversations.",

It has been over a month since I’ve seen her and she lives 2 hours away so I really wanted her to have a good time and I was so excited.But I think I fucked it up. She went home today and I just feel so deflated. I don’t think she’ll be trying hard to visit again any time soon.Here’s what I did right:I cleaned up the house LOADS. Mopped, scrubbed, clean sheets, fresh flowers on the table.I got food for her. She has a lot of dietary restrictions, and I bought her own selection of food for her to eat while she stayed and she seemed to enjoy it.I brought her to a market that I thought she would like and I think she did like it.And I think that’s it.What went wrong:I don’t have a car so we had to use public transport and walk in the wind and rain sometimes.I have insomnia and the stress of the weekend made it so hard for me to sleep so I was getting hardly any sleep at all.we didn’t do any of the fun laid back things I wanted to do because we had to constantly go out to do all the things we had planned. It felt like a let down.no pictures. We usually have lots of fun pictures when we’re together but she took none and I only took a few.because she came at a weekend, everywhere we went was so crowded and it killed the vibe.she was tired and didn’t really want to stay up and chat as much.I felt like I was awkward sometimes and came across wrong. I asked her if she was okay because she seemed like she wasn’t enjoying herself and she said I didn’t have to keep asking her which made me feel guilty.I helped her to the train station and she thanked me for a lovely time but I’m just sitting here wanting to cry. It wasn’t a lovely time. I feel like she’s so happy to be away from me.What can I do to fix this? Maybe I should distance myself so she can forget about the bad vibe and see me with fresh eyes?",

      "content_preview": "Basically the title.I'm a 23F and I feel like I’ve been struggling socially for the last few years. I’m feeling kind of hopeless (and helpless) about it so I guess I just want to see if anyone else relates as well and if anyone has changed this about themselves (or at least improved a little bit).I feel like I don't have much to say in most social interactions. I have no idea what to talk about during any conversation.But here's the thing: when I'm alone I think. A lot. To the point where I debate most things in my own head (lol). But I just can't bring myself to do that with other people. In case you're wondering, I also have a lot of trust issues and I am extremely anxious (great combo, I know).I am afraid of saying the wrong things and making people turn their back on me because I might have said something stupid.This whole thing has started making me feel extremely depressed, especially in the past few months. I really want to go out more, meet new people and make new friends but it's extremely hard for me.Has anyone gone through this? Any advice? Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "Hey all,This is a bit of a weird request but I wanna know what methods of building social skills are the most efficient time-wise. I'm a guy currently in university and realise I'm rather underdeveloped on the whole build and maintain relations with people thing, and its having a noticeable affect on my quality of life and job prospects. I'm quite busy but I want to dedicate a good 2-6 hours per week just trying to meet new people, master first impressions and maybe build some connections but I'm not sure how to best use this time efficiently.For context:- I do go out to the club with friends about once a month to make myself more comfortable around women, but the whole thing is expensive and I only talk to like 2 women per night and it never goes anywhere (either she's not interested or I get too nervous even when she approaches me first).- I have about a 90% failure rate in interviews over my lifetime even for simple things like McDonald's jobs so might be kind of on the spectrum lol.- Overall, I get quite sad when I fail at things like this but I never stop trying, I was just wondering if there was anything out there which could condense my experiences and help me improve faster. Maybe something like those speed friending/dating events or a sports club.Thanks for any advice you guys have.",

      "content_preview": "Back when I was a teenager, a very outgoing family member told me that social skills are an important life skill, and developing them isn’t something to take lightly. For the longest time, I tried to “fix” my awkwardness. I always felt pressure to be more confident and polished, but that just made things worse.What actually helped?A few years ago I decided to pursue something that I was passionate about by making my first short film. I had to collaborate with and lead the cast and crew.  My goal wasn’t to “be less awkward”..it was to bring my vision to life.  I was so focused on what I was creating that I didn’t have time to care about how others viewed me.You’ve probably heard the advice “Don’t care about what others think of you”.  For me, it wasn’t something I could just “fix”...I accomplished it by focusing all my thoughts and energy on something I was passionate about. Developing social skills was never the goal, but they came as a side effect of working with others on something meaningful.When I was a teenager I wished I could be extroverted. But looking back, I’m glad my wish never came true.  I’ve learned to lean into my awkwardness and see it as a strength.That same awkward kid just released his second feature film earlier this year. Not by fixing himself, but by following what he loved. It’s not mainstream at all. It’s a bit weird and offbeat, just like me. But I’ve found there are a lot of people out there who appreciate that kind of thing.I may still suck at small talk with new people, but I’m happy, grateful, doing what I love, and surrounded by meaningful relationships.  And I’m proud to call myself socially awkward with very subpar social skills.I hope that sharing my perspective helps at least one person reading this!",

I find it hard to have an interactive conversation with others.Even when I was a kid I had hard time making friends. I think the reason for my inability to interact with people in society properly is because my parents didn't used to take me to any social events like meeting their friends families or collegeaus so i was not able to improve my social skills since childhood. Even my father did not used to speak much in home. He also doesn't have any friends or good social skills. So I might have got his genes. So how can I improve my social skills and build friend network have a good communication skills and be more interactive and be able to talk to anyone and keep the conversation going so the opposite person is also interested in hanging out with me?",

I ask one of the co workers if it's been busy that day and we have a little chat about that. And it's almost like after that point (we inevitably 'bump into' colleagues 4 or 5 times per day) it feels like i'm trying to think of things to ask or say! But I see others often having conversations. If it's a monday i'll ask how their weekend was or if they're doing anything for the weekend if it's a Friday. I dont know.With friends, even though I still have the issue, it just feels like there;s more often things to talk about due to us having so many shared friends and memories and stories etc",

Anyways, there’s this guy I like and having a highschool like romance is one of my goals. Issue is: idk how to make friends or even start to talk to him. We have one class together and it’s not a class we would/could talk in so yk, and he’s a senior and I’m a junior. He’s friends w the sport guys pretty much exclusively and I’m more artsy. Making friends with girls is so easy, my tactic is smiling and waving at them and so far I have made 1/2 new friend with this. This would not work with him. So how do I make friends with ppl without like forced connections essentially??",

      "content_preview": "Ask them to be part of the solution. Most of them will turn red and shut down. The biggest critics out there are all talk and no do. I saw a woman criticizing a mother who had to return to work after giving birth to make ends meet. I said to this woman “if this is such an issue for you, why don’t you start a charity that assists those with children with their bills so a parent can afford to stay home?” No response. Someone calls you unhealthy, ask them what healthy recipes they’d recommend, better yet, let’s go shop for those ingredients.  They may try to retort with “that’s not my responsibility!” Then you say “then you shouldn’t have said anything to begin with.” This makes you seem more assertive and is the best repellant for people who want to shit on you.That being said, please use this method with caution because it can backfire. You don’t want to end up pushing away someone who is genuinely trying to help you. This is more for dealing with shitty people who project their insecurities and negative thoughts onto you and projecting it right back to them. If something is actually your fault and is affecting other people, take accountability. Only use it on people you don’t mind walking out of your life.",

My ideal guy isn't a big drinker, but I wonder if single guys go there in hopes of getting a girlfriend.I never went. I always heard bars were bad places where all the weirdos go, so I was scared.

Like if I need to call a restaurant to make a reservation, I'll literally practice what I'm going to say multiple times. Or if I know I'm going to run into someone I haven't seen in a while, I'll prepare like 5 different conversation starters and topics.The worst part is that it never goes how I planned anyway, and then I feel even more awkward because I'm trying to force the conversation back to my \"script\" instead of just going with the flow.I know logically that most people aren't judging my every word, but my brain doesn't seem to get the memo. It's exhausting being this in my head all the time. The funny thing is, a few months ago my roommate was dealing with similar stuff and she started using this AI conversation practice app (CharmXP I think?). At first I thought it was kind of silly, but she seemed way more relaxed in social situations after using it for a bit. She said it helped her get the \"practice\" out of her system before real conversations so she could actually be present instead of stuck in her head.I'm thinking about trying something like that myself because clearly my current method of mental rehearsal isn't working.Has anyone else found ways to break this cycle? I just want to have normal conversations without feeling like I need a script for everything or maybe im just too OCD.",

I don’t talk nonstop, I usually keep my thoughts to myself, but every now and then I’ll say something funny or come up with a decent idea.The weird part is… people never seem to notice it was me who said it. Once during lunch I suggested a small improvement to the HR girls, just casually, and they actually ended up implementing it. It worked great. Nobody ever mentioned it was my idea.Same thing happened the other day. I cracked a joke, half an hour later I hear someone else repeating it like it was theirs. I mean, I can’t exactly walk into the office kitchen and be like “hey guys, that was my line.”It feels like I do contribute valuable stuff, but somehow it doesn’t translate into recognition or my social standing at the office.",

      "content_preview": "I used to be super awkward and naive untill this year, i’ve worked so hard to grow out of it so here are some lessons I’ve learned along the way:1- I used to take judgment seriously until I realized people who judge you are usually projecting their own unhappiness. Remember happy people are too busy living their lives, not judging others.2- confidence takes time and practice: The more you do it the more natural confidence becomes. confidence is attractive and inspiring3- not everything is a life or death situation. Learn to chill and stop taking everything so seriously. The less you take things seriously the more you have fun.4- social skills are practice not a talent. The more you socialize with people the more you get better at it.5- people can be selfish and its why learning to put yourself first is important. Protect your energy and put yourself first.6- its 100% okay to walk away: Some people wont respect you or your boundaries and thats their problem not yours.7- learn how to detach from people who dont help you grow. It’s going to save you from a lot of heartbreak. Some people are not worth crying or being sad over.8- final and favourite tip: maybe youre not healing because youre in the same place that made you sick.Thats all. I hope those tips were helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read all that, bye now.",
