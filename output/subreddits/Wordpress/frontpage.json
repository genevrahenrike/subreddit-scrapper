How'd they even do a wavy effect? I don't see any banners on my end like this. How do you edit with the actual website background?

The scenario is as follows, you created several websites for your clients (using Elementor or not) and now you want to keep them saved (for security and even for collection) so, do you use git? And if so, is there a solution like in NPM where I don't need to upload all the \"standard\" files from the site, and when I want to run the project locally, I would just need git clone and then npm start to download the dependencies. I found this article at LocaWeb , but I don't know if it is the most suitable or \"standard\" in the community. Currently my only way of maintaining/saving my codes in Wordpress has been local copies on my desktop (which doesn't seem interesting at all). *See, I'm not talking about website hosting, but a \"backup\" for the source code",

      "content_preview": "Hi All, I've tried searching, but no luck... I'm afraid that Google is missing a tonne of our content from our multiple and detailed contact forms (I want them to be found for the purposes of SEO)... I've been noticing that when I started to do some keyword search/researching (via chrome exts/plugins), that I would have keywords that I could see 3 times above the fold (like: \"building site\") clearly visible, but the keyword research results, etc, saying \"keyword occurrences: 0, keyword density: 0%\"... ... But this issue is ONLY happening where the text/copy/words are on the contact form (WS Form), not the standard page text above the form (which seemed to be indexed/searchable just fine). When you load the webpages that contain contact forms on them, they only load after user interaction (move mouse 1mm, etc) becuase of lazy loading. ... So aiming to test that without lazy loading having any affect, I've tried searching the pages without caching (avoiding NitroPack optimised pages with \"/?nonitro\" tag appended to the URL, the pages load correctly without lazy loading, but no luck on the keywords being noticed... This site also runs through Cloudflare, but just recently having to start setting that all up again from scratch, I'm pretty sure there's no caching going on there... but am all ears of how to test if CF is possible cause too. I've done some basic tests and can't see any 'noindex' etc tags anywhere... I'm stumped. So, the only main factors I could see that might affect the forms' content not being read by Google etc... - WS Forms issue/settings? - NitroPack issue/settings? - Cloudflare issue/settings? Other info... It's built in WordPress with Divi (but all other content is also built with them too, and keywords give correct results/searches fine if not inside form). Can someone please help shed some light on what is happening here, and how to fix it? (The forms are very thorough and industry-specific, and I really think they need to be counting towards our SEO!) Yes, I could reach out to the tech support of each plugin etc, but I find many of them just point the finger of blame at each other, back and forth... also, Cloudflare support was pretty bad last time I tried to get help.",

I am trying to help a friend who has a small WP site but the designer disappeared years ago and he hasn't done anything with the site at all. Since I don't know WP I hired someone from Fiverr to give me an hour lesson thru zoom to show me around the dashboard and we changed 2 little things (store address and year in footer). I've used Fiverr on the past for all sorts of small things like professional voice over work to excel macro sheets. Every time I got a good person, good work at a fraction of the cost it would be in the states. This person who showed me around WP is from Pakistan, spoke good English and seems like a nice person. He would do a new 10 page site for $200 US dollars which is dirt cheap and in the non budget my friend has for this project and $200 by itself is more then the average monthly salary for someone on Pakistan and he said he can get the site done in a few days so he's doing probably 8-10 sites a month which is a very good salary in Pakistan.  My concern/fear is that something can be programmed in the site to grab customer information or some other malicious code. I know I can change the account password after things are done but am I being too paranoid. The world is screwed up these days and my paranoia seems just.  Of couse a good old American charging 10k for a site could do the exact same thing that I'm concerned of. What are your thoughts on this? I appreciate you all taking time to read the ramblings of an old man. BTW, I built prob 40 sites in my day between 1994 and 2002 before I stopped😄.",

      "content_preview": "EdgeOne is a free secure CDN service offered by Tencent Cloud. Since it's currently free, I decided to try integrating it. My access method: DNSPod Managed Access Used the rule template: WordPress Website Setup However, I customized the WordPress rules myself. Of course, this requires modification and optimization based on your specific website's actual conditions. The official default rules are merely a general template. For example, if you don't want to cache JS or CSS files, you can simply remove them from the rules https://preview.redd.it/tutorial-for-integrating-wordpress-sites-with-tencent-cloud-v0-b80jzfviiomf1.jpg Acceleration and Security – Security Protection – Web Protection – Site-Level Protection Policy Within this section, Custom Rules – Add custom rules as needed. I only add and write tutorials based on my requirements. Control Type: User-Agent Matching Method: Wildcard Matching Control Scope: Then select: Block https://preview.redd.it/tutorial-for-integrating-wordpress-sites-with-tencent-cloud-v0-7hy0ur0qgomf1.jpg This is equivalent to a UA blacklist. If such a UA is detected, it will be blocked. https://preview.redd.it/tutorial-for-integrating-wordpress-sites-with-tencent-cloud-v0-k93h31yxgomf1.jpg Then scroll down to the “Hosting Rules” section and disable this option, along with the “Evaluation Mode” below it. If you don't disable them, the interception will be ineffective and everything will default to observation mode. https://preview.redd.it/tutorial-for-integrating-wordpress-sites-with-tencent-cloud-v0-ilr1dng4homf1.jpg Moving forward, there is a rule set. The free version has a default rule set; change it to block. https://preview.redd.it/tutorial-for-integrating-wordpress-sites-with-tencent-cloud-v0-56xedlb9homf1.jpg Other Protection Rules: Adaptive Rate Control – Set to Lenient. Adjust this based on your website's traffic volume. Lenient: 2000 requests per visitor within 5 seconds before blocking. If you have a low-traffic single-page site, “Moderate” is sufficient. If you detect brute-force attacks, switch to “Emergency” mode. In Emergency mode: Client requests are limited to 40 per 10 seconds. If you've used Cloudflare before, you'll be familiar with these configurations. DDoS protection is enabled by default. Traffic Anti-Fraud – Enable blocking For low-traffic websites, I recommend direct blocking without setting up JavaScript challenges. If your site has high traffic, you can enable monitoring or challenges for analysis. Then, for site-wide settings: Case insensitivity, cache pre-refresh, offline caching, and file optimization are all enabled. HTTPS-related: If you have no special requirements, you can directly select Apply for a free certificate. Some of its more conventional features are comparable to Cloudflare. If it doesn't impose restrictions on QPS requests or performance, it will undoubtedly attract a large user base. Competing with Cloudflare will require time to prove itself, but for users, it simply means another option is now available.",

See the screenshots below: on a wide screen, it is fine without a background, but on a phone, the menu background looks odd. Before you suggest changing the appearance, hear me out—it’s a bit more complicated. Keep on reading below. The website is here: https://fabgoalie.ai/ https://preview.redd.it/submenu-in-header-stays-transparent-cannot-change-v0-btazh5c6bomf1.png https://preview.redd.it/submenu-in-header-stays-transparent-cannot-change-v0-ovxm46c6bomf1.png I’m using a block template and Polylang for multilingual support. To make the menus adjust for each language, I installed the legacy widget, which works. I created a separate menu for each language. However, this also means I can’t adjust the background under Styles or Blocks . Changing the Navigation or Submenu block doesn’t affect the menus—the background remains transparent. https://preview.redd.it/submenu-in-header-stays-transparent-cannot-change-v0-noqrc1c6bomf1.png https://preview.redd.it/submenu-in-header-stays-transparent-cannot-change-v0-3zfpl2c6bomf1.png https://preview.redd.it/submenu-in-header-stays-transparent-cannot-change-v0-2z8xi6c6bomf1.png",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been looking into ETCH lately. It seems like a really solid, developer-focused builder, but since it’s still a work in progress I’m hesitant to dive in. I’ve been burned before when tools lost support: Oxygen → the lead dev shifted focus to a new product, leaving people stuck. Cwicly → just straight up discontinued. Arc browser → I invested a ton of time into it, only for the team to move on to something else and stop updating Arc. Stuff like this makes me wonder: how do you actually decide which plugins or tools are safe to build a business on? A lot of senior devs I’ve talked to say they usually stick with tools that have a strong reputation and a big user base. Even if something new is faster or more exciting, the stability and long-term support of the popular ones usually win out.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I have a question about the licensing of paid WordPress plugins that's been on my mind, and I'd love to get your thoughts. Here's the scenario: I'm getting tired of the subscription model for many plugins, especially when some developers are slow to release updates. I'm a developer myself, and I'm comfortable maintaining my own code. So, I'm considering this plan: Purchase a paid plugin with a single-site license . After the initial purchase, I don't renew the license for ongoing support or updates. I then modify the plugin's code myself to fix bugs, add features, or just maintain it for compatibility. Here's the key part: I want to use this self-modified version on multiple websites that I personally own or manage for clients. My question is, where does this fall legally and ethically? I understand that most WordPress plugins are under a GPL license, but the \"premium\" part often involves support, updates, and sometimes assets (like CSS/JS) under a different license. To be clear, I have no intention of redistributing or reselling the modified plugin. This would be strictly for my own use on sites I control. Is this a clear violation of the license agreement? Is it illegal? Or is it a legal gray area because of the GPL? TL;DR: I bought a single-site paid plugin. Can I legally modify it myself and use it on multiple sites I manage without buying more licenses? Thanks for any insights",
