      "content_preview": "ZS Earnings Analysis Summary (2025-09-01) Summary (executive): My read: Zscaler (ZS) is moderately-to-strongly bullish into earnings based on repeat beat history, solid revenue momentum, strong gross margins, healthy cashflow and sector tailwinds. Options market is pricing a ~9–10% move; chain shows heavier put OI below current price (institutional hedging) and concentrated call interest at 285–300. Premiums on the provided 2025-09-05 chain are material (ATM calls $9–13+; 300C ask $6.20) — these are the prices we must use. Verdict: Moderate Bullish. I will recommend a single‑leg naked call trade using only strikes/prices in the provided options table: Buy the 2025-09-05 300.00 Call @ $6.20 (ask). This balances probability (delta ≈ 0.30–0.45), liquidity (OI 208), and cash risk vs. expected move. Earnings prediction analysis (framework-driven) A. Fundamental Earnings Drivers Revenue momentum: TTM revenue growth 22.6% — healthy growth for a mid‑cap security SaaS name; sequential momentum intact. Margin dynamics: Very high gross margin (77.5%), still negative operating/profit margins (-3.7% / -1.5%) due to growth investments. FCF positive ~$734M and $3.0B cash balance reduce execution risk. Guidance / surprise pattern: Material edge: historical beat rate 100% (last 8 quarters) and average surprise ~25.7% (last 8). Management tends to sandbag guidance → positive surprise skew. Consensus revision: Forward EPS est $3.56; analyst targets biased higher (avg target $316.75). Street sentiment overall constructive but priced for growth. Net fundamental read: Bullish with a clear positive surprise tail (but high valuation r... 🔥 Unlock full content: https://discord.gg/quantsignals https://preview.redd.it/zs-quant-signals-earnings-v2-2025-09-01-v0-ysrf3auqzlmf1.jpg",

      "content_preview": "Bull Case – Why IBRX Looks Like a Prime Short Squeeze Candidate 1. Extremely High Short Interest Short Float: 78.38% – This is extremely high, putting IBRX in the top tier of heavily shorted stocks. Anything over 40% is considered ripe for a squeeze if momentum kicks in. Short Ratio (Days to Cover): 8.96 – This means it would take nearly 9 days for short sellers to close positions under average daily volume, which is very favorable for a squeeze. 2. Insider Ownership Insider Ownership: 89.60% – Insiders hold the majority of shares, which drastically reduces available float for shorts to cover, increasing potential squeeze pressure. 3. Technical Setup Price just broke above its 20-day SMA ($2.61) and is now approaching the 50-day SMA ($2.77) . A clean break and hold above that could accelerate momentum toward the 200-day SMA at $3.19 . RSI: 59 – Room to run before overbought territory (70+). Volume Spike: August 13 saw ~30.7M shares traded, well above the 8.6M average — early sign of accumulation. 4. Recent Positive Momentum 1-Week Performance: +18.49% 1-Month Performance: +22.26% Quarterly Performance: +12.35% Buyers have been stepping in, and shorts may start feeling pressure if this continues. Bear Case – Why It Might Not Be Worth the Risk 1. Financial Weakness Negative Income: -$367M, P/S at 47.10 is very high relative to revenue. Negative Margins: Gross margin is high (70.86%), but operating margin (-504%) and profit margin (-648%) are catastrophic — burning cash fast. Negative ROE: -86.74% indicates very poor returns on equity. 2. Long-Term Downtrend 1-Year Performance: -37.04%, 5-Year Performance: -73.17% — shows a history of dilution and decline. Still under long-term resistance from November highs (~$7). 3. Biotech Risk As a biotech, stock movement is heavily tied to trial results, FDA decisions, and capital raises. Any bad news can crater the price instantly. Pros vs. Cons Table Pros Cons Extremely high short float (78%) Weak financials, negative margins High insider ownership (89%) Historically poor performance Recent technical breakout signs Heavy biotech sector risk Low float liquidity squeeze potential Still in a long-term downtrend Increasing volume Dependent on news catalysts",

      "content_preview": "Tilray (TLRY) has a rare setup brewing: possible U.S. cannabis policy news in September, heavy short interest, insider conviction, a stronger balance sheet than people think, and a legit beer business on top. Add October earnings into all this, and you’ve got a recipe for a September run that could squeeze toward $10. September, catalyst window The White House has said a cannabis rescheduling decision is coming “in the next few weeks.” That puts September front and center. If weed gets bumped to Schedule III, it’s not legalization, but it is a tax and operations game-changer. Even small policy hints have sent TLRY vertical before. This would be the biggest shift in years. Momentum into September + a real policy headline = the perfect setup for a spike. Shorts are walking on a trap door About 13–17% of TLRY’s float is shorted. If a catalyst hits, shorts will have no choice but to cover. That’s where you get the face melting moves, the kind that gap a stock 50–100% overnight and keep running as late shorts panic. With calls stacking up and dealers forced to hedge, a squeeze in September isn’t just possible it’s on the table. Fundamentals aren’t broken • TLRY Nasdaq compliance restored (10+ closes over $1). • FY revenue around $821M. • Q4 adjusted EBITDA: $27.6M, trending up. • $256M cash on hand; debt around 0.3x EBITDA. Bottom line: TLRY isn’t a zombie stock any more than OPEN was. That gives institutions and traders confidence to pile in when momentum flips. Beer business = hidden upside Tilray is now a top-5 U.S. craft beer company after scooping brands from Anheuser-Busch and Molson Coors. Craft beer itself isn’t mooning, but the distribution network matters. If cannabis-infused drinks ever break through, Tilray already has the shelf space. Even near term, it makes them more than “just weed.” Europe + October earnings = extra fuel Germany expanded its medical cannabis market, and Tilray already has a facility supplying it. That’s long-term optionality. But in the short term: earnings in early October. If the stock is already moving on September hype, traders could push it higher into the print. Price action potential (in my opinion) TLRY sits around $1.38 now. Scenarios I see: • Base case (no news): $1.50 - $2 chop. • Policy catalyst: first leg toward $3 - $5. • Short squeeze + hype: $7 - $10+ blow-off move possible. If the catalyst hits, momentum + shorts could drive a serious run. If not, I cut quick. Shares safer than options given IV spikes. September is Tilray’s window. Shorts are loaded, calls are flowing, insider buys add confidence, and a policy bombshell could send this thing vertical. $10 isn’t guaranteed but for once, it’s not just a meme, it's a dream slowly becoming reality.",

I verify all strikes/premiums against the provided OPTIONS DATA and use only those exact values. Executive summary Recommendation: Buy-to-open SNOW 2025-08-29 210.00 Call at ask = $7.25 (single-leg, naked call). Entry: pre_earnings_close (prior to the AMC print). Rationale: Strong fundamental upside potential (AI/data tailwinds, 88% beat history, robust revenue growth) + significant pre-earnings volume and call OI concentration. Technical setup shows washed-out short-term sell pressure but strong support at the 200-day MA. Options positioning implies a meaningful expected move (~±9%) but skew/OI favors upside. Directional view: Moderate Bullish. Confidence: 75%. Earnings prediction analysis (framework-driven) A. Fundamental earnings drivers (score 8/10) Revenue momentum: Positive. TTM revenue +25.7%; revenue/share $11.55; large enterprise exposure to AI/data workloads. Momentum consistent with expectations for an upside surprise catalyst. Margins: Structural weakness (Net margin -36.4%; Op margin -32.7%) but FCF positive ($1.158B) and large cash balance ($3.91B) provide runway for continued investment. Market will price guidance/margins into multiple — downside risk if guidance tightens. Guidance pattern: Historically conservative with an 88% beat rate and large average surprise (46.9%). That pattern supports a skewed upside probability. Consensus revision: Analyst average PT $233.90 (range $150–$440) and reported analyst upside 16.5% — supportive. Net: fundamentals favor upside surprise but valuation and margins remain material conditional risks. B. Options market intelligence (score 7/10) Implied move: ATM weekly straddle implies ~±8.5–9.5% expected... 🔥 Unlock full content: https://discord.gg/quantsignals https://preview.redd.it/snow-quant-signals-earnings-v2-2025-08-27-v0-p2evxhgr1mlf1.jpg",

The $QQQ tech index closed last week at 553.88 (-1.97%) to turn the weekly candle into an ugly bearish engulfing pattern with a top wick spanning ~20pts from ~554 (last close) to 574.63 (all-time high). Despite the steep nature of the decline over the last couple of trading sessions, I wouldn't worry unless we fail to flip old resistance/all-time high at 540 into new support as an indicator for structural resumption of long-term uptrend. If we lose 540 , then we would test 530-525 support range in quick order. The only real directional sentiment determinants for the day are economic data releases, so just pay attention to those and any other headlines/catalysts intraday. Bitcoin is currently trading at ~$114.5k/coin, spot Gold is at ~$3,417/oz, and spot Silver is at ~$37.3/oz. Regardless of broader market sentiment, you can always locate relative strength by tapping/clicking on the column headers to sort the live watchlist in descending order of whichever data metric is important to you. Today's economic data releases are: 🇺🇸 Factory Orders (Jun) @ 10AM ET 🇺🇸 US Core Durable Goods Revised @ 10AM ET 🇺🇸 US Durable Goods @ 10AM ET 📙Breakdown point: BELOW this price, the move will lose momentum significantly in the short-term, as shorts will gain confidence encouraging them to short more. Reducing probability of a squeeze without a catalyst. 📙Breakout point: ABOVE this price, the move will gain momentum significantly in the short-term, as shorts losses will increase pressuring them to cover. Increasing the probability of a squeeze occurring, especially if with a catalyst. 4. $APLD Squeezability Score: 50% Juice Target: 33.0 Confidence: 🍊 🍊 Price: 12.52 (+4.72%) Breakdown point: 11.0 Breakout point: 15.5 Mentions (30D): 2 Event/Condition: Massive rel vol spike + Very bullish reaction to earnings report after company targets $7B in contracted revenue in long-term AI data center leases as company accelerates build-out timeline + Potentially imminent resumption of long-term uptrend/bullish momentum + New price target 🎯 of $18 from Lake Street. 5. $SVV Squeezability Score: 33% Juice Target: 24.6 Confidence: 🍊 🍊 Price: 11.47 (+10.18%) Breakdown point: 10.0 Breakout point: 11.9 Mentions (30D): 0 🆕 Event/Condition: Small rel vol ramp after very positive reaction to earnings report + Potentially imminent long-term downtrend bullish reversal + Company raises 2025 outlook with net sales target of $1.69B as US comps climb + New price target 🎯 of $13 from Baird.

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/squeezefinder-aug-25th-2025-v0-r2izndpb36lf1.png Good morning, SqueezeFinders! The $QQQ tech index made a very aggressive move upward after Jerome Powell gave multiple indications that the Fed maybe ready to cut rates this year. He also mentioned they were dropping their prior framework of the Federal Reserve seeking inflation that targets 2% and one to it making decisions on employment based on shortfalls from its maximum levels. The $QQQ tech index closed on Friday up 1.54% at 571.97. This leaves us ~2% away from making new all-time highs above 583.32. The main support level we should aim to hold before getting concerned about further volatility is ~560. No major directional sentiment determinants today, but there will be a lot of anticipation building as we approach Wednesday, as $NVDA, $SNOW, $CRWD, and $HP will all be reporting in after-hours. We will have the most clarity on market sentiment by Thursday morning this week. Bitcoin currently trades for ~$112.7k/coin, Gold trades for ~$3,410/oz, and Silver is near ~$38.3/oz. Regardless of broader market sentiment, you can always locate relative strength by tapping/clicking on the column headers to sort the live watchlist in descending order of whichever data metric is important to you. Also stay tuned for our new upcoming trading research tool, SqueezeRadar!

The $QQQ tech index was largely flat yesterday as volatility played out while traders awaited the the highly anticipated $NVDA earnings results for the quarter. The $QQQ tech index closed yesterday at 573.49 (+0.15%) before the semiconductor giant announced top and bottom line beats (again) paired with a whopping $60B share buyback. They only fell slightly shy on data center revenues due to China. Seeing lots of analyst (Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Bernstein, etc..) price target upgrades to 200+ for $NVDA, so hopefully Wall Street can give us another delayed reaction jump, and set the broader market up for new all-times again soon. The $QQQ tech index remains less than a 2% rally from all-time highs, and ~2% decline to the 560 support zone.

      "content_preview": "Why the Enovix Warrant Dividend Will Trigger Massive Short Covering Enovix (ENVX) just pulled off one of the most effective anti-short-seller moves the market's seen in ages—a warrant dividend. If you’re wondering why this is particularly bad news for shorts, here’s the simple breakdown: Well first heres a reference that started this post and gives it some credibility to read: https://ir.enovix.com/static-files/3a1c4d42-81f3-4b68-8750-3ee2d5b90f79 1. What’s a Warrant Dividend? Enovix granted all shareholders of record as of July 17, 2025, one tradable warrant for every 7 shares they hold (symbol: ENVXW). Each warrant lets you buy more stock at $8.75/share (when the stock itself was ~$14.75 at announcement), meaning each warrant is instantly worth about $6 . If you don’t want more ENVX stock, you can just sell the warrant and pocket the cash. 2. Why Are Short Sellers Screwed? Short sellers “borrow” shares and sell them, aiming to buy them back lower. But with this dividend, anyone short as of the record date is required to deliver the new warrants to whoever owns the real shares they shorted. Management sent out a letter to shareholders stating their stock is being manipulated at earnings calls/events and posted evidence of claims. . Here’s the problem: There were about 44 million ENVX shares sold short (almost 27% of the float—a huge short interest) I confirmed on highshortinterest.com float size To deliver the warrant dividend, shorts have to produce warrants for every share they’re short...but only real, registered shareholders get them, not the shorts themselves. Shorts now have two ugly choices: Buy back shares ASAP to close their position before the dividend, ideally before warrant distribution, to avoid owing the warrants. Remain short and scramble to acquire warrants (by buying shares back in the market—driving the price up), otherwise risk forced buy-ins or face legal/contractual headaches as their brokers and clearing firms must deliver the dividend they cannot manufacture. 3. The Squeeze Is On With 44 million shares short (and only about 2 million available to borrow recently), there’s nowhere near enough extra shares for shorts to cover easily . As everyone needs the same thing simultaneously (warrants, or shares to cover to avoid the liability), shorts are forced to buy shares back at higher and higher prices—triggering a classic “short squeeze” situation .Expire on Oct. 1, 2026 – UNLESS ENVX trades above $10.50 for 20 of 30 trading days, in which case they could expire as early as 5:00pm ET on August 19, 2025. Yes that means on august 19th they could literally put out a press release. 4. This Is NOT Like Ordinary Dividends Cash dividends are just paid through the system; warrant and share dividends physically require delivery of new instruments (in this case, tradable warrants). You can't fudge delivery—the only way out is buying the stock (covering shorts). 5. TL;DR: Enovix’s warrant dividend means shorts must deliver valuable warrants for every share they’ve shorted. There aren’t enough loose shares around, forcing them to buy back stock at almost any price. This cycle is a recipe for a massive short squeeze. August 19th is the earliest the business could announce recall of warrants. || || |“This only increases the difficulty to start a squeeze”| later ❌ Backward logic. More float can reduce squeeze pressure , but the immediate effect is neutral or bullish due to prior share recalls.“Now, warrants provide shorts more shares on the market to cover” ❌ Shorts don’t get the warrants; only registered shareholders as of July 17 do. Exercised warrants may increase float in the future, but not instantly.“This only increases the difficulty to start a squeeze” ❌ Backward logic. More float can reduce squeeze pressure later, but the immediate effect is neutral or bullish due to prior share recalls.| If August 19 triggers the early expiration, the actual dilution (float increase) won’t materialize for mid-late september , giving shorts limited time to exit in a potentially thin float environment. Check the company's own FAQ and recent shareholder letter for the details—this isn’t theoretical, it’s happening now. Positions: September Opex calls august 22nd calls",

The $QQQ tech index closed yesterday @ 569.28 (down 1.36%), and has been dragging us into a more precarious situation as the index grinds lower— testing every support. Bulls need to hold support near 560, or we risk retesting the 540 long-term pivot in the near-term. Bitcoin trades for ~$113k/coin, spot Gold for ~$3,370/oz, and spot Silver trading near ~$37.2/oz. The main directional sentiment determinants for today will be $TGT earnings in premarket, and also the FOMC meeting & Jackson Hole Symposium will have an impact on market sentiment. Regardless of broader market sentiment, you can always locate relative strength by tapping/clicking the “Price” column header to sort the live watchlist in descending order of top gainer.

Reducing probability of a squeeze without a catalyst. 📙Breakout point: ABOVE this price, the move will gain momentum significantly in the short-term, as shorts losses will increase pressuring them to cover.
