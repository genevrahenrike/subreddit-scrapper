The story dives into a nightmarish apocalypse where the dead don’t simply rise—they evolve. As cities collapse, survivors confront not only the infected, but the crushing silence of a world unraveling. It’s written to be raw, bleak, and unsettling—perfect if you like your horror with an apocalyptic edge. Since this is my debut release, I’d be incredibly grateful for anyone who grabs a copy, gives it a read, and maybe leaves an honest review. Every bit of feedback helps me grow as a writer.

I probably wouldn’t have ever thought of picking it up with the title tbh, doesn’t sound like my kind of thing but I seen a rec on YouTube, and a defeated goddess landing in a lake next to a woman who just wants to collect her rocks, smoke her pipe and look after her pet snails sounded intriguing. 50% in and I’m not disappointed so just wanted to give the book some love.

      "content_preview": "Hey all, I’m basically new to reading. Haven’t really read in like 20 years, and even back then I didn’t do much of it. I just got a Kindle and want to start actually reading, but I don’t want to spend money on books I might not like. I’ve seen people recommend stuff like Project Hail Mary and Red Rising, but those aren’t on Kindle Unlimited and the library waitlists are long. So I’m looking for something: •\tEasy to get into •\tEngaging enough to keep me reading •\tAvailable on Kindle Unlimited or free somewhere Any suggestions? Thanks!",

But I did the math on how much you have to read before costing Amazon money from your subscription and I’ve already superseded that so it’s been worth it for me!

It’s a short, practical guide for anyone who feels stuck in their own head — always regretting the past or worrying about the future — and wants to finally experience peace of mind. I wrote it because I used to struggle with constant mental noise myself, and what I share here are the simple practices that actually helped me quiet it down. If you’re in KU, you can read it for free: 👉 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPBD3X7S Would love to hear from anyone who reads it — what parts resonated, and what you’d like to see in future books. https://preview.redd.it/new-self-help-book-in-ku-finding-peace-of-mind-by-letting-v0-jhfn0g4e4jmf1.jpg",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been a KU reader for years, and now it feels surreal to say that two of my own books are available there. They’re very different from each other, but both are close to me in different ways: Resolute – a science fiction thriller with conspiracy and mystery elements. It all begins with a forgotten signal from the past, leading to a story about science, exploration, and human choices. If you enjoy twists and suspense with a touch of sci-fi, this might be up your alley. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8M9KCLR The Art of Copiloting – nonfiction, based on my background in aviation. It explores the idea that flying is never a solo act, and how teamwork in the cockpit can teach us lessons about decision-making, communication, and learning from mistakes. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKTFF744 I’d love for other KU readers to give them a try, and I’m curious: do you all usually stick to one genre in your KU reads, or do you also mix fiction and nonfiction?",

I also seem to keep finding books written by UK authors, which I dont care for the language differences and it usually distracts me from the story.  I love fantasy/sci-fi stories with witches, ghosts, fae, time travel, folk lore etc, but bored of the same old storylines like someone is inheriting a haunted house or accidentally finding out they're a witch or some fae royalty.  Series can be fun, but after a few books, I tend to feel like they become monotonous, especially if the author is constantly recapping previous events. I also like murder mysteries and sappy stories. Some authors I've liked in the past are: Ilona Andrews, Charlain Harris, Jodi Picoult, Alice Sebold, Deborah Harkness, Anne Rice, Patricia Briggs, Terri Reid, Gregg Olson, Robert Dugoni I have Prime Reading and Kindle Unlimited, but dont mind paying a few bucks for a great book or series. TL;DR - Looking for recommendations for non-romance, US based authors or books that include fantasy, sci-fi type characters/themes or gripping, emotional, dramatic or murder-mystery stories.",

What about the tale of a troubled young man, his put-upon friend, an appliance store clerk, and an aging thrift store owner—searching for answers, within the shining halls of an endless shopping mall with no apparent exits? Do you want to see slice of life moments, pulse-pounding action, magic, portals, sleuthing, scheming, romance, wholesome murders, bureaucratic demons, philosophical meandering, and at least one talking animal? You do? Well that's a hell of a coincidence. This is turning out to be a pretty good day for both of us. Come on in, take your shoes off, and sit for a while. Trigger warnings: Violence, gore, death, body horror, torture, spiders, implied sexual violence (references to the past), existential horror, dad jokes, frequent use of adverbs, and the escalator on the cover is out of service.

Defying expression, even through rhyme. No meatier part of the year than its prime, To stew in our fear—the passage of time. The forests, the grass, the beaches and parks. The wind through the trees carries laughter, and barks. Through down-dogged days wreathed by fire, we marched. Our own meat sauteed—then seared, scorched, and parched. Through nights thick as soup did we toss, turn, and slog, Our reward, come the 'noon? The hair of the dog. Undeterred by the hellhound, huzzah ! On we pressed. Through that season most favoured by ol' #Blessed. Now facing destruction, we stand 'fore a Fall. For the pumpkin spice cometh, and it takes us all. The night's bitter chill brings a word from the grave. Through the passage of years, time's made us a slave. But hark! There's a herald, a breaker of chains. An angel of portent, a taker of pains. Take pride in your year, as it takes one from you. And maybe, your year will take pride in you, too. Together, we find, as we both face the end, Time left to curl up, with a future old friend. Take hold of your fate, for it warrants a look, Find more to be proud of, within a good book.

      "content_preview": "(A book for emotionally inconsistent overachievers, burnt-out soft people, and anyone pretending to be fine.) You meant to get your life together. You tried to heal, hustle, journal, meditate, optimize, exfoliate your trauma, and pivot into a “better you.” It didn’t work. That’s okay. This book won’t fix you either. Part self-help parody, part emotional survival guide, You Tried traces nine deeply unnecessary “stages of personal development” from denial to weaponized mediocrity. Written for anyone who’s ever cried in a grocery store, Googled “how to be okay,” or responded to a text with “LOL I’m fine,” You Tried is a deeply human meditation on doing less, spiralling with style, and calling it growth. This is not a guide to success. It’s a messy shrine to trying anyway. Link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDFPS9YH About me: Todd holds several post-secondary degrees of questionable utility, including a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (with a minor in Overthinking), a Bachelor of Social Work (specializing in Well-Intentioned Burnout), and a Master of Social Work, which he still lists on LinkedIn because it sounds impressive and the debt isn’t paid off yet. He spent a decade practising in Child and Adolescent Mental Health, a career that—while noble—eventually revealed itself to be an elaborate and covert form of on-the-job self-therapy. Once he realized he was treating his own unresolved childhood issues via paperwork, behaviour management, and youth group facilitation, he did what any responsible adult would do: quit, and pivoted into podcasting. By a combination of luck, timing, and unsettling relatability, he became accidentally successful in communications. He now makes things that sound like he knows what he’s doing, despite being plagued daily by Imposter syndrome so thick you could spread it on toast. Todd has won a few awards. None of them helped. His current achievements include functioning despite existential dread, getting out of bed (most days), and pretending to be emotionally regulated in client-facing emails. He wrote this book because he was tired of trying to get better. Those who can’t do, teach. And those unpublished blog rants just sitting there in the draft folder made good filler for the nearly-forgotten vintage manuscript on the failing hard drive. (Congrats if you're still reading at this point. No judgment to those that didn't. I'd be struggling if I were them.)",

I wrote this for fans of dark, sprawling epics with high stakes and morally grey characters. If you're looking for a new world to get lost in, I'd be honored if you'd give it a shot. It's a story of: A hidden prophecy and a \"nobody\" orphan with a secret power. A merciless \"Mad King\" and the brutal politics of a fracturing kingdom. A found family of outcasts fighting for survival. Demonic creatures, forbidden magic, and a cosmic wound bleeding across the sky. Thank you for supporting indie authors! Amazon Link Goodreads Link",

It’s a collection of five intense erotic romance short stories—written to explore the deeper side of intimacy, emotional connection, and passion. Honestly, sales and views have been close to zero so far, and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t discouraging. But my friends who’ve read it were really surprised I even wrote it—and even more surprised that they loved it! I’d love to connect with others on the same path: what helped you get your first book noticed? Any advice on reaching romance/erotica readers?

      "content_preview": "I can promise you this is unlike anything you’ve ever read. Because this story isn’t about some “chosen one” who magically appears to save the world. It’s worse. Alex doesn’t want to be the one to save anything, especially not the crumbling underwater kingdom he awakens to after a terrible incident…an incident that was no accident at all... Check it out Full official blurb down here :) Alex is extraordinary but he doesn't know it. His life is a soggy loop of visits to the principal's office, and sleeping in a room that doesn't feel like his own. That's his life. He doesn't complain because he can't change it. But something strange has been happening to him. It's unexplainable and goes against everything he's ever known of himself. He hasn't told anyone because it's stupid, completely unrealistic of him to draw such a conclusion... but the facts are there and even more certain when he is dragged forcefully into a world of fantasies. A world where mermaids are real and where evil exists in the hands of a false king. It is then obvious that he was meant for much, much more.",
