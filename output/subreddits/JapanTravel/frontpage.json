I tried to leave evenings pretty open so we can add on as much as were feelingWe're traveling with a.. chaotic... 4 year old. He has traveled with us since he was born and we are used to big trips and lots of walking. I just wanted to include some things he may really like. The preteen plus myself and husband are going to just enjoy being in the country.  I wanted to find something Power Rangers...even if it is a shop with figurinesPreteen daughter is really into foxes but I was hesitant to look at the animal cafes d/t animal neglect and abuse. Any suggestions?If I buy the Suica card for me, husband, and preteen, will that cover my entire trip (minus shinkansen)? I was confused if I needed the kansai one once in kyoto...I know I mention taxi a lot but I am so worried about my sweet 4 year old disrespecting the culture. He is just a talkative kid and won't really understand why he all of a sudden is being shushed. Not loud or disruptive but there is always a topic to be discussed. What is etiquette on shinkansen? Do you chat with your parties or is it expected to be quiet as well?Thank you for any suggestions",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone!My friend and I are traveling to Japan from December 1–18, and it’s our first time there. What’s most important to us is getting a good first impression of Japan without rushing from place to place. We’re not so interested in hitting all the typical sightseeing spots—instead, we’d like to experience the culture through flea markets, markets, temple visits, food, bars, and museums. I’ve also taken a small Japanese course and I’m really looking forward to using the little bit I’ve learned.Do you think this itinerary is realistic? It’s important to us not to spend too much time on trains (we won’t be renting a car, just using trains). Are we too short on time in Takayama and the Kiso Valley? Or is there something else along our route that we should squeeze in, so that we only return to Tokyo a day later (say, December 15)? Also, are we spending too long in Tokyo for first-timers?TOKYO (Dec 1–5)Dec 1: Arrival, get over jetlag, explore Asakusa, visit Konbinis, Mori Tower for Tokyo skyline view, Mori and TeamLab Borderless, early nightDec 2 (Tue): Akihabara, bars in the eveningDec 3 (Wed): Morning shopping at Kappabashi Street, jazz bar at nightDec 4 (Thu): Shopping, Tokyo Photographic Art Museum, karaoke bar in the eveningDec 5 (Fri): Heiwajima Antique Fair (first day, planning to go early).

      "content_preview": "Hi all,Wanted to get some feedback/suggestions on our itinerary to Japan 12/10 - 12/25. This is our first time to Japan and it will be my wife, myself and our two kids (10yo son and 8yo daughter). We just found out recently that my wife is expecting too - she will be around 19 weeks upon going and around 20 weeks by the time we are back.I have a rough itinerary but Kanazawa is a wildcard. I only saw it as an alternative suggestion to Kyoto originally when I was initially planning to go in November to see foliage. I hear it's nice in December but it may snow (and be icy and colder) and perhaps is just too much so I'm thinking maybe it's not the best idea? If we were to cut Kanazawa out, I'm guessing we should allot more time in Tokyo and maybe Kyoto?12/10 - Arrive HND around 4:30pm (catch limobus to avoid rush hour traffic - hotel likely in Shinjuku area closer to Yoyogi stations) - check into hotel, hang around Shinjuku area, grab dinner and then crash)12/11 - Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park, Harukuju, Shibuya Crossing at night + Illuminations (maybe Blue Cave?)12/12 - DisneySea (if it were Disneyland I'd skip but I hear DisneySea is pretty unique and the kids like Disney but we are not diehard fans either)12/13 - Asakusa, Sensō-ji Temple, Ueno Zoo/park(?), Sumida river walk, Tokyo Skytree (also Hello Kitty store for the daughter)12/14 - Teamlabs Planet Toyosu, Toyosu market, Odaiba (I might try to see if I can get Sushi Daiwa.... I'm not sure if my pregnant wife will like this idea though hahaha)12/15 - Shinkansen to Kanazawa - lunch or late lunch at Omicho market and Samurai District after12/16 - Kenrokuen Garden and Kanazawa Castle12/17 - Shinkansen to Kyoto (stay near Kyoto station)12/18 - Kiyomizudera and Ninenzaka (Higashiyama area and probably no Fushimari Inari - I hear it would be too grueling for a pregnant woman)12/19 - Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and Monkey Park12/20 - Nara Deer Park12/21 - Visit Uji(?) then train to Osaka (stay around Dotonbori and Namba station)12/22 - USJ (kids have been reading tons of Harry Potter lately so this may be something we can't miss)12/23 - Osaka Aquarium12/24 - Low-key day to shop, buy luggage and souvenirs/snacks/etc. Hang around Namba area. Maybe Umeda Sky?12/25 - fly out of Osaka Itami at 2:05pm (there is a connecting flight through NRT back to LAX - it's operated by ANA single ticket so it will be a connecting flight and luggage transfer handled by ANA)I just realized there were some daytrips I was considering too, like Hakone, Kamakura, Nikko or Yokohama but it seems I'm forfeiting those in favor of the Kanazawa side-trip. Not sure if any of those would be recommended for my wife (probably not Nikko if there's a lot of climbing or hiking involved) though.",

Loves Japanese food and pretty good for big walks (sure he will be on my shoulders for some!) and public transport. We are also doing some basic language and customs as he has Japanese teachers at Kindy.Day 1 - explore dontonbori, round1 stadium, sumo hall show (any recommended other spots close to these that are musts with a 5 year old boy?)Day 2 - namba yasaka, kaiyukan aquarium, Legoland, Osaka castleDay 3 - day trip Nara, maybe teamlab Nagai at night (has anyone been? Worth the effort?)Day 4 - off to Kyoto but in no rush so could do something in the morning in Osaka. Afternoon tandem Bike hire and ride around Higashiyama and Gion district.Day 5 - Arishiyama and Monkey ParkDay 6 - Nishiki Market, Train museum, Nijo castle, any recommended Kyoto arcades?Day 7 - Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizudera,Happy for any recommended cool food spots, pet cafes, better gaming spots, children’s playgrounds/parks in Osaka (staying near Osaka-Namba Station) and Kyoto (staying near Kyoto Station)! Supportive solo parent travel tips welcome.PS For anyone worried about walking distances with child, we are not locked in everything, these are just options to consider 😂 if we’re exhausted we won’t do something 🤷🏼‍♂️ I’m learning people on Reddit can be very strange.Thanks! ☺️",

For reference, I am staying in Shinjuku area in Tokyo, near Osaka Station in Osaka and near Kyoto Station in Kyoto (I've decided to stay at both Osaka and Kyoto rather than just one to make the early starts easier).

I have double packed my luggage so that I don't need to get a new one there and no surprise I needed both. The summer heat is what I will call a \"Wet Heat\" equivalent to a steam room at gym but like for the whole day. Any cooling treatment will help. I didn't have a language barrier since I learned Japanese in highschool.This trip is a mix of solo and with my family members so I never felt alone , met new people that shared same hobbies and well deserved vacation from my workload.",

      "content_preview": "Hi guys, I’m looking for some insight/feedback on how I’ve planned out our itinerary for a 2 week trip to Japan (we’ll have 12 full days to explore)! There’s 3 of us going, myself, wife and brother. We are all vegetarian. I don’t want to be rushed during the trip, but also do want to see a lot so trying to find a happy medium between the two. We are going mod to late November. From what I’m reading, sunset in Japan is at around 4:30pm, so that will play a factor into how we should structure the days.  So far, I’ve booked hotels (most if not all have cancellation policies), Tea Ceremony in Kyoto, and a ramen cooking class in Tokyo. All of these can be cancelled/adjusted as well if need be.  If you think things can be done better or have suggestions on anything, please feel free to share! Appreciate any input on our plans! Thank you!Day 1: Arrival in Haneda at 6pm. Get food and get some rest somewhere near the Tokyo train station.Day 2: 7:00am Train to Osaka from Tokyo 9:30am Reach Osaka, leave bags at hotel Explore Dontonbori until 2:30pm 3:00pm See Osaka Castle (There is an Uverworld concert going on nearby that we are trying to get tickets to, but not likely as we are foreigners - maybe we can just hang outside the venue and hear them from afar and grab some food) Pretty much just keep exploring Osaka from this point on, Dontonbori, PARCO, 2nd Street, Doguyasuji shopping street Hotel is in Umeda (reason is it’s cheaper, quieter, and gives us a reason to walk around this area as well)Day 3: Half day trip to Nara - no particular time to end, but want to reach Nara around 7:30am Want to see Todaiji, Nara Park, Higashimuki shopping street, Natkatanidou, Salon Naramachi Cafe, Kasugataisha (optional)From here we can spend the second half of the day in Osaka if we feel like there is more to be explored, or we get a head start on Kyoto. Back to hotel in Umeda to sleep.Day 4: Take early train from Osaka to Kyoto and leave bags at Arashiyama Station 8:00am Togetsukyo Bridge 9:00am Take Sagano Scenic train to Kameoka 9:30am Hozugawa Boat Ride 12:30pm Lunch maybe at Tenryuji temple/shigetsu or Sagano-yu cafe 1:00pm Kinkakuji - we’d take a taxi to get there and back to Arashiyama station 2:00pm Check in hotel near Kyoto station and drop off bags 3:00pm Nishiki market and Poncho alley for remainder of nightFrom what I’m reading, Nishiki Market shops start to close at 5:00pm. Is this itinerary enough time to spend time in Nishiki market area if we take the train back to Kyoto station to drop our bags? I know there is a bus that goes straight from Kinkakuji to Nishiki market, would this be better? If we do this, where do we store our bags?   Day 5: 6:30am Fushimi Inari at sunrise 9:00am Tea Ceremony at Maikoya Nishiki Market reservations 10:30am Pancakes at Kumonocha Cafe Soak it in and enjoy the area if we missed anything from yesterday 1:00pm Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka 3:45pm Head to Kiyomizudera for sunset 6:00pm Kodaiji at night time with illumination Spend remainder of night at Kiyamachi-dori or Gion or just by the Ina RiverDay 6: 7:15am Shinkansen to Mishima, get there at 10:00am 10:30am Get a rental car, and grab some snacks 11:00am Be on our way to Kawazu Seven Waterfalls with some stops along the way So sunset is at 4:30pm, and I want to do this hike while it’s still daylight and enjoy the Amagiso public onsen nearby. Plan on hitting the following on the way down, we don’t plan to stop too long at any of these: Ichigo Plaza in Minamiema for food, drive by Wasabi Fields of Ikadaba, Joren Falls, Old Amagi Tunnel North Side (Can I drive through this??) After the Waterfalls, we can check out the Uehara Museum, and spend the rest of the night in Shimoda and explore. We are staying at a hotel in ShimodaDay 7: We see the west coast of Izu 7:00am Get up early and see Shimoda in the daylight 9:00am Leave on our drive along west coast No particular time frame for the places we want to see but we need to wrap up by 4:00pm. Plan to see Kumomi Sengen Shrine, Dogashima Cave (we will be doing a tour, I think they are only 20 minutes long), Koganezaki Park, Lover’s Cape Gold Bell, and Mihama Beach and get Mt. Fuji views. End the night at Arai Ryokan in Shuzenji and explore the area after sunset (5:00pm onwards).Day 8: 5:00am Leave for Kawaguchiko 6:00am Arrive at Kawaguchiko and see Mt. Fuji 9:00am There is a bus from Kawaguchiko to Tokyo that we are planning on taking. The Toyota car rental offers pickup in Mishima and drop-off in Kawaguchiko according to their website, but will have to confirm. This is a 2 hour bus to Tokyo and maybe a 15-20 min train to Asakusa. 1:00pm Explore Asakusa and Akihabara Some places of interest: Sensoji, Nakamise Street, Animate 8:00pm Take Shinkansen to Nagano 10:00pm Arrive in Nagano and go to hotel to sleepDay 9: 9:00pm Togakushi Shrine There is a Soba Festival going on on this day (Nov 23rd) that we’d love to participate in! 12:00pm Zenkoji Temple We would get dinner at Zenkoji Temple as well Explore Nakamise shopping street until 4:30pm 6:00pm Watch fireworks from Saigawa Ryokuhci Park After this, head back into town if there is any bar/place to drink sake. Then head back to hotelDay 10: No real timeline for this day We go to Jigokudani Monkey Park in the morning to see the monkeys. Then go to our Shibu Onsen Ryokan and enjoy the baths/walking around/exploring. Dinner would be at the ryokan, I heard this place accommodates vegetarian/vegan meals!Day 11: No real timeline for this day We would make our way back to Tokyo Stop by in Ikebukuro probably around 11:00am. I’d like to try the Ain Soph Soar restaurant (I read Ain Soph Ripple closed). Plan to see: Animate, Sunshine City mall, K-Books. We are staying near Shinjuku Station, closer to Higashi-Shinjuku, for the remainder of the trip in Tokyo. We’d make our way there after we are done in Ikebukuro.Day 12: Planning to do some major shopping this day for anime/culture/kitchen/beauty/skin care items. 9:00am Arrive in Shibuya Station 10:00am Check out Magnet by Shibuya109, and then go to Shibuya109 12:00pm Shibuya Parco, Uniqlo and GU if time 2:00pm Shibuya Center-Gai Street 3:30pm Get in line for Shibuya Sky Tower to see views at sunset 5:00pm Get out of the tower and take the train to Harajuku station 6:00pm Get a small drink at Maccha House and head to Vegan Bistro Jangara for dinner 7:30pm Check out Harry Potter Shop From here we can explore either Takeshita Street or Cat Street and Don Quijote late night There is a bar I’d like to hit up as well called Bar Ishinohana.Day 13: 9:00am Shinjuku Station 9:30am Get breakfast at Sarabeth’s in Lumine 10:30am Reach Shin-Okubo Explore Shin-Okuba until 12:00-1:00pm 1:00pm Come back to Shinjuku Station We can shop around here if we feel it Explore Shinjuku until 3:30pm 4:00pm Get to Omoide Yokocho for sunset Explore this area, make way back to Shunjuku to explore at night Can hit up Golden Gai for drinks laterDay 14: We can see Meiji Shrine in the morning if we are up early enough We have reservations for a vegan ramen cooking class from 10:00am to 1:00pm Leave for the Haneda Airport at 1:00pm Wrap up remaining gifts/shopping at airport before we leave",

      "content_preview": "Me and my family (4 people- mom dad me little brother ~11) are planning a trip to Japan in October. After alot of discussions on the itinerary we decided on this, and still have alot of questions- Is it doable? Is it convenient? Is it hassle free and is genuinely interesting without overdoing it? And alot more Please provide some tips and answer to some more questions from the given itinerary, it will be of great help 🙏🏻Day 1- We would reach hotel (in Shinjuku) by 12pm -- Next I can't decide if I should go to main Shinjuku area (Tokyo metropolitan building etc.) or to go to Asakusa (sensoji, nakamise, sumida river)? Asakusa is slightly better imo in terms of first experience, but requires roughly 50min of travel one way, where as Shinjuku doesn'tDay 2- Morning- teamLabs planets, then Kiyosumi gardens, then akihabara-- if Shinjuku not done on day 1, it can be done here, not sure if asakusa can/should be done hereDay 3- Full day disneysea Day 4- morning- Ueno park + zoo, then Yanaka ginza, and finally ginza for shopping Day 5- mt fuji day tour Day 6- Meiji Jingu then Yoyogi park, then Shibuya parco (short time, 1hr or so) Evening- hachiko statue (snacks nearby), Shibuya sky, Shibuya crossing Mega donki-- what do u think of this order days itinerary order? Is it valid?Day 7- Hakone day trip- -- Don't know if I should take romance car or the train included in the freepass Hakone open air museum Tozan railway -> Gora Ropeway to Togendai Pirate ship cruise Motohakone -> Hakone shrine --Return using ___ train? -- Wanted to include an onsen bath here, but I think time doesn't allow (or does it?), I wanted to skip Togendai because it's not of any interest to us, but i didn't know the alternate route to reach the aishi cruise so i just stuck with this",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I’m planning a trip with family (all adults) to Hokkaido in October this year to view the autumn foliage. I’ll be renting a car and have drafted a preliminary itinerary. Please let me know if it’s feasible/any suggestions on best places to view autumn leaves. Thank you!18th Oct:Arrive in New Chitose airport around 2pm.Collect rental car from airport and drive to Jozankei Onsen area. Side note: is renting a car directly from the airport advisable? Or should we travel to Sapporo city first to collect the car so it would be cheaper?19th Oct:Travel around Jozankei Onsen area - view autumn leaves from Futamitsuri Bridge. Other places of interest: Kappabuchi Pool, Akaiwa-no-Kan streamTravel to Mt Hakkenzan20th Oct:Drive to Lake shikotsuDrive to Mt TarumaeDrive to Noboribetsu, visit Hell’s valley. Side note: I’m not exactly sure if I want to visit Noboribetsu as I’ve been there before in the winter. I didn’t find it particularly beautiful/interesting but I’m not sure about autumn. However there aren’t any major towns to stay in close to lake shikotsu. Any advice/suggestions?21th Oct:Drive to FuranoVisit Farm Tomita, Panorama RoadDrive to BieiVisit Shirogane Blue Pond and Shirahige waterfallDrive to Asahikawa to stay for the night22nd Oct:Drive to Daisetsuzan Sounkyo Kurodake ropeway.Take ropeway up 3 Visit Ryusei waterfalls and Momijidaki waterfallsTravel back to Asahikawa for the night23rd Oct:Drive to OtaruTemiya Botanical gardenNeed some more suggestions for Otaru!24th Oct:Drive to SapporoReturn the carVisit Hokkaido universityNakajima park25th Oct:Travel to the airport to depart.Some other questions I have:Would it be easy to find free parking spots in hotels in Asahikawa/Noboribetsu/Otaru? Parking seems expensive in Sapporo hence I’m inclined to return the car and rely on public transport when in Sapporo.How is driving like in Hokkaido? We are not very used to driving long distance so I’m worried the drive to Furano might be tiring.Would the tourist spots be crowded during the time period I’ll be there?Thanks in advance!",
