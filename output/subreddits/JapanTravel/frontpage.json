I tried to leave evenings pretty open so we can add on as much as were feelingWe're traveling with a.. chaotic... 4 year old. He has traveled with us since he was born and we are used to big trips and lots of walking. I just wanted to include some things he may really like. The preteen plus myself and husband are going to just enjoy being in the country.  I wanted to find something Power Rangers...even if it is a shop with figurinesPreteen daughter is really into foxes but I was hesitant to look at the animal cafes d/t animal neglect and abuse. Any suggestions?If I buy the Suica card for me, husband, and preteen, will that cover my entire trip (minus shinkansen)? I was confused if I needed the kansai one once in kyoto...I know I mention taxi a lot but I am so worried about my sweet 4 year old disrespecting the culture. He is just a talkative kid and won't really understand why he all of a sudden is being shushed. Not loud or disruptive but there is always a topic to be discussed. What is etiquette on shinkansen? Do you chat with your parties or is it expected to be quiet as well?Thank you for any suggestions",

      "content_preview": "During my solo trip to Nagano, I had the chance to stay at a shukubo (temple lodging) right next to Zenkoji, one of Japan’s most historically significant Buddhist temples – and it turned out to be the highlight of my entire trip.About ZenkojiZenkoji Temple was founded in the 7th century, making it over 1,400 years old. It’s considered one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Japan, as it enshrines the first Buddhist statue ever brought into the country.Uniquely, Zenkoji is not affiliated with any specific Buddhist sect, making it open to everyone – regardless of religious background. Millions of visitors come each year to walk its sacred grounds, seek spiritual clarity, or simply experience its powerful presence.One of its most famous features is the okaidan meguri, a pitch-dark underground passage under the main hall. You walk in complete darkness, searching for a hidden key that symbolizes enlightenment. It’s surprisingly intense and symbolic. 　 Staying at a ShukuboRather than booking a hotel, I opted to stay at one of the shukubo lodgings run by the temple community. It felt like stepping into a different era.Here’s what the experience was like: •The setting: As I arrived just before sunset, the sound of temple bells echoed through the quiet streets. The air smelled faintly of incense. Everything felt calm, timeless. •The room: Tatami mats, sliding shoji doors, no television or distractions. Minimalist but deeply relaxing. •Dinner: I was served shojin ryori (traditional Buddhist vegan cuisine). No meat, no garlic or onions – but the flavors were delicate and profound. Honestly, it was one of the best meals I had in Japan. •Morning ceremony: At 5:30am, I joined the monks in their morning chanting ritual inside the main hall. The sound of sutras being chanted in unison while candlelight flickered in the background—it was one of the most moving experiences of my trip. •People: The staff (often monks or temple caretakers) were incredibly kind and welcoming. Despite my limited Japanese, they made everything easy and memorable.Final Thoughts This wasn’t just a place to sleep – it was a deeply spiritual and peaceful experience.In the middle of a fast-paced trip, this night felt like hitting pause. I walked away feeling lighter, clearer, and more grounded. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something more meaningful than just sightseeing. 　 Would you ever stay in a temple like this? Or have you tried one in another part of Japan?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all! As a way of saying thanks to everyone on this sub I'm posting a \"quick\" report on our 18 day trip. Me and my gf, both mid thirties from Italy. Hope you find it useful, feel free to ask any questions!Mon 11:arrival at Fukuoka late afternoon, quick stroll along the river and dinner at yatai, there were only a few even though it was a national holiday. Ok ramen, great grilled mentaiko!Tue 12:shinkansen to Hiroshima, train to Miyajima. Itsukushima shrine, then mt Misen then Daishoin. Train back to Hiroshima to see the atom dome, okonomiyaki dinner and train to Onomichi. Quick stroll to see Onomichi temples from outside at night.Wed 13:Shimanami Kaido to Imabari. We stopped at Kosanji and did a detour to Oyamazumi shrine, plus a quick swim. Get the electric bikes if you want to see more stuff, and use them on max! Yakiniku at Imabari near the station for dinner.Thu 14:Train to Matsuyama. Matsuyama castle via the Ninomaru (on foot) then took the ropeway down, then Dogo Onsen tour and private bath at the annex. Wanted to see the cave tunnel at Ishiteji but it closes at 16:00 so we missed it. Train to Marugame, izakaya dinner since it was late, great udon!Fri 15:we decided against getting up super early to go to Kotohira and instead went directly to Takamatsu. Visited Ritsurin without rushing, then train to Tokushima for Awa Odori. Amazing experience. We had tickets for the show at Sansan at 20.20, so much fun. Stayed at an AirBnB (only place available when we booked).Sat 16:early train to Takamatsu then Okayama. Stopped for Korakuen. Train to Himeji, managed to get a spot on the official english tour at 13. Then onwards to Osaka, after checking in we headed to Dotonbori.Sun 17:train towards Nara, stopping first at Horyuji and then Yakushiji and Toshodaiji. Check in at Nara just before seeing the sunset in the park in front of the museum. After dark we walked to the gate at Todaiji, seeing the kongorikishi lit up at night alone was great!Mon 18:Todaiji, Kasugataisha, Kofukuji for the museum (fantastic statues!) because obviously the pagoda is under renovation, then the free machiya at Naramachi Nigiwai-no-le. Around 8 pm we took the train to Kyoto, checked in, then went to see the last day of illumination at Kodaiji.Tue 19:early start at Kinkakuji, then Ryoanji. Then Arashiyami, bamboo grove and Senryuji. Then ukai cormorant fishing, awesome! Dinner at an izakaya in pontocho.Wed 20:first Toji since it was near our hotel, then Nijojo. Nishiki market afterwards. In the afternoon Kiyomizudera for the sunset, walk through Higashiyama and Gion, then kawayuka dinner.Thu 21:Toji once again since we learned of the huge flea market held on the 21st of each month. Then Nishi and Higashi Honganji. The huge gate at Higashi was open so we climbed it. Afterwards we took a train to Uji for Byodoin, then crossed the river for Ujikami shrine, and took the Keihan train to Fushimi for sake tasting. After that we got to Fushimi Inari a bit after sunset, and climbed to the top at night with way less crowds. Yakitori for dinner.Fri 22:last day in Kyoto, we were missing some of the main attractions (imperial palace gardens, Ginkakuji, Heian...) but we decided to escape the crowds and the heat and went north for the Kurama-Kibune hike. We even managed to get a spot at the nagashi somen kawadoko place! In the afternoon back to Higashiyama for Sanjusanjendo and the national museum, which closes at 20 on fridays. For our last meal in Kyoto we found a minuscule obanzai restaurant (literally just someone's kitchen).Sat 23:train back to Osaka to catch the Nankai express for Koyasan. Okunoin in the morning, fire ceremony, check in at Kongo Sanmain, and then in the afternoon we just had time for the museum before everything closed. Back to the shukubo for dinner (delicious shojin ryori!) then a night stroll at Okunoin again. We didn't do the guided tour, too expensive and with so many people it would have lost all the atmosphere.Sun 24:morning ceremony, breakfast, then Kongobuji, Tokugawa Mausoleum and the other sights. Took the train back to Osaka in the early afternoon since we had an helicopter ride booked to see the Daisenryo Kofun (mindblowing!). Then shinkansen to Tokyo. After check in, we managed to see Sensoji lit up.Mon 25:day trip to Nikko. Rinnoji, Toshogu, Futarasan, Taiyuin and Kanmangafuchi Abyss. Simply amazing. Quick outing at Shibuya to see the scramble when we got back to Tokyo.Tue 26:train to Yamanashi for wine tasting at Katsunuma Winery. Then back to Otsu to take the train for mt Fuji, and the Fujiyoshida fire festival. One of the most amazing experiences in the whole trip.Wed 27:from Fuji directly to Kamakura. Kotokuin, Hasedera, and Tsurugaoka. We could have done more temples but we decided to take it easy and managed to go to the beach for a bit. Back to Tokyo for the night.Thu 28:Sumo exhibition tour at Tachikawa. So much fun, 6 hours went by so fast! In the afternoon Meiji Jingu, a bit of shopping at Shibuya, then managed to see the fireworks at Ota City.Fri 29:last day in Japan, breakfast at Tsukiji market, then the national museum. Flight back home in the late afternoon.All in all... fantastic trip! First time in Japan for both of us. Spent around 3500€-4000€ each including flights and everything.Notes: the heat in august is no joke. Be sure to keep hydrated... pocari sweat FTW! Also, we used waaay more cash than we expected. Everywhere we read online said card was accepted 99% of the time... well not really. Luckily withdrawing in yen at the 7/11 ATM was easy and cheap (commissions-wise).Thanks for reading!",

      "content_preview": "my boyfriend and I just spent two weeks (12 full days of exploration, considering the travel time) in tokyo and osaka. we also did a day trip to kyoto, which was lovely. after visiting, i wanted to post about my experiences in hopes of providing some insight for those of you looking to travel to japan in the future! at the end of the post, i’ll include a day-to-day itinerary of our adventures. we did minimal planning, just general cultural research in preparation.we stayed at the hotel metropolitan edmont in iidabashi in tokyo. this hotel was downright lovely. it was affordable, but so nice. iidabashi is a super quiet neighborhood, so if you’re looking to be in the middle of the action, i don’t recommend, but it suited us well. lots of eateries and train stations close by. we were more central in osaka, at the luxcare hotel in tenmabashi. definitely a different vibe from our tokyo hotel, but still good. the location was super convenient overall.we took the metro absolutely everywhere. for context, i lived in nyc and have used the metro in various american and european cities, so i felt very confident navigating. the tokyo metro was a breeze imo. super intuitive and easy to use. a suica card is a MUST! it will get you everywhere you need to go - don’t even consider paying for another pass, IC covers it all. the osaka metro was a bit more confusing for us. i think it came down to signage and odd station layouts, but we always figured it out in the end.it was obviously super hot, as our visit was mid-late august. i do not recommend visiting this time of year, i’ll be honest. we made do - we’re from north carolina so the weather just felt like home, but we spent many afternoon hours in our hotel room and found ourselves ducking into stores to find a respite from the heat. an umbrella, fan, and lots of water are non-negotiables. if you do visit in the summer, rely on museums and other indoor activities to save yourself from the relentless sun, take afternoon siestas, and go out at night.we did do a day trip in kyoto, and if i were to change one thing, it would be the amount of nights we stayed in osaka. don’t get me wrong, it was a super interesting and much more diverse city (from what i saw) than tokyo, but 7 nights weren’t necessary. i maybe would have opted for 5 and done a couple nights in kyoto. as you’ll see in the itinerary below, we did all the main tourist spots. this was our first visit and they felt obligatory. the next time we visit, we’ll hit smaller, more niche spots. to our credit, we ate at lots of holes in the wall. don’t shy away from eating at local spots!!! ofc keep an eye out for those rare hostile “tourists unwelcome” signs, but in my experience, people are friendly and most restaurants have qr code or tablet ordering.there was definitely awkwardness and minor faux pas along the way, especially in restaurant settings - i feel like that’s to be expected. we occasionally leaned on google translate but overall we were able to communicate without issue, regardless of language barriers. an example of faux pas on our parts: we often like to grab a snack between meals and share something, especially when it’s a new food item we’ve never tried before. we didn’t realize until the end of our trip that it’s considered rude to order one plate for two people. we were corrected by staff and urged to order a second item, and did so without issue. we just didn’t realize this was a thing!a final note on osaka: sooo many more gaijin/tourists than tokyo. i was not expecting this! europeans were around every corner. i also found myself getting lots of more stares in osaka. i didn’t once notice anyone staring at me in tokyo, but almost from the get-go, i clocked it in osaka. i don’t care to read into why they were staring or what the social context is, i just observed this as a difference between the two cities.general tips: get international phone service for the month of your visit or an esim - it’s a lifesaver. don’t get too attached to your plans and account for a rest day / a nap here and there. a suica/ic card is 100% necessary. always carry cash - you may end up using your credit card a lot, but carry it anyway. learn the basic phrases (arigatōgozaimasu, sumimasen, gomen nasai) - they will take you far. look up restaurant etiquette. be mindful of social norms and be quiet in public (there are exceptions like izakayas, but i’m talking about public transit and the average restaurant).day 1 - 7-11 and jet lag. we landed around 9 the night before, got our hotel, and tried to sleep, but made the mistake of sleeping on the plane. if you land in the evening, try to stick it out and stay away. i was a mess this day and got actually sick. a mid-afternoon bath rejuvenated me and we ventured back out in the evening for a gyoza dinner.day 2 - explored the imperial palace grounds and went to akihabara in the evening. visited the 10-story yodobashi camera and super potato. conveyor belt sushi for dinner.day 3 - shibuya - record shopping, many stores, and the hachiko statue. shinjuku - kabukicho and golden gai. we went into an empty bar on a corner with no cover charge and ¥700 drinks. the man running the place played us guitar and gave me a cigarette. indian for lunch. yakitori for dinner.day 4 - senso-ji temple and karaoke. dinner at an izakaya.day 5 - last day in tokyo. back to shinjuku. art museum, views from the government building, and a rest in chuo park. korea town and a lovely bonchon dinner. thrifting in harajuku.day 6 - fly to osaka (we probably could have taken a bus or train, but oh well, this worked for us). pizza and a shoeless smoke-friendly izakaya.day 7 - universal studios.day 8 - osaka castle (but i lowkey overheated so we didn’t stick around long). dontonbori. takoyaki and okonamiyaki for dinner. drinks and cigs by the water.day 9 - kyoto. temples, views, markets. sushi and green tea ice cream for lunch. burger king for dinner LOL.day 10 - history museum. beef bowls, unagi, and natto for lunch. shinsekai - rainy and so hot / humid i almost crashed out. sichuan noodles and a shared kebab for dinner.day 11 - private hot spring at an onsen (this ran us ¥7,200. pricier than a normal onsen, but i have tattoos and we didn’t want to be separated for the experience). yakiniku for lunch. izakaya hopping in the evening.day 12 - last day. taiwanese breakfast. kaiyukan, ferris wheel, more okonomiyaki. early night and home the next day!if you want any specifics or recommendations, feel free to ask in the comments! the post was long enough so i limited myself lol.thanks for reading :-)",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone!My friend and I are traveling to Japan from December 1–18, and it’s our first time there. What’s most important to us is getting a good first impression of Japan without rushing from place to place. We’re not so interested in hitting all the typical sightseeing spots—instead, we’d like to experience the culture through flea markets, markets, temple visits, food, bars, and museums. I’ve also taken a small Japanese course and I’m really looking forward to using the little bit I’ve learned.Do you think this itinerary is realistic? It’s important to us not to spend too much time on trains (we won’t be renting a car, just using trains). Are we too short on time in Takayama and the Kiso Valley? Or is there something else along our route that we should squeeze in, so that we only return to Tokyo a day later (say, December 15)? Also, are we spending too long in Tokyo for first-timers?TOKYO (Dec 1–5)Dec 1: Arrival, get over jetlag, explore Asakusa, visit Konbinis, Mori Tower for Tokyo skyline view, Mori and TeamLab Borderless, early nightDec 2 (Tue): Akihabara, bars in the eveningDec 3 (Wed): Morning shopping at Kappabashi Street, jazz bar at nightDec 4 (Thu): Shopping, Tokyo Photographic Art Museum, karaoke bar in the eveningDec 5 (Fri): Heiwajima Antique Fair (first day, planning to go early).

      "content_preview": "Just discovered this sub and decided to do a report on a short trip I took to Nagasaki last week. Going into it, I was mainly interested in Nagasaki for its history, from its founding as a Christian city by the Jesuits to its status as the primary gateway between the world and a closed-off Japan during the Edo period.That part was great as expected, but what I didn't expect was how gorgeous the city and nearby countryside were. The city is surrounded by mountains covered in lush green forests, which as a Tokyo resident was kind of mind-blowing.Kyushu has seen record flooding this year, and I think there was literally a typhoon passing by Kagoshima during my flight there, but miraculously we had beautiful (but very hot and humid) weather everywhere we went.I stayed atHotel H2 Nagasaki, which was perfectly fine but nothing special. Breakfast definitely not worth it. Good location close to Hamamachi and Chinatown, where all the restaurants are.Day 1 (Atomic Bomb Stuff)Arrived at Nagasaki Airport in the morning (on an Exeggutor themed plane!) and took the ~40 min bus to Nagasaki Station. Fare is 1200 yen and IC cards (Suica, etc.) are accepted.Friend arrived on a later flight, so while waiting I visited theTwenty-Six Martyrs Museum and Monument, built to commemorate a 1597 public execution of Christians by Hideyoshi. The museum is small with informative exhibits on the history of the incident and the Portuguese/Spanish mission in Japan more broadly. There was lots in English and other languages as I believe the site has been officially recognized by the Catholic Church (Popes Francis and John Paul II visited).Met up with friend at her hotel and ate lunch at nearbyEdo Bishi. Very homey place for Nagasaki Chinese food. We were literally served by two elementary school children who must have been on summer break. The signature dish of Nagasaki is champon, which is just a bunch of vegetables and seafood thrown on top of noodle soup, supposedly invented by a Chinese chef who wanted to provide poor Chinese students studying in Japan with something cheap and nutritious. I opted for its soupless variant (instead smothered in goopy sauce), calledsara udon(literally \"noodles on a plate\"; it's not actually udon noodles), which was delicious.Took the cute tram to theAtomic Bomb Museum. There aren't really any words to describe the experience or why you should go. If you're in Nagasaki for the first time, just go. It was smaller than I was expecting, took about 2 hours. After you're done it's a short stroll up to thePeace Park, where there's a memorial at the hypocenter with remnants of the original Urakami Cathedral, and further along the famous statue of the man pointing up with one hand to warn of the dangers of the bomb and sideways with the other to signify peace.Walked a bit to the rebuiltUrakami Cathedral. Not much to see, but you can peek inside for free. On display is a haunting bust of the Virgin Mary that was exposed to the bomb. It looked so symbolic that at first I thought it was an art piece.Bought some locally grown grapes atIwanaga Fruitsjust across the street before hopping on a bus toSanno Shrine(you get off at Sakamotomachi), where there is a famous torii gate standing on one leg after the other half was blown away by the blast, as well as two camphor trees which appeared totally dead after exposure to the bomb only to grow again into the giants they are today. The beautiful songKusunokiby Masaharu Fukuyama (super celebrity born in Nagasaki) is about these two trees and was featured at this year's remembrance ceremony.Back to the city center for dinner atEl Dorado Mexican Restaurant & Bar(lol). It was very good but obviously most tourists aren't going to come to Japan and eat Mexican food. I live in Tokyo, where it's relatively hard to find, so that's why I wanted to go.Day 2 (Shimabara)Rented a car withToyotaand drove out to the Shimabara Peninsula, stopping at a small bakeryPatisserie Boulangerie Packalong the way in Obama (!). Picked up a red-bean bun, nothing special but the grandma was nice. The whole drive was scenic. Stopped to get out at thisviewing pointoverlooking terraced potato fields.Arrived at Kuchinotsu for dolphin watching withMinamishimabara Dolphin Watching, booked online about a week prior. You have to check in at reception 20 minutes before departure. The group was fairly large so we split into two boats. Besides us and a group of Chinese tourists, it seemed like mostly local families with kids. Most of the ~80 minutes was spent going farther out into the sea and then back again, but we were lucky enough to see a large pod of dolphins. There must have been at least 20 all swimming together very close to the boat. Unfortunately we didn't get to spend much time with them as we had to get back to port, but it was still an incredible experience. Summer is apparently the best time to spot dolphins, though, so I wonder what the average experience is like at other times of the year.Lunch at nearbyKiyoka. This felt like a hidden gem and was probably my favorite meal of the trip. Unassuming building but we strolled in without a reservation and were shown to a private tatami room. Felt very traditional, the waitresses even do the thing where they kneel before opening the sliding door, and the menu consisted of those set meals where there's like a sampling of twenty different things. I got the \"Ladies' Set\" (around 2000 yen and you don't have to be a lady lol) which had nigiri (tuna, shrimp, egg), sashimi (octopus, salmon, hamo, etc.), dengaku (my favorite), and more.Visit to theArima Christian Heritage Museum, a modest local place exhibiting the history of Christianity in Japan in connection with the local warlord Arima Harunobu, one of the daimyo converts, and Hara Castle, the site of a bloody 1637 rebellion where many of the rebels were Christians. I don't remember there being any English. They were selling products from local businesses, and we got some neat biscuits supposedly made according to a traditional recipe from Santa Maria Island in the Azores that the Portuguese missionaries brought over.Drove over to theHara Castle Ruinsbut it seemed like there wasn't much to see and it was sweltering, so decided to just head back to Nagasaki. Stopped in Obama again, this time for delicious sorbet atR cinq famille.Casual dinner atAsa made Udon. Nothing special but we got to try Gotо̄ udon (hailing from the nearby Gotо̄ Islands), which is much thinner than your typical Sanuki udon.Day 3 (Random City Stuff)Ate breakfast atCafe Hirai, an atmospheric little cafe serving hot sandwiches. I think I had the egg sandwich with a banana soy milk drink, both of which were good. One of the few non-fast food joints open early.Spent a couple hours inDejima, the artificial island where all the Dutch traders were sequestered during the Edo period. It's now a sort of historical park with recreated buildings and plenty of informative exhibits. We did an hour-long guided tour (free). The guide was clearly pretty new and wasn't the best public speaker, but he was doing his best so I didn't mind. As a history nerd I could've easily spent more time there, but my friend had a work thing so before splitting up we grabbed Chinese for lunch atRed Lanterninside the Dejima Wharf building. They of course had champon but I opted for congee, which was not bad.On my own, I headed toО̄ura Cathedral, one of the first churches built as Japan was opening up to the West and the oldest one still standing. There's not much to do inside the actual building but admire the architecture and listen to the spiel playing on the speakers (in Japanese). Most of your time will be spent in the adjacent museum introducing the history of Christianity in Japan. Of the three Christianity-related museums I visited, this one had the most noticeable Christian bent, whereas the other two had more of a neutral historical perspective.Walked around the nearbyGlover Garden, where you can tour the historic homes of prominent foreigners from the late 1800s. To be honest I thought this along with the О̄ura Cathedral were skippable unless you have a particular interest in either, though admittedly I didn't go through the garden too thoroughly as it was very hot.Cooled off in my hotel before heading toward Mt. Inasa for the night view, eating dinner along the way atBibi Sushi, a revolving sushi place attached to a soccer stadium. Just walked in and it was pretty empty, but I assume that's because everyone was busy watching the game. Their specialties are local fish and fresh tuna that's never been frozen. You can never go wrong ordering the daily recommendations, which included fish I'd never seen before in Tokyo likeisaki. They traditionally prefer white fish in Nagasaki, apparently. Everything was delicious, better than most revolving sushi places I've tried in Tokyo. I was alone and ate around 4000 yen worth, so the price is a step up from your Kura Sushi or Sushiro but so is the quality.Walked over to the cable car station and rode it to theMt. Inasa Overlook. Honestly if I went again I'd just take a bus up to the top. It wasn't crowded when I went (around 7 p.m.) but I still had to wait a bit, only to be crammed into a small cable car with no air conditioning. Yes, the view is nice, but you're going to see the view at the top regardless. On my way down the line was enormous, which would definitely not be worth it. The view from the mountain is nice, though. Unfortunately there were bright lights on top of the viewing deck so you can't see many stars.Day 4 (Sasebo)Took an early bus to the airport and from there rented a car withNippon Rent-A-Car. I reserved online, so just had to go up to the rental car counter in the arrivals area and let them know I was there, then they sent someone to pick us up, as the actual rental shop is across the bridge.Drove up to Kujukushima (literally \"99 islands\") near Sasebo, which is part of the Saikai National Park. There we got on acruiseto tour the scenic coastline. There were many options, the most basic of which was a large ship like the \"pirate\" ship at Hakone, but we chose the smaller boat which fits around 15 people. Didn't make a reservation as you have to do that by the previous afternoon but there was space, probably because it was a weekday. The guide explains things you see along the way, and the boat can enter small inlets that the large one can't, where we saw tiny jellyfish swimming around. According to our guide, sometimes there's even boar and deer swimming from island to island.Friend had an earlier flight so I dropped her off at theSaihi bus terminalnext to Sasebo Station, from which a bus bound directly for the airport departs, then tried a Sasebo burger, the local specialty owing to American influence from the naval base there, atC&B Burgers. I'm not a huge burger person but it was worth a try.Headed back to Kujukushima and visited theaquarium, which you get a small discount for if you show them your cruise ticket. Though small, it stood out to me precisely because it focuses on showcasing aquatic life from the surrounding area rather than just gathering popular and impressive species. There were also lots of cute handwritten notes by the staff. The big draws are the dolphin show (which they weren't running as the dolphins needed rest), sea turtles, and many species of local jellyfish.I had a lot of time to spare (flight wasn't until 9), so I took in some breathtaking views of the island-dotted coastline and the city with naval vessels going in and out of the harbor fromTenkaihoandYumiharidake, just two of many observation decks in the area. The former was better for looking out over the islands, while the latter offered a better view of the city.Had my first pide (not a lot of Turkish food where I grew up) atKing's Kitchenbefore driving back to the airport. Owner was a funny guy. Everyone there was speaking English.Overall, I loved Nagasaki and it's definitely one of my favorite destinations in Japan now. The two primary reasons I travel are to see history and nature, and it is top quality in both regards. In the future I hope to check out Hirado, the hot springs at Unzen, and maybe if I'm feeling adventurous, the Gotо̄ Islands or Tsushima.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all,Wanted to get some feedback/suggestions on our itinerary to Japan 12/10 - 12/25. This is our first time to Japan and it will be my wife, myself and our two kids (10yo son and 8yo daughter). We just found out recently that my wife is expecting too - she will be around 19 weeks upon going and around 20 weeks by the time we are back.I have a rough itinerary but Kanazawa is a wildcard. I only saw it as an alternative suggestion to Kyoto originally when I was initially planning to go in November to see foliage. I hear it's nice in December but it may snow (and be icy and colder) and perhaps is just too much so I'm thinking maybe it's not the best idea? If we were to cut Kanazawa out, I'm guessing we should allot more time in Tokyo and maybe Kyoto?12/10 - Arrive HND around 4:30pm (catch limobus to avoid rush hour traffic - hotel likely in Shinjuku area closer to Yoyogi stations) - check into hotel, hang around Shinjuku area, grab dinner and then crash)12/11 - Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park, Harukuju, Shibuya Crossing at night + Illuminations (maybe Blue Cave?)12/12 - DisneySea (if it were Disneyland I'd skip but I hear DisneySea is pretty unique and the kids like Disney but we are not diehard fans either)12/13 - Asakusa, Sensō-ji Temple, Ueno Zoo/park(?), Sumida river walk, Tokyo Skytree (also Hello Kitty store for the daughter)12/14 - Teamlabs Planet Toyosu, Toyosu market, Odaiba (I might try to see if I can get Sushi Daiwa.... I'm not sure if my pregnant wife will like this idea though hahaha)12/15 - Shinkansen to Kanazawa - lunch or late lunch at Omicho market and Samurai District after12/16 - Kenrokuen Garden and Kanazawa Castle12/17 - Shinkansen to Kyoto (stay near Kyoto station)12/18 - Kiyomizudera and Ninenzaka (Higashiyama area and probably no Fushimari Inari - I hear it would be too grueling for a pregnant woman)12/19 - Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and Monkey Park12/20 - Nara Deer Park12/21 - Visit Uji(?) then train to Osaka (stay around Dotonbori and Namba station)12/22 - USJ (kids have been reading tons of Harry Potter lately so this may be something we can't miss)12/23 - Osaka Aquarium12/24 - Low-key day to shop, buy luggage and souvenirs/snacks/etc. Hang around Namba area. Maybe Umeda Sky?12/25 - fly out of Osaka Itami at 2:05pm (there is a connecting flight through NRT back to LAX - it's operated by ANA single ticket so it will be a connecting flight and luggage transfer handled by ANA)I just realized there were some daytrips I was considering too, like Hakone, Kamakura, Nikko or Yokohama but it seems I'm forfeiting those in favor of the Kanazawa side-trip. Not sure if any of those would be recommended for my wife (probably not Nikko if there's a lot of climbing or hiking involved) though.",

Think I kept putting it off because I was thinking I had to do it just right.. but really, I just have to do it. So here we go..I've researched other people's itineraries on here (thanks everyone for sharing), and here's what I came up with forMarch 2026. Reasons for my choices: I want to hit up the iconic spots, with more of a lean towards nature and food (duh). Hope it's feasible without being overwhelming and makes geographical sense, so please let me know. I decided to split my time in Tokyo to spread the sensory overload and mainly so I wasn't getting a train on my last day. Because of this, I'm also open to changing Hakone to being on the way back to Tokyo from Kyoto, for some R&R. But also like the appeal of using it to revive myself from potential jetlag to prepare for the meat of the trip. All feedback welcome!Tokyo - 2 nightsDay 1Arrive in the AM and staying in ShinjukuMeiji Jingu Shrine / Harajuku / Shibuya CrossingSenso-ji Temple at night / Hoppy StreetDay 2Ghibili (if poss)Omoide Yokocho Memory Lane / Golden GaiKurand Sake MarketHakone - 2 nightsDay 3 & 4Ryokan stay with nothing else planned to make most of amenities.

      "content_preview": "After reading this entire subreddit and watching (almost) every Youtube video on Japan walking tours, my wife and I spent an amazing 3 weeks in Japan in May 2025. Stop scrolling and use this itinerary for your own walking tour.Shinjuku City, Tokyo:  Beautiful city. Highlights include an early morning walk through Meiji Jingu and Yoyogi Park, in one of the most pedestrian-friendly big cities. However, this trip was focused mostly on nature walks so our stay in Tokyo was short.Hakone:  We took the Romance Car from Tokyo to Hakone and spent an amazing two nights at a historic Ryokan. Highlights include the very quiet evenings, Gora Park, the Open Air Museum, and a very early morning walk in Onshi-Hakone Park to view Mt Fuji, before taking the touristy Pirate Ship, and Ropeway (which were fabulous). For being super touristy, this place was gorgeous. We used the gender-separated public onsen, which was amazing.Nakasendo Trail:  We spent 4 days walking between post towns Nakasugawa, Magome, Tsumago, Nagiso, Kiso-Fukushima, and Narai. The forest walks and waterfalls were spectacular, but the best views were near the small villages surrounded by rice fields and the beautiful Japanese countryside. Typical morning walks were only 4-5 hours, with slow lunches, and a soak in the onsen after a quiet dinner. We packed very light for this trip and had no trouble with our 12lb day packs. The trails were very quiet, and food and drink options were plentiful with a bit of planning.Kanazawa: One of the prettiest gardens in all of Japan is Kenrokuen and we walked every part of that garden. This was a large city, and so our stay was short.Kyoto: We spent 4 days in Kyoto, and for being a large city it was incredible. A top highlight was a quiet bike ride right along the Kamo River to the botanical garden…, one of our favorite bike rides anywhere, and eating lunch at the very busy Nishiki Market. We walked through a dozen amazing gardens, parks, and shrines, and enjoyed  delicious food at many small restaurants.Kumono Kodo: We spent 5 days on a 75 km pilgrimage walk on a gorgeous forest path, walking between very old moss-covered shrines and quiet mountain streams. Reservations are organized by the Tanabe City Kumono Tourism Bureau, and you must plan many months in advance in order to choose the best locations right near the trail. If you want to be surrounded by some of the best scenery in rural Japan, start planning your trip now. All of the Japanese people (and most of the other visitors) we met along the way were friendly, happy, and kind. We took a few wrong turns, hiked in a downpour, and once had trouble finding an ATM, but enjoyed every minute of it! Thanks Reddit.",

      "content_preview": "3-Week Japan Travel Itinerary/Report (May 18 – June 6, 2025)This May/June, my girlfriend and I traveled through Japan for three weeks together with another couple. I’d love to share our itinerary and travel experiences with you. It’s a fairly factual overview, mainly intended to give a general idea of what there is to do and what is feasible in a day. I don’t review everything in detail, but we honestly enjoyed almost everything—unless I specifically mention otherwise. Feel free to ask about any specific experiences or practical tips, tho!Day 1 (Sunday, May 18)Arrival in Tokyo. Arrival around 2 PM at Narita airport.By train and Yamanote line to our apartment in Shinjuku.To Senso-ji and the Sanja Matsuri festival in Asakusa. We were lucky to be there exactly on the final day of this annual festival in Tokyo. (Every third weekend of May).Ended the evening in Kabukicho/Golden Gai (walking distance from our apartment).Day 2 (Monday, May 19)Meiji shrine + inner gardenYoyogi park (We had planned to go there on Saturday or Sunday, as it’s said to be very lively on weekends. Due to a problem with our flight, we only arrived in Tokyo on Sunday afternoon, so that didn’t work out. On Monday the park was very quiet).Harajuku (including Takeshita street)Shibuya crossingAkihabaraDay 3 (Tuesday, May 20)Kappabashi doriUeno parkUeno Toshogu shrineTokyo national museumShinobazuno pond bentenAmeyokocho marketWalk through Nezu and Yanaka (nicely quiet after a day in the crowds).Nezu ShrineDinner in Omoide YokochoDay 4 (Wednesday, May 21)Shinjuku GyoenYokohama (Minato Mirai and China Town)Football match Yokohama F. Marinos – Vissel KobeDay 5 (Thursday, May 22)Imperial palace / Kokyo gaienTsukiji fish marketGrand Sumo tournament in the Ryogoku Kokugikan. One of the highlights of the trip. Totally into sumo ever since.See my earlier comment about the experience.Tokyo Skytree. One of the few less enjoyable experiences that generally felt a bit like a tourist trap. The view was quite nice, but we were a bit late so it was already getting dark. Also, it was very crowded and we had to wait a long time to get up and especially to get back down.Day 6 (Friday, May 23)Start of a 4-day road trip through the Japanese Alps.Arakurayama Sengen Park / Chureito Pagoda. We hoped to see Fuji, but unfortunately it was hidden in the mist so not visible.Drove on to Matsumoto. Visit to Matsumoto Castle.Stay in a Ryokan hotel with onsen, traditional Kaiseki meal.Day 7 (Saturday, May 24)Hiking in the beautiful Kamikochi (Chubu Sangaku National Park)Dinner in TakayamaOvernight stay in Shirakawa-goDay 8 (Sunday, May 25)Enjoying the beautiful famous houses in Shirakawa-go and the slightly further located Gokayama.Continuation of the road trip to Kanazawa, overnight stay in KanazawaDay 9 (Monday, May 26)Traditional tea ceremonyKenroku-gardenKanazawa castleFinal part of road trip from Kanazawa to KyotoDay 10 (Tuesday, May 27)Arashiyama Bamboo grove. Quite beautiful but small and very crowded. The bamboo forest on Mt. Inari was much more impressive.Nishiki marketGion (Sannenzaka, Ninenzaka, Yasaka pagoda, Yasaka shrine).Fushimi Inari Taisha. We didn’t just stay on the main path but also took the ‘hidden trail’ and we loved it. Very beautiful bamboo forest. At the top of Mount Inari a great view over Kyoto by night.Day 11 (Tuesday, May 28)Nijo castleBy Shinkansen from Kyoto to Fukuyama and from there a local train to Onomichi. Great to enjoy an ekiben bought at the train station along the way.Day 12 (Wednesday, May 29)Shimanami Kaido! With rented road bikes from Onomichi across islands and bridges through the Seto Inland Sea to Imabari on Shikoku. Very cool for people who enjoy sporty activities like ourselves.Day 13 (Thursday, May 30)Trip from Imabari to HiroshimaPeace memorial park / Atomic dome / Peace memorial Hall + museum. Impressive..Day 14 (Friday, May 31)We flew from Hiroshima to Okinawa where we stayed for 3 nights. Unfortunately the weather was disappointing so we didn’t do much there, but we did relax.Day 17 (Tuesday, June 3)Flight from Okinawa to Osaka.Baseball match Orix Buffaloes – Hiroshima Carps.Day 18 (Wednesday, June 4)Osaka castleKuromon marketShinsekaiTsutenkaku TowerDotonbori streetDay 19 (Thursday, June 5)Osaka 2025 world expo.See my earlier review.ROR comedy club.Day 20 (Friday, June 6)Traditional Bunraku performance at the National Bunraku theatre.Return flight from Osaka back home.General experiences/impressionsAn amazing trip through a beautiful and diverse country with rich culture, history, stunning nature, buzzing modern cities, calm parks, beautiful gardens, friendly people and delicious food. Love the food markets, love the konbinis, LOVE the izakayas.Our travel pace was high and it was definitely not a ‘relax vacation’. But overall it was doable. For fit and active travelers this schedule is feasible, for people who prefer a slower pace it might be (too) intense.Hopefully this helps you in planning your own trip and feel free to ask me anything you’d like to know!",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys, been lurking in this subreddit for a while to draft out my November plans. Please tell me if it's too packed. I like overplanning to ensure I have backup plans when I run into free time or if I decide to skip places.I've been to Japan a couple times to visit family and friends. This time I focused on nature walks and my otaku driven hobbies. I tried to put them in the order I'll go through them every day, but I can easily swap days as needed if weather affects my plans.I'll be awake around 5-6 am and head to bed by 10 pm latest most days. (This is my literal sleeping schedule right now since I work nights) My main issue is finding morning activities to fill in the lull before places are open. Most morning breakfasts in Osaka will probably be Matsuya for budget or Komeda as an alternative. In Tokyo, I have Dormy Inn for breakfast and soba if I want a light dinner at night. I plan to buy quick meals in the market for days I wake up before restaurants are open (hike/day trips).Lunches and early dinners are when I'll splurge for good meals. I just pinned a bunch of spots featured in JapanEats I liked and recommendations from friends for whenever I get hungry.All places with asterisk (*) are optional pivots if I'm ahead of schedule and finish early. If you have any suggestions enroute for days lemme know.---Day 1 – Nov 4- Arrive in Osaka (KIX)- Check in at Namba Hotel- Dinner at Sushiro or YakinikuDepending on energy levels, I might knock out early. I'll land in the afternoon, but I doubt I'll get any sleep on flight. Sushiro or Yakiniku should be good for a low stress meal. I'll make a supply run to a supermarket nearby like LIFE to get some drinks and discounted bentos/onigiris for quick meals. Depends on selection.---Day 2 – Nov 5- Shop in Umeda- Hanshin Tigers Shop- Kinokuniya Umeda- MARUZEN & JUNKUDO- Mandarake Umeda- FireBomBARAfter Hanshin Tigers, I don't mind going off script if I something that catches my interest. I just wanted some places I know I'll be interested to head towards as a framework.---Day 3 – Nov 6- Kobe Day Trip- Nunobiki Falls Hike- Nunobiki Herb Garden* (Might be too early so I'll pass if so)- Kobe Beef Ramen Yazawa- Center Plaza West- Motomachi Street*- Chinatown / Guanyu Temple- Kobe Minato Onsen LotusI should be able to get on the trail by 7AM. Might wake up earlier than 5 AM today. I'll take the ropeway down if I need the break, but I don't mind the exercise. I fully expect to be here all day and end in the onsen around 9 PM---Day 4 – Nov 7- Kizu Market- Sennichimae Doguyasuji/Kuromon Market* (If DenDenTown not open yet)- Den Den Town- Amerikamura- CAOFF DISCOVERY- Dotonbori*I haven't been to Kizu Market so I decided to check it out. If anyone has any suggestions for stuff to do before Noon in the area, let me know. Considered going to Tsuruhashi instead of Amerikamura.---Day 5 – Nov 8- Minoh Falls- Ryuan-ji Temple- Katsuoji Temple*- Tempura no Yama- Relaxation Salon Fortuna (Or another Spa option)- Head to Bed EarlyI had considered walking through the Takedao Abandoned Railway Trail, but I chose Minoh Falls instead since it's autumn. I plan to retire by early afternoon and try to get a spa visit appointment to decompress so I can sleep blissfully.Tomorrow will be a long day so I plan to sleep around 9 PM or so.---Day 6 – Nov 9- Shinkansen to Nagoya (Early Morning)- Nagoya Castle (Gift Shop Only)- Osu Shotengai- Nagoya Touken Museum*- Hard Off / Hobby Off Shimadaminami*- Shinkansen to Tokyo (Evening)- Check in at Dormy InnI regret setting my hotels early on in Osaka and Tokyo. Spending a night here would of been less hectic. According to the dates, some of the places I had considered won't be open on this day. I plan to arrive in Nagoya early in the morning on the first train or so and be in Dormy Inn around 8-9 PM.---Day 7 – Nov 10- Akihabara- Nakano Broadway- Find Dinner in Nakano AreaDidn't plan to fill this up too much. I've been here many times already, so I'll probably finish early and look for stuff to do after browsing Nakano Broadway. Might revisit a maid cafe. Any suggestions for places to go around Nakano Area to eat?---Day 8 – Nov 11Mt. Takao & Hachioji- Mt. Takao hike (Trail 6 up / Trail 1 down)- Keio Takaosan Onsen Gokurakuyu- Lunch here or wait until DAPS*- ECO Town (Hard Off Megastore)- DAPS Famous Hood Joint- Inokashira ParkWonder if I'll get any good autumn leaves on this day. ECO Town and DAPS is the main reason I wanted to come to this area. If it rains I'll do something else in Kichijoji or swap to another day's plans.---Day 9 – Nov 12- Head to Saitama- Visit Friends- Omiya Bonsai Village- Railway Museum*I like bonsai. Might go trainspotting.---Day 10 – Nov 13- Yokohama Day Trip- Shonan Monorail (Flexible)- Amimoto Izu Sushi- Yokohama Chinatown (Guanyu Temple here too?)- Yamashita Park*- Red Brick Warehouse*Saw a good spot to film the Monorail passing you from below on youtube and wanted to check it out. Post Chinatown is mostly filler.---Day 11 – Nov 14- Okachimachi Niconico Theater (Guaranteed event on Fridays)There's an idol event here every Friday so unless I find another one available, I'll probably go here.---Day 12 – Nov 15- Design Festa Vol 62- Odaiba Statue of Liberty- Unicorn Gundam Statue- Dinner in Odaiba* (Or just head back if too crowded)Not sure how crowded Design Festa will get this year, but it'll be nice to find something cool here. Good excuse to check out Odaiba more if I decide to leave early.---Day 13 – Nov 16- Hatonosu Gorge- Moegi-no-Yu Onsen- Gallery Poppo*- Lunch at Gorge or DAPS food joint- Tori no Ichi Festival (Shinjuku)Hatonosu Gorge was originally an alternative plan I thought of if I didn't want to head to Mt Takao. This was originally a free day, so I can easily change this to something else if I get updates on more events.---Day 14 – Nov 17- Miyashita Park- Shibuya PARCO- Shibuya MODI- glamb (Harajuku)- Tokyu Food Show (Souvenirs)- Bar Ginza Panorama Shibuya (Revisit)Souvenir Day. Getting omiyage for friends and family. If you're into trains and train models, Panorama Bar is worth checking out. The owner and regulars there are pretty welcoming.---Day 15 – Nov 18- Check in Hamamatsucho Hotel (Leave bags early morning check in later)- Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building- ARTNIA (Square Enix Cafe)*- Shinjuku Marui Annex- Tower Records Shinjuku- KabukichoFudged my hotel/flight dates. Decided on a hotel closer to the Tokyo Monorail to make the best of it. Since it's the last day, I'll probably stay out late. I always wanted to do a night walk in Kabukicho to compare the landscape to Kamurocho (Yakuza Series).---Day 16 – Nov 19- Ginza Steak in Ebisu for last meal- Return to hotel → collect bags- Depart for HND- Duty-free shopping- Board FlightThe flight is in the evening, but I might head to HND early afternoon for ease of mind. I haven't explored the airport so that would give me something to do.",

      "content_preview": "Hello I have worked together an itinerary for my first trip to Japan. I want to ensure I am not slamming to much into the trip. I have interests in history and cultural sites mostly with some interest in the anime/manga stops for a bit. I utilized the Lonely Planet Japan guide book to get most of my ideas together and some online searching.I land in Tokyo and Depart from Tokyo, these days are set (Arrive October 30th and Depart November 14th), I am going solo so the trip does not take another person into account. I have some questions about my schedule below but any other advice or thoughts would be helpful before I begin to book rooms.I don't know if I have too little decided for Day 1? I feel like I may be tired from the flight so it might be best to take it slow. Was planning to stay the night in the area so I could get started early.Day 2 also feels light but Osaka seems like a more \"go with the flow\" style so I kept it more open since searching for specifics didn't really give me anything I was driven for.Wasn't sure if i should try to go to Himije Castle on my way to Hiroshima, or on the way to Kyoto or at all? (See Day 4 & 5)Day 6 and Day 7 I wasn't sure if I was packing too much into them based on distances?I wasn't sure on the Hakone trip, I thought it would be nice for a rest, do what I can and not too much? (See Day 10 & 11)Are my last days in Tokyo doable or is it too crammed? I figured I would leave some blank space so if I decide I want to do something else or just rest.Day 0 - October 30th (Thurday)Land at Haneda ~3PMLocate HotelStaying in Tokyo (Harajuku/Aoyama Area?)Dinner NearbyDay 1 - October 31st (Fri)Yoyogi Park & Meiji Shrine (Morning)Shibuya (Midday)Tokyo Sky Tree (Evening?)Day 2 - November 1st (Saturday)Shinkansen From Tokyo to Osaka (Morning) [2.5 hours]Umeda Sky ObservatoryShinsekaiRest Day?Day 3 - November 2nd (Sunday)OsakaShitennoji TempleNamba Yasaka JinjaNipponbashi Den-Den TownCup Noodles MuseumDay 4 - November 3rd (Monday)Shinkansen From Osaka to Hiroshima (Morning)Shukkeien GardenAtomic Bomb DomePeace Memorial ParkFerry to MiyajimaNight in MiyajimaDay 5 - November 4th (Tuesday)MiyajimaItsukushimaMount Misen Cable CarHokuuku-JinjaFerry to HiroshimaShinkansen from Hiroshima to KyotoDay 6 - November 5th (Wednesday) KyotoFushimi Inari Shrine (Early AM - Plan to Hike)Daigoji TempleKinkaku-ji?(Too Much?)Day 7 - November 6th (Thursday)Kyoto > NaraTodai-jiIsuien GardenKasuga-TaishaDeer ParkWander NaramachiNara > KyotoDay 8 - November 7th (Friday) KyotoArashiyama Bamboo Forest (Early Start)Okochi Sanso GardenIwatayama Monkey ParkKiyamachi StreetDay 9 - November 8th (Saturday) KyotoKiyomizudera TempleHigashiyama DistrictNanzenji TempleGinkakujjiDay 10 - November 9th (Sunday)Shinkansen from Kyoto to Odawara (2.5 Hours) (AM)Hakone Tozen Line from Odawara to Hakone Yumoto (Morning)Hakone Venetian Glass MuseumHakone Open Air MuseumHakone ShrineHakone Stay in RyokanDay 11 - November 10th (Monday)Look out from Lake AshinokoHakone to Tokyo (Romancecar?)Hotel Stay in Asakusa?ShinjukuShinjuku GyoenVisit IkebukuroDay 12 - November 11th (Tuesday) TokyoKamarkua areaShrine HoppingJochi-jiKuzuharaoka-jinjaZeniarai-bentenSasuke-inari-jinjaKotoku-inVisit Yuigahama Beach before heading back to the hotel?Day 13 - November 12th (Wednesday)Asakusa, Ueno, AkihabaraKaminarimon GateSensoji TempleUeno ParkTokyo National MuseumShop Around AkihabaraDay 14 - November 13th (Thursday)OdaibaUnicorn GundamLast Minute ShoppingWhatever else/RelaxDay 15 - November 14th (Friday)Departure from Tokyo",

      "content_preview": "Hi all,My husband, mom and I just got back from an extremely hot 2 ½ week trip, and I thought I’d share. My husband and I are experienced Japan travelers specifically, having visited 44 and 45 prefectures respectively, but this trip sticks to sights mainly on the western part of the golden route due to my mom, who really wanted to see Kyoto (she visited Tokyo enough for her taste when my husband and I lived there). We tend to focus on historical sights and museums, local food (and beloved chains), and shopping for local mascot characters. Having done most of the classic sights in this region, we deprioritized a lot of them.It’s entirely possible to do more stuff than we did in a day, but it was between 90 and 100 degrees F almost every day with high humidity, and my mom had a bad reaction to a knee treatment right before leaving, limiting her mobility for a while. And then we all got sick. It was a great trip, but definitely not a packed itinerary.This did get long because I have a lot to say in the hopes that someone might find it useful, so I ended up splitting it into two parts. The Matsuyama and Kyoto parts will come in the second post, once I get around to fleshing out my outline.A few logistics notes:We all have physical suicas picked up from previous trips.All transit except the boat to Matsuyama, the buses in Asuka and the airport bus were paid for with suica.The only prebooked train was the shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima, using SmartEx.My husband and I speak Japanese, my mother does not.Thursday 7/10 - OsakaWe landed in KIX directly from the US, rather than having to fly to Tokyo first and transfer. We got through customs procedures in about 40 minutes, largely because I picked the slowest moving line. Then we hopped on the train and made our way to the Red Roof in Namba. Normally we don’t pick western chains when in Japan, but I guess we got a deal. Definitely a Japanese business hotel with western branding, though.Generally on our first night we buy toothpaste, but the nearest convenience store had been raided, so we spent way too long wandering around Namba trying to find one that was less picked over. And then trying to find sweat-proof sunscreen. Eventually, we accomplished our missions and collapsed.Friday 7/11 - OsakaWe slept in out of respect for jet lag and ate convenience store bread for breakfast (true most days). My mom meanwhile decided to test herself and got a breakfast sandwich at the hotel next door. Once we were all combobulated, we decided for an “easy” day at Osaka castle. This ended up being hubris.We last went to Osaka castle in 2016, as part of a two castle day with Nagoya back in the halcyon days of the JR pass being a good deal. At the time, I assumed my feet hurt so much afterward because… well, we did two castles in two cities on one day. I forgot that Osaka castle’s park is huge, and they added shuttle “buses” to get around the park for a reason. We hit 10,000 steps before lunch.We opted not to buy tickets in advance, which meant waiting in line for the ticket machines for maybe 10 minutes. The line was covered, which is an innovation I wish they’d implement at Niagara Falls, but that’s a rant for another subreddit. The castle ticket includes admission to the small, recently opened castle wall museum, which we hadn’t been to before. Where the castle itself was slammed with people and it could be hard to get to some of the exhibits, the castle wall museum was quiet and cool. There’s not much there, but if you want a break from the crowds and the heat, it’s right there. It’s also got great english.From there we decided to get lunch at the Osaka Gourmet Expo, which was on the grounds of the park, but actually pretty far from the castle. We ended up walking the full circumference to get back to the Osaka History museum, so in hindsight I might have chosen to have lunch closer to the history museum if only to spare my mom some walking. The Gourmet Expo itself is a collection of stalls that you order from via QR code. The food was good (okonomiyaki for me and my mom, beef bowl for my husband), but I don’t like QR code ordering. If you don’t speak Japanese, it’s probably more convenient, though.After that was the Osaka History museum, which doesn’t seem to have changed since 2016. Plentiful english, and my mom enjoyed the intro to Osaka’s history. But the heat had drained us pretty badly at this point, so after navigating the dungeons of Namba station to find the 551 Horai (steamed buns), we retired to the hotel to rest until dinner. My mom ended up staying in for the rest of the night for her knee. My husband and I got different regional katsu bowls at nearby Miyamoto Munashi, and then popped over to Den Den Town for a little shopping. This was interrupted by sudden, heavy rain, and I dipped after two stores. My number one Japan tip: always carry a collapsable umbrella.Saturday 7/12 - AsukaMy husband has been wanting to visit Asuka over in Nara prefecture for years because he’s a fan of kofuns - japanese burial mounds. He thought he had it figured out perfectly. We would walk less and take buses everywhere, because the buses are more frequent on Saturdays. This is true… in April and May. For those two months, they run extra buses on Saturdays. Otherwise, they’re once an hour. So we bought a day pass for the buses, but I’m not sure we ended up breaking even in the end.In Asuka, we visited the Asuka History Museum first. It was light on English, but introduced a lot of the interesting artifacts from the area and the historical sites. We ended up getting lunch at a plant based food spot outside of the Asuka Museum of Manyo Culture, which was better than expected but small. They also ran out of food after we ordered so clearly if you need plant based food in Asuka go here early. The museum itself was pretty immersive with good english explanations, I would recommend it! The focus is on song and poetry, and even if you can’t understand the songs, you can definitely feel them.After this we hopped on the bus to the Takamatsuzuka tumulus park, and specifically the mural museum within the park. Genuinely very cool, both in terms of vibes and temperature. The tomb found here had colorful murals inside, which is pretty uncommon in tombs from this period.We could have walked around the park more, and I guess the thing to do is actually to bike it, but heat and pain were winning, so we took the bus back to the station, and trained back to Osaka. We had to make a poorly indicated train transfer (if you don’t speak Japanese), but luckily it was cross platform and I was paying attention, so we made it.My mom wanted okonomiyaki for dinner, so I found Fukutarou in Namba station, and remembered it being recommended somewhere. Possibly here? There was a short wait, and they were clearly prepared to try and do everything through gestures up until I revealed that I speak Japanese. My mom tried the negiyaki and liked it, but my husband found the okonomiyaki under-sauced and with not enough ginger. As with everything, ymmv, I liked it.After dinner, we took a break until dark, and took a walk through Dotonbori. I’ve always avoided it because I’m not one for crowds and nightlife, but it was worth doing once, at least as a fan of the yakuza games. It’s totally possible to take a walk down the canal without being sardined, once you get past the lines for the boat rides anyway.Sunday 7/13 - OsakaWe started the day with a pretty niche set of shrine and temple visits: one in honor of Sanada Yukimura, and the other on the former site of the Sanadamaru. Almost no english, really only interesting if you’re into this particular sengoku period warlord. Or if you want to see the alleged tunnel to Osaka castle.The next stop was the Museum of Housing and Living, which my husband and I had done before, but thought my mom would be interested in. She loved it, so, win. If coming by subway, the museum is easy to find and well signed from within the tunnels. We came by JR years ago, had to find it on the street, and ended up having to ask for directions. So take the subway. One thing about this museum, the permanent exhibition after the model town relies on QR codes for their multilingual information, which I feel really slows down the flow of visiting a museum.Now, the big mistake of this day. We forgot about the expo. Specifically, that it was Sunday, and many people might choose to take the Chuo Line to the expo on their day off. But we bought advance tickets to Kaiyukan for my mom, and we had a 1 pm slot. So we crammed ourselves onto the Chuo line and assured ourselves that the mall at Tempozan was still a great place to get lunch.We ended up getting takeout from a katsu restaurant in the mall, eating them in a back corner of the old Osaka nostalgia alley. And it was honestly really good! But the place was a zoo, and we should have known better. The true pain was getting out, though. I think it took us four trains before one came out of Yumeshima with enough space for us to get on, which was another lesson learned. Expo traffic does exist, mainly on the Chuo line, especially near the western end, mainly on weekends. Plan accordingly.My mom really enjoyed Kaiyukan, she got a go pro basically for this purpose. But it's gotten kind of expensive and they surge price, so I don't suggest just showing up without planning.Once free of the Chuo line, we checked out the pokemon center in Shinsaibashi and my mom bought luggage (we were all carry on only to this point). We walked back to Namba by way of 551 Horai, Pablo cheese tarts, and my favorite stamina-meshi chain, Sutadonya. Despite being in Dotonbori, at 5 pm, it was easy to get a seat. If you like garlic, this is the place to totally ruin your ability to detect low levels of it.We got an early night, anticipating an early train to Hiroshima.Monday 7/14- Osaka to HiroshimaIn hindsight, we would not have booked shinkansen tickets that required us to take the Midosuji line during rush hour with all of our stuff. It was probably the one time having our luggage on the train felt like a significant inconvenience. Also, apparently this line doesn’t always go all the way to Shin-Osaka during this time, so plan accordingly.After a painless shinkansen to Hiroshima, we dropped our bags at the Universal Hotel Hiroshima, which was definitely an older business hotel than I expected. Last renovation probably in the 80s, but it had free breakfast and free dinner (we opted for just the breakfast). We got lunch at an udon place in the station, before taking the tram to the peace park.It rained all day. This lowered the temperature somewhat, but we had to detour to buy my mom an umbrella. The gift shop at the Orizuru tower sold some, so you’re never far from somewhere to buy one. It would have been nice to take more time to explore the park, but the weather didn’t encourage us to linger. We sought shelter in the Atomic Bomb Memorial Museum, along with every other tourist in Hiroshima, it felt like. I don’t know what they can do to improve crowd control other than decrease the number of tickets sold, but I think they need to do it. Several sections are very narrow with a lot of text to read, and everyone wants to stop to read, of course they do! But it felt very crowded, and I’m convinced this is where we got sick. It’s an important museum, and I understand why they don’t want to limit visitors, but the crowding really doesn’t encourage you to take your time and absorb everything.There are a couple of other small museums in the park, like one about the G7 summit held in Hiroshima, and a preserved section of ruins. There’s also a memorial for those who died in the bombing, with a lot of personal stories from survivors. It’s heavy stuff, which is probably why our next stop was the Hiroshima pokemon center for a palate cleanser. This is probably the pokemon center with the greatest number of unique regional pikachus, so it’s more worth visiting than some of the others. One of those Pikachus is definitely a Carp fan, lmao.We got dinner at a restaurant in the station that specialized in local Hiroshima cuisine.Tuesday  7/15 - HiroshimaWe started Tuesday by hopping on the Maple Loop bus, which I think Kyoto should consider stealing. A bus that loops between the major tourist spots, with multiple languages and sight-seeing specific info? Great way to get tourists off the regular buses.Anyway, we took it to Hiroshima castle, which is similar to Osaka castle in that it’s a reconstruction with a history museum inside. Worth visiting, if only to see some of the trees on the grounds, which not only survived the atomic bombing, but went on to thrive. I found that surprisingly meaningful.We got an early lunch at an Onomichi ramen place that was 1. Really cheap 2. Really good 3. Had absolutely massive karaage. Great deal, no notes.After that we made our way to Shukkeien, taking our time strolling through the garden. We saw crabs! Once my mom started to tire, we opted to head back to the hotel to rest, as we had tickets to a Carp game that night.One of the coolest things for me about the Carp game was the walk to the stadium, which has a ton of carp themed manhole covers and businesses that change their normal brand colors. There's a red Lawson, a red Toyoko Inn, etc. And the merchandise is everywhere. I think my mom bought multiple Carp shirts by the end of our time in Hiroshima, and I bought one for myself. The atmosphere at the game was really cool too, for all that it was a weekday night. The stands ended up filling quite a bit, even though the game ended up being a 0-1 loss. No one gave up until the very end, and I didn't see the kind of leaving early to catch the train that I saw in Tokyo or Osaka.Wednesday 7/16 - IwakuniWe spent a very hot day in Iwakuni, taking in the sights on the far side of the Kintaikyo bridge, which is a sight in itself. The castle is another reconstruction, but the view is gorgeous, and it was much cooler up there than it was on ground level. There are a couple of interesting little museums in the area, like the White Snake museum, and an art museum. Tickets to these museums are discounted when you buy the joint ticket at the bridge, which covers crossing the bridge, the ropeway, and the castle.We retired early because it was hot and my mom wasn’t feeling well, a theme of the trip. After a brief rest, my husband and I ventured to the station for Hiroshima-yaki and extensive station mall shopping. There is so much carp merchandise in Hiroshima, you guys. I feel lied to that I haven’t seen anyone mention this before.Thursday 7/17 - Hiroshima to MiyajimaThis was our hotel transfer to Miyajima day. Our ryokan (Hotel Grand Miyajima Arimoto) sent us an english email that morning asking for any allergies and letting us know that we needed to arrive no later than 6 pm if we wanted dinner. We wanted dinner. So we kept the morning light, going to the Craft History Museum (light on english but very visual), super donki, hama sushi, and for a bit of karaoke before hopping on the JR ferry to Miyajimaguchi. It was drizzling when we arrived on Miyajima, and it basically rained the whole time we were on the island. But it was still beautiful. I don’t think I expected to like Miyajima as much as I did. It really isn’t overhyped.Our ryokan was a short walk from Itsukushima Shrine, with the tide times displayed on a chart next to the elevators. They also offered evening and morning tours of the area, Japanese language only. We tried the night tour, and even I barely understood anything, on top of the rain switching to pouring. But my husband braved the beach at night to get low tide shots of the gate. Our room was very nice, and dinner was also amazing. I love you ryokan sukiyaki. Never change.This ryokan has a lot of staff who speak english, but someone clearly clocked that we didn’t need that level of support, because the hostess they assigned to our meal services confessed to speaking very little, and I ended up doing a lot of interpreting for her and my mom so that they could communicate somewhat naturally. It’s clear the hotels on Miyajima expect a lot of foreign visitors, but it’s also clear that having some language ability is really appreciated.The one weakness of this ryokan was the onsen. There was one bigger bathing room, and one smaller one, which rotated between men and women in the morning. Neither had a view to speak of, and the set up was fairly basic. But they allowed covered tattoos in the public onsen so that’s a win, as my mom has several.Friday 7/18 - Miyajima to MatsuyamaAfter ryokan breakfast, my mom and husband decided to take morning onsen dips while I jogged over to Itsukushima to catch the gate at low tide. Because it was on the early side for ferries to come in, there weren’t that many people there, and I was able to take as many pictures as I wanted (there are more pictures of this on my phone than of the rest of the trip hahaha). A Japanese woman even offered to take my picture with the gate. It’s absolutely massive in person, and I’m glad I did it. Plus at low tide you can see all of the little crabs on the beach. Even after the tide came in a bit, we still saw people wading out to get a picture with the gate, so I’m glad I went when I did.We checked out of the ryokan but left our stuff, and started the morning officially with a walk over to Daishoin. We actually learned about this temple from Zatsu Tabi! It has a couple of unique features. The stairs leading up to the temple have spinning sutras by the hand rail, with the idea being that you spin them as you walk up and it “counts” as saying them. There’s also a sort of cave in the back with altars representing all of the temples from the Henro pilgrimage, so that you can essentially speedrun the Henro. As someone who’s been to a lot of temples, these things were both new to me.After that, we went into Itsukushima proper. (We waited a little because I’d seen a large school group go in during my dash to the gate.) it was still basically low tide, so all of the structures were visible. I feel like wood rot must be a huge upkeep issue with this shrine. But it’s very beautiful, and the crowds were manageable, especially since we weren’t there to worship.After that we walked along the shopping street. The deep fried momiji manju were great, they taste a bit like funnel cake. Lunch was eel, one of the local specialties. We’re not a fan of oysters so figured we might as well do the other one. We bought a lot of souvenirs, and I got my Sugi Bee member’s card stamped at the Miyajima branch. And a deer tried to steal my second deep fried momiji manju. Lesson learned, don’t take them out of the shopping street.With shopping complete, we got our bags, shuttled back to the port, and took two boats to get to Matsuyama, our next destination.And that's it for part 1. See you in part 2!",

the most questions and could really use your input! We definitely want to see Mount Fuji, but we know the weather can be unpredictable. To stay flexible, we booked accommodation with a good cancellation policy so we can check the forecast a week before and decide whether to go or not.That said, we’re on the fence about renting a car. We’re fairly experienced drivers (we drive almost every day), but we’ve never driven on the left side of the road. Plus, Toyota Rent-a-Car requires cancellations 7 days in advance, which doesn’t give us much flexibility.How realistic is it to rent a car closer to the date instead? And if we don’t rent one, would it still be enjoyable to explore the area by bicycle?Days 18 – Friday: FujikawaguchiWake up early (~6:00)Train to Shinjuku → Depending on ticket availability:Train to Fujikawaguchiko → Toyota Rent-a-car OR Rent a bicycleBus to Fujikawaguchiko → Toyota Rent-a-car OR Rent a bicycleTrain to Otsuki → Toyota Rent-a-car → Drive to FujikwaguchikoDrive/Ride to Mt.

We weren’t planning on spending much time in Tokyo, but since the tail end of the trip would be around Halloween we thought it worth spending at least a few days in Tokyo.

Loves Japanese food and pretty good for big walks (sure he will be on my shoulders for some!) and public transport. We are also doing some basic language and customs as he has Japanese teachers at Kindy.Day 1 - explore dontonbori, round1 stadium, sumo hall show (any recommended other spots close to these that are musts with a 5 year old boy?)Day 2 - namba yasaka, kaiyukan aquarium, Legoland, Osaka castleDay 3 - day trip Nara, maybe teamlab Nagai at night (has anyone been? Worth the effort?)Day 4 - off to Kyoto but in no rush so could do something in the morning in Osaka. Afternoon tandem Bike hire and ride around Higashiyama and Gion district.Day 5 - Arishiyama and Monkey ParkDay 6 - Nishiki Market, Train museum, Nijo castle, any recommended Kyoto arcades?Day 7 - Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizudera,Happy for any recommended cool food spots, pet cafes, better gaming spots, children’s playgrounds/parks in Osaka (staying near Osaka-Namba Station) and Kyoto (staying near Kyoto Station)! Supportive solo parent travel tips welcome.PS For anyone worried about walking distances with child, we are not locked in everything, these are just options to consider 😂 if we’re exhausted we won’t do something 🤷🏼‍♂️ I’m learning people on Reddit can be very strange.Thanks! ☺️",

      "content_preview": "Me and my family (4 people- mom dad me little brother ~11) are planning a trip to Japan in October. After alot of discussions on the itinerary we decided on this, and still have alot of questions- Is it doable? Is it convenient? Is it hassle free and is genuinely interesting without overdoing it? And alot more Please provide some tips and answer to some more questions from the given itinerary, it will be of great help 🙏🏻Day 1- We would reach hotel (in Shinjuku) by 12pm -- Next I can't decide if I should go to main Shinjuku area (Tokyo metropolitan building etc.) or to go to Asakusa (sensoji, nakamise, sumida river)? Asakusa is slightly better imo in terms of first experience, but requires roughly 50min of travel one way, where as Shinjuku doesn'tDay 2- Morning- teamLabs planets, then Kiyosumi gardens, then akihabara-- if Shinjuku not done on day 1, it can be done here, not sure if asakusa can/should be done hereDay 3- Full day disneysea Day 4- morning- Ueno park + zoo, then Yanaka ginza, and finally ginza for shopping Day 5- mt fuji day tour Day 6- Meiji Jingu then Yoyogi park, then Shibuya parco (short time, 1hr or so) Evening- hachiko statue (snacks nearby), Shibuya sky, Shibuya crossing Mega donki-- what do u think of this order days itinerary order? Is it valid?Day 7- Hakone day trip- -- Don't know if I should take romance car or the train included in the freepass Hakone open air museum Tozan railway -> Gora Ropeway to Togendai Pirate ship cruise Motohakone -> Hakone shrine --Return using ___ train? -- Wanted to include an onsen bath here, but I think time doesn't allow (or does it?), I wanted to skip Togendai because it's not of any interest to us, but i didn't know the alternate route to reach the aishi cruise so i just stuck with this",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I will be visiting Japan in mid-late May 2026 (after Golden Week) and it will be my first time overseas by myself (excited but also scared if I am being honest). I am very fit (I'm a big walker haha) and keen to beat the crowds early for the \"touristy\" spots. Because of this, I am planning for early morning starts and early bedtimes on this trip - I'm not really keen to party or meet people tbh, just want to do things at my own pace and eat good food in my own company. I am looking for advice on whether this itinerary might be too much, especially in Kyoto and Hiroshima. For reference, I am staying in Shinjuku area in Tokyo, near Osaka Station in Osaka and near Kyoto Station in Kyoto (I've decided to stay at both Osaka and Kyoto rather than just one to make the early starts easier).

Please let me know if it’s feasible/any suggestions on best places to view autumn leaves. Thank you!18th Oct:Arrive in New Chitose airport around 2pm.Collect rental car from airport and drive to Jozankei Onsen area. Side note: is renting a car directly from the airport advisable? Or should we travel to Sapporo city first to collect the car so it would be cheaper?19th Oct:Travel around Jozankei Onsen area - view autumn leaves from Futamitsuri Bridge. Other places of interest: Kappabuchi Pool, Akaiwa-no-Kan streamTravel to Mt Hakkenzan20th Oct:Drive to Lake shikotsuDrive to Mt TarumaeDrive to Noboribetsu, visit Hell’s valley. Side note: I’m not exactly sure if I want to visit Noboribetsu as I’ve been there before in the winter. I didn’t find it particularly beautiful/interesting but I’m not sure about autumn. However there aren’t any major towns to stay in close to lake shikotsu. Any advice/suggestions?21th Oct:Drive to FuranoVisit Farm Tomita, Panorama RoadDrive to BieiVisit Shirogane Blue Pond and Shirahige waterfallDrive to Asahikawa to stay for the night22nd Oct:Drive to Daisetsuzan Sounkyo Kurodake ropeway.Take ropeway up 3 Visit Ryusei waterfalls and Momijidaki waterfallsTravel back to Asahikawa for the night23rd Oct:Drive to OtaruTemiya Botanical gardenNeed some more suggestions for Otaru!24th Oct:Drive to SapporoReturn the carVisit Hokkaido universityNakajima park25th Oct:Travel to the airport to depart.Some other questions I have:Would it be easy to find free parking spots in hotels in Asahikawa/Noboribetsu/Otaru? Parking seems expensive in Sapporo hence I’m inclined to return the car and rely on public transport when in Sapporo.How is driving like in Hokkaido? We are not very used to driving long distance so I’m worried the drive to Furano might be tiring.Would the tourist spots be crowded during the time period I’ll be there?Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "With money from my summer internship flooding in, I decided well in advance to see the sakura in April for peak Japan. A full budget breakdown will be at the end including a link to the Spreadsheet I used to track my expenses. This was a solo trip I began planning for 8 months. I tend to overplan before cutting stuff out in the moment. This is going to be very in depth, so strap in and grab some popcorn if you want to tuck in!Day -1: Flying nonstop MSP to HND was ~$1500 for regular Economy. I have my classic drink order: Woodford Reserve whiskey to sleep lolDay 0: High Table: Landing in Haneda (HND), it took just 30 minutes from getting off the plane to leaving customs with my backpack and checked luggage. I reserved a 3GB Pocket WiFi from NinjaWiFi like always, which was plenty for solo travelling and using Google Maps every other moment. I used Timeshifter to help minimize my jet lag, which did help!! I also had melatonin with me as well to ensure my best chances of being jet lagged for not that long. I reserved a Gran Class ticket (to be used later) with my JR Rail Pass at the JR East Travel Center, and got some free chopsticks, neat! I wandered around Haneda Airport Garden but wasn’t too impressed.LODGING, which I booked for my whole March 31 - April 12 stay: Pegasus Hostel. 200 USD total via AirBnB.While the hostel was a little cramped, and you have to carry luggage up stairs, the in unit (I forgot if it was coin operated) laundry and free WiFi is nice to have, and I was more than happy given how cheap the accommodation was. The receptionist mainly speaks Mandarin, so my Cantonese did not really work, and we made do with English and Google Translate which had no issues. Let me tell ya, this hostel is a sleeper pick location-wise!! You are <5 min away walking from Asakusabashi Station, ONE stop away from Akihabara, ONE train ride to-from HND if you take Keisei thru line to the Asakusa Line, and a more involved walk to Bakurochō Station. There is a FamilyMart and 7-Eleven within a 2 minute walk, along with Naruto Taiyaki Honpo Asakusabashi shop for a nice evening Taiyaki. There is a caveat though, taking the Chuo Line from here is almost always super busy, and the station’s east exit is a little cramped, so I would not recommend it as much if you have more than 1 rolling luggage.I ate supper over in Akihabara at Wako Tonkatsu Akiba 8th Floor, as PremierTwo recommended it, quite nice and super filling! I would need this to prepare my liver for…HIGHLIGHT: Bar BenFiddich. I had to reserve this in advance, and I felt ultra intimidated being in such a curated and intimate space. I felt small in my expansive seat, as I was seated right in front of Hiroyasu Kayama himself! I got to see him make most of the drinks ordered in that 2 hour slot, and it was magical. I had to wrack my imagination for drink orders since this place has no menu. He put me at ease, and made 3 cocktails that I will never forget.Scotch? + Passion fruit w/ Muscat Liquor, chocolate?, and fennel sprinklesMy request: something using the muscat grape. He blowtorched the top?! WHAT. But it was a brilliant gradient of flavor.Japanese Gin w/ Lavender Distilled WaterMy request: something floral. It’s perfectly fragrant, topped with a sprig of lavender. It’s wavy in the sense of winds going over a lavender field.Chery Brandy + Drouet Cognac VS Grande ChampagneMy request: “a warm hug on a cold snowing day.” He then makes this HOT tiny dainty signature cocktail, which was literally on fire at some point. WHAT. It was right on point with my abstract request, and my only regret was that I could not finish it… because 3 drinks would put me to sleep. I am a lightweight, 6’ 2”, 160 lbs, half white (Germany + Wales), half Chinese, and 2 drinks is enough to make me drunk. I needed to make sure I could take the train back to my hostel lmaoooStep Count: roughly 9k stepsDay 1: Eye’s Up: It’s April Fool’s Day, so I did not sleep great, only sleeping 11-3-5-6? The rain in the morning was not welcome. Maybe it being April Fool’s was unrelated. I ate breakfast at Kameido Gusto (decent, but would’ve preferred a konbini) before buying a shirt from Work Land. I got new glasses at Jins (Akihabara Yodobashi Camera), but it took 2 days of having a mental breakdown before I started liking the glasses lmaoooo.Lunch was at Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building’s Cafeteria bc I make it a consistent staple to eat there once per Japan trip. The curry was good, but the cafe pastry left much to be desired.I bought souvenirs at Shinjuku Marui Annex before walking to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden which was not that busy due to the light rain throughout the whole day. I sauntered into Omotesando but did not buy anything there. I took the train back, and it stopped for several minutes, an odd occurrence… My night ends with a mashup supper of a 7-Eleven onigiri, a FamilyMart fried chicken, and some dried persimmons before going to SAKE street nearby for a flight of sweet sake.14.5k stepsDay 2: PremierMe: After a crisp 9 hours of sleep, I’m up for breakfast at Ootoya. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! For only 600 JPY, I got red rice, miso soup, chicken, and unlimited drinks. A killer breakfast set for basically $4 USD. Once again, my train stops in the middle of the line… huh.I spend a fair amount of time taking Shinkansen pictures from the Nippori Station’s North Bridge before trying to find cats at Yanaka Ginza. The rain eventually stops, but not before I get some gelato and a latte from Guru Guru. The Yanaka Cemetery is a great place to visit. A stroll around leads to some peaceful adages, loads of sakura, and the rare stray cat. Another train down to Ueno leads to plenty of souvenirs, shaved ice, and lunch at Uo Tsuka: full of oysters, ikura-don, and a sweet sake to pair with the seafood. I eventually end up at Ishibashiinari Shrine where I adjust my itinerary until loud bells begin ringing. It’s 3PM, and a ceremony of sorts seems to be happening. I bask in the loud noises, before I drop off my purchases at my hostel.Following a few of the steps that PermierTwo took in his 2024 Meguro walk and talk, I witness the sakura festival at Naka-Meguro! Stopping at Kura Sushi for supper, I go to the raised crossing that is the inspiration for the location where Akane Kurokawa is saved by Aqua Hoshino in Oshi no Ko Season 1. A bit of a trek from the station, but nothing unusual. I stop at Traveler’s Factory, a haven for stationary lovers, although I only buy a small notebook refill there. Next is SLOWJAM GARAGE for a sakura highball, where somehow I feel a brief and fleeting sense of community. I get a bit more food, some gyoza at Ohka the Bestdays.Last stop of the day was Bar Panorma Ginza, which fun fact: is not located in Ginza. A pain to find, but once you enter you are in a textbook otaku paradise. No no, not for anime. Trains! The bulk of the floorplan is taken up by the lovely trainset! A shinkansen zips around. A local train whirs past, and there are more model trains on the walls! All of the drinks are train line themed, you HAVE to order the Yamanote Line drink if you like sweet and/or melon.To unwind, I went to Akihabara because I found a Taiko machine cheaper than all the others… how? I got 3 songs per play instead of 2… ohohoho it is #MusicMaxxing time! I would do this most nights… I like combining violence (hitting a drum) with music (anime openings).20.3k stepsDay 3: A Simple Meal: I didn't sleep that long, which was okay because I spent 6 hours in Akihabara! I got Pork Belly Curry for lunch at Hinoya Curry before spending 2x retail price on a countryside Miku figurine at a crane game, oof. I popped into Yusha Kobo which is a super cool physical keyboard shop. Yeah, you’re better off buying it all online, but it’s nice to see and test the keyboards and switches yourself!~I waltz on over to Shibuya, and I immediately get lost. Not in the station, but in the basement department store of Shibuya Mark City. I swear, every department store could use better wayfinding, but I’ll live. I eventually found Kageyamarou to have some soba for supper! A perfect fuel for the drinks I am about to indulge in, I get out on the streets, and what’s that? PLAYERS by YOASOBI is playing! I am so elated, I saunter, skip, and dance my way down the street to LOST Bar. I enjoy the April Cocktail: License to Chill, Like a Magic Mule, and the cracker-cheese plate! I push myself to eat it all, even if I accidentally stalled my appetite… oops lol my greed tends to get the best of me >~>10.4k stepsDay 4: A-S-O So Much Volcano: It is time to be ambitious! I take a 7AM flight down to Kumamoto, with a rental car in wait, ready to drive towards Aso. No, there were no Pikachu plushies in the vending machines, very sad. I was amazed security took only 1 minute AND I could bring water through security??? America could never. I miss spotting Mt Fuji from the plane which is very sad, but I was about to see more mountains!The rental kei car was awesome! Getting >50 mpg, taking only <10 seconds on ignition for it to recognize and automatically play music from my iPad, and the snazzy gps. Oooo, now this is a nice upgrade from my Chevy Spark. While it was only 57F outside, it was warm coming from Minnesota~. Ozu Roadside Station was filled with samples aplenty, so ofc I had to buy some Ube Cheesecake, which was the tastiest thing I sampled there. I try horse meat in a bun at Michi no Eki Aso, and I even get to glimpse the Seven Stars of Kyushu train there!Next up is Milk Factory for some cheese on soft serve, before winding up to Daikambo Lookout Point. Something worth mentioning is that even on these mountainy roads, everyone is going 10-20 kmph over the speed limit. A brief visit to Meoto Falls, preps me for the quaint town of Kurokawa Onsen. Did I go there because it shared a last name with my favorite anime character inOshi no Ko? Yes. Did I also go there because of the nice onsens? Yes.LODGING: Yamamizuki. I splurged 40480 JPY for a night here with their seasonal kaiseki meals. There is so much info, so I am shaking with worry, but this time I do not get an anxiety attack trying to put on my yukata! I take a quick bath before I see my FIVE COURSE KAISEKI and another portion laid out in front of me. Because the room was for 2, there were 2 portions (next breakfast would only have 1 though), so I got extras of the real good stuff~! There was so much food, all so good, this was well worth the steep cost! I go back into the onsen before I fall asleep to the river noises beyond my window.7.2k stepsDay 5: POP IN 2: Waking up at 5AM means that I get to take an early bath! There were two tourists speaking Cantonese in the bath so Ihad toreply back in Cantonese (bc my mother is from Guangzhou). The two men were stunned, and I will forever grin at their shocked expressions. Breakfast was plentiful, and I finished the last bit of sake before Ipop in 2the tourist center in town to buy a couple towels and a pouch to carry them in. Driving down to Takachiho, I park at the Eki store after checking that parking by the gorge is all full. It’s … just about walkable (downhill is okay, it’s uphill that’s rough) over to my reservation for…HIGHLIGHT: Rowboat in Takachiho Gorge! It’s genuinely quite beautiful, you get to be tens of feet deep as you maneuver yourself along the black rock and falling water.I spy a local shop on my way walking up, where I got some dango with walnut sauce and an orange-mango swirl soft serve! What’s up with soft serve? I guess America is also a fan of soft serve in fast food and such, but is there any reason why Japan likes soft serve too? Let me know! Next is the freshwater aquarium, a nice quaint place with a sturgeon, an axolotl, and more! I chose this area because it’s whereOshi no Kobegins! Ijust missedthe Oshi no Ko Season 2 x Takachiho collab event, but thankfully a couple places still had merch left!Around this time, I have a mental breakdown because I bought the Onsen Pass at Kurokawa Onsen and have yet to use it, so I hastily drive back to Kurokawa to use ⅔ of the pass at Sanga Ryokan for the baths and a fruit drink. It starts raining on my parade back to Kumamoto, and then I make a minor mistake at KMJ. I accidentally bought frozen basashi instead of fresh, and I threw it out because I did not have facilities at my hostel to work with it. Curse me being rushed and not wanting to say no to the shopkeep. I still slept an hour on the flight though!8.5k stepsDay 6: TOP LINE, TOP CLASS: I lost that Gran Class ticket I booked ;-; so I had to buy a new one… At least Gran Class is SUPER CUSHY. Free slippers, water, Katsuyama Ken Sake, a small meal? It was so nice, I even did some homework on the train to Morioka. But the train of bad news does not stop only there. Turns out I LEFT my Apple Pencil on the train. After anxiously waiting with the staff, I was told to check back with the Sendai staff (as I’d be there in 2 hours). At least Morioka Station had heat lamps, that was nice. Plus I had a cheap and swift lunch at Soba no Hana.As per the staff in Sendai, it turns out my Apple Pencil went all the way to Hakodate. That’s not good. Because I booked a hostel, the receptionist wanted me to be there on arrival to pay for the delivery, and I could not make that happen with what I had reserved… but wait! I will be in Kusatsu Onsen for a night, I can have them deliver it there! We communicated, and in a few days I will have my Apple Pencil again; the cornerstone to a third of all of the college notes I’ve written (bc paper notes take up physical space). Sadly, this meant I could not do anything in Sendai EXCEPT for a load of food stalls in the station plaza?! I gaze around before it settles on a booth with alcohol. I sample some local sake and wine? You heard that right, grape wine! This was a welcome surprise because I just started getting into wine this year. Now onto…Utsunomiya! I’m here thanks to Jake Valiane's video on the city citing its notably hospitable bartenders. I peeped a shinkansen barrel through the station, before I spotted a lil light rail, just like home (minus the bullet train). Supper was decided to be a local specialty: gyoza! Coined in by the dog encased in one inside Utsunomiya Station, I head to 365 Gyoza Bar for some delectable gyoza. I have to admit, I am pretty ambivalent to dumpling-like things of [thing] encased in [carb casing], but those were nice!LODGING: Utsunomiya Tobu Hotel Grande. A really cheap hotel accessible by bus from the train station, I had a whole room with nice amenities. There was also a newspaper vending machine? I suppose people still read those. I used to once when I worked at a gas station in All-There-Is-Is-Corn, Minnesota.As someone who can only have 2 standard drinks maximum to not be sedated like someone shot by a tranquilizer, I had to choose my bar time carefully. Do I go to one bar having 2 drinks or two bars having 1 drink? I chose the one bar strat. In Bar Juice, we have a lovely bartender! He can speak good English, and we talked about our lives before a couple came in. This was a Sunday night, so the four of us shot the shit as I indulged in a seasonal strawberry cocktail and a matcha cocktail so me and the couple ordered the same two cocktails! This was perfect, not at all pretentious, and I would genuinely go here every night if I lived in the same city. The price was decent, the table charge snack plentiful, and I got a branded small set of matches to take home!16k steps.Day 7: Sake Country: Turns out I keep yapping so I will try to summarize… oops. It’s a huge reach of the day, taking the shinkansen from Utsunomiya to Gala Yuzawa to Niigata to Tokyo in one day! Gala Yuzawa is relevant so I can see snow, go into a small onsen, enjoy the footbath by Yuzawa Station, get complimented on my Japanese, and enjoy the sake vending machines inside the station!Niigata is obvious: Sake. I toured Imayotsukasa Sake Brewery and chatted with someone travelling from Finland! We enjoy the Niigata Station sake vending machines together before we go our own ways.Tokyo is back but so is Shinjuku?! HUUUUUH? That’s right, I got a 2nd reservation for Bar BenFiddich at 11PM. Drink 1 is something herbal: Wrymwood Gimlet. Drink 2 features Japanese ingredients: Smooth Matcha Old Fashioned. That cocktail was genuinely perfect, a touch of walnut liquor and coconut water making is extremely easy to drink. I would actually drink one every night if I could. Since me and a couple nearby were chatty, I got to try a Fernet and Bar BenFiddich’s Absinthe. I absolutely will return again.Lodging: Shinjuku Nikka. Here for something super cheap, a walkable distance, and easily accessed when the trains have stopped running.14.6k steps.Day 8: Wine Country: By this point, I have successfully paid off the 7 Day Japan Rail Pass! You know what that means? Time to take a convenient Limited Express to the local Chuo Line to Katsunumabudokyo Station. A lovely trip, passing by the maglev shinkansen test track, we arrive at loads of vineyards and sakura! Super scenic!! This is a guaranteed HIGHLIGHT with how pretty the station looks in April. I spend time in Budou no Oka’s wine cave to indulge and sample on locally made wine~I head on back and rest in my bed before eating mackerel ramen at Seafudou. Mmm, fish. I walk to Jimbocho to buy some doujins for me and a friend, walk to Ochanomizu for the train photospot, and walk next door to Akihabara. I spend more time playing Taiko no Tatsujin, and I drink a Sapporo before I sleep.13.7k steps.Day 9: Warm Sulfur Town: I meet up with a friend and her mom at Ueno so we can take the JR Kusatsu Limited Express train + bus up to Kusatsu Onsen!By this point, I have not only paid off the Rail Pass, but the Green Car version. That’s right, I bought the Green Car version of the 7 Day Japan Rail Pass. I wanted to ensure I got guaranteed seats since I noticed that some trains were completely full when I went to Japan the month prior with my parents.LODGING: Kusatsu Onsen Eiyada! I have dinner there before I walk around town with my friend, going into baths along the way. I sleep to some Japanese TV.9.5k steps.Day 10: Cheesy Nightlife: I see my friend off as she flies back this afternoon, and think over my plans as I go into the 4 increasingly hot baths in Otaki no Yu. I buy some grape juice and camembert from Karuizawa before taking the shinkansen to Omiya for the Railroad Museum! There was so much to see, and even more I could buy from the gift shop. A MUST VISIT if you are into trains even a little bit. Omiya Station also had something going on, so I sampled a couple sweet sake before making a snap choice to…Return to Utsunomiya! Bar Juice was so good, I had to go again to give the bartender a bar of dark chocolate from Trader Joe’s I had brought with me on the trip. I also visit Bar Yamanoi (the one operated by the son, not the father bc there’s two) to try the Ryokubi! I love yuzu and muscat, what can I say? The shinkansen takes me back~17k steps.Day 11: 25 Cour: I skip breakfast as I wander around Tokyo Station for one key reason: 25 Course Omakase at Manten Sushi Nihonbashi for lunch. I just barely survived, but hot damn was everything really good! One minor gripe was that they did not tell you how much drinks cost and I found out when the bill arrived :pAround this point, I ran out of money in my bank account so I was rationing what little cash and IC card money I had. No, I did not buy the $200 four liter sized mango, but I really wanted to though… I pop into Shibuya 109 for an Oshi no Ko pop up store before heading down to Enoshima Treasure Cafe for a Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid collab cafe! With that being my #2 fav anime of all time, I had to go for the goodies. I went back up to Asakusabashi but not after trying to 100% Fatal on Normal Mode in Taiko.12.2k stepsDay 12: Prince of Speed: I furiously pack and keep my luggage waiting in the hostel before heading to Ikebukuro. Why there?? A Dungeon Meshi collab cafe of course. Somehow, I got a $400 refund from my university. Not sure HOW, but better late than never? I play Taiko one last time in Akihabara before I take my one train from Asakusabashi to HND Terminal 3.I unfortunately fell into the trap of making my checked bag too heavy, so I had to move 1 kg into my backpack. It almost always happens to my mom, and I thought it would never happen to me. Ah, well. Thanks to Face Express, instead of lining up in the long 100+ person line, I got to line up behind only about 20 instead, thanks Japan! I use the last of my cash and coins on 7-Eleven and vending machine stuff to have food on the flight all the way back to the Land of 1000 Lakes. I will return again next year!8.7k steps pre-flight.Here is myExpense Spreadsheet, if you have any questions feel free to ask me and I will do my best to answer! I know this was a super ambitious and indulgent trip, but it was worth it for all the stories and pictures I can show and tell.",

Is that correct?)NahaWould you say it's worthwhile to see both Okinawa World and Ryukyu Mura? Should we swap or leave something out?Any child-friendly restaurant or hotel recommendations? We'll probably try and book two hotels, one further south and one further north to keep the driving times more manageable for the kids. Your input would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",

Our idea for now is just a day trip, renting a car in Otsuki to have more flexibility to visit different spots.On the other hand, we thought about renting a car in Takayama to go to Shirakawa-go and then to Kanazawa. Even if it is more expensive than the bus, it will give us more freedom to see some villages in the area and enjoy it more. Do you think it’s worth adding 1 more night in Takayama/Kanazawa? From where would you remove it?We are not interested in visiting Hiroshima, but we do want to see Himeji. Is Miyajima worth it as a day/afternoon trip?We already booked a ryokan in Takayama (Honjin Hiranoya). Do you think it’s worth it or are there better ones? We don’t mind the price since this will be our relax day/night (after all, it’s our honeymoon).Which places would you add or remove from this itinerary?If you’re still here, thank you so much for taking time to read our plan and for your advice :)",

I've wanted to do this for 20+ years and definitely not intending it to be the only time so this is intended to be a little bit of everything in the small time I have available. There's heaps to see and soak in but I also want time to just be in places.I'm sure most of it is the usual tourist stuff and that's fine, it is what it is. But I also hope I've left enough room to just explore along the way sometimes.There's a few things on my wishlist that I haven't slotted in yet and maybe won't even have the time to do but any suggestions about that would be very appreciated.

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone,I’m planning a trip to Japan (coming from India) and would really appreciate help in finalizing my itinerary. I have a bunch of places and interests in mind, but I’m struggling to put them in the right order and figure out the best base cities and day trips.Here’s what I have so far:Arrival:I’ll be landing inOsaka.Places I definitely want to visit:Osaka:Osaka Castle (mainly for the autumn foliage)Kuromon Ichiba MarketNamba ShrineUmeda area (for Pokémon Center and Nintendo store)Universal StudiosHiroshima:Itsukushima Shrine and Miyajima IslandNara:I'd like to visit Nara, but not for the deer park. I’m more interested in the historical/cultural side.Kamakura and Shizuoka:I’d like to do day trips to both, but I’m unsure if I should stay in those towns or visit from nearby hubs like Tokyo or Yokohama.Mount Fuji area:I’m not planning to hike, but I’d love to get some great views of Mount Fuji. Places like Chureito Pagoda, Fujisan Yume No Ōhashi Bridge, or the famous Lawson with the view are on my list.Open to suggestions for scenic spots that are accessible and don’t require intense walking.I know visibility depends on weather, so I’d also appreciate any tips for maximizing my chances of seeing Fuji clearly.Tokyo:I know this city has a lot to offer, but also can be expensive. Here’s what I’m most interested in other than the obvious places:Pokémon Centers (not sure which ones are worth visiting, any recommendations?)TeamLabs BorderlessThe Making of Harry Potter Studio TourDisneyland and DisneySea (Would I need two full days, or can both be done in one?)Other experiences I’m interested in (location flexible):These don’t have to be in Tokyo. I’m happy to include them anywhere that makes sense logistically.Watch asumo match(if there's one happening during my trip)Traditional onsenexperienceWatch avolleyball match(national, university, or even local, anything fun to attend)VisitingKasukabe City(Shin-chan’s hometown): does this make sense as a fan?Travel window:I’m choosing between two time windows:Mid October to end of OctoberFrom 8th November onwardsWhich one would you recommend in terms of weather and avoiding huge crowds?What I need help with:What’s the most efficientroute/orderto visit these places?For places like Kamakura, Nara, Shizuoka, etc., is it better tostay overnightor doday tripsfrom a nearby city?How many days should I ideally spend in each major area?Any tips to help structure this trip in a way that’s exciting but not exhausting?Hiroshima is kind of a secluded location on the west side of the map, can I include anything else on that side?Thanks in advance for any help! I know this is a lot, but I’m super excited and just want to make the most of my time while keeping things realistic.TL;DR:Planning a Japan trip (landing in Osaka) with interests in Pokémon, tech, Mount Fuji views, and theme parks. Not into hiking or food. Main places I want to visit: Osaka, Hiroshima, Nara (other than deer park), Mount Fuji area, Tokyo, Kamakura, and Shizuoka.Also hoping to fit in: sumo match, onsen, volleyball game, and maybe Kasukabe (Shin-chan city).Need help with:Best route/order to visit these spotsWhether to do day trips or stay overnight in places like Nara, Kamakura, ShizuokaChoosing between two travel windows: mid to end Octobervs.starting Nov 8 (which has better weather and fewer crowds?)General tips to avoid burnout while covering everything efficiently",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone,I would be really happy if you could have a look at my itinerary for my first trip to Japan. I wonder if my plans are to ambitious (I'm aware that Day 11 + 12 in Kyoto will be stressful, because I have reservations stacked on those days).My main focus is on shrines, temples, gardens, Kimono experiences, experiencing Geiko/Maiko as much as much as possible. And I would like to collect goshuin, stamps and souvenirs at shrines. And eventhough I like shopping for cute things, I would skip some shopping (Day 5 +6) for a cute/beautfil shrine.  Maybe you can recommend something to me? I even thought about leaving Tokyo one day earlier to have more time in Kyoto.And do you think it will be possible to enjoy Nara on day 8 (if we start early) and still have time to arrive at Fushimi Inari before the stores on the grounds of the shrine close? Or do you think it would be better to start early at Fushimi Inari and then travel to Nara (open end) - and if we feel fancy, come back to Fushimi Inari the same day to experience it at night? I just would love to find a little quite place in Nara Park to interact with the deers alone, so I thought about arriving there really early.Thanks in advance for any help and tips!(English isn't my first language, maybe I worded some things strange)GreetingsNiriDay 1 (Tokyo):Arrive at 4 p.m. at Narita AirportTransfer from Narita Airport to Asakusa via Keisei-LineEvening: Check-In Airbnb in AsakusaConbini Shopping & relaxDay 2 (Tokyo):Senso-jiAsakusa ShrineAsakusa Culture Tourist Information Center (Viewing Deck, no reservation needed)Explore the side streets of AsakusaTakagi ShrineTokyo Skytree + Shopping in Skytree Town (Pokemon Center, Ghibli Store)Day 3 (Nikko day 1):Asakusa to Nikko via SpaciaX --> Arrive at Nikko at 9:40 a.m.Nikko Sightseeing near Ryokan (Toushoguo, Futarasan Jinja Haiden, Rin’nōji Temple sanbutsudo, Shinkyō Bridge, Kanmangafuchi Abyss)Check-In Ryokan at 3 p.m.Eat, Bath, Relax in RyokanDay 4 (Nikko day 2):Visit Edo Wonderland in Nikko5:57 p.m: Take SpaciaX back to Tokyo (same Airbnb in Asakusa)Day 5 (Saitama/Tokyo):Saitama: 10 a.m. Omiya Bonsai Art Museum + other bonsai related sights nearbyIkebukuro (Shopping, e.g. Pokemon Center in Sunshine City)maybe afterwards: Tokyo National MuseumDay 6 (Tokyo):Meiji JinguShopping in Harajuku: Laforet Harajuku (Sailor Moon Store)Shopping in Shibuya: Shibuya ParcoHave a look at Shibuya Scramble CrossingDay 7 (Tokyo --> Kyoto):Tokyo to Kyoto via Shinkansen12 a.m. Luggage Storage/Check-In Airbnb Higashiyama DistrictOkazaki Shrine (20 min away from airbnb by foot)Ōtoyo ShrineShorenin TempleYasaka Shrine (evening)Day 8 (Nara --> Kyoto: Fushimi Inari):Early Trip to Nara:Nara ParkKasugataisha ShrineTōdai-jiYoshikien GardenBack to Kyoto:Fushimi Inari (in the late afternoon/evening) --> would like to be there before 5 p.m. to buy at the shrine (Goshuin)Day 9 (Koya day 1):Bus from Kyoto Station to KoyaSightseeing in KoyaTemple StayDay 10 (Koya day 2):Sightseeing in KoyaBus from Koya to KyotoDay 11 (Kyoto):9 a.m. Kimono rental near Yasaka Shrine(Reservation made)Yasaka ShrineKodaiji TempleKiyomizu Dera3 p.m. Gion Kagai Art Museum(Reservation made)6 p.m. Traditional Arts Performance Gion(Reservation made)afterwards a little Exploring in Gion (Hanamikoji Street, Pontocho Alley)Day 12 (Kyoto):9 a.m. Maiko Make-over all morning(Reservation made)2 p.m. Kimono Rental (combi-ticket with the geisha performance)Nishiki Market6:30 p.m. Geisha performance(Reserveration made)Day 13 (Daytrip to Himeji):Kyoto to Himeji via Shinkansenmaybe 8:50 a.m. Arrive at Himeji CastleKoko-enmaybe 4 p.m. Arrive at Kyoto StationShopping (Pokemon Center, Kimono Store)Day 14 (Kyoto):08:45 a.m. Saihōji (Kokedera) Temple(Reserveration made)Taxi to: Otagi Nenbutsuji TempleAdashino Nenbutsuji TempleGiōji TempleJojakkoji Templea little bit of shopping in ArashiyamaArashiyama ForestEvening: Visit Onsen near Arashiyama Area (open until midnight)Day 15 (Tokyo):Kyoto to Tokyo via Shinkansen12 p.m. Luggage Storage/Check-In Hotel in GinzaZōjō-jiTokyo Tower (maybe Sunset/at night)Day 16 (Tokyo):10 a.m. Edogawa: Shunkaen Bonsai Museumback to Ginza for shopping: Pokémon Center Tokyo DX, Ginza Loft, HANDS7 p.m. TeamLab Planets(Reservation made)Day 17 (Tokyo):Store Luggage at hotel after check-out“last minute shopping”maybe Taxi to Tokyo Station (10 min by Taxi)Departure at 4:30 p.m. from Tokyo Station to Airport Hotel Narita via Narita ExpressDay 18 (Narita Airport):Shuttle Bus from Narita Airport Hotel to AirportEarly departure",

      "content_preview": "Hello! I will be in Japan this November for roughly 13 days. The first leg of our trip is in Tokyo, and I would like some advice on how I have organized the itinerary for the initial 3 days in Tokyo and then the final day in Tokyo before we fly out. I'll have some specific questions below, but this is our overall itiniterary so you get an idea of how we'll be moving around the country. I'm really only asking about the Tokyo days since I'm still working out the entire Kyoto Itinerary. Thanks in advance!GENERAL TRAVEL PLANDay 1: Arrive in TokyoDay 2-4: TokyoDay 5: Travel to KyotoDay 6-9: KyotoDay 10: Travel to Kinosaki, stay at RyokanDay 11: Travel to TokyoDay 12: TokyoDay 13: Fly Out of TokyoTOKYO ITINERARY(we will be staying at a hotel in the Akasaka area during the first three days and then north of the Ueno area for the final day)Day 2 (Meiji Jingu and Shibuya):Coffee/Tea, Meiji Jingu Shrine (get there at 7am to 8am), Yoyogi Park, Brunch/Lunch, walk down Cat Street in Harajuku to Shibuya and check out Tower Records, Loft, Parco Building (Nintendo Store, Pokemon Center, Shounen Jump Store), and Shibuya Scramble Crossing, get dinner in the area.Day 2 (Ueno):Coffee/Tea, Check out Parfum Satori (opens at 11am so may be get breakfast before somewhere?) and then take train to Tokyo National Museum (we want to make sure this happens early on in our trip even though Ueno is closer to our final hotel location) and spend most of the day there, walk through Ueno Park afterwards then walk down to Aneyoko Shopping Street and get dinner in Okachimachi.Day 3 (Shinjuku):Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden before 12pm (coffee/tea/breakfast before or after), potential stationery stores and otome merch shopping (Shinjuku Hands, Otomate Store, Melonbooks, Kingdom Note), then at night/afternoon check out Omoide Yokocho (retro drinking district) and Shinjuku Golden Gai, get dinner in the area.Day 12 (Senso-Ji and Tsukiji):Tsukiji Outer Market in the morning for breakfast (get there around 8am to beat the crowds), Hamarikyu Gardens for birding, then take a train to Senso-Ji Temple and check them out and the gardens and Nakamise Shopping Street in the afternoon as the sun goes down OR go to the Tobichi store if I still want to and we are feeling a bit tired and don't want to beat the crowds for another temple OR do something else entirely this day? Hamarikyu seems worth it for birding potentially.QUESTIONSTwo of the stories I'd really love to visit at some point but are a little out of the way areParfum Satoriand theTobichi Store, and I've put tentative places for them in my itinerary but am wondering if there are better times to slot them in? Any recommendations on that would be great.Do you have recs for good vegetarian food in the areas we are visiting (we can eat fish and seafood so are moreso pescatarian)?We got a recommendation from a friend forMino SushiandGinza Cafe Hanonand was wondering if there would be any way to fit those into the itinerary I have going?Are these four days two packed? Is there anything you would do differently?I would love recommendations for parks or birding locations in and around Tokyo that you would recommend over anything I have listed. We're trying to decide if doing Senso-Ji is really worth it or if we would prefer something a little bit more slower paced that last day.",

      "content_preview": "For an experience that is utterly different from what you'll find on the usual Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka itinerary, consider allocating 2-3 nights to visit Kiso Valley, a perfect blend of natural beauty and culture/history, where you can visit Atera Valley and hike the Nakasendo Trail. You can make a transfer in Nagoya (on the Shinkansen line between Tokyo and Kyoto) to make your way up to Kiso Valley.Two highlights in Kiso Valley:Atera Valley is a stunning mountain stream with otherworldly turquoise waters that the Japanese call “Atera Blue.” We just spent an incredible day exploring natural swimming holes surrounded by lush forest and dramatic mountain scenery in the heart of central Japan. In the fall, there is amazing fall foliage.Another highlight is the classic hike along the Nakasendo Trail from Magome-juku to Tsumago-juku, two super-scenic Edo-era post towns. The 2-3 hour hike between these towns takes you through a beautiful, forested route with waterfalls.We based ourselves in Nakatsugawa, a small town in the Kiso Valley just 50 minutes by limited express train from Nagoya. Nakatsugawa is a good choice as a base, as it is close to both Atera Valley and Magome-juku, and it has a good selection of accommodations and restaurants. The town is compact so everything is within walking distance.For Atera Valley, we took a 30-minute local train from to Nojiri Station, then walked about 15–20 minutes to the mouth of Atera Valley. You spend the day on a scenic walk along a beautiful well-kept road that follows the rushing water upstream, passing pool after pool where you can swim, some of which are deep enough to jump into from rocks 5–13+ feet high. It’s an incredibly peaceful and relaxing day filled with refreshing swims, rushing water and scenic views.Start your day with swimsuit under your clothes and bring water shoes or sandals (e.g. Tevas). Once there, you can rent e-bikes from a nearby parking lot, but we opted to walk instead. There is also a van that goes to/from nearby parking lots up the road.We had two of our best dinners of our trip in Nakatsugawa, including Waraidokoro Airo (笑処 あいろ), an obanzai place run by two smiling ladies, and Shabu Shabu Aoyagi (志ゃぶしゃぶ 青柳), a counter-only place run by an elderly couple. Both are limited capacity restaurants, so be sure to make a reservation once you get to Nakatsugawa (just stop by before dinner service starts or make a reservation for the next night).Be sure to bring cash, as many places in the Kiso Valley don't accept credit cards and local train stations don’t take Suica/IC cards.",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I am looking for some feedback on my upcoming 2nd trip to Japan. I've been doing planning and research for 3 weeks now, and this is my 5th version of the draft, you can see from the posts I've made what some of the previous version were.I will be travelling fromApril 7th to the 29th.  Now unfortunately I will have to do course work (Accounting)  during my trip, my options were to either mix school and travel, or not going to Japan for quite a while,  so on my spreadsheet, I split each day into a free day or a study day, I've given myself 2 free days per week, to allow me to enjoy some days without the expectation of studying.My plan with studying would be to wake up earlier, and do 1 hour revision, then get on with the rest of my day, start my day around 9-10am, then explore, eat lunch etc until, like 3-4pm, go back to my accommodation, shower and study for 2 hours, this also in a way acts like a forced break, and afterwards I would eat dinner, and maybe go sight see somewhere if I still wanted to go anywhere. I should also clarify this is not a university course.Example:https://imgur.com/a/GdxO0JZLastly, before I get into it, I feel like I should mention, I am basing this trip on 4 locations:Nagasaki, Yakushima, Takachiho Gorge, Kurokawa Onsen(Used to be Miyajima, but I decided to drop Hiroshima), so for example on a day like April 16th, where I am going to Kumamoto, if I don't feel like walking or just need rest then I am just going to skip the castle, I just thought I should mention that.With this trip I am trying to strike a balance between Nature/Food/City experiences, last time I was in Japan I didn't mind it, but it felt like I spent too much time in cities, and didn't really go outside to see the beautiful nature in Japan.Itinerary:April 8:Arrive in KIX at 12:35pm, take the limousine bus to Hotarugaike station, I want to stay close to the Itami airport, plus since I will have a checked bag, I don't really want to use the train system, so a bus seems good, I will probably just grab a bite to eat and chill for the rest of the day.April 9:Fly to Yakushima, arrival time should be around 1:10PM, I would've really wanted to fly on the 8th to save a day, however I learned that there's only 1 flight per day, and I can't make it, I think there's too much value to start in Yakushima, that even though I have to sacrifice one night, it's still worth it.  Upon arrival my goal is to just sort everything out, so pick up rental car, check in to my accommodation, I decided to stay in the Anbo area.April 10:Yakusugi Land - I haven't decided yet, but I am thinking about either the 80 min hike, or the 150 min hike, then head back, and eat dinner in the evening.April 11:Senpiro Falls ->  Oko-no-taki falls -> Hirauchi Kaichu onsen if possible.My main goal with this day, is to drive to the Oko-no-taki waterfall, and stop at anything interesting on the way to it.April 12:Shiratani Unsuikyo Gorge, I am giving myself 6 hours for this hike in total, I would like to do the Taikoiwa course, so go as far as Drum Rock, and go back afterwards, again not planning anything afterwards, probably just take a shower and grab dinner.April 13:Ferry to KagoshimaCheck out, give the car back as well. I would probably take the jetfoil ferry, to Kagoshima, depending on what time I arrive, I would like to go to the Meiji Restoration museum and Shiroyama Park at around sunset, however I could push something back if timing is an issue.April 14:KagoshimaSengan-en, is the main place I would like to go to on this day, and then probably just walk around and explore Kagoshima.April 15:KagoshimaIf the volcano is chill, then I would like to rent a bike and cycle around the volcano, if not I would probably explore a new area of Kagoshima that I haven't been to, maybe Kirishima?Also, food that I want to try while in Kagoshima: Black Pork, and Unagi at Eel Mitsuru if possibleApril 16:Bullet train to KumamotoKumamoto castle and the Suizenji Jojuen.  I would be alright with skipping the castle if I am not feeling super energetic.  I would like to check out the International Bar Detour that's in Kumamoto while I am there.April 17:Drive to Takachiho GorgePick up a rental car, and then drive to the Takachiho Gorge, afterwards head to Amanoiwato shrine, stay overnight in Takachiho, might grab soba for dinner at TENAN.April 18:Mt. Aso part 1Drive from Takachiho and on the way to Daikanbo lookout, stop by the Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu shrine. I would probably grab lunch/dinner at 溶岩石窯ピッツァ轍 or Wadachi Pizza, stay overnight in Aso town.April 19:Mt. Aso part 2 and drive to Kurokawa OnsenIf possible I think it would be fun to have the helicopter ride around Mt. Aso, afterwards I would hike the Kishimadake Trail, finally drive to Kurokawa Onsen, I would like to stay at Kurokawa Onsen Okunoyu, I might also check out the Shinmeikan Onsen.April 20:Kurokawa OnsenA day to relax, and onsen hop, I have some ideas for onsens that I might want to go to, such as: Yamabiko, Yamamizaki and maybe one more if I feel like I need more time to soak.April 21:Drive to FukuokaDrive to Kokonue Yume suspension bridge, I would like to be there around 11 amDrive around 1h30min to Fukuoka, I haven't looked into it, but I would like to give the car back around Hakata station if possible, check in, and try the Hakata style ramen at ShinShin Hataka DEITOSIf I have time, and if I don't feel dead, yet, I would like to walk around and explore the Fukuoka Gion district and see the Tochoji Temple.April 22:FukuokaUminonakamichi Seaside Park, I think it would be pretty nice to rent a bike and drive around.I might go to Canal City, or maybe just do some exploring and shopping, honestly the main reason why I am excited about Fukuoka is I've saved so many coffee shops, bars, and cafés that I want to go to.Maybe go to the Yatai food stalls in the Tenjin area,The CITADEL cocktail bar looks pretty cool as well.There's honestly so many places (restaurants, cafés, bars) I would like to go that it might be better to just provide a picture:https://imgur.com/a/BcoKFB2April 23:FukuokaNanzoin temple in the morning (9-10am)In the afternoon hours I would like to go to the teamLab Forest Fukuoka, Fukuoka city museum and finally Fukuoka tower, once it's dark outside.April 24:FukuokaExplore the Dazaifu area, go to the Dazaifu-tenmangu shrine, on the way back I might stop by the Life-Size Gundam statue near LaLa port.April 25:Train to NagasakiOn the way to Nagasaki I would really like to stop by the Yutoku Inari shrine, then keep going to Nagasaki, check in, pick up my forwarded luggage from Fukuoka, I am thinking about staying at the Forza hotel in Nagasaki, since it seems like quite a good location.April 26:NagasakiAtomic Bomb museumHypocenter ParkNagasaki Peace parkIn the evening, once it's darker, I would like to take the cable car to the Mt. Inasayama overlook.April 27:NagasakiMorning walk to Sofuku-Ji, since it's quite close to the hotel, if I do end up staying there.Dutch SlopeGlover GardenOura CathedralIn the evening, I would like to go to the Chinatown, to see the place lit up.While in Nagasaki, I would like to try Castella, Sasebo burger, Toruko rice, Kakuni Manju. Don't know how I feel about Champon.April 28:NagasakiI was planning to maybe go to the Mt.Unzen area, or go to Shimabara town, but I feel like I want to wind down and just stay in Nagasaki for my last full day, I might revisit some areas that I liked, e.g. Dejima or maybe just pick a new area and explore it.  One of my favourite things during the last trip was just walking the streets in the city, I especially liked Ueno, so I might do something similar, just appreciating the difference in everything compared to where I am from.April 29:Fly from Nagasaki to Osaka Itami, I was planning to maybe revisit a place I've been to during my last trip to Japan, but since it's the start of Golden Week, the thought of visiting something in Osaka during golden week, scares me a bit, so I would probably just take the limousine bus to KIX.",
