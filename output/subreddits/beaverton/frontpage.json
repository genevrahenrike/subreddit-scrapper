      "content_preview": "I just moved to Beaverton about 2 months ago and we moved into a house in one the high density housing areas. It's a neighborhood with those narrow houses that all look the same. Our neighbor has at least 4 cars and his household (4 people) keep partially blocking our driveway, claiming that they are allowed to block part of our driveway and the police won't do anything about it so don't bother calling. This morning we couldn't get out of our driveway because his household had 2 cars blocking our driveway - one on either side. I mean, I suppose we could technically get out of our driveway but we have to do a 30 point turn to get out. Very challenging and I'm a pretty solid driver but dang, that's unnecessarily difficult to not hit another car. This morning we asked him to move and he told us to call the police it's public parking. A couple of weeks ago he had agreed to not park in front of our house on one side of our driveway but I guess he changed his mind. We did not want to call the police. I come from a place where the police don't show up and if they do you don't want them there. But he has brought up the police with us a couple of times now so we thought why not?  We called the police and they came in like 15 minutes (!!!) and made them move one of the cars and told them not to park there anymore. No ticket, no tow, just made them move their car. That worked great for us. However, 2 hours later the same car is parked in the same exact spot. This seems like our neighbor is messing with us now, right? We called the police again and a different cop came out this time, also in about 15 minutes (so fast!) and said he didn't want to have to go to court so he didn't want to write a report and he left. That's the kind of police I'm used to! Ahhhh, just like home. I just need to be able to get out of my driveway. My neighbor bragged to us about how he has battled with other neighbors he deems uncooperative over where he parks his cars so I'm not sure if he's dumb or crazy or what. He seemed chill when we met him but I don't know why he wants to block our driveway so bad, thus creating unnecessary beef with us. We like to get along with our neighbors. This is stupid. So, does anyone have any suggestions? I'm more interested in peace than retribution.",

I think he is catasrophizing the experience so I want to take him out to a big open field or empty parking lot so he can drive around in circles to see how he is with it. If he's still really bad with it then we know for sure and can put the issue to rest. If not then maybe I can get him to learn how to drive. He still may not want to learn and that's fine, too. I just felt that he should have some experience so he knows what it's like. I don't mind driving a bit out of the way for this. I've got podcasts to listen to while on the road. Edit: Thanks for all the replies! You've given me several places to go check out. I really appreciate it. 😄",

      "content_preview": "Three officers tackled a shirtless man experiencing a mental health crisis onto the asphalt today at the intersection of dogwood and saltzman right beside the leedy grange. One officer was kneeling on his back multiple times for several minutes at a time and even rolled him upside down onto his neck and head as they tackled him. One officer had his leg against the man’s head on the pavement for a few minutes until screaming onlookers made him stop. It’s 85 degrees outside right now so the pavement is at least 100 degree, but could be up to 130 degrees. He repeatedly screamed his mother’s name: Robin Louise O’Brady or Robin Louisa Brady. At 2:45 paramedics showed up and they restrained him to a stretcher and took him away. This is not the first time Wash Co PD has brutalized a person experiencing a mental health crisis before and it is a wholly inappropriate response to someone needing medical and crisis help. They need to be held accountable for this disgusting behavior. FTP Edit: it was the Washington county sheriff, not PD.",

You literally cannot move more than two lights at a time in either direction.  The light at Loon is going to be red.  The light at the top of the hill, where one single car triggers the light, is usually red.  Nevermind the disaster around Murray Scholls.  Davies, the one street that actually could use a quicker light, is fortunately usually green.  But after that, good lord.  It's so bad now the traffic at North Dakota can't get through the light at Boones Bend, so you have a backup at BOTH lights, right in front of Whole Foods.  Of course, the church gets their own light, and then it backs up from Nimbus.  Absolutely beyond ridiculous.  Maybe a flow of traffic study?  Something?  It's absolutely ridiculous for an alleged State Highway.",

Estimates: - Les Schwab -  is $1,300 ~ $1,700 (difference is premium vs regular struts) - Middleton Motors - $2,200 -- they're always on the higher end, but I've had good service here otherwise - Honda Beaverton - $1,400 -- i'm always leery to hit the dealership. Anyway, I have my options but just want to hear your input if you've have solid strut work done elsewhere. Thanks for reading and hope you're having a great Monday!",

If you own an untrained, not-collared giant Pit Bull / Rottweiler mix, your teenagers let the dog out into the neighborhood tonight and it proceeded to jump on, and drew blood, from several people in the neighborhood closest to Catlin Gabel including a three-year-old boy. Someone finally got him on a leash. When your teens came up the street calling his name, we met them and asked why the dog didn’t have a collar, and they said, “he only has a shock collar”. So to the owners of this dog I say this:  1. You suck,  2. You are irresponsible pet owners, and.  3. if this ever happens again, we will capture and re-home your dog to better owners. Did I mention that you absolutely suck?",

      "content_preview": "I’m putting together a list of bar trivia nights around Beaverton and nearby (embedded below). I run trivia at an area bar and am curious what else folks here have experienced that stands out. Most places I’ve seen use the classic model — host reads questions, teams scribble answers on paper, and the highest score at the end wins (kind of like Geeks Who Drink). That works well enough, but I’m especially interested if anyone knows of places experimenting with different formats. I'm trying to get some ideas of how folks with unique or independent models are able to engage new players while retaining their base. The main issue with our trivia, as far as I can tell, is that it can be overwhelming for new players because of its faster pace and unique format. So — does anyone know of other bars that break from the traditional pen-and-paper model? I would love to see them for myself and learn from how they're managing their games. https://preview.redd.it/unusual-bar-trivia-games-in-beaverton-and-the-portland-metro-v0-mal80pswp0mf1.png (Edited to remove any identifying information about our trivia. I've done this voluntarily to assuage a user who questioned whether this was a veiled advertisement or an earnest attempt to learn about other trivia nights in the area.)",

The good: she charges way too little. $600 per month, but she’s thinking about raising her rates. She’s very good with the kids, never seen her have a bad day. Meals provided. The ok: it’s no Montessori school, but there’s also no TV. Lots of play and a bit of structure, but not early education per se. Great hours 7-6 The bad: she has an elderly dog, and honestly he stinks. My kids cloths can stink from the dog. I’m totally cool with it, a little dog stank is good for a kid… but it’s there.

I don't get down to southeast of Tualatin much, since Lee's Farms was the only other place I knew within semi-convenient driving distance, but it appears they no longer make their own fresh cider, they just sell manufactured, pasteurized stuff from who knows where. It seems like the only other thing I see that is semi-local is PSU Farmers Market, but I am not really physically up for driving downtown, finding parking, and shuffling through a crowded farmers market to find something I'm not even sure is there. Is there anywhere on the west side that sells seasonal fresh-pressed cider anymore?",

      "content_preview": "Update: I have chosen SAC. I visited BAC, west hills, and SAC. BAC felt pretty corporate like Villa did, so I’m good on that for now. West hills was nice but there were kids running around in the gym and cardio deck and at one point I thought injury was inevitable. Just don’t want that stress while I’m training. Plus they do only have one squat rack and no squat bars (knurling in the middle for traction). SAC felt much more like an old school YMCA but better funded/managed. Their facility is gigantic and everyone is super friendly. They also have the all new one off Barnes that is adults only. Overall, I found SAC to have the best vibe, value for cost, and good location. Hi everyone, historically I’ve gone to VillaSport because I can literally walk there but ever since slipping on mold in the women’s spa lounge area (hitting tile full-force is not fun, and I’m in my 20s so I can’t imagine what would have happened if I were an elderly lady), I decided I need to find a new gym. I’ve just been going to planet fitness but I find I really do need heat therapies (sauna, steam room). I wanted to hear from folks who are members of both places. What is the atmosphere like? Is equipment hogged, are there kids running around unsupervised in adult-only areas, how is cleanliness, etc. I can’t find any info on bringing guests to SAC occasionally; I have one gym buddy that pops up every few weeks so I’d just pay for a day pass. I know BAC does day passes but idk about SAC allowing members to bring guests. Also how is management/staff? Do they keep unruly members in line or do they smile and nod and do nothing? Are they welcoming, etc. I know I can tour these places and I will, but what they show you/how they treat you on the tour and what the daily vibe is like…those are two different things. Just looking for people’s experiences. TYIA!! Edit: I have a few people asking about lifetime and the answer is that while I could pay $300 a month for that, I’d rather have a cheaper place and be able to feed my street taco addiction.",
