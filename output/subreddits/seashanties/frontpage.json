      "content_preview": "It just amazes me how genuine their original songs sound, at least to me. You’d never think a song was original unless you listened closely to the lyrics or specifically checked the credits. For example, Brisbane Harbour feels like a perfect capstan song. Or Shiloh! It *has* to be an 18th-century ballad! Even Roll Northumbria — the lyrics give it away, but still. And recently I got stuck on Bay of Suvla; it could be as authentic a Great War song as It’s a Long Way to Tipperary. I can’t wait for their new release in September. The only songs they’ve shown so far are polka and tarantella, which are great, but I’m sure there’ll be some quality shanties too, whether traditional or original.",

We usually meet for a pre-sing beer at a Bath Road pub, Bath Road Beers for preference but it can be busy with the quiz every other Thursday.  If anyone from Cheltenham or the surrounding areas would like to come along and join us, please do so.

His phone got wiped after he passed- so I can't find any of his music but I feel like I'm going crazy looking for this song! It was about these guys on a ship who had a bunch (maybe millions) of stuff on it. I've done my research and it looks like the obvious answer is Irish Rover but I swear it's not that! I remember it being super faced paced and almost inaudible due to accent but each verse got faster. I'm sorry if that isn't enough information to find it. Thank you :)",
