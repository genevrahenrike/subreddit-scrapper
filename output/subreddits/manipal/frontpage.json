      "content_preview": "Alright, buckle up, because this is the most dramatic thing that‚Äôs happened to me this semester. So, on 20th August , I went to FC-1 for dinner, around 9:15 PM. It was raining, so I parked my umbrella in that little stand inside. Fast forward to 9:40 PM, I‚Äôm done eating, walk out, and boom ‚Äî umbrella gone. Vanished. I even informed security, drafted a whole email (yes, a formal email, receipts and all), but deep down I had given up. Cut to 26th August , Ganesh Chaturthi eve. FC-1 is serving cholle and pooris , and obviously the line was long . I‚Äôm standing there, dreaming of pooris, and then I see it ‚Äî my umbrella . Same design, same scratches, the whole deal, in the hands of some random guy in a group of juniors. Now, I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene mid-queue, so I had my dinner first (priorities). Kept an eye on him the whole time to make sure he didn‚Äôt leave. After washing up, I gathered all my courage, walked up, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, ‚ÄúHey, can I see that umbrella for a second?‚Äù Checked for the initials I had marked on it. They were there. My anger went from 0 to 100 real quick. Told him straight up, ‚ÄúBruh, this is my umbrella.‚Äù And what does he do? Blames his friend. And then, with a straight face, says, ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have kept it in the umbrella stand.‚Äù I swear I almost lost it, but his friends stepped in like, ‚ÄúChill bro, you got your umbrella, just leave it.‚Äù And honestly, it was me vs. 5-6 of them, so I decided to cut my losses, grabbed my umbrella, and walked away. So yeah, after a week-long FC-1 umbrella mystery, justice has been served. Moral of the story? Mark your umbrellas. People will straight-up gaslight you about your own stuff . And FC-1 is apparently the Wild West for umbrellas. Edit: Y'all are wild for the takes, lol. For everyone coming at me, I was at Annapoorna and FC-2 for two years and never had a problem leaving my umbrella in the stand. Guess FC-1 is the final boss of umbrella theft.",

When we took it up to the higher authorities, we were told that nothing could be done about it because the marks completely lies in the hands of the coordinator. Due to these circumstances, a lot of our CGPA dropped which in turn reflected on our report cards. if anyone from MAHE is reading this, i have nothing but respect for you and your institution, but please do take the students seriously once in a while as it does reflect poorly towards your institution as well.",
