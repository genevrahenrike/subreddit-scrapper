      "content_preview": "Hi all. I am almost 19 (F) and I‚Äôve had acne since I was about 15. My skin has gone through all the stages and it alternates from rlly bad to rlly good to idek. When I went to college I had a really simple skin care routine and the main acne treatment I was using was the ordinary azelic acid 10%. My skin LOVED this so much my skin was basically clear. I got a new blush that I thought was non-comedogenic but unfortunately found out 2 months later it was what was breaking me out. Stopped using it, tried to get back to my old routine but my skin was super irritated and breaking out like crazy. Finally had enough and wanted to go on accutane. Doctor said try spiro (50mg/perday) first cause you‚Äôve never been on it. I‚Äôve been now on it for 2 weeks and well I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs working. The first few days my skin felt a lot smoother and then now I‚Äôm getting breakouts (on my jaw and chin which i never breakout on usually and that‚Äôs what spiro is supposed to help w anyways so idk if it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúpurge‚Äù). I would like to preface I am using my ordinary gel again only at night so lmk if I should stop using that or if there‚Äôs anything else. All my makeup is free of pore cloggers and I wash my brushes occasionally as well as my sheets and pillow cases. Also, I have dry skin and another thing my diet doesn‚Äôt break me out. Please help I‚Äôm really discouraged about new pimples when I was told that you‚Äôre not supposed to break out on spiro but other ppl say to give it time.",

      "content_preview": "okay so i have had a lot of trouble with skincare for acne over the last few years due to allergic reactions and sensitive skin. i started with curology and i liked it but it wasn‚Äôt enough so i tried some other things that i can‚Äôt remember. eventually i tried differin and it worked well but the day time moisturizer had sunscreen which burned my eyes and face. i have had many troubles with moisturizer because cream moisturizers don‚Äôt go into my skin? like they make my face sticky and it lasts all day so i try to stick with gel moisturizers. i started using clinique 100hr moisture surge and that worked really well. the only problem with the moisture surge is that its $36 for the smallest container. recently for my birthday in july, my mom got me the clinique acne care set but it made my acne a lot worse and my skin red and itchy. my mom said i was probably allergic to it so i went back to differin. since we decided that i am allergic to clinique, i decided to use the curology gel moisturizer again since i remember liking it but it isn‚Äôt intense enough to combat the differin and my skin is really dry and peeling. should i try to use the clinique again since i didn‚Äôt really have any problems with it until the other stuff? or can someone give me allergen/sensitive skin friendly moisturizers that aren‚Äôt sticky but still work? pls someone help üòû",

I haven't been able to walk out my door today. I was going to. I put on my makeup and everything but then I saw myself in the mirror and the acne wasnt hidden enough. I panicked and I just couldnt leave. It makes me miserable really and I feel guilty because I dont know what I did wrong for my face to flare up. I am doing better than I used to. I used to need to leave class every so often to go check in the bathroom my face. I used to take a hundred pictures of my face a day to check it under every angle (I try to stop but the habit creeps up on me in times like now). I met a psychiatrist a while ago and he diagnosed me with Body dysmorphic disorder. I understand what it means but I don't know what to do about it. I just don't really have anyone to talk to. I dont have a therapist, nor can afford one. My family and my boyfriend do try their best but they are sick and tired of me going full shutdown mode over pimples. They say there is nothing much on my face but I feel like they are lying and it's upsetting to me. I know they mean well but it feels like they're saying I'm making myself miserable on purpose. I try really hard you know. I guess I just am wondering about you guys. If anyone feels the same. If you have any tricks you use when you feel bad like this.",

      "content_preview": "So about a year and a half ago I started getting acne, and my dermatologist put me on some antibiotics for a few months along with tretinoin. It ended up working and my skin became very clear, but after I stopped the antibiotics, I had a month where my skin was still clear just for my acne to come back worse than before.  After the antibiotics, my derm prescribed me a benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin topical cream to put on during the day and more tretinoin at night. I would also wash my face with a salicylic acid foaming clenser in the shower twice a day. But with my acne this bad, I stopped using the salicylic acid because I don't want it to be too harsh on my skin, but I'm still using the tretinoin every night, putting vaseline on right after, washing my face in the morning, and putting benzoyl peroxide on with some moisturizer. But my acne is still getting worse. Idk what else I could possibly do to fix it, I change my pillow cases at least once a week, stopped sleeping on my stomach, don't touch my face, use a very sensitive shaving razor that doesn't shave close to the skin, apply aftershave regularly, idk what else I could do to get rid of it. I don't wanna go on acutane because I dont want the side effects, but everything I've tried results in basically no change.I also get these bad ingrown hairs in my beard area even when I go a long time without shaving despite me exfoliating regularly and using aftershave for a couple days after a shave.",

Also I used to have some hormonal cheek acne not horrible but still rough and I‚Äôve gotten most of my scarring gone from tretinoin, but I still feel like there‚Äôs some lingering discoloration and I just want to have clear cheeks with 0 makeup on itüò≠that‚Äôs it thank you!",

I just started on Yaz a little over a month ago- def got two white heads but nothing much. The thing is, I'm still on the spirno (25 mg). Do you guys think I should stay on the Yaz for 3 months then go off the spirno? I've heard that's how long it takes for some people. Do you think I need to taper off the spirno? Really would hate for all of that acne to come back but I've read the Yaz has a decent chance of working since I'm just on 25.",

      "content_preview": "As the title says, I'm a 28yo male, and have suffered with acne since I started puberty, and after all these years it's still persistent and won't go away. I'm currently trying Adapalene 0.1% at night, and 4% Benzoyl Peroxide during the day with a La Roche Posay Niamicide moisturizer for both. When I was in high school I was on Minocycline and it worked wonders, and I'm at my wits end dealing with this. It's mainly on my cheeks, chin, and nose and consist of black heads, white heads, and cystic acne. I don't know what else to do. I'm pretty sure I'm purging from the Adapalene currently as it's only been a few weeks, but it's very red and inflammatory, is this normal for Adapalene? I've never tried Adapalene before so I'm hoping this routine will work for me. Any advice or stories from products or other options would be great. Thank you.",

No one liked me in high school or even college.
