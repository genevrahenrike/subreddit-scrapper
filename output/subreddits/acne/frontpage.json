      "content_preview": "hi everyone. please be nice i know i was being a freaking idiot i rly regret it and all i need is help rn i already know i made a mistake. i need help with my skin rly bad. basically i used the peter thomas roth sulfur face mask on a really small under the skin pimple that i noticed on my face. i reached for that because sulfur masks usually get the job done rly fast and i rly love that face mask. so that night I decided to use it one night without checking the expiration date because I’m dumb and turns out it expired in April. and now my skin is extremely flaky and itchy all over. I’m breaking out i have 5 super painful deep pimples and I don’t really know what to do here and I even have a lot of red spots and small pimples on my forehead which i haven’t had since i was like 15.  my skin was fairly clear before because I’m seeing an esthi. she put me on the acne free Boot Camp program where I use benzoyl peroxide every night and mandelic acid in the morning — that completely cleared my skin. I had some scars and some texture after starting that, but my skin was very clear and i messed it all up. I start school in two weeks and I’m freaking out. I don’t know if I can clear this up because some of the pimples are still under the skin and haven’t come to head yet. do I just focus on skin barrier for now do I stop all my actives? can i spot treat w my benzoyl peroxide? When do you guys think this will clear up? I don’t have pictures to show because I don’t wanna show my face but help me.",

Currently all my marks are black/dark brown. I tried using The Ordinary niacinimide 10% + zinc, however I felt this did nothing. After some research I see that azelaic acid might be best for pigmentation, however I’m not sure. I would really appreciate some help in forming a routine, specifically products from The Ordinary to treat my dark marks / pigmentation. Which acids are best and how should I layer everything?",

When I went to college I had a really simple skin care routine and the main acne treatment I was using was the ordinary azelic acid 10%. My skin LOVED this so much my skin was basically clear. I got a new blush that I thought was non-comedogenic but unfortunately found out 2 months later it was what was breaking me out. Stopped using it, tried to get back to my old routine but my skin was super irritated and breaking out like crazy. Finally had enough and wanted to go on accutane. Doctor said try spiro (50mg/perday) first cause you’ve never been on it. I’ve been now on it for 2 weeks and well I don’t feel like it’s working. The first few days my skin felt a lot smoother and then now I’m getting breakouts (on my jaw and chin which i never breakout on usually and that’s what spiro is supposed to help w anyways so idk if it’s just a “purge”). I would like to preface I am using my ordinary gel again only at night so lmk if I should stop using that or if there’s anything else. All my makeup is free of pore cloggers and I wash my brushes occasionally as well as my sheets and pillow cases. Also, I have dry skin and another thing my diet doesn’t break me out. Please help I’m really discouraged about new pimples when I was told that you’re not supposed to break out on spiro but other ppl say to give it time.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone,I (19F) have had different types of acne since I was a young teen, and over the years I've tried lots of topical treatments with varying grades of success. Three years ago, I started visiting an esthetician who did extractions on my face every 2 weeks ($100 per session, so... yeah it's a lot) and after the first year she also did the dermapen to help with scarring.The thing is, this whole time my skincare routine has consisted of mainly these three products:Natinuel Face Cleansing Gel (AHA-BHA 9%) (with Glycolic, Salicylic, Azelaic Acid and B-Dermin)Natinuel SEBA 12 Face Fluid (AHA-BHA 12%) (with Azelaic and Salicylic Acid, Vit. PP-AHA's) (ONLY AT NIGHT)Natinuel Hydra-Moist Face Cream (TEWL Normalizing) (MORNING + NIGHT)For a while now, I stopped using the cleanser in the morning because I felt my skin super dull and dry, so I only cleaned it with water or CeraVe's Moisturizing Cleanser.Because of summer break, I haven't gone to get an extraction for this past month and so my acne has returned (also due to more sweating and the weather being warmer) and that has made me rethink if maybe there are other options. I'm looking into going to the dermatologist (either via public healthcare or private).I'm also following an anti-inflammatory diet and implementing foods rich in omega-3 and do sports every day. So, I'd say I have a pretty healthy lifestyle. And, of course, I know the basic hygiene tips relating to acne (change your pillowcases, don't touch your face, don't put your phone on your face, drink lots of water...smh)The esthetician told me that given how my skin is, I should resign myself and do extractions and treatments for life. But during this break I started looking into acne related skincare and... have I been gaslit? Aren't these amounts of acids too much? Shouldn't I have more hydrating/moisturizing products to protect my skin barrier? Why isn't she telling me to wear sunscreen every day? Every time that I've told her that my skin is dry and really dull and sometimes even flaky but as the day progresses it gets really oily, I have been dismissed. She always told me to ONLY use the products I mentioned above (which she gave me).I was planning on leaving her after the appointment we had scheduled after summer break, and after this I'm sure I'm not going back. My skin has improved a lot, specially the hormonal acne and scarring on my cheeks (which was so so awful and painful!), but this last year I haven't seen any noticeable changes. I feel like I'm wasting time and money.Any thoughts and/or advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",
