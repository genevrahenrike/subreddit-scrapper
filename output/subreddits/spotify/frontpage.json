Free in the app store at: https://apps.apple.com/app/id6746056385 The premise is: Have you heard every #1 song on the BillBoard Hot 100, from 1958 to present day.  Most people have not, lol.  This app helps you track your progress and earn badges along the way.  Sometimes the badges are obvious (like completing the 1960's) and others are hidden/mysterious, like what's the only James Bond theme song to hit #1. It combines my love for music and collecting stuff (even if digitally).  The songs all have artwork and loads of information to help you explore while you listen and mark off songs. Again it's free to download and check out.  You can pretty much use the entire app for free, the first 5 marking of songs heard is free and then it's just 5 bucks (once, no membership) to have unlimited marking of songs. Hope you might check it out and if you enjoy, leave a rating/review for me (even if you don't do the in-app purchase), I'm always looking for feedback negative or positive. All the decades (1950s - 2020s) have playlists built into the app, and one main \"all #1s\" playlist for Spotify as well, for example: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/010ZEBjTwhaQTcYSQ4rDB7",

Any tips or recommendations? A couple of notes: •\tI don’t like reggaeton. •\tI enjoy rock and heavy metal, but most of the time I’ll be listening while driving, and those genres often feel a bit too heavy for that.
