Would love to hear songs and artists like: Cut Copy, Digitalism and Capital Cities would be nice to hear too. Would love to hear more \"electronic and melodic stuff\".When it comes to Pop try to avoid the most mainstream songs, unless you think it's somethings that's really worth checking out. Would love to hear songs and artists like: Miike Snow or Paramore (Told you so & Hard Times)When it comes to Rock and indie rock, there's pretty much no bounds other than please try avoiding 'sad and slow\" songs. And try to go for more \"upbeat\" and hard hitting ones.  Would love to hear songs and artists like: Two Door Cinema Club, Foals , Circa Waves or Battle Tapes.That's it. Do your thing.",

Any tips or recommendations?A couple of notes: •\tI don’t like reggaeton. •\tI enjoy rock and heavy metal, but most of the time I’ll be listening while driving, and those genres often feel a bit too heavy for that.Thanks in advance for any ideas!",
