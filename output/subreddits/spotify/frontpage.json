Would love to hear songs and artists like: Cut Copy, Digitalism and Capital Cities would be nice to hear too. Would love to hear more \"electronic and melodic stuff\".When it comes to Pop try to avoid the most mainstream songs, unless you think it's somethings that's really worth checking out. Would love to hear songs and artists like: Miike Snow or Paramore (Told you so & Hard Times)When it comes to Rock and indie rock, there's pretty much no bounds other than please try avoiding 'sad and slow\" songs. And try to go for more \"upbeat\" and hard hitting ones.  Would love to hear songs and artists like: Two Door Cinema Club, Foals , Circa Waves or Battle Tapes.That's it. Do your thing.",

On top of that, I’ve always been terrible at remembering lyrics (but that’s another story).Now I’d like to start getting into music (I’ve got Spotify Premium), but I struggle to find songs I genuinely enjoy.How do you usually discover music that clicks with you? Any tips or recommendations?A couple of notes: •\tI don’t like reggaeton. •\tI enjoy rock and heavy metal, but most of the time I’ll be listening while driving, and those genres often feel a bit too heavy for that.Thanks in advance for any ideas!",

Here are some tips to help you work (or, you know, not work) from pretty much wherever (home, highways, canyons, etc.). If you want to work from wherever, you need a reliable, expansive network. T-Mobile’s got that and tons of other travel-perfect perks ready for you.DIGITAL NOMAD-ING: A HOW-TO GUIDE1. Lock in a reliable remote connection:Surprise surprise, the first tip in a T-Mobile post is about your network. BUT... stay with us. It’s first because the whole ‘digital nomad’ thing is all about staying connected while you’re traveling. T-Mobile keeps you online with the largest,fastest, and most advanced network available. Just one of the reasons people are calling us the Best Network (officially) according to Ookla® Speedtest®.12.Treat your car like your child (because it basically is):When you’re living the nomad lifestyle, your car is your castle. Your sacred place. Your literal window to the world. Be sure you stay up-to-date on maintenance, keep that gas tank full, and have a first-aid kit in your trunk. Nice-to-know: You can get a year of AAA on us when you switchto T-Mobile, just in case you’re so focused on nature’s beauty that you forget to fill up.23. ABPFAP (always be prepared for a picnic):There are beautiful, stunning, totally-take-your-breath-away views out there just waiting to be… viewed. Make sure you’ve got a picnic go-bag in your trunk (blanket, cards, snacks, maybe even a …cooler?). With more 5Ginterstate highway miles on T-Mobile than with any other provider,3it’s easy to track down hidden gems on your route where picnics seem to grow on trees.4. Catching Zzzs:Sleeping under the stars or in a tent can be serene. It can also quite literally break your back. Every now and then, you’ll want to sprinkle in a night somewhere that has a bed and a shower. Good thing you can save up to 40% on hotels and car rentals as a T-Mobile member.41 Based on analysis by Ookla of Speedtest Intelligence® data 1H 2025.
