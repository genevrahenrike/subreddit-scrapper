Today we are happy to announce a new version of the fheroes2 game engine - 1.1.10 ( https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.10 )! This update brings several art enhancements, Editor fixes, and more! This release includes multiple improvements to the Editor . First, the team fixed several crashes related to reaching the object placement limit. We also resolved a few passability and rendering issues. Lastly, the Castle‚Äôs options window now supports canceling all changes made there. https://preview.redd.it/fheroes2-version-1-1-10-has-been-released-v0-i06xdlzixlgf1.png The team reworked several in-game dialogs, updated buttons for various languages, made buttons resizable in many cases, and fixed font inconsistencies. We also added sorting for save files by name or date, and introduced an icon for the Virtual Keyboard button. https://preview.redd.it/fheroes2-version-1-1-10-has-been-released-v0-1qvm01ckxlgf1.png https://preview.redd.it/fheroes2-version-1-1-10-has-been-released-v0-aphs5ebmxlgf1.png This release features numerous art updates. The Magic Book now shows a visual indicator when no pages are available. We fixed white pixels in the Sorceress castle sky and rainbow , and added missing bay artwork for the Wizard castle . Additionally, we improved the Swordsman's walking animation by adding a new frame. https://preview.redd.it/fheroes2-version-1-1-10-has-been-released-v0-o4kdw2unxlgf1.png https://preview.redd.it/fheroes2-version-1-1-10-has-been-released-v0-0tn9mwtnxlgf1.png https://preview.redd.it/fheroes2-version-1-1-10-has-been-released-v0-jvz0rxtnxlgf1.png Alongside these changes, the team updated translations for several languages, resolved more issues on the Adventure Map, and closed over 40 issues since the last release. As a nice bonus, we have included a new community-made map in the fheroes2 bundle: Good, Bad, Magne , and we updated the Eruption map in the bundle. We hope you enjoy the updated version of the engine. Thank you so much for supporting the project!",

It is easy to navigate, you can find whatever you want to know easily, and can go to relevant topics. There is even a User Commentary (that is hidden by default) that gives some additional insight on some creatures and such. So I wonder, is there any similar site that I could use for Heroes 4? I played Heroes 4 long ago, never been good at it, but I recently installed it again and would be nice to know more about creatures, buildings, artifacts, skills etc., maybe even a few tips here and there (like which dwelling is usually recommended for a town). I only found the Might & Magic Fandom wiki , but I don't find that as neatly structured as the Heroes 3 wiki I mentioned. Any recommendations? Thanks!",

The Switch 2 isn't a powerhouse but I bet that the game could run fairly decent, even if there had to be some sacrifices. However, the biggest reason is the actual mouse support which the console offers with it's controllers that can be put down sideways. It works really well with Civ7 (for a console at least). Having HoMM on the go or just using the controls on your TV would be great. Most people play on a laptop for mobile experience but damn it would be neat on the Switch 2.",

Also, I feel like the animations, like the attack animations of creatures or the animations when they get attacked kind of suck. Most creatures look like ratched animals or homeless people to me. The sound effects are lackluster too. The animations when the hero casts a spell are hideous and look like I am playing a game from 1999 on a nintendo. I did not like the music of the game either. Overall, I feel like this game has 0 atmosphere or soul, which is a shame because I wanted to like it. For me gameplay wise it is ok so far, but Am I the only one turned off by the visuals + sounds?

I didn't want him to accompany me into the next phase over my preist so I dismissed him. Now I see that there is a purple gate, and the last remaining red player behind it. The keymaster tent is saying bring me Proetho and he'll let me pass, but I already deleted him. What can I do? I mean if the hero is integral to progress then they should never allow you to dismiss them in the first place...",

I have some experience in making simple mods for myself (Battletech amd MechWarrior 5), but I do not have any background in programming. Before getting into the game, I wonder whether I could add a new hero, or edit name/attributes/skills/portrait of an existing hero. From my search, I found that there are some packing/unpacking tools or something, but I am not sure whether adding/editing a hero could be done with these tools. Could you provide some advice on whether and how I can add or edit a hero? Thanks in advance!",
