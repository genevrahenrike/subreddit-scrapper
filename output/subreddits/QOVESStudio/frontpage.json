      "content_preview": "I have read many stories of negative, neutral, and sometimes positive outcomes of wisdom teeth removal. I understand many people are in different development situations and it may contribute to post removal developments. A major theme I see in these stories is that the jaw seems to want to re-adjust to the new pressures caused by the lack of wisdom teeth, and this may promote major jaw movement/change. Since I am 17 with impacted wisdom teeth, I was wondering what decision I should make. I have read some people choose to get their teeth removed later as it means the jaw will change less since it has finished developing, at the cost of a worse recovery and possibly greater damage. On the contrary, people have said its better to get them out earlier as its a lot easier, at the cost of the jaw shifting and becoming narrow. One view I have not heard is utilizing the change that can happen after getting wisdom teeth removed at a young age to correct/widen the jaw. My theory is that since wisdom teeth removal at a young age can lead to negative change, potentially the opposite can be achieved. Maybe if someone is doing nothing to support the jaw post removal, it will simply become narrow or poor-shaped. If there was some kind of way to support the jaw outwards it could widen. I have mouth breathed for the majority of my life and only practiced proper breathing and posture and everything a few years ago. My facial development is alright so far but I have always had slightly a narrow jaw. If I were to get my teeth removed early, and did something to support widening of the jaw, maybe it would be an opportunity to widen the jaw? Just an idea I had. If anyone has any ideas I'm willing to test them by taking photos and showing progress photos.",

I mean, some actors like Jake Gyllenhaal looks way better with a stubble than when shaved. Then there are people like Brad Pitt, the man could easily go shaved or with a goatee without any problem. I saw a reel of Chico the other day where he was shaving his face. In the while,  he was showing how he would look with a goatee or a moustache, the former wasn't that great, while the latter suited him more, yet we know the best, for chico, is clean shaved. But so here's my doubt, how do you determine what's the good facial hair on a face without making it less appealing?",

      "content_preview": "So I guess if you spent enough time researching, more or less by now, you're aware of the anatomy, sociology and psychology regarding facial aesthetics such as: -you know about the concept of facial harmony -you're aware of universal vs cultural/regional beauty standards (including the associated racism/colorism/colonialism) -you can pinpoint why someone looks (un)attractive / average (not to be confused with computer-generated average, aka averag ed ) -you're aware of cognitive biases of lookism (halo effect / horn effect / contrast effect / cheerleader effect / projection / cherry-picking / confirmation bias / etc.) -you can consciously observe/experience lookism offline / online / on yourself -you're aware of camera lens distortion and recognize edited pictures -you recognize if someone had cosmetic procedures Now my question: What impact has all this knowledge and awareness on you so far, for better or worse? =============== My own 2 cents: As for me, I feel quite mixed... Positive effects: +From a pure pragmatic view, I started to learn about proper skincare, exercising and nutrition which improved my overall health and appearance +Psychologically, I'd say I'm now more \"immune\" as I try not to fall for the above-mentioned biases, especially when I don't know someone well enough (although as cynical as this sounds, I've always been somewhat skeptical towards attractive-looking people, as growing up, I could already observe how they tend to stick with each other and get away with many things less attractive people couldn't) +I was able to heal from my body image issues that affected my formative years (I wrote about this more in detail in another post) Negative effects: -Spending a lot of time researching about facial aesthetics that I should have spent for other important topics -Unvoluntarily stumbling upon toxic online spaces (including reddit); At least, as a lurker and rare commenter, I now know which ones to avoid and can dissociate myself from the negativity -Realizing how unfair the world actually is (as a kid/teen, I had naively thought everything is going to improve with time but I guess lookism will always stay the same or gets even worse with social media) Negative effects I could observe on others (more likely those who are still insecure / not content about their own looks or other aspects of their life that might intersect with lookism): -Overanalysing / overthinking -Projecting their insecurities on other people -Depression / anger issues, e.g. after learning that their flaws can't be improved -Falling into negativity spiral (further amplifying and giving in to the toxic/absolutist/defeatist side of lookism)",

In the show and in motion I think they’re genuinely so attractive, but when I look up pictures of them I realize they all look so incredibly mid in still pictures compared to how they look on the show, even though I find them super attractive in motion. as opposed to like top level celebrities and models who look amazing in both pictures and in motion. do you think for most attractive people who are still within average range, aka nothing super duper special but still good looking, do they tend to look better in motion rather than in still photos? I feel like a lot of people in the top levels of attractiveness have the right bone structure to where they always look amazing whether in photos or in motion. whereas for more normal good looking people, it’s not just their looks but it’s also things like body language, facial expressions, their voice, mannerisms, etc. that add to their attractiveness. things that can’t be captured on camera accurately.",

Some commenter replied with something like \"other women are mean to you.\" I found this comment to be confusing, because while I'm sure you got jealous women acting cold or cruel to you, you know intersexual competition, the evidence tends to show that good looking people get treated better. You can look this up and it'll tell you that good looking people get treated better, and the real world examples I've witnessed tends to prove that. The pretty hot woman in my work was liked by everyone, no one treated her poorly or was cold to her. She was so liked that the boss would want to hang with her during lunch, the boss was a woman in her late 30s  with 3 kids, this coworker was in her early 20s. Why did this older woman care to hang out with such a young woman? Because she has that beauty halo that gravitates people, even women. And in every case I never met a hot, pretty, or beautiful woman that was unpopular, they seem to be favored by both men and women. And I've never witnessed a case where one woman is being cold or hostile to some beautiful woman. I understand it happens but nowhere near the level where they gain favoritism and adoration from everyone.",

      "content_preview": "I’m just wondering as I have a bit of extra fat towards the outside corner of my eyes that hang down a bit. It’s not the typical hooded eyes that let’s say Nina dobrev had when she was younger where the fat was on both the inside and outside. She is the main culprit people generally think of when saying an upper Bleph ages you. I think there are of course other factors that come into play Hooded eyes sag as you age but for some the fat just goes away which is beneficial for aging as your eyes hollow out. I’m trying to understand as referring back to my first sentence the outer corner of my eye has a bit of extra fat but it seems that it naturally sags more and always has since I was a child, I’m 20. I’ve looked into blephs but the results seem to go either way.",
