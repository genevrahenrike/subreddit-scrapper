I'm hoping to find 1-2 roommates and rent out a house that would be within a 30ish minute commute to Long Beach and rent <$2000 per person. work : I will be working onsite 4-5 days a week right by the LGB airport. Ideally my commute is under 30 minutes. neighborhood : Still TBD, but ideally in the South Bay area. I will have a car, but I would like to live in a semi walkable area. Ideally this would mean there is a coffee shop, restaurant, bar, and store all within walking distance (1 mile?). Living by a \"main street\" area would be a plus. about me : I'm a software engineer, but when I'm not at work, I like to walk, hike, bike, etc. I love trying new bars, breweries, and restaurants as well. I have a handful of friends fairly spread out between Newport and West Hollywood. Being close to fun things to do and being in an area with lots of young people would be awesome. about you : mid 20s, friendly, clean, and respectful of common spaces, stable income. Down for the occasional shared dinner, hike, or bar hopping, but also cool to be doing your own thing DM me with an intro (age, job, typical schedule), socials/LinkedIn if you’re comfortable, plus any listings you like",

They’ll be staying with us during their little one’s special day and are looking for a vegetable based cake that’s not too sweet.  I have no clue and hoping someone knows a local bakery that could fit the bill! Update: thanks everyone for the amazing suggestions!  This list also gave me some spots to try for my own cake cravings",
