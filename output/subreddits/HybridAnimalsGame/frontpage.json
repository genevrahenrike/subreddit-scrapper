      "content_preview": "The hammering from Vitamin Ape’s workshop faded behind them as Tyler and Milo made their way back into the woods surrounding Yandi. Tyler stretched his arms, feeling the strength in them grow with each quest and every swing of his stone sword. He glanced over at Milo, who was humming softly to himself, his turtle shell bouncing lightly as he walked. “I need to get you levelled up,” Tyler said. Milo nodded. “I’m fine with that. You fight. I’ll block.” But Milo didn’t need Tyler’s help. While Tyler wandered off to forage berries and scoop up honeycomb to sell to Octokitty, Milo remained in a nearby clearing, steadily working through clusters of squirrel-rats and crow-mice, each around level 6 to 8. His calm expression never wavered as the mobs lunged toward him. [Activated Skill: Absolute Defence – All damage negated for 1 second.] [PE: 13 → 9] Milo blocked expertly and countered with a few careful swings of his dull stone weapon, slowly but surely chipping away at their health bars. Tyler, meanwhile, was crouched near a bush, inspecting a cluster of glossy green berries. [Acquired Item: Blueberries x2] [Acquired Item: Honeycomb] He yawned. Despite the peacefulness, something irked him. He looked back at Milo, who had just parried a crow-mouse and taken it down in one hit. [Enemy Defeated: Crow-Mouse Level 7] [+45 XP] [Enemy Defeated: Squirrel-Rat Level 6] [+30 XP] [Enemy Defeated: Squirrel-Rat Level 7] [+45 XP] [Level Up! Milo Level 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10] “He’s actually doing it…” Tyler muttered. A flicker of irritation crossed his face. They regrouped shortly after. “I hit level 10,” Milo said with a small smile. “Didn’t even use all my potions.” Tyler forced a grin. “Nice… I guess.” Milo shrugged. “There’s a path further west with gold berries. Octokitty pays double.” Tyler followed him quietly, but his thoughts were loud. He’s the player. He’s the elder brother. Why does it feel like Milo’s leading everything? They walked in silence. Milo continued giving tips about berries and avoiding mob clusters. Finally, Tyler stopped. “I’ll take the lead from here.” Milo blinked. “Okay.” Tyler expected protest. He got none. “We’re heading back to Noobia,” Tyler said. “We can just use the teleporter—” “No, we’re walking.” “…Right.” On their way back, Tyler made Milo handle berry collection while he scouted ahead. He cut down a few salmon-crow mobs around level 9 with ease. [Enemy Defeated: Salmon-Crow Level 9] [+45 XP] They were nothing now. He marched further ahead, basking in the sense of control—until he saw something bizarre. A massive nest. A huge green egg. And behind it… [Enemy Spotted: Big-Momma Rhino, Level 30] [HP: 600/600] Tyler blinked. “A rhino with a nest?” Apparently, in this world, even rhinos laid eggs. The egg had to be valuable. He glanced around. No mobs in sight. Milo was still somewhere behind, busy picking berries. Good. He’d do this himself. Glory would be his alone. He crept toward the nest. Big-Momma Rhino didn’t move. Emboldened, Tyler jabbed with his sword. [HP: 592/600] Then she roared. Her eyes glowed a bright crimson, and with a thunderous bellow, she stomped the ground and launched forward. [Skill Activated: Ram – Damage 50. Knockback triggered.] [Tyler HP: 165 → 115] He was hurled backward like a ragdoll. His back crashed into a tree trunk, rattling his vision. Pain seared through his chest, like fire ripping through his ribs. His limbs wouldn’t move. She turned, pawed the earth, and charged again. [Skill Activated: Ram – Damage 50] [Tyler HP: 115 → 65] He gasped, breath ragged. His head throbbed. The green forest around him blurred. The rhino’s shadow grew larger by the second. “I’m gonna die,” he mumbled. “This is it. I’m actually going to—” “TELEPORT, DUMBASS!” The voice cut through the fog like lightning. Tyler blinked. “What did you just call me?!” Milo was suddenly there, dropping berries as he sprinted forward. “You dare insult your brother—your superior? I’m the Player! I’m the literal main character! You don’t get to order me around!” Tyler shouted, his face red. “This isn’t about roles, Tyler! You’re going to die!” Milo barked. “Snap out of it!” The rhino was already charging again, thundering forward. Milo activated [Freeze Core] and [Absolute Defence]. [Skill Activated: Freeze Core — Target frozen for 3 seconds.] [Skill Activated: Absolute Defence — All damage negated for 1 second.] Ice surrounded the rhino’s hooves as she froze mid-charge, eyes locked on them. Milo stepped in front of Tyler, arms wide. “Click [Teleport]! You can teleport to marked locations once per day! DO IT!” Tyler, still dazed, fumbled with his window. His hands trembled. The rhino broke free. With a bellow, she charged again. Milo’s skill was on cooldown. He braced himself and took the hit with his body. Tyler watched as Milo’s small frame absorbed the full force of the blow, holding the rhino back just long enough. He finally clicked— [Teleport Activated → Destination: Noobia] [Teleportation in progress…] The air shimmered and warped. A flash of light. They appeared in the middle of Noobia’s town square. Milo dropped to one knee, panting. “That was a close one, right? You okay, Tyler?” Tyler sat silently, knees pulled to his chest. His HP was recovering, but his mind wasn’t. “I… I was really gonna die back there,” he whispered. “I couldn’t even move.” Milo sat down next to him. “But you didn’t. We got out.” Tyler clenched his fists. “If I was just a bit stronger… if I had a better weapon… better armour…” “Tyler—” “No! I’m the one who’s supposed to protect you! Not the other way around!” Milo reached out. “You don’t need to—” “I do!” Tyler shouted. “I need to get stronger. We’re going training. Now.” He stood up and stormed off toward the town gates. Milo sat there a moment longer, watching him disappear into the distance. He sighed. “He’s not okay.” < Previous | List | Next >",

      "content_preview": "The first thing Tyler felt was pressure. Not the metaphorical kind — but actual pressure, like his lungs were trying to figure out if the air around them was breathable. His body was numb, almost hollow, and when he finally opened his eyes, the world around him looked… weird. The sky was a little too blue, the grass a little too green. Trees were blocky and symmetrical, like props from a half-finished game map. Even the clouds looked suspiciously like… clouds someone had copy-pasted into the sky. And then there was the thing standing three feet in front of him — a creature with the tail of a squirrel, the wings of a crow, and the twitchy energy of someone who’d had too much sugar. “What in the actual—” The creature flapped once, gave him a sceptical look, and then darted off into the woods. Tyler blinked. “That was… not normal.” [Welcome, Player. Please enter your name to begin.] He squinted. “Tyler. It’s… Tyler.” [Confirmed. You are now: Tyler (Human + Human)] [Species Trait: Balanced. No elemental affinity. No disadvantages. No advantages.] [Starting Skill: Sprint] [Increases movement speed by twice for 6 seconds. Power Energy Cost: 4] [Inventory Slots: 0/15] Another window slid in beside it: [Level: 1] [XP: 0/50] [HP: 105/105] [PE: 11/11] Stats: Attack: 1 Defence: 1 Agility: 1 Speed: 1 Power Regen: 1 Accuracy: 1 Dodge: 1 Health Regen: 1 Remaining Attribute Points: 0 “I’m in a game…” Tyler muttered, taking a step forward. The world responded with a familiar rustle. Grass crunched underfoot, a bird chirped overhead, and a stick clipped the side of his leg. [Tutorial Quest Assigned: Craft Your First Weapon] Objectives: Collect [Wood Stick] x3 Craft [Wooden Pickaxe] Mine [Stone] x5 Craft [Stone Sword] [Reward: Bread, +3 XP] [Will you accept the quest?] [Yes] | [No] He tapped [Yes] instinctively. Almost reflexively, Tyler began scouring the area. A few tree stumps nearby. Some broken logs. Within ten minutes of casual foraging, he’d gathered the sticks. [Acquired Item: Wood Stick x3] He opened the crafting menu. With a single tap, he converted the sticks into a flimsy wooden pickaxe. [Item Crafted: Wooden Pickaxe] Nearby, a cluster of grey rocks waited conveniently. With satisfying thuds, Tyler smacked the rocks until they cracked and crumbled. [Acquired Item: Stone x5] Back into the crafting menu, he combined the materials and forged his first real weapon. [Item Crafted: Stone Sword (ATK +5)] [Achievement Unlocked: Your First Weapon] [Grade: F] [Condition: Craft the most basic weapon — a stone sword.] [Tutorial Quest Completed: Craft Your First Weapon] [Reward: Bread, +3 XP] [XP: 3/50] He stared at the bread in his hand. “Why bread?” “Meeeowww?” Tyler turned. An octopus-kitten hybrid stood upright, blinking at him with bright golden eyes. A tiny purple wizard hat perched atop her head, and her tentacles gently curled around a wooden staff. She pawed at the bread. He raised an eyebrow. “You want this?” [Translation Protocol Not Found] [This NPC uses a non-standard language. To communicate, consume [Translation Bread].] [Do you want to consume?] [Yes] | [No] He tapped [Yes]. The bread vanished in a flash of sparkles. “Finally! Took you long enough!” chirped the creature. “Name’s Octokitty! Welcome to Noobia, rookie.” Tyler blinked. “Uh. Thanks?” “You look broke,” she said, eyeing his crude stone gear. “But I like your vibe. Tell you what — I’ve got a little starter gig if you’re up for it.” [Quest Assigned: Octokitty’s Herbal Remedy] Objectives: Collect [Brown Mushroom] x3 Collect [Blueberry] x1 Collect [Nut] x1 [Reward: Mild Health Potion, Rusher Muffins x2] [Will you accept the quest?] [Yes] | [No] “Sure,” Tyler muttered. “Great! Oh, and pro tip: don’t eat any mushrooms with purple spots. That’s not flavour. That’s doom.” The surrounding woods had plenty of spots where mushrooms clustered near fallen logs. After a bit of searching, Tyler gathered three brown mushrooms. The blueberry bushes were obvious too, thanks to their bright colour. Finding nuts required shaking a few trees until something dropped. [Acquired Items: Brown Mushroom x3, Blueberry x1, Nut x1] He returned to Octokitty, placing the ingredients carefully on her stall. “Well, well,” she purred, inspecting the items. “You didn’t eat any weird mushrooms. That’s already more impressive than half the players I meet.” She flicked her tentacle, mixing the items into a bubbling pot behind her stand. A soft pop! and a swirl of glitter later, she handed him a glowing blue vial and two small, sugar-glazed muffins. [Quest Completed: Octokitty’s Herbal Remedy] [Reward: Mild Health Potion, Rusher Muffins x2] [XP: 6/50] [Acquired Item: Mild Health Potion] [Description: Instantly restores 25% of max HP when consumed.] [Acquired Item: Rusher Muffin] [Description: Boosts movement speed by twice for 10 seconds.] “You might want to hold onto those,” she advised. “This world gets dangerous fast. And you’re not exactly wearing enchanted armour.” “Thanks,” Tyler said. He hesitated. “So, what is this world, exactly?” “You really are new, huh? Let’s just say you’re inside something bigger than you can understand right now. Just keep surviving. Keep learning. Oh, and try not to die. That would be… inconvenient.” Before he could ask more, a squelching sound interrupted them. A slimy, green snail-crab hybrid emerged, dragging itself toward him with surprising speed. [Enemy Identified: Snail-Crab, Level 2] [HP: 80/80] Tyler raised his sword. “Alright, let’s see what you got.” He activated [Sprint]. [Activated Skill: Sprint] [PE: 7/11] He dashed forward, slashing twice. The snail-crab pulsed red and retaliated with a flick of its goo-covered claw, jabbing him in the side. [Status: Affected by [Poisonous Slime] – Target loses 5 HP every second. Duration: 00:00:05] [HP: 105 → 100 → 95…] “Seriously?” He gritted his teeth, rolled to the side, and slashed again. The creature let out a garbled squelch and burst like overfilled jelly. [Enemy Defeated: Snail-Crab Level 2] [XP Gained: +45] [XP: 51/50] [Level Up! Level 1 → 2] [Attribute Points: +1] [Achievement Unlocked: Beginning of the Hunt] [Grade: F] [Condition: Defeat and kill your first mob.] [Player: Tyler] [Level: 2] [XP: 1/50] [HP: 105/105] [PE: 11/11] Stats: Attack: 1 (+5) Defence: 1 Agility: 1 Speed: 1 Power Regen: 1 Accuracy: 1 Dodge: 1 Health Regen: 1 Remaining Attribute Points: 1 Another snail-crab emerged from the shadows, its shell glistening. Tyler grinned. “Perfect. Round two.” And far above, in the oddly bright sky, thunder rumbled in the distance. The world had only just started watching. < Previous | List | Next >",

      "content_preview": "After officially appointing Milo as his companion, Tyler stepped out of Shooba’s tent feeling more confident than ever. The world outside felt slightly warmer — or perhaps it was just the glow of having a partner to share this strange journey with. The streets of Yandi buzzed with activity. Somewhere nearby, the rhythmic clanging of hammer on metal echoed through the air, but before he could investigate, Milo nudged his side. “Look! That tent—it’s got lights and music. Let’s check it out!” The vibrant colours and flickering neon signs practically pulled them in. The tent flaps parted to reveal a hybrid of elephant and bat behind a game table, spinning a cue stick in his trunk. “Welcome, travellers!” the hybrid announced with a showman’s flair. “I’m Game Guy, master of Monster Pool and karaoke king of the continent!” Tyler raised an eyebrow. “Monster Pool?” Game Guy winked. “The only game where reflex meets raw animal instinct! You win? You get XP and a rare berry. Lose? Well, you still have a story to tell.” Tyler shrugged. “Why not.” He picked up the cue — a branch polished to near perfection — and chalked its tip with something that smelled oddly like pineapple. The balls on the table were colour-coded, each representing a hybrid animal class. The table was longer than regulation and slightly uneven, with magical ripples in the felt that made predictions tricky. Game Guy broke first. His trunk-shot sent three balls into pockets with perfect spins. “You’re doomed,” Milo whispered. “Shut it.” Tyler managed to pocket two balls with sheer luck, missed one miserably, then accidentally ricocheted a ball into another pocket. He grinned as the game continued. Eventually, Game Guy won, but not without clapping Tyler on the back. “Not bad, [Player]. That took longer than usual. Come back when you’re brave enough for the Champion Challenge.” Outside, the midday sun bathed the farm fields in light. Nearby, a stall displayed baskets of glowing mushrooms and fresh blueberries. A red panda-hedgehog hybrid, Filbert, was arranging produce. “Hey there,” he said with a soft smile. “You two new around here?” “Yep,” Tyler nodded. “Cool town.” Filbert sighed. “It used to be cooler before Melongutan started eating my crops. And don’t get me started on the squirrel-rats. Little pests think my orchard’s an all-you-can-eat buffet.” Tyler’s ears perked. “You need help?” [Quest Assigned: Pest Control] [Objectives: Defeat 5 Field Pests (Squirrel-Rats) around Filbert’s farm.] [Reward: Blueberry x10, Mild Health Potion x1] [Will you accept the quest?] [Yes] | [No] Tyler pressed [Yes]. “Lead the way.” Filbert pointed toward an orchard fenced with brambles. “They nest in those trees and run when you get close. But they’ll return. Good luck!” Tyler and Milo approached the orchard cautiously. Almost immediately, a chubby creature with twitching whiskers and a thick striped tail leapt from a bush. [Enemy Spotted: Squirrel-Rat Level 5] [HP: 130/130] Tyler activated [Sprint]. [Activated Skill: Sprint — Increases movement speed by twice for 6 seconds.] [PE: 16 → 12] He zoomed in, slashing with his stone sword. Milo joined in with [Freeze Core], freezing the pest in its tracks. [Activated Skill: Freeze Core — Target frozen for 3 seconds.] [PE: 13 → 7] Tyler’s follow-up strike ended the fight. [Enemy Defeated: Squirrel-Rat Level 5] [+45 XP] The next pest, a Level 4, darted from a pumpkin patch. Milo used [Absolute Defence] to shield himself while Tyler attacked. [Enemy Defeated: Squirrel-Rat Level 4] [+20 XP] Milo grinned. “You thought I picked this hybrid for the memes? Nah, I knew what I was doing.” Three more pests fell under their combined assault. Milo tanked while Tyler weaved through the orchard, sword flashing. [Enemy Defeated: Squirrel-Rat Level 5] [+45 XP] [Enemy Defeated: Squirrel-Rat Level 6] [+75 XP] With the final pest down, Tyler’s system window flashed. [Level Up! Level 10 → 11] [HP Restored] [Attribute Points: +1] [Player: Tyler] [Level: 11] [XP: 5/50] [HP: 165/165] [PE: 16/16] Stats: > Attack: 3 (+5) > Defence: 3 (+10) > Agility: 2 > Speed: 2 > Power Regen: 6 > Accuracy: 1 > Dodge: 1 > Health Regen: 1 Remaining Attribute Points: 0 [Quest Completed: Pest Control] [Reward: Blueberry x10, Mild Health Potion x1] Filbert met them with a grateful smile and the promised goods. “Thanks! Most folks don’t help out unless they’re promised gold. You two are alright.” Suddenly, the sharp clang of metal-on-metal cut through the calm. Milo flinched. “What was that?” Filbert chuckled. “He’s at it again.” “Who?” “Vitamin Ape,” Filbert said, gesturing toward the edge of town. “The legend himself. Strongest warrior turned weaponsmith. You’ll know when you see him.” As Tyler and Milo approached the source of the hammering, they found a muscular figure pounding raw molten metal on a stone slab using just his fists. Sparks flew with each blow, and the ground trembled slightly beneath their feet. He was a gorilla-carrot hybrid, his body rippling with muscle and orange tufts, eyes sharp and focused. His workshop was more battlefield than forge — lined with shattered helmets, broken blades, and old armour designs scattered like fallen enemies. “Welcome,” Vitamin Ape said, barely looking up. “Here to window-shop or battle steel itself?” “Uh… window-shop for now,” Tyler said, watching in awe as the smith pounded another glowing ingot into shape. Vitamin Ape wiped his brow and motioned to a shelf. “Crude Titanium Set. Armour, helm, sword. Not pretty, but they’ll save your life.” [Crude Titanium Sword: +10 ATK] [Crude Titanium Armour: +10 DEF] [Crude Titanium Helm: +10 DEF] Tyler winced at the price tags: 250 gold each. “You take blueberries as down payment?” Vitamin Ape grunted. “Bring coin or ore. No exceptions. And if you ever bring me Ancient Ore… well, let’s just say I’ve been waiting for someone who can handle what I’ll make from that.” Milo nudged Tyler. “Let’s remember this place.” As they stepped outside, Tyler looked over his shoulder once more, eyes lingering on the fire-lit figure hammering destiny into shape. < Previous | List | Next >",

Nothing. Even the [Help] tab showed only a spinning icon that read [Fetching Guidebook Data… Error. Try Again Later.] “Ugh. Figures,” he muttered. Opening the crafting tab, he saw: [Crafting Table Unlocked] [Craft Wooden Armour: Requires Wood Stick x4] [Craft Wooden Helmet: Requires Wood Stick x3] It didn’t take long to collect seven sticks from nearby branches. [Acquired Item: Wood Stick x7] He tapped to craft. [Item Crafted: Wooden Armour (+5 DEF)] [Item Crafted: Wooden Helmet (+5 DEF)] The armour creaked like cheap plywood but gave him a modest sense of security. With a satisfied grunt, he equipped the set and looked around for anything interesting. Soon, he found himself walking through Noobia’s modest plaza, where market stalls stood under crooked signs and oddly shaped rooftops. The first vendor was a slow-moving creature, a fusion of pug and snail. It was curled lazily beside a shelf of handmade furniture and tools. [Name: Gumpy Pug] [Species: Snail + Pug] [Shop: Gumpy’s Furniture Emporium] “You again? I knew it. You’ve got that presidential sparkle in your eye,” the pug drawled, his words slow but laced with importance. “Presidential?” “I’ll be the President of Noobia someday. Mark my words. Just you wait.” Tyler blinked, unsure whether to laugh or nod. “Uh, good luck with that.” “It’s all politics and posture, kid,” Gumpy said with a grunt, already turning to scrawl something in a dusty guestbook labelled ‘Visitors of Destiny.’ Next was a bright pink stall adorned with flower petals and flashy signboards. A bubbly red panda-butterfly hybrid fluttered over, her wings shimmering. [Name: Petunia] [Species: Red Panda + Butterfly] [Shop: Petunia’s Grand Boutique] “Oooh! A Player! You simply must try this on!” she squealed, holding out a purple wizard hat with glittery trim. “Storm Wizards wore this exact design!” “I’m not really a hat person,” Tyler replied. “Nonsense! This once ruled the market before it was mass-produced. Still top-quality fashion! Once you go wizard, you don’t go back!” He laughed awkwardly. “Maybe later.” Petunia gasped theatrically. “Don’t leave me hanging, darling! You’re going to regret not glowing in style!” Tyler slipped away before she could force a fitting. At the next booth, a pig stood with a pineapple growing from its head like a crown. One hoof rested on a sheathed sword. [Name: Pineapple Pig] [Species: Pig + Pineapple] [Shop: The Pig Iron Works] He snorted as Tyler approached. “Aye, the world is dangerous unless you’re spiky like me. You’ll need a weapon to protect yourself.” “Right. Got any metal gear yet?” The pig squinted. “A bit too cocky, aren’t we? Come back when you’ve actually earned the right to swing steel.” Tyler sighed. “Just asking.” “Pride doesn’t block blades. Remember that.” Further down the cobbled path stood a booth so wildly decorated it was hard to miss. Pink frosting and glitter covered every inch. A crab with a cupcake shell waved a claw. [Name: Cupcake Crab] [Species: Cupcake + Crab] “Pssst! Hey, kid! You look like the collecting type,” Cupcake Crab whispered, voice far too enthusiastic. “I’ve got a task for you. Not from the system. Just from me. Totally trustworthy.” Tyler frowned. The crab was blinking one eye independently of the other. “What’s the catch?” “No catch! Just… bring me seashells. Five of them. Different colours. Red, green, blue, gold, and purple. Or white if gold is too rare. Do this, and I’ll reward you with something special.” [Quest Assigned: Colours of the Sea] [Objective: Collect 5 different-coloured sea shells] [Reward: ????] [Will you accept the quest?] [Yes] | [No] Tyler tapped [Yes]. “Excellent choice! You won’t regret this. Or maybe you will. Who knows! Anyway, I’ve got to… evaporate now!” And without warning, the crab scuttled behind a curtain, leaving behind only a faint scent of frosting and mischief. Tyler muttered to himself. “Why do I feel like I just signed a pact with the devil?” Finally, he sat down on a mossy patch to collect his thoughts. In just a short time, he’d geared up, picked up a sketchy quest, and met some of the weirdest NPCs imaginable. He checked his stats again.

      "content_preview": "The sky above Noobia shimmered beneath a soft morning sun. Birds chirped lazily, and the crisp wind rustled the long grass as Tyler left the plaza, clutching his stone sword with anticipation. He hadn’t forgotten the shady Cupcake Crab’s strange quest — finding colourful shells. He figured he’d start with that before venturing further. A quick search around the outskirts of town yielded two promising finds. [Acquired Item: Red Shell] [Acquired Item: Green Shell] Tyler grinned. “Two already. Nice.” His enthusiasm was short-lived. A lavender glint in the grass turned out to be nothing more than a squished pile of moonberries. “…Ugh, gross.” He sighed and shook his hands clean. “Guess I’ll come back later for the rest.” He turned to the western trail, where tall grass swayed and trees stood like silent sentinels. It was time to venture out. As he moved deeper into the forest, the mobs grew noticeably stronger. He paused at the edge of a clearing where three salmon-crow hybrids shrieked to one another. [Enemy Identified: Salmon-Crow, Level 17] [Enemy Identified: Salmon-Crow, Level 19] [Enemy Identified: Salmon-Crow, Level 20] “Too risky,” Tyler muttered and backpedalled. He spotted a lone frog-goat hybrid munching leaves beside a stump. [Enemy Identified: Frog-Goat, Level 8] “Now that’s more like it.” Tyler opened his stat window and allocated both available points to Power Regen. [Attribute Points: 2 → 0] [Power Regen: 3] [PE: 13/13] He activated [Sprint], rushing in from behind, striking once, and immediately retreating. The mob lunged, but Tyler had already moved past its range. A few more back-and-forths and the creature collapsed. [XP Gained: 45] [Level Up! Level 3 → 4] [HP Restored] [Attribute Points: +1] He ventured deeper. Spotting a trio of duck-mouse hybrids loitering near a rock, Tyler crept behind them and struck one quickly, leading it away before it alerted the others. [Enemy Identified: Duck-Mouse, Level 6 x3] One by one, he defeated them. [+20 XP] [Level Up! Level 4 → 5] [HP Restored] [Attribute Points: +1] [+20 XP] [Level Up! Level 5 → 6] [HP Restored] [Attribute Points: +1] He repeated this tactic across the region, gaining experience steadily. When he reached Level 8, he spotted a massive creature grazing ahead—a rhino-duck hybrid. [Enemy Identified: Rhino-Duck, Level 15] “Alright… let’s see how far I’ve come.” He darted in, landed a blow, and leapt back. The beast turned with a roar and charged. Tyler evaded, but one of its legs clipped his side. [HP: 74/120] Tyler winced. “Can’t get hit again.” He activated [Sprint]— [PE: 1/13] “Out of energy?” he hissed. Desperation kicked in. He reached into his pouch. [Item Consumed: Rushers] [Description: Boosts movement speed by twice for 10 seconds.] Zipping around the beast, he led it on a wild chase. Eventually, the mob paused and began trudging back to its spot. He stood there panting. “That was too close. I should just—” But then, a flicker of green caught his eye—the mob’s HP was nearly depleted. Acting on instinct, Tyler charged in, slammed his sword into the mob’s flank, and watched it vanish in a poof of light. [Enemy Defeated: Level 15 Rhino-Duck] [XP Gained: 90] [Level Up! Level 8 → 10] [HP Restored] [Attribute Points: +2] “YES!” he shouted. Then more quietly, “…But I’m not doing that again without a plan.” Past the tree line, a town came into view—larger, windier, and built around a river. At its entrance spun a glowing green disc embedded in a stone pedestal. [Teleporter Registered: Yandi] [Fast Travel Unlocked] “Nice,” Tyler breathed. “That’ll save time.” Next to the teleporter was a cozy tent, embroidered in gold thread and decorated with feathers and maps. Inside was a familiar voice. “Tyler!” He froze. There sat a fluffy Turtle-Yeti hybrid on a low wooden chair. “It’s me! MILO!” Tyler blinked. “What the—” Milo stood up, stumbled forward, and grabbed him. “I woke up in a TREEHOUSE! Like, suspended in the middle of nowhere. There was a storm, then it went dark and the next thing I knew—” He suddenly swayed. “I-I… have nowhere to go… will you let me… follow you?” Milo fainted into Tyler’s arms. “Whoa, hey!” Tyler caught him. “Milo?” “Don’t worry,” a calm voice said. An alpaca-goat hybrid stepped from behind a curtain. [Name: Shooba] [Species: Alpaca + Goat] [Shop: Shooba’s Shack O’ Stuff] “He always says that. Standard [Companion] prompt. His body’s still adjusting. Poor guy.” Shooba offered Tyler a chair. “I found him collapsed outside my shop. Patched him up, gave him a place to stay. He’s too clumsy to travel alone.” Tyler nodded slowly. “Thanks. Guess I owe you.” “You want to explore the world?” Shooba asked. “I sell comfort kits for travellers—tents, flint, ropes, even enchanted blankets.” “I might come back for those,” Tyler said. “Right now, I need to understand what’s going on.” Just then, Milo stirred. “Ughh… wait… Tyler?” “I’m here,” Tyler said, offering a hand. Milo grabbed it. “Took you long enough.” The game interface chimed. [Would you like to appoint [Milo] as your companion?] [Yes] | [No] Tyler smiled and selected: [Yes] [Milo has joined your party!] [Companion: Milo] [Species: Turtle + Yeti] [Level: 4] [Skills: Absolute Defence, Freeze Core] Together, they stepped out of Shooba’s tent, the road ahead open for the first time. < Previous | List | Next >",
