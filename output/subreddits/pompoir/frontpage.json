      "content_preview": "Hi, im someone who trains my whole body, including vagina muscles. Here is principles to gain strenght - training pelvic floor has the same principles as all strenght training :) So you can either train strenght and endurance in the same day, or separate days. If you train all in tge same day, would be wise to warm up first (control training, pompoir is good for that, you connect with your vagina which helps also with strenght training). After warm up strenght training, cause if you start with endurance, your muscles are not that 'fresh' for maximum strenght. But not directly from warm up to your maximum strenght, step by step. For example if your maximum strenght was 1kg hold 3sec in vaginal weight lifting, you could warm up with 200g, 500g, 800g and then 1kg. Its same as if your 1rep max in bench press is 80kg, you dont try it directly after warmup, but first try 50, 60 or even 70kg just to prepare your body what will come and how to use muscles. BUT dont overdo warmup cause otherwise your muscles fatigue a bit so that you cant get \"all you got\" in maximum strenght training. After maximum strenght training (1-3reps in your max) its good to train strenght (6-12reps 3-4 sets with as much weight you can barely handle)) or endurance (more than that, depends how far you want to go it can vary 12-1000reps or even more sometimes when you are advanced). Then cool-down, and some stretching. Or you can train strenght other day, then 1-2 rest days, and endurance and control/skills the other day. How this can look in vaginal weight lifting, is for example: -warm up: as much weight that it feels very easy to hold, you feel muscles activating but it does not feel much work -basic strenght: as much weight that you can hold it 10sec standing straight and repeat it after pause 3-4 rounds. -maximum strenght: as much weight you need to use all power you can to hold it even 1sec. If you can hold the weight more than 3sec, its not maximum strenght anymore. (but its not wise to train maximum strenght in every training session, for example once a week is good). -endurance: as much weight you can hold it 1min or more, you need to work for it And, variation is key for muscles to develop! So, train in many positions, with many methods. Not only it keeps your mind entertained, but also it gives different kind of stimulus for your muscles ti develop better. Listen to your body. 1-4training days and always after intense training day at least 1 rest day. Muscles grow during rest :) And vagina muscles can get DOMS (sore or over tense) too. If your muscles feel sore or tired, give them rest until you feel recovered",

      "content_preview": "So I’m new to this (like less than a week) and I have the book and Perifit. The reason why I got the Perifit so early is because I feel like I have a good strength starting point and I have used Ben Wa Balls before and felt like it didn’t help as much. I’m looking at it this like how I would train for pole dancing. The Perifit/weights are like my “gym” session and Pompoir is more of training like practicing tricks and moves. I know I have to build up strength first but I also want to focus on control and endurance. My main concern is overworking the muscles so should I not do both in the same day? I use the Perifit for about 10 minutes. I figured it could work well as a “warm up” and muscle “activation”. Or should I just follow the workout split in the book and use the Perifit for resistance?",

      "content_preview": "Does pompoir help address or reduce anxiety for having an orgasm? I was treated pretty badly when I was young (I’m 42 now) and my partners would either never think of me having an orgasm or the would huff or make big sighs that I was taking long, which made things take longer. I’ve never orgasmed purely through vaginal sex. I’ve needed clitorial stimulation to reach orgasm. I stopped using my bullet vibe 3 months ago and I’m happy that I can orgasm with just rubbing with my it takes me 10-20min when I’m alone. With my partner when we have sex I can orgasm with my fingers while he is inside my vagina, but the sensations in my vagina (the thrusting) distract me (so much going on) so it’s hard to focus on orgasm when I’m having sex because it’s just so much sensory overload. My body has been used to quiet, lights out, and just my fingers on my clit. When I video chat with my boyfriend it takes me longer to orgasm because I know I’m being watched, I have to close my eyes. I can hear him do sighs sometimes because from my understanding the girls he was with could orgasm easily, so we are both doing something new and learning. It’s uncomfortable but I want to be able to have easier orgasms. If I keep only having orgasm alone then I will feed and reinforce that behavior. I need to expose myself to other stimuli and practice compassion that I may not have an orgasm easily and that my body is learning. I remind him that my body isn’t used to all these stimulations when I’m trying to orgasm and it’s a lot, it’s harder to finish, and he says “yes that’s true.” I also have adhd which research shows it’s difficult to focus so that also happens with sex, my mind wanders easily and has a tough time staying with the sensations. Will pompoir help with any of this? I got the course which I haven’t started yet, and I’m also changing anxiety because my current treatment (plus therapy, tons of therapy) isn’t addressing my adhd /anxiety in a more functional way.",

Backstory: I know womens health is under researched and parts of health in general are hard to define but i’m 25 and im genuinely confused still. I never orgasm with a partner. Ever. I do alone kinda? But its not “as advertised”, orgasms are so hyped up when i do it alone i’m like is that it? I used to be a vibrator girl. I had a theory that was preventing me from achieving orgasm with a partner because how could u replicate that feeling and maybe my body is too used to it. I noticed an increase in getting turned on and ability to get wet/turned on but still no orgasm.  Not even the sparks. Part of it is definitely my partner. He’s sexually immature where forplay isn’t really a thought, he wants to get his dick sucked or just stick it right in me, spit on his hand need be 🫥 which im kinda a clean freak and unless u have impeccable dental hygiene im kinda like ew. Tbh even though he isn’t prince charming in bed or otherwise i feel inadequate. I feel like most men experienced a woman who orgasms like a waterfall. I grew up with guys raving about it. I’m scared to accept some girls just need clitoral stimulation and can’t orgasm from penis alone which is like why would we be made like this then.",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I'm a first timer as far as kegel exercises go and i'd love to know everyones experiences. I used the perifit for the first time yesterday. I set it to 10 minutes. Afterwards a few hours later I noticed sensitivity in my pelvic floor area, this has carried on into today. It feels sore from the inside, I am assuming because I exercised that area and it is not unlike exercising biceps etc at the gym? Soreness afterwards. It is an uncomfortable feeling and I have concerns I am not doing a kegel correctly. I can feel myself from the inside every time I inadvertantly clench and unclench these muscles. I wouldn't want to do more damage than good. Is what I'm experiencing normal? Any advice on how to proceed with my routine is much appreciated. I am 32 years old and never had pelvic floor issues and I've never had children. I am using the perifit to increase my sexual pleasure as I would like to connect positively with that area of my body more and I thought this would be helpful for that reason.",

I’m currently working on these: narrowing my vaginal canal, isolating contraction of my left and right wall, contracting different depths, “milking” motion. I used to worry about being loose and would do a bunch of kegels without stretching my pelvic floor and I would get so chronically tight that I bled and felt numb during sex. Needless to say, it didn’t make intercourse more pleasurable. Now I’m working on stretching, building awareness and lately doing some vaginal lifting too.

I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if Pompoir helped improve it/ how long it took for it to make a difference? I’ve only just started my Pompoir journey but have done kegals before. I’m on day 2 of the training program & I’m really excited, I feel like it’s going well so far and it’s probably way to soon to expect to see a difference but I’ve also read multiple posts of people saying how when you have a bigger partner they may not feel it as much so I’m also curious what your experiences have been in this regard. Does it require intense training to be able to grip a partner that is larger tightly?",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone. I'm interested in your experiences with perifit training or other pelvic floor exercises and the resulting changes in sexuality. My story in brief: I have two children; the last birth was years ago. I didn't do any consistent pelvic floor exercises afterward. At first, I had some incontinence, for example, when coughing or on the trampoline, but after about a year, this disappeared by itself. I didn't have sex for a long time so I didn't bother. Now I have a partner again. I can have vaginal orgasms, and I squirt during them. During sex and especially after having an orgasm, I feel my vagina is too loose. Also, arousal often leads to me getting very wet, and when I squirt then it gets even wetter. My partner then has trouble feeling anything. He says this is mainly related to all the Fluid, but I think the relaxaaaation of my vagina is also a cause. It's not a particularly serious problem, and neither me or my partner are unhappy. But it used to feel different in the past. So I became worried about my pelvic floor. So, I started training (perifit care +) a few weeks ago. The device shows me a medium force, for those who know: about 400 grams. As expected, no problems with relaxation. I'd be interested to know if consistent training makes your vagina feel tighter during intercourse, or put it the other way rund, can it stop you feeling too wide. And if you can somehow relate it to perifit scores. (Just to mention it, I also had genital numbness caused by antidepressants in the past. But the numbness is something different, and I got rid of it, fortunately.) Edit: Personal success stories on the topic would be very much appreciated. Please tell your story. This thread has already had thousands of visitors after less than 24 hours, but only few answers compared to that. I think lots of people would love to hear success stories.",

      "content_preview": "Have been a grateful recipient of pompoir for a few years, and I’m shocked that my wife has never mentioned what it’s called! She said she saw a video a few years ago on tiktok but didn’t really catch the name. Some things I haven’t seen mentioned here that she does might be fun to try! One is responsive motions, where I suck/lick/pinch her nipples and she reacts with her vaginal muscles in response, almost like Simon says. She also can control her orgasmic contractions to twist or grip harder instead of the usual kegel while orgasming, which is a struggle to make it through no matter what! 😅 It’s less common but she can also “write” on my dick. Her favorite is to write “cum in me” while I do! She can write her name and a few other short words too. Varied sensations from taps to twists to squeezes to a mid sentence grab/contraction also help us go at it for a long time. Prevents her from getting too sore and prevents me from popping too fast. We take breaks and slow down the movements to talk too, but let me tell you I frequently can’t remember what she says, haha… I must reassert other posts to say girl on top is the best position, it sounds boring but it’s just about all we do! We are so grateful to have further knowledge of this to develop further skills!",

I just got the KM, and this thing is a workout. If you’re on advanced springs, hats off to you! And with that, I’m wondering if y’all are chiseled in other regions of your bodies, too? I mean, how much does overall fitness play in getting the pelvic floor strong and maintaining it? And how much work are you putting in on the KM? And how exactly are you doing it (contract and relax for ??? sets, long contractions for ??? minutes, etc)? I feel like even doing just the basic 3 sets of 30 contract and release are a workout right now for my PF. Should I be doing more than that, though? If some of you are working out with the KM for extended duration, can you offer some guidance or a “workout plan” with detail? I’m very new to this. Also, going to see a pelvic floor therapist to ensure I’ve got it right. Thanks!",

Anyways, I was skimming this thread and saw someone talk about muscles needing different routines or patterns of usage, and another person talking about the videos from the Ohlympus program. I was just wondering if anyone had more detail as to what is in the program in terms of video content. Is it like the images in the e-book but live/animated? Or follow along, paced routines that vary? Would anyone who has purchased both the book and the course recommend the course specifically as helping with breakthroughs when starting with early stages (specifically squeezing)? Or is it more beneficial compared to the book specifically for more advanced techniques? I really want to purchase the course eventually regardless, I love the work that Gohdess does and want to support, and the information is invaluable, I'm just on a budget right now so wanted to see what others thought.",
