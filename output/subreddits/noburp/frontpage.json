I’ve definitely gone down the rabbit hole on this sub and have seen a lot of horror stories about symptoms post-op, mainly around vomiting at random intervals. I def meet some of the criteria for an emet, so I’m looking for folks who have had the procedure done and had an okay recovery period, aka no vomiting. It’s causing me a lot of anxiety over something I was originally ecstatic about because I thought it might be the missing piece of the puzzle. TYIA!!",

I am now able to burp whenever I need. I am more present and less distracted by pain and discomfort. I no longer need to excuse myself from my desk at work frequently to pass gas. I started working out more, because I can properly fuel my body before and after workouts, and my stomach discomfort is completely gone. I used to have nearly daily diarrhea — also gone. I cannot overstate how much getting treatment changed my life. I know many people are scared for one reason or another — I was too. But I firmly believe that if you have R-CPD, you should not let your fears stop you from seeking help. There really is a miracle cure. I am so excited to live the rest of my life in this body. I want this for everyone who has suffered from R-CPD!",

I will swallow, it will feel like it gets lodged in the back of my throat and I start to choke (I have NEVER had an issue swallowing before, started taking pill medication on a regular basis before I was 5 years old) then I have to cough it up into my mouth (the preferred option, as opposed to on the ground or my hand) then swallow the SAME BITE again usually with success. Is this at all normal/ part of the recovery timeline.  Any suggestions? I am 38 years old and have not been able to burp for as long as I can remember, my mom is the same way as is one of my sisters. I self diagnosed thanks to https://laryngopedia.com/retrograde-cricopharyngeus-dysfunction/ . And was finally able to get my doctor to take me seriously and refer me to ENT who verified it.",

Should I consider rescheduling my appointment? Will I be burping incessantly while the bride walks down the aisle?! Grateful for any advice about this dilemma and any insight as to how the office procedure with Dr. Pitman was for anyone who had it done with him. I would really rather not reschedule because I’m so eager to treat this issue, but I will if I must. Thank you!",

At some point I found this subreddit and realized I wasn't the only one who gurgled at most, and would experience the occasional \"air vomit\". About a year ago, I was at work and lifted a heavy box.  I must have had some gas build up in my gut because just exerting myself to lift I burped all of a sudden. I felt dizzy and slightly nauseous soon after, but I didn't give it much thought.  The next day I found myself burping a few times through out the day.  I can't describe exactly how, but lifting that box seems to have changed something, and since then I can just burp whenever I need to. Has anyone else experienced this?  Wish you all the best of luck out there!",

I experienced microburps in the following weeks but it wore off quite quickly. 3 weeks ago I have my second botox treatment (100 units). I've had a similar experience to before, with the slow-swallow and food blockages in my throat being the only symptoms but very manageable. I'm not certain but I think I'm able to burp on command by positioning in certain ways. Although I'm worried that these are just throat noises and not actual burps. I'm still doing my regular croaking, in fact it's a lot more than usual. By facing a wall and putting my elbows up against it with my hands on my upper back, then sliding my elbows up as far as they'll go and tucking my chin down, I can reliably make a lot of \"burping\" sounds. I'd love to hear from you guys what happens when you do this as well because I can't tell if I'm making progress or not. I'm also happy to answer any questions about the procedure, recovery, etc. I'm 28 M from the UK.",

However, I used to hiccup a lot before. Not in fits just occasional silent ones after eating and drinking. I’m getting these even more now but they tend to then be immediately followed by a micro burp so it must be related to the gas escaping. If that’s what happens now I’m definitely happy with it as a trade off but has anyone else experienced this? did it go away? Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I had the botox injection 8 days ago but since then my R-CPD symptoms have become so much worse. I would get pretty bad gurgles before the botox but I would say they have become extreme since about day 4. My stomach feels painfully full of air after eating very small amounts, and it makes me feel very nauseous and discouraged. I am also worried about getting enough nutrition because I get super full so quickly and everything is so difficult to swallow. The only thing that really helps is lying down, but I feel like I should be trying harder to practise burping rather than treating this feeling like I would have before the botox. I have been able to burp a few times, but they aren't big or relieving and I am still mostly just gurgling. The taste and sensation also reminds me much more of vomiting than I was hoping, so I am finding it very difficult to get used to the sensation, especially when I am already feeling nauseous from the amount of air in my stomach. I've been having to call in sick to work because of these symptoms and the weakness from not eating enough, but I'm not sure how long I can take off without a doctor's note/proper explanation. So far I have been implying that I caught a virus because I'm too embarrassed to explain the real reason and I don't think they would understand how bad R-CPD can be. I do have a zero hour contract but I feel super guilty not showing up for shifts when it's busy in summer. Is this just part of the process, and will it get better? If you experienced a worsening of your symptoms after the botox, how long did it last?",

This therapy may prove especially useful for those of us who have required multiple injections because the results fade over time. This therapy is intended to retrain the nervous system so that burping will continue even after Botox wears off. There is no video available but the four simple maneuvers are described in the article. They can be used separately or in conjunction with one another. Each person will need to experiment to determine which work best. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.32427 Upvote10Downvote2Go to comments",

I am still burping but  they aren’t quite as big as they were in the first few weeks and take slightly more effort to release. My question is: when and how did you realise you were ‘cured’? Did the burps slow to a ‘normal burper’ rate and how long after the procedure was that?",

      "content_preview": "I have my surgery booked in exactly 1 month under GA. At this point I’m starting to get more panicky about it after reading about all the horrible slow swallow and laryngospasm horror stories 😅 I already have a major fear of choking and just thinking about not being able to swallow food or not being able to breathe even if just for a few seconds is enough to send me into a panic attack. I keep telling myself even if I do have bad side effects like that, the results will be worth it of not having to live in misery anymore. I’ve read up on the straw breathing technique, and kind of what I’ll be able to eat and what I should avoid with the slow swallow. Is there any tips or tricks anyone has to offer regarding these 2 side effects, or anything for that fact even if non related to those 2 things. I just want to make sure I’m fully prepared for recovery. Like for instance, for the people who state they couldn’t eat solid food for a month after Botox, what did you eat to survive?? Should I be drinking fizzy drinks to try and get burps right away or should I wait until the Botox starts to wear off?? I have a prescription for acid reflux medication (because I’ve been getting treated for GI problems this whole time when that was never the case) should I have that filled and be taking it to avoid potential reflux or should I just stick to tums/gaviscon as needed? Clearly I’m a huge worrywart and just appreciate any advice or tips anyone can provide of stuff I might not be thinking of 🥹",

      "content_preview": "In less than six months, I’ve had three Botox injections (in-office, Ruysdael Amsterdam). Just under two weeks ago, I received my third shot. Because the first two didn’t work, the dosage was doubled. I’m not entirely sure, but I believe I’ve now had 100 units, while the first two times I received 50 units each. And it finally worked! I got my third shot on a Wednesday. That following Monday, the burping started, and since then, it’s been improving a little more each day. My stomach issues have almost completely disappeared, and I feel like a different person—it’s truly amazing. Now I’m just hoping that this effect will last and that I’ll never have to feel the way I did before again. Given the number of injections I’ve had—and the different outcomes—I thought it would be useful to share what I’ve learned and experienced. Please note: these are my personal experiences after one week of being r-cpd free, and of course, they may not apply to everyone! Be prepared that you might need multiple injections. I found it especially mentally tough when the first two didn’t work. I saw this as a last resort, so when the second one failed too, I really thought things would never get better. Mentally preparing yourself for the possibility of needing a second or even third dose helps—it’ll only be a bonus if it works the first time. All three times, I experienced a bit of slow swallow, but it was really manageable. I could eat pretty much everything; I just needed a bit of water with bread. I didn’t experience any acid reflux or other side effects with any of the injections. With all three shots, I only started to feel something around day 5. The first four days, I felt alsmost nothing at all. Don’t let that discourage you. With this third shot, I’m noticing that the effects are still improving every day. After my first injection, I thought I was burping, but I was actually just sucking air in. It makes a similar sound. Now I know that “real burps” come up on their own and taste like what you’ve eaten. They’re often warm too. It sounds gross, and as someone with emetophobia, it was a bit shocking at first—but you get used to it very quickly. I’m already noticing a decrease in my anxiety. Don’t drink carbonated drinks until your body starts burping on its own. Fizzy drinks can help you practice burping, but only once your body is already capable of doing it. The in-office procedure is a bit uncomfortable, but not painful. If I had to choose between getting an injection every day for the rest of my life or living with R-CPD, I’d choose the injection without hesitation. Now that I can burp, I’ve realized just how much air used to go into my stomach. After every sip of water and every bite of food, I burp multiple times. Farting has decreased probably by 95% When it works, it's all worht it!!!! If anyone has tips on how to keep the burping going well in the coming months, I’d love to hear them! And if you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",

As i understand it, the Botox relaxes the muscle which then “teaches” it to stay relaxed, usually negating the need for additional Botox shots. So doing exercises is just another way to train the muscle to relax. Am i right about this?",

I (like everybody else here) had these weird and horrible symptoms that I had suffered with for probably 15-20 years. I found this sub, got in contact with Dr. Bastian, and got all fixed up (2 treatments… 75 then 100). I’ve been “cured” for several years now and it’s still the most amazing feeling! I have been able to help a lot of people with my experiences over the years but I feel it’s time to leave. I don’t know what it is, but over the past few years the sub has been overrun by people “afraid of Botox” or people with mild symptoms only slightly resembling RCPD. It’s just not what it used to be. Maybe it’s a generational thing but I find myself unable to offer much more help than I already have. Bottom line, if you have this, there’s no question once you read the stories of those who have suffered with it for a long time. It would be a “Eureka!” moment, and no amount of anxiety would keep you from getting fixed. I have a deep appreciation for those who came before me and helped me, and of course for Dr. Bastian who pioneered this treatment. For those who are actually suffering from this condition I wish you good luck.",

      "content_preview": "Does anyone else find that eating healthily and exercising significantly worsens symptoms? I find that when I am eating lots of fruit/veg/protein and taking regular exercise like running, lifting or even stair walking, the bloating, hiccups, and gurgling is really bad. Not just while I’m doing it but the whole day and the following day. But when I have a weekend of eating cookies and sitting on the couch, I feel totally fine. I did loads of sport in my 20s and 30s and it was never an issue - I was often bloated and would hiccup after meals, but it seems like my body was often able to push it through the other end more quickly. Does R-CPD (which I only just discovered existed!) get worse as you get older? Any tips to manage the exercise/eating thing?",

But it doesn't burn in the way that heartburn does from acid reflux? I've seen some posts on here describing this feeling, but all have mentioned this as happening after Botox treatment. I've not had this treatment, but get it often. Worse if I'm anxious.",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I got 50u of botox in-office with Lucy yesterday morning. She was really lovely and kind, and it was so nice to be finally taken seriously by a doctor, but I found the injection itself much more painful and uncomfortable than I was expecting to. I had read a lot of posts on here from people saying they could barely feel it, but for me it actually hurt a lot! I think this was partly because she initially couldn't find the right muscle in my neck and had to put the needle in a second time (about 1cm further down/up my neck) to inject the botox successfully. The worst part was swallowing while the needle was in my throat, which was extremely painful and difficult. I felt ok right after, a bit sore but I was expecting to. I would compare the feeling to how it feels if you do sit ups when activating your neck instead of your core. There was a sore lump in my throat, and it was painful but not physically difficult to swallow. However by the evening my throat felt very swollen and the lump felt very big. I was struggling to swallow without feeling a tight choking/gagging sensation, and couldn't eat dinner because it just felt like everything got stuck in my throat. From what I've read on here it isn't normal to get slow swallow on day 1, and water after every bite doesn't really help because water doesn't wash it down (and is very difficult to swallow too even on its own). I am also not feeling any other effects of the botox and not burping yet, so I think this might just be caused by swelling from the injections? I was hoping it would go away in the night, but it's now the next morning and my throat still feels very sore and swollen. I tried to have some yoghurt and a cup of tea but still can't get anything down past the sore lump in my throat easily. I was expecting to have some pain and discomfort, but I am also worried that this doesn't seem to be most people's post-botox experience (from what I've read on here). At the end of the day I am super happy that I could get the botox and really hoping that it works, but was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and how long it will last?",
