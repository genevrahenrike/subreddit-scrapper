Problem is the chests that you need to buff luck are just that…LUCK…and if you miss even one, it’s -100 to said stat…which is bullcrap since then I could be going back and forth between 0 and 100 constantly. I tried to see if there was a way to exploit the saving of the VMU but no luck there as it seems like it saves even before the end of an adventure (compared to Adventure 1 where it seems to only save after the journey is done). Now if I were on an emulator it would be as easy as save stating the VMU tool, but I’m on real hardware where save states are not a thing.",

      "content_preview": "TLDR: I have a GDEMU setup that seems to be pretty stable aside from Shenmue II that keeps on crashing at specific points in game. I tried a lot of things to fix this but now would like to try an image that is guaranteed to work on someone else's setup so I know it wasn't a rotten image all along. Stuff I've tried: I have a Japanese dreamcast with a DreamPSU since I'm based in europe. Cleaned the PSU contacts, got a better power brick, updated my GDEMU clone from 5.05 to 5.20 with 3d printed case to improve airflow, tried 3 of 4 different reputable SD cards. All other games I tried are stable aside from Ecco which also hangs occasionaly. It seems the steps I took to improve this did reduce the rate of crashes but did not fix it altogether. What I also tried: play the xbox version of Shenmue on my Xbox 360 instead, which wouldn't run, and try and play the HD remaster on PS4 but it turns out I just enjoy Shenmue on a dreamcast so much more. I have a feeling I'm not going to be able to fix this but it'd be nice if I could have an image that I know is working for someone else as a final attempt. If that fails I'll just give up and finish it on PS4. I got my image from the  EF_SEGA_Dreamcast_GDI_Europe collection on archive.org. Tried a bunch of other images but they wouldn't even boot. If someone can confirm this archive.org image works for them without issue or can point me in the direction of an image that works for them, that would be helpful.",

      "content_preview": "So, for anyone not aware, the VM2 is a modern incarnation of the VMU, made by Dreamware Enterprises (which is literally one amazing guy, Chris, who lives in Greece). It was a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo (I was a backer, I got two, and only opened one until just recently), and they are available for pre-order (looks like they ran out of stock since I last looked) on dreammods.net Long story short about me, I’m a small Twitch streamer, who absolutely LOVES Skies of Arcadia. I’ve played it at least 10 times between English and Japanese Dreamcasts and Legends, have capped Pinta Quest on two VMU’s and mapped out which A-rank items you get for each square of the map (which I will be revealing to the public for the 25th anniversary of the game this year), and own all the First4Figures line-up (with Vyse version 2 pre-ordered as well). Also, for context, Pinta Quest is Skies of Arcadia’s VMU minigame that allows you to get items and gold that can be transferred into the main game, and at level 100, every item you find or trade you make gives you an A-rank item, which are things like great equipment, permanent stat-increasing items, etc. You can use it to sandbox your characters out of their archetype, or just plain break the game, if you want to have fun. So, how does all this factor into the VM2? Well, I was 3 weeks into my 7th “SundaysofArcadia” weekly stream, had reached Sailor’s Isle, unlocking Pinta Quest. During that week, toward the end of my work-day, my VM2 with my stream’s current save file and my Level 99 Pinta Quest game (this is #3, mind you: I intend to refine my A-rank item map even further) powered-down, and was 100% unresponsive to anything when I got it home. No charging, no sounds, no recognition from either the software or a Dreamcast, completely dead. So, I reached out to the manufacturer. We did some back and forth troubleshooting via e-mail, and he ascertained that I most likely had a defective power circuit (which he said was quite rare, and was “a first time to come across a similar situation”). So, I shipped it off to Greece to be repaired. He received it (after it was safe to do so, this was when the wildfires were happening there), and it was indeed the power circuit that had failed. Now, right before I had sent my VM2 over to be repaired, I had watched Adam Koralik’s review of the device, where he praised the VM2 developer, Chris, for the extra miles he was going for authenticity and compatibility with the product. Having now had my own experiences with the developer, and having my own notes on the product, I decided to offer my notes. I had noticed that the OEM VMU would go to sleep during Pinta Quest, which would mean a pair of 2032 batteries would last me a week and a half or so of casual use at work. In comparison, the VM2 would not go to sleep at all, and the same amount of use (with backlight off, I work outside) lasted less than 6 hours of the same casual usage (I would’ve been happy just to get 10-12). Chris told me he was working on sleep functionality, and asked me to provide more specifics on how the mini-game went into sleep mode on the OG VMU. After some testing and some back and forth, this developer had not only determined that this mini-game in particular had a different Sleep function, but had provided a solution (which would have the unit sleep but then awake in the regular menu). BUT WAIT, IT GETS BETTER! Because of the time zone difference and me working, before I could even respond, this guy sent another e-mail essentially saying “NEVERMIND, I REVISED THE WHOLE SLEEP CODE IT SO THAT IT WILL FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL PROGRAMING AND RESUME DURING GAMEPLAY AS NORMAL.” This developer, Dreamware Enterprises, goes above and beyond, and I am happy to have taken a part in helping to develop Firmware 1.5.5, which I had access to for about a week and a half before it went live earlier today. I talked about it on my Skies of Arcadia stream last Sunday, where I also showed off the features, but I wanted to get a post put out about the experience of having a passion for something, and allowing that passion to help you make a meaningful change in something you love. While I love and adore Skies of Arcadia, and want a remaster more than anything, I am grateful that my passion for it at least led to anyone else playing this mini-game on a VM2 to have a more genuine experience. I also took place in the “Save F4F Aika” Facebook campaign that helped lead to the amazing “beginning” of the SoA line of figures, which I hope has also helped to bring visibility to the game and brand. Oh, and the battery life? I took it to work with me with a full charge yesterday. Backlight off, just like the OG version. This thing lasted the whole day at work, same amount of use I normally give it, right along two VMU’s. Stayed in sleep mode for 16 hours and was still at ~50% battery. So, this is a huge upgrade, if you have a VM2, get the 1.5.5 firmware update today! The VM2 is a fantastic product, and it was a pure joy and pleasure to contribute to Chris’ efforts to give the most authentic Dreamcast and VMU experience possible. I can’t recommend the product or company enough, and if you have your own suggestions, or notice anything weird with games you enjoy with it, please provide him with the feedback! I hope you all have enjoyed my story into helping out in our little niche of entertainment and love! -BlueRogueReservoir, aka Captain Blue Rogue",

Games were a bit hit-and-miss as to whether they would work, or needed some serious tweaking to get them to work.

      "content_preview": "So I live in the UK, and the issue I'm having is that, with a particular game, the Dreamcast doesn't seem to be able to load the game past a certain point. Interacting with triggers that load more of the game, such as going through a door which loads a different room, or opening the inventory etc, will load more memory and then the game will just go to a black screen if it fails to load, which happens after the game has loaded a certain amount of content, I believe. Also if you idle in the game (stand still, or just stay in a menu for a while, etc) the crash will happen sooner. The crash is always triggered by interacting with something that will request something in the game to be loaded. At least, that's how I think it works. It is possible to beat the game by saving the game before the crash occurs, and just playing the game in short sessions and always saving. This issue is only with one specific game, but I've bought more than one copy so I know that it is an issue with the console. Based on what I've heard, I think maybe the capacitors need replacing, but I can't say for sure. I've tried to look for repair services in the UK but none of them say anything about the capacitors being replaced, and they also seem to offer modding services to improve the console, meanwhile I'm just wanting a console that works. Does anyone know any places worth trying out?",
