        "content": "Here is how it works: You submit an image link. It will be filtered. You will be sent an automated message, telling you all of this. You comment with a formatted text recipe. Once you complete steps 1 and 2, you will send the mods a modmail. We manually review your post and either approve it or coach you on what to do differently. Please be constructive with your comments! If you have a healthier option, please post that instead of discourse. moderators will remove comments or users who just sow discourse and do not add to the healthy discussions. It's just food but to some people, the recipes, images, discussions and interactions here can help them to get to a better place in their personal lives. We use reddiquete as a rule here and not just a good idea. Please help us grow the community. Remember, we come from a varied and diverse background, and all of us have different perceptions of what cheap and healthy means. There is no one right way to eat for all people and all budgets, and there is always room for improvement. Please keep things cordial and respectful, and if you think you have a better set of recipes, lead by example and post them! This means you cannot tell people that their content is not healthy, or you could be banned. No polls, surveys, research for school, no ads, limited self promotion, etc. Please be positive, constructive criticism is welcome but being mean is not. See our rules of engagement mantra for clarification. This also means that any arguments of dietary restrictions are not allowed, no matter which side you argue for. Nobody has time for that drama."

I have no idea how to properly shop for food, and I keep finding myself with no food by the end of the week. I usually get lunch meat, bread, cheese, produce, and eggs and shit. I'll also get the great value mac and cheese and ramen. My body feels horrible at all times because im kind of just eating trash. Can anybody help me put together a grocery list that will stretch for the week and not make me feel disgusting? Im also lowkey tired of not having snacks, but im not sure if thats in my budget. Thank you so much!Edit: Both of us can and do cook! Its not an issue of not wanting to cook, its just an issue of not knowing what TO cook or what ingredients we need",

Looking for real honey, nothing that is cut with with a bunch of sugar, so maybe from a larger reputable beekeeping organization. I would go local, but the local honey in my area is awful. Willing to buy in bulk. Thank you in advance!Edit: looking for recommendations for an organization based in the US, or a reputable organization that can ship here and still be affordable. Thank youEdit 2: aside from not looking for local honey because of taste preferences, I think the European honey bee out competes native bees in this fragile ecosystem. Would prefer to get something like orange blossom honey or buckwheat honey from an ecosystem that has already been created to provide for human populations.",

Unfortunately, after making it in my rice cooker (no spices) yesterday, I tried eating it plain and it quite literally killed my appetite because of the strong aroma. Definitely not possible to have it like rice, but probably it is an acquired taste. Still, having it plain literally made me nauseous and want to avoid   food for the past 24 hours lol",

      "content_preview": "Sharing in case it may inspire someone. This is something I do to make weeknight meal prep easier and save some money:I buy 6ish turkeys around Thanksgiving. In my area, they go for 50 cents a pound right near the holiday. I aim for 20lbs each. This puts me out about $60, which I realize is a bit. But...I roast a turkey every couple of months. For that initial meal, I'm fairly traditional. But, afterwards (like 2-3 days later, let's be honest), I chop/shred all the leftover meat, and simmer it with taco seasoning. I mix my own, but packets are fine. I then freeze it in 2-cup portions. Last turkey I did, we had dinner with 7 folks total, and I still had 15 bags of 2-cup portions.I use this meat for tacos, nachos, enchiladas... the weekly tex-mex meal and/or easy weekend lunches. When I'm exhausted, I can throw together nachos in 10 minutes and save us from running out for fast food. It's been wonderful.Also, there's no rule saying you must season the way I do. Leave some plain, or throw in Italian seasoning, or whatever you fancy. It's just been a great way for us to meal-prep and save money through the year.Next experiment: deboning and running one raw through the meat grinder for ground turkey. Will report back.",

      "content_preview": "My favorites:Switching car insurance every 6 monthsIf you haven’t checked your insurance rates in the last 6 months or so, do it.If you’re a good driver, your auto insurance rate should be dropping (not rising), cos you’re less of a risk to insure.They count on you not shopping around. Don’t let them win. Use a comparison site to find a better deal (I used this one: link here).Get cash back when you shop on AmazonAmazon isn’t always going to show you the best deals.Use a savings app like Capital One Shopping (Honey is good, too). It auto-compares prices and applies coupons while you shop. It’s free so prob worth a try.Find someone to help manage your moneyIf you can find the right financial advisor they’ll help make sense of your money and help you plan for the future.People with a good financial advisor can see yearly returns boosted by ~3% (Vanguard, 2019).If you don’t know one, try a comparison site to find someone with solid reviews (link here).",

But I am trying to figure out things that I can either make or buy from Costco or Trader Joe’s, that are still healthy but easy to put together/snack on throughout the day. I also want to mention  I am visually impaired, but that doesn’t mean that I still can’t figure out how to put together a meal or even a healthy snack. I would appreciate any suggestions",

Aside from the initial stock up of spices and grains this keeps our meals interesting and low effort while allowing flexibility for what sounds good to us that day.It requires a bit of improv and a stocked pantry, but we've been using it for years and it works like a charm. We also base our choices that week on what's seasonal/on sale and at this point have some solid rotational meals we can default to when mental energy is low.",

Along the way, something changed and now I really don’t like cooking. I really WANT to like it, I love looking at recipes and reading about different cultures and different foods. But after I’ve done all the shopping necessary (which is expensive for recipes?) prepped the food, tried to cook it, and cleaned up the whole mess…I just don’t have enough energy to like it. Oftentimes i don’t even like the food I cooked.I lost a couple of hobbies when I started showing signs of depression, and the fatigue only gives me so much energy to do the things I want/need to do during the day. I can function fine, but I often struggle with fatigue, which makes it hard to really enjoy cooking. I guess I really just want to feel curious and passionate about it again. I don’t know where to start. Advice appreciated, but please be gentle.",
