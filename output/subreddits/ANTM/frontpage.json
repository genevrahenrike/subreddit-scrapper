      "content_preview": "I believe it was Season 11 when a semi-finalist had just graduated from Harvard with a degree in English.  So of course, Tyra immediately wanted to knock her down.  Tyra said \"Who was your favorite heroine in English literature?\" The girl was like \"Um.... don't remember much.\" Tyra with faux incredulity: \"How about Jane Eyre? REBECCA?\"   Later, to the judges \"Why is it that I didn't go to an Ivy League school and here I am tossing out British and American literature...\"  We get it, Tyra.  This girl is not as smart as you are, degree notwithstanding. Welllllllll...... yes, there is a famous British novel called Rebecca.  But the heroine is not named Rebecca.  Rebecca does not appear as a character in the book.  She is the deceased first wife of the heroine's husband (not a spoiler, btw).  Clearly Tyra just googled \"British literature\" and wrote down a couple titles with women's names. And yes, I guess you could make some argument that Rebecca is somehow still the heroine of the book despite not being in it, but I'm going to go ahead and say that's not what Tyra meant.",

      "content_preview": "My Thoughts on all of the Cycle 16 contestants: Nicole, Monique, Hannah - All three of them have a very safe and/or mens magazine apperance. That is why Monique could have used a short bob. Side note, I think Monique looks a little East Asian. They had so many better options, much more edgy girls that they could have cast from the semi finalists Rune - This is an example of a contestant Tyra loves, really goes against the mold of a beauty, the thing is, I think their look went a little too far out the mold and the pixie cut wasn't a great idea. Brittany - She had the winner edit, this was a good casting choice, I didnt dislike any of her pictures. Dominique, Kasia - Also have a mens magazine look but their look is a little more atypical, they wiped that look away from Dominique but Kasia could have had her hair dyed black instead. Dalya/Mikaela - They both have an edgy modelesque look I just think they had next to no character development for the show. Ondrei - Her bee photo is one I actually found to be gorgeous. I dont think she quit because of the reason she gave, I think she quit because the fake out was too much for her to handle. Alexandria - I think shes a great model, I like her look even more with the cycle 17 hair. To me that hair was very fashionable. Jaclyn, Angelina - Their backstage photos at the first panel are my favorites, there I said it, both pictures draw me in, like the panel said these photos have mystery and are cinematic, I actually think they both dont look like themselves, chameleons.",

      "content_preview": "I hope you‚Äôre sitting on the toilet or avoiding doing something productive, because mama has words on words on words for you. This cycle gets a lot of hate for the precise reasons I just watched it twice in a row. Let me try and convince you why it‚Äôs worth a rewatch: The fuckery is high, both literal and metaphorical. Mikey would have fucked a Property Brother if that was all that was available. And you can‚Äôt tell me that Mam√© did not suck his peep in that cold little cabin, which is a sentence I both never thought I‚Äôd type and stand behind firmly. Also, Mam√©, holy shit, what a face. Justin was so physically gorgeous but anyone calling themselves J-Smooth needs FAR more shaming than this thirsty ass fandom is willing to show. Courtney had my favorite unique look and could take an amazing photo, but that child was mentally about 12. Had she been well-educated (not a slight at her, she grew up poor and with many serious responsibilities she shouldn‚Äôt have needed to take on) and naturally more curious about learning, she would have the grounds to build her confidence, know references, and really crush it as a Nylon-type It girl. But she was just too naive beneath the very cool look, buck teeth included. Courtney walked so that girl on White Lotus S3 could run. Bella had no good goddamn business being on that show. She was not modelesque in person or in photos, she booked not a damn thing, those Tijuana eyes were botched, and that crown made Jade rise from her ANTM grave yelling ‚ÄúBroke ass crown, those ain‚Äôt even real diamonds‚Äù. I am glad that along with coming out as trans, she came out as photoshopping that fuck ass blue-eyed baby picture and showed us that she was finally accepting herself for who she is now. I‚Äôll bet she is a LOT more chill as a human now, and she looks a thousand times better with her natural eyes. Devin. I knew he would be a key part of Top Model‚Äôs humiliation ritual the moment I clocked the producers using the same ‚ÄúHA HA HA‚Äù Devin laugh audio four times in a row while zooming in on his crazy eyes.¬† Devin has a polarizing look to be sure, but I love a weird ass look, and I thought he photographed pretty well‚Ä¶but his photos did not keep him in the competition: his ‚ÄúSmell my fieeeeyaace‚Äù fuckery did. And I‚Äôm ok with that. He is like a martian who came to earth imitating a human after only having access to a VHS of ‚ÄúParis is Burning‚Äù and I found that highly entertaining. Tyra showed up in her Harvard Business School wig and said ‚ÄúI am here to promote my baby daddy Erik, my entrepreneurial besties, and my MLM, and that‚Äôs about the fuck it.‚Äù It‚Äôs as if Tyra just said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a shit if the photoshoots call back to my days in Paris, here‚Äôs a list of my investors and you just make sure there‚Äôs a challenge that involves them and call me when it‚Äôs time to put my business wig on.‚Äù Tyra has the ambition and discipline to be successful, but she lacks the ability to understand that she is not a good creative. She is not a visionary. She is not a wordsmith. That makeup pyramid scheme would have been a dumb look in 2008, but alas, Tyra‚Äôs delusion makes for incredible reality TV, so we have to thank her and her Suze Orman pussycat wig for it. When Kelly said the seed money prize for the models‚Äô pitches was $2500 I had to rewind and made sure I heard that bitch correctly. What the fuck is that seed going to help grow? A single shipment of blank socks from Vietnam? I swear Mam√© heard ‚Äú$25,000‚Äù because she was gooped, going like ‚ÄúThat is life-changing money‚Äù. The utter BUDGET of it all. Speaking of budget, they took these nice people to Las fucking Vegas as their destination. It was giving ‚Äúsomeone core to our production staff is dealing with legal issues and cannot leave the country at this time.‚Äù On a serious note, it pissed me off that so few contestants put effort into communicating with Nyle. But it‚Äôs not like the show is known for contestants who are eager to communicate with people who do it differently, such as the neurodivergent contestants. I get that everyone had to be focused on themselves and that this is not America‚Äôs Next Top Best Friend, but the few people who did take time for Nyle went a long way in my book. Speaking of Lacey, while I really liked that she was inclusive of Nyle (if only because she thought he was straight and found him hot and sexually non-threatening) I just personally can‚Äôt stand someone who just constantly speaks so‚Ä¶ produced in their talking heads. But I have to remember in my near-middle age that she was a kid from a small town and was just trying to be like other TV personalities when she appeared on TV. Speaking of kids, I always have to remind myself that these people are young, often come from fucked up situations, and are flung into a fantasy world with no mental preparation. Mikey was 26 when he got on the show, and while it‚Äôs fair to say he was a cocky womanizer with one look, I have to give him the grace I give all of them kids. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an abusive sociopath, I think he is someone who had piss poor role models living in near poverty who has natural charisma and good looks: the combination of all these components will never not make a Mikey at 26 years old on ANTM. It would be a miracle if on top of being disciplined and ambitious he was ALSO an emotionally intelligent gentleman at that part of his life. I hope now at 36 he used that $2500 seed money to start therapy and has identified his issues with women. Kelly is not a bitch, she‚Äôs that bitch. She has the soul of an artist but knows she is not especially artistically creative, so she channels her talents into uplifting other artists and brands and I love someone who knows their lane and rocks it. At first Kelly gave me jealous bully vibes at times, but when she mama bear‚Äôd Alexa the Barbie, I really loved that. And I love that she shows no favoritism and treats everyone the exact same way; when she cut off Nyle for hemming and hawing too much when answering a question, I bet you that made Nyle feel fucking great. Because she was not coddling him as if he needed to be handled with kid gloves for his hearing impairment, she was treating him like any other model. Love her. Yu Tsai was real as fuck when he said to Alexa ‚ÄúYou got bullied because you‚Äôre pretty. I got bullied because I‚Äôm ugly! I get it, but I don‚Äôt let any of that stuff break me down.‚Äù Let‚Äôs end with Alexa: the Barbie doll gone too soon. As a pretty bitch with breast implants myself, I had a soft spot for Alexa. But as a girl who also absolutely cannot adjust to a loud, chaotic, people-filled home environment smoothly, I completely understood Alexa. I didn‚Äôt see her as leaving because she felt too good for the competition or unwilling to put the work in, I think that for some people like us, it is extremely mentally hard to be around so many people 24/7 on top of the pressure of being judged for your looks. She once struggled with anorexia (again, she‚Äôs my soul sister in that) and that is a disorder always linked with anxiety, and I think it was a very wise choice for her mental health to remove herself from the competition when she realized just how anxious this was going to make her. It does not make you a lesser person to know your own mental limits, because where someone else may have more fortitude for handling stress, they may not have something emotionally or mentally valuable that you do have. No one has it all, and no one should be expected to. I hope her and her implants are doing well.",
