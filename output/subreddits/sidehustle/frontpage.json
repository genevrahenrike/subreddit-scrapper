      "content_preview": "I see a lot of people looking for quick hacks, but honestly, there’s no easy way to build a side hustle. I tried dozens of things that went nowhere before I finally found something that actually worked for me.For context, I’ve been using Reddit as my main traffic source. With consistency, I now make $10–$20 a day. It’s not life-changing money, but it’s real and it adds up and most importantly, it actually works without ads or upfront costs.Here’s what it took:A full month of consistency and frustration. Most days I felt like I was wasting time, but I kept posting and engaging.Finding the right subreddits. Places where people are genuinely asking for help or looking for solutions.Joining the conversation. Not spamming just sharing useful insights, then slowly pointing people to resources.Using AI as a helper. I don’t fully generate posts, but I use AI to brainstorm ideas, organize thoughts, and save time.It took effort, but once a few posts hit, the results snowballed. One comment of mine got 1,300+ upvotes and drove traffic for days. Another post brought 60 downloads of a free guide in less than 24 hours.I put together a manual breaking down the process step by step (from subreddit research to posting strategies), because I know how confusing it feels at the start. But the key lesson is this: don’t expect easy money, Expect to grind for a month before seeing results.If you stick with it, even small side hustles like this can become reliable streams of income.",

There’s a worksheet, but the math just makes my head spin. I don’t want to owe a big amount at tax time, but I also don’t want to give away too much of my paycheck every two weeks.It feels like the whole system is designed to be confusing on purpose.

Honestly thought it would be way more complicated but its been pretty solid so far.Been hitting up estate sales and garage sales on weekends, mostly looking for solid wood pieces that just need some TLC. My first flip was this beat up dining table for $25 that I sanded down and restained. Sold it for $180 on marketplace within like 4 days.The key seems to be knowing what people actually want vs what I think looks good. Mid century modern stuff and farmhouse style sells super fast. I've been putting aside about 30% of profits to reinvest in better tools and supplies.Best part is I can work on pieces in my garage whenever I have free time. Made around $800 last month from Stake as well which honestly blew my mind. Not gonna quit my day job but its definitely helping with some financial goals I've got.Anyone else doing furniture flips? What pieces have worked best for you guys?",

I've been thinking about starting a financial coaching business. This is not like a financial advisor who needs to be licensed and can provide investment advice, but rather someone who sits with you and reviews your finances (income, debt, financial goals) and comes up with a plan on how to achieve it. They help make plans to pay down debt, set savings goals, and offer financial education so you are aware of different savings and investment options (again, not offering advice on any specific investment or stock portfolio). It seems similar in structure to therapy sessions but focused on discussions around finances rather than mental health.I've done some research and it seems like companies out there charge $100 a month or more for a 15-30min monthly checkin. I honestly don't think this kind of service is worth that much, and would be fine charging half that rate. I am wondering if anyone has any experience in this and can provide insight into whether it is worth it or not.Thanks!",

May-July are typically over $25k+ gross due to spring and summer.Was working from home full-time due to COVID and just started washing houses in my neighborhood as a side hustle. This scaled into washing over 300+ houses annually mostly via word of mouth.

      "content_preview": "If you're looking for a side hustle that takes no effort or confidence to set up, stop reading.if you want a straightforward business idea that takes mid-level amounts of effort, has lots of upside, and can be turned passive, keep reading.I work at a company that had over 100 support staff.We implemented Intercom and their AI tool. With that, we have been able to deflect 80% of the incoming support requests that we used to have real people answer.This made me realize that there's a massive opportunity for people toImplement & Manage AI Support For CompaniesHere's the playbook I would recommend:find companies with large support staff and reach out on linkedin. spray and pray to anyone who is a manager of support or higher in the company. who cares if they don't respond?offer to help them find the best tool and estimate their cost savings for free. just ask chat GPT to do this analysis for you and make it look semi decent in a spreadsheet and powerpoint. who would say no to a free report on how much money you can save? this will get your foot in the door and build credibility.offer to implement it for an up front fee. justify the cost based on the cost saving. you can ask for like 10% - 20% of annual savings. if you're forecasting to cut 80% of a 100+ person team, that's a fat chunk of change.offer to manage the tool and knowlege base ongoing for a monthly retainer of 5% - 10%. this is really easy. you just see what problems the AI can't solve, then get info from the company about how to answer the questions and add it to the knowledge base.do the first one or two yourself, then take advantage of labor arbitrage because this is actually a non-technical thing to do. go on upwork and hire people out of Pakistan or Phillipines for $5 - $10 / hr and have them do all the work. then your job is just finding new clients and basic oversight.This is non-technical enough that you can easily do a great job for one client while working a full time job.The funny thing is, as you get bigger, you can either outsource everything and offer an okay experience to your customers or just quit your job and do this full time and watch alex hormozi videos all day about how to scale and work on acquisition and retention.I mean I think this is a great idea, but it's my idea so I'm biased. Lmk what you think.PS if you think this was thought of or written by AI, then please do us all a favor, get off reddit go outside and get back in touch with reality. Thx :)",

Please share what it is and how much it paid.Here’s my list:Answering surveys on various sites mentioned on this subreddit before like Prolific/UserTesting/CloudConnect. This can be hit or miss but you HAVE to be early to apply so I’ve been refreshing them nonstop. $220 made so far in August. Also I have a theory if they see you answer more surveys you get more opportunities so the hardest part is in the beginning. They also reject not based on personal things as much as the fact they already got too many participants so be early. I also don’t want to recommend any 1 survey site as I’ve had ups and downs with each of them.Promoting my ghostwriting services on Craigslist.com with classified ads. Mostly eulogies, cover letters, resumes, best man speeches, etc. I promote in my local area but I don’t meet anyone in person so this could be done remotely if you’re not in USA probably. I get paid through PayPal or Venmo 50% upfront and 50% when I submit. Made $390 so far in August. Probably took me 3 hours of actual writing and 1 hour of making classifieds and posting them & email back & forth with the client before they pay. I am hoping to scale this up and will form an LLC for this. (Yes I do use ChatGPT to help me out but you still have to proofread. Most customers are elderly or English is their 2nd language).Last month got my first adsense payout from YouTube. Been making those Reddit story & texting story videos using Vubo.ai and posting to YouTube Shorts 2 times a day. Took me 31 days from start until I reached monetization eligibility. The payment from adsense for August so far will be $431.72 as of today. I also did two sponsored posts and was paid $200 via PayPal. I spend about half an hour a day after work on this. If you want to get inspired just go to YouTube and choose shorts then search “Reddit stories” and then make similar videos. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel just copy what’s already working for others.Been trying to be a “remote closer” for a coaching company but so far didn’t close anything. It’s one of those things you work your own hours but idk if I just suck at it or it’s my confidence or if their leads are just bad. I will report back if I’m able to make anything from this.In total I spend about 20 hours per month on this excluding the time I wasted on trying to do the remote closing thing.Now please share yours so we can all grow. What’s working? How much do you make? And how long does it take you? Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "Here’s a little background info: A good friend of mine is trying to start a digital product business and sell things like digital planners, Notion templates, wallpapers, and stickers/clipart packs. She also has no background in design or business, no degree, and no real experience with software like Photoshop or Canva. She’s trying to teach herself everything from scratch, and the only tool she has that’s been remotely helpful is ChatGPT.She’s been feeling totally overwhelmed by where to start, so she came up with this idea:She wrote a really detailed prompt explaining her goals, tools, and limitations. She is basically asking ChatGPT to act as a brand and product coach for someone who knows nothing about starting a business. But instead of just running it once, she wants to feed that same prompt into multiple versions of ChatGPT (GPT-5, GPT-5 Agent Mode as well as the legacy models GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-3.5) to get different perspectives.Then she plans to combine all their feedback into one doc, send it back to the models again, and ask them to create a “master plan” based on everyone’s input.I honestly don’t know if this is kind of genius or just dumb lolSo Reddit, is this a clever way to use ChatGPT for guidance, or is it unnecessarily complicated? And if she is doing too much, what would be a more effective (but beginner-friendly) way to get started using ChatGPT for this kind of business?Thanks in advance for any advice.",

I've had so many friends that call themselves online gurus and what's not and it's just bs. They're just trying to get people to get the money well never actually producing a product themselves.That being said the legitimate side hustles that did exist have mostly been eradicated.It's a problem, freelancing is getting decimated by artificial intelligence and it's just going to get harder.We need to be honest about this.I was horrified to assist some people in this community to try to apply for thousands of different gigs and jobs online and for all of them to get rejected except for one or two.It's extremely hard out there and it's time to be transparent..",

You’ve got ideas, maybe even some momentum, but you’re still that one person behind the laptop.I’ve joined Discords, Slack groups, “networking” forums ..and 90% of it felt like noise. Endless intros, no actual building. The flip side is sites that make it feel like you’re applying for a job instead of testing an idea.So I hacked together a little web app called CollabCY. It’s super simple:Post your startup or side hustle idea (even half-baked ones)List what kind of help you’re looking for (design, tech, marketing, etc.)Or browse open ideas and join as a teammate A few people already posted stuff, and I noticed how different it feels when the goal is purely action, not just talking.I’m not trying to “pitch” this .. just genuinely curious:Do you think this solves a real problem?As a solo builder / hustler, what would you expect here?Any obvious red flags I should fix early. Link’s in my profile if anyone wants to poke around  but even just your feedback here would help me not build in a vacuum. And we have an empty chair for co founder - if you can market it well with us.join us .",

      "content_preview": "I’m gonna be straight with you for a second.I’ve been lurking on this sub for a while, and there’s one thing I keep noticing:most people here will never actually make a single dollar online/offline.Not because they aren’t smart.Not because the ideas don’t work.But because they’re stuck in “idea-hunting mode.”Scrolling. Saving posts. Asking “what’s the best side hustle right now?”Over and over.Here’s the truth:there is no “perfect” hustle waiting for you.There’s only the one youpickand actually do something with. Because the truth is that majority of hustles work, it's just about how you execute them and make it different to the others that are about.A quick story:2 years ago, I was in the exact same spot.I had no job, no connections, nothing lined up.But I had a laptop, Wi-Fi, and decent free time.I spent weeks bouncing between YouTube videos, blog posts, Reddit threads, just like this one. My brain was full, but my pockets were empty.Then it hit me:If I didn’tstart, I’d be in the same place 6 months later.So I picked one simple model:selling digital products online.It was a popular model. Low-no startup costs. Keep about 95% profits. I was intrigued...I created my first product on Canva. It was not ugly but not great. I didn’t know what I was doing.But I listed it anyway.That single messy start led me down a path that turned into consistent sales. All that experience I've been able to gain from the digital product space, including marketing techniques is what allowed to me have 4 successful digital product businesses just making money in my sleep.All that trial and error. Creating top quality thumbnail images, quality descriptions, quality products, setting the best pricing points, and so on...Not because I found the “secret hack.”But because I actuallydid something..Here’s the thing:Side hustles don’t fail. People quit too early. And I'll be honest that used to be me too!The guy who edits YouTube videos?His first gigs paid $20, now creators beg to get on his calendar at $300 a pop.The girl crushing it with TikTok shops?She probably posted 50 videos before one popped.The ones who “get lucky” usually just stayed in the game long enough for \"luck\" to finally show up.So if you’re here endlessly scrolling for your golden ticket, here’s the blunt truth:You’ll stay broke until you pick something and do it consistently.That’s it. That’s the formula.I’ll wrap it here.If you’re serious, stop waiting for “the one perfect idea.”Pick something. Start ugly. Refine as you go.This quote will always stick with me - \"Done is better than perfect\"That’s how people actually make money.Not by saving another thread to their “side hustle” folder.                                                                       Stop lurking and start building.",

More like a habit at this point.Anyone else do this? Do you just treat it as a little fun side thing? Or do you actually try to squeeze real money out of it? Curious what other people do.",

Whenever I pick a side hustle, I start thinking of other side hustles and can never stick with one…!This side hustle that I choose I will want it to replace my main income in preferably about two years, giving me the flexibility (preferably) of working from anywhere in the world. I would want it to replace my current monthly income. I can realistically put in 4 hours a day 5 days a week.Thankfully, I have a decent job with decent work-life balance, and I have good social skills. I make about $7.5K CAD (5.5K USD) per month.I’ve thought about:Video-editing Digital marketing Faceless YouTube (I don’t have the hard skills neither the capital to launch this) Subcontracting (I feel it sounds easier said than done) Lead-gen (no idea how it would be executed)I read about others side hustles and they sound interesting and I start daydreaming about me doing those.Help me stick with one side hustle! Offer me some advice. I appreciate you!",

      "content_preview": "And these are sales and posters that otherwise wouldn't have existed 🤪To give a bit of background, I got into print on demand around 2021, and began selling posters on Etsy. I had a lot of success, and made what was quite a crazy amount of money for a Uni student lol. I had a bit of an up and down journey (including getting banned on Etsy for copyright infringement, oops)But eventually, I began selling posters again, whilst living in Thailand. During this time I started posting on TikTok and grew a bit of a following, where naturally I started talking about how I'm self employed from Print on Demand. A lot of people were interested in doing the same, so this is where I got the idea to start a Print on Demand company - PrintShrimp!I'd built up a network of poster printers throughout my time in POD, so I thought I could package up these printers and create a Print on Demand company - so that is exactly what me and my friend did! We started about a year and a half ago, and it's been a long journey where we've made a hell of a lot of mistakes, but I wouldn't change any of it for the worldAnd we recently crossed the 50,000 mark of posters processed through PrintShrimp! What is crazy is that about 75% of our customers were previously not selling posters (used to be 100% when we started!). We began by creating customers ourselves, through teaching people how to sell posters. And yes, we teach for free! This is because we make our money from the results, not selling the knowledge.That's how you know it is good information 🤪 Like I said this has been a long road to get to this point. We are thrilled with 50,000 prints but feel like we are just getting started. Everything has been done with just two of us too, including building the whole platform, which we're quite proud of 😅Hope this was a cool read, I'm happy to answer any questions about the journey. And if you want to check out the free guides and community we have about selling posters, just google PrintShrimp. You'll be able to find it all :)",

Now I’m starting over and trying to get clients but there’s gonna an earnings gap while I build momentum.I could really use ideas on how to get some extra cash for 1-2months. I had done some task rabbit in the past and liked it.In terms of location and skills, I live in a rural/suburban town 30ish min  outside Louisville which for the unfamiliar is a decent sized city. Besides being a certified personal trainer and nutrition coach I am also a certified CrossFit coach. I’ve gotten feedback that I’m good at it. Besides that I am handy, pretty much any straightforward DIY jobs I can do. For instance, so far this year I repaired the drywall in our garage and painted it, and installed all new flooring through the entire house. I’m very good at assembly as well as I grew up working on my own cars.  Ive spent most of my working life in inventory management, as well as training and development. I’ve got a good set up in terms of tools, and a reliable truck (Nissan frontier). My wife is primary income so the big thing I’m trying to do is help ensure we don’t have to cut into too much of our savings. If I need to make a small investment I can but need to recoup the money almost immediately.So with all that, I wanted to see what others ideas would be in terms of best options? Ie where I can get the best return on my time investment",

Things like babysitting, elderly care, dog walking, or cleaning people's homes etc. Not just that but also even online side hustles don't work. For example, I see the ideas like Online Surveys that pay, play games to get paid, TikTok Seller Shop, most affiliate programs etc.Things like online surveys, you complete the surveys but all the time they don't pay claiming you are not qualified for it. Other ideas like TikTok Seller Shop and affiliate programs are not available. Ad platforms that monetize content like Google Adsense etc. also pay very low.I see people asking for online side hustler ideas to earn as low as $80 per month, which leaves me wondering if those play games to earn or online surveys also don't work in America etc.I thought it could be easier over there and someone can setup multiple online side hustles. For instance, I can do quite a number of things on the internet from automated content creation, design, create web content, No face YouTube videos, web content (blogs) etc. But over here it is nearly pointless because the revenue you will generate can even be less than the cost of running the side hustle (subscriptions for AI, web hosting etc.) because of the low rates they pay.So, does it mean those side hustlers don't work over there as well?",

Do you get to make your own hours? How much does it pay typically? And do you need to be sort of like a salesperson and make your profile really catchy and sort of sell yourself? Do you work on a platform like italki.com or do you work for a company? And do I need a certification? Any info or tips is helpful. Thanks!",

I do electric work for the union from 5am-3pm, and with being a first year have no extra money left over.I love art and drawing is my favorite hobby, however I just don’t have the time to look for clients in order to do commissions or such.Any ideas on how I can get around $500 within 3 days? In all honesty, any hustle/idea that can get me money outside of the 5am to 3pm timeframe would be amazing!",
