My main job is full time, and then I work about 15–20 hours a week at the side gig. Both jobs withhold taxes, but my paychecks feel like they’re shrinking faster than they should.I tried reading about how multiple jobs affect your W-4, and honestly, I don’t get it. There’s a worksheet, but the math just makes my head spin. I don’t want to owe a big amount at tax time, but I also don’t want to give away too much of my paycheck every two weeks.It feels like the whole system is designed to be confusing on purpose. Has anyone else here worked two jobs and figured out how to set up their withholding correctly?",

Whenever I pick a side hustle, I start thinking of other side hustles and can never stick with one…!This side hustle that I choose I will want it to replace my main income in preferably about two years, giving me the flexibility (preferably) of working from anywhere in the world. I would want it to replace my current monthly income. I can realistically put in 4 hours a day 5 days a week.Thankfully, I have a decent job with decent work-life balance, and I have good social skills. I make about $7.5K CAD (5.5K USD) per month.I’ve thought about:Video-editing Digital marketing Faceless YouTube (I don’t have the hard skills neither the capital to launch this) Subcontracting (I feel it sounds easier said than done) Lead-gen (no idea how it would be executed)I read about others side hustles and they sound interesting and I start daydreaming about me doing those.Help me stick with one side hustle!

      "content_preview": "The Problem with Most Side HustlesMost side hustles have deal-breaker limitations: dropshipping requires massive ad spend and thin margins, affiliate marketing means you're promoting other people's products with no control, and traditional content creation means your face becomes your brand forever.The side hustle everyone's talking about but few are actually doing? AI influencers.Why This Actually WorksIf you scroll TikTok, you've seen those talking baby videos or AI personalities getting millions of views.They're businesses generating real money through AdSense, brand deals, and product promotions.Here's why this beats most side hustles:No face required: Stay completely anonymous while building a following Scalable content: Create daily videos without being camera-ready Multiple revenue streams: AdSense, sponsorships, affiliate marketing, product sales Low overhead: No inventory, shipping, or customer service headaches The Real OpportunityMajor platforms are pushing AI content because it keeps users engaged longer. That means better organic reach for creators who understand how to use these tools effectively.The biggest barrier for most people starting social media businesses is personal exposure and time commitment. AI influencers solve both problems.What You Need to Get StartedTools likeAIpersonality.videoandautoshorts.ai. generate content and create AI influencers.Unlike drop shipping or other side hustles where you're competing with established players using the exact same methods, this space is still early enough to build real advantages.The Revenue RealityThis isn't get-rich-quick, but it's more scalable than most side hustles. You're building digital assets that can generate revenue whether you're actively working or not.Compare that to gig work, freelancing, or reselling where your income stops when you stop working.Why Now?The technology is mature enough to be accessible but early enough that most people haven't figured it out yet. Audiences are already engaging with AI content at massive scale.If you've been looking for a side hustle that doesn't require showing your face, huge capital, or competing in oversaturated markets, this is worth investigating while it's still relatively uncrowded.",

I've been thinking about starting a financial coaching business. This is not like a financial advisor who needs to be licensed and can provide investment advice, but rather someone who sits with you and reviews your finances (income, debt, financial goals) and comes up with a plan on how to achieve it. They help make plans to pay down debt, set savings goals, and offer financial education so you are aware of different savings and investment options (again, not offering advice on any specific investment or stock portfolio). It seems similar in structure to therapy sessions but focused on discussions around finances rather than mental health.I've done some research and it seems like companies out there charge $100 a month or more for a 15-30min monthly checkin. I honestly don't think this kind of service is worth that much, and would be fine charging half that rate. I am wondering if anyone has any experience in this and can provide insight into whether it is worth it or not.Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "If you're looking for a side hustle that takes no effort or confidence to set up, stop reading.if you want a straightforward business idea that takes mid-level amounts of effort, has lots of upside, and can be turned passive, keep reading.I work at a company that had over 100 support staff.We implemented Intercom and their AI tool. With that, we have been able to deflect 80% of the incoming support requests that we used to have real people answer.This made me realize that there's a massive opportunity for people toImplement & Manage AI Support For CompaniesHere's the playbook I would recommend:find companies with large support staff and reach out on linkedin. spray and pray to anyone who is a manager of support or higher in the company. who cares if they don't respond?offer to help them find the best tool and estimate their cost savings for free. just ask chat GPT to do this analysis for you and make it look semi decent in a spreadsheet and powerpoint. who would say no to a free report on how much money you can save? this will get your foot in the door and build credibility.offer to implement it for an up front fee. justify the cost based on the cost saving. you can ask for like 10% - 20% of annual savings. if you're forecasting to cut 80% of a 100+ person team, that's a fat chunk of change.offer to manage the tool and knowlege base ongoing for a monthly retainer of 5% - 10%. this is really easy. you just see what problems the AI can't solve, then get info from the company about how to answer the questions and add it to the knowledge base.do the first one or two yourself, then take advantage of labor arbitrage because this is actually a non-technical thing to do. go on upwork and hire people out of Pakistan or Phillipines for $5 - $10 / hr and have them do all the work. then your job is just finding new clients and basic oversight.This is non-technical enough that you can easily do a great job for one client while working a full time job.The funny thing is, as you get bigger, you can either outsource everything and offer an okay experience to your customers or just quit your job and do this full time and watch alex hormozi videos all day about how to scale and work on acquisition and retention.I mean I think this is a great idea, but it's my idea so I'm biased. Lmk what you think.PS if you think this was thought of or written by AI, then please do us all a favor, get off reddit go outside and get back in touch with reality. Thx :)",

I would love to make at-least a minimum of $10 a week or something close to that.I have looked at many options, currently writing a book and plan on publishing it, though, highly likely to be accused of using AI with how this generation is… might be able to get me a few bucks but who knows.Edit: I would love to be able to do flight school, learn how to fly a Piper Super Cub or some sort of small plane related to that, a bush plane pretty much, my state allows for two years of free community college in which I would also like to do a course that allows me to be around children as I work really well with them.",

Post your one-liner, get blunt feedback, and leave at least one helpful reply for someone else. The goal is clarity, not poetry, clear beats clever every time.How to use this thread: paste your current one-liner and the context below. People will \"roast\" it by pointing out jargon, missing outcomes, or fuzzy promises, then suggest a crisper version. Keep it constructive and specific so folks can ship updates today.Copy/paste template:• One-liner (as you say it now):• Audience (who you help):• Outcome (what they get, in plain words):• Timeframe / scope (how fast, how much):• Link to one-pager or example (optional):What good looks like:Fuzzy: “I help brands with social media.”Sharp: “I write 10 ready-to-post Instagram captions for café owners in 48 hours, including hashtags and a seasonal promo, €75 flat.”Drop yours below. If you critique, offer a rewrite that’s shorter, more specific, and outcome-focused. By the end of this thread, everyone should leave with a one-liner that someone outside the niche can instantly understand and say “yes” to.",

      "content_preview": "hi guys! i’ve been trying out Whop and wanted to share a few things i learned.1/ the biggest one is to only join programs that still have a good chunk of their budget left (imo at least 60%). if it’s almost drained, you can end up posting clips that get views but don’t actually pay out.2/ another thing is consistency matters way more than perfection. we already know that platforms like tt/shorts/reels love it when you post daily, which means payouts grow with volume. captions or subtitles also make a big difference since a lot of people scroll with sound off (but you already know this, so i won't bore you with useless tips)3/ don’t lock yourself into one program. the same video can turn into 10 clips, and if you spread those across different Whops you multiply your earnings. the cool part is you’re not just earning from Whop either!!when you also post those clips on Tiktok, Reels, Shorts, you can stack platform payouts too. yeah it works better if you have some audience, but short-form growth is easier these days with the consistency from step #2.hope this helps anybody. happy to answer questions!!",

      "content_preview": "For those of us outside USA/CA/EU, in Africa to be specific, most of the side hustles and passive income ideas don't work. Things like babysitting, elderly care, dog walking, or cleaning people's homes etc. Not just that but also even online side hustles don't work. For example, I see the ideas like Online Surveys that pay, play games to get paid, TikTok Seller Shop, most affiliate programs etc.Things like online surveys, you complete the surveys but all the time they don't pay claiming you are not qualified for it. Other ideas like TikTok Seller Shop and affiliate programs are not available. Ad platforms that monetize content like Google Adsense etc. also pay very low.I see people asking for online side hustler ideas to earn as low as $80 per month, which leaves me wondering if those play games to earn or online surveys also don't work in America etc.I thought it could be easier over there and someone can setup multiple online side hustles. For instance, I can do quite a number of things on the internet from automated content creation, design, create web content, No face YouTube videos, web content (blogs) etc. But over here it is nearly pointless because the revenue you will generate can even be less than the cost of running the side hustle (subscriptions for AI, web hosting etc.) because of the low rates they pay.So, does it mean those side hustlers don't work over there as well?",

I obviously am just starting up, so I need to do it as cheaply as possible while still maintaining some ethics, but when I google custom clothing or clothing manufacturing, I never seem to find what I need.
