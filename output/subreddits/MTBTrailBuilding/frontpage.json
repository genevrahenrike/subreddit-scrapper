I hate to just leave it so I whipped out my two saws and got to work. It was a small diameter tree but whatever kind of wood that is, it was HARD. This tree looks like it died during the Clinton administration. Normally I prefer leaving the trees that fall naturally on the trail and letting them become part of the trail. But this one fell and wedged itself up on some live trees, thats was just no way to keep it. I have a regular basic folding saw that I did most of the cutting with. Its pretty sharp but really struggled. I also have a \"manual\" chainsaw or rope chainsaw or whatever you call those. It works well on certain kinds of wood, but on really hard wood it just jams up constantly and doesn't really cut. Oh well, I got it done eventually. https://www.instagram.com/p/DNnA7L9uJxb/",

For context this individual has intentionally removed screws and bolts from features, making them unsafe, as well as tagging items in an attempt to lay blame on local bikers.  This individual has been warned many times by local police but continues to do such activities since no one is able to get conclusive video or photo evidence.  The individual knows where all the trail camera are placed and knows how to avoid being caught in the act.  I will not name said individual nor should anyone else because that would encourage more actions from the individual. The post about a broken board and “unsafe features” is this person’s way of seeking validation and attention.",

Now a week has passed and now I remember all of those bumps in the trail I used to ding my rims on! This line is for a roll thats optionally a drop. Anyway, when I need gravel or fine gravel or sand, its easy to \"mine\" that off of fire roads in the woods. But what to do when what you really, really need is good, clay rich dirt? If you go to a garden center and order some dirt, you're getting top soil. No clay, all organics , terrible to smooth out a trail with. You can get rough fill for free from construction sites all over the place, but its NEVER screened. Its always half rocks half dirt. This is new england, you can't sink a shovel without hitting rocks. Its all rocks. Speaking of, yeah I could probably find a spot somewhere near by where I could dig a hole and between all the root and rocks, eventually find some nice solid clay rich soil. But for a variety of reasons, I don't want to do this route. I'd much rather truck it in. It really will be easier all around. So, what kind of dirt am I looking for? Does it exist as a product people sell? I've never seen anything like it anywhere. Stone dust may work, but it will be super obvious and I'm trying to slip under the radar and not ruffle any feathers.",

This was one of those spots. I like to launch off the top and land halfway down, but all year I've been pooping my pants on the landing. You can't see from the pic but the trail slopes to the right, and theres trees in line with the trail, so you have to turn right to avoid them. So today I finally got sick of cheating death here and went and swept out the leaves with my feet. It actually went really quickly since this is existing hardpack trail, this isn't virgin ground. I went back and hit it again and it was SOOOOOO much better without the leaves. The sneaker leaf sweep is a technique i use often, but usually to clear out drainage gulleys that are filled with leaves, not usually on drop landings :D",

      "content_preview": "I'm in the very preliminary stages of planning a bridge. It's going to be a very narrow singletrack bridge (not a stunt, it will be rideable for everyone) that will probably be about 16' long. It goes over a waterway. Right now, people either splash through the water when its shallow, or throw trees down and cause water flow problems when the water is high. First off, has anyone ever painted your bridge stringers? Like a dark grey/brown color. Something that won't stand out the way brand new lumber would? Which lead me to the next question... if I'm going to put tar paper or something similar on the top of the stringers to prevent rot, and then paint the sides and probably bottom, that begs the question: Do I even need to use PT? I suppose the paint will peel off eventually and Its never going to get repainted. But it will be up off the ground so I imagine it will say solid, even untreated, for quite a while. Thoughts/experience? The pads that the long stringers rest on would be PT but in theory the rest could be regular wood. Has anyone ever cut a bit of an arch into bridge stringers? the wood is 12' tall and you may need that thickness in the middle when its carrying weight. But you don't need them to be that thick at the ends. If I pre-cut an arch shape into the wood, so lets say they were 8\" tall at the ends and curved up to the full 12\" then back down to 8\" on the other end, it would in theory be just as strong, but lighter and easier to lug in. And it would hide the appearance of sagging over the years, which would also be a nice bonus. That last question leads me to this obvious question: Is there a guide anywhere for how thick bridge stringers should be for a particular span length? I honestly haven't even measured this span yet, for now I'm just assuming its about 16' end to end so about a 14' span. But it could be less. I know when I was building a new shed floor, my contractor friend told me 6\" joists were not big enough, and that it would sag and bounce. But I went with 6\" because thats what the original floor used. And it has sagged a little, and it does bounce a little, but not much at all. CERTAINLY an acceptable amount for a bridge in the woods! I'm not suggestion I'm going to use 2x6x16' to make a single-span long bridge :D But maybe 10\" or 8\" would be sufficient, which would also reduce cost and make construction easier.",
