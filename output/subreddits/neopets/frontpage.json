Since most black hairs don't have \"black\" in the name (ex: \"Deep Raven Wig\"), the best option on DTI would be to filter by Hat and maybe type in Wig or Hair and look for the black ones. This would take forever... But! SunnyNeo team manually tags all items by zones , colors, categories, themes, and more. So instead I can tick the \"Hair and Wig\" category, which filters out items that are only hats, and I can go to the colour tab and only look for items tagged black and grey. Sometimes when I see people recommend customization tools they only mention DTI, so I wonder if a lot of people don't even know this exists. It's really useful for finding items!",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I have a really old school neopets story that I want to share with you. Okay, so, I was really into neopets between the years of 1999-2001. Picture me, 11-13 years old and using dial-up internet and the family computer that sat in the kitchen so mom and dad could monitor our internet use. Sometimes I had to wait up to FIVE MINUTES for a forum to load, I‚Äôm not even joking. I loved neopets. I‚Äôm not sure what it looks like nowadays, but I was always hustling to try and buy the next paintbrush, or hanging out in the forums to meet cool people who wanted to RP our pets meeting and making friends (or sometimes enemies because THE DRAMA). I even learned basic HTML so I could make a website for each of my pets (that is legit a life skill that has helped me in my adult life!). So, I was only allowed about an hour or two of computer time per day. This, as you know, is not much time, particularly given that every time the phone rang, I would be bumped offline. Sometimes I would sneak down at night when everyone was in bed to play, but our house was mega creaky (and in those days, getting on to the internet was even loud), so this was risky. One day, I was chatting with someone I had met in the forums, and I was telling them about how bad I was lusting after some paintbrush (starry night for my Uni, I think?). This person was like: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything to do tonight, why don‚Äôt you just give me your password and I‚Äôll play games on your account and make you the money you need for that paintbrush.‚Äù I was, like, 12 years old and could not believe my luck, so I gave them my password and went to bed that night. So, I went to school the next day, came home, finished my homework, waited for my turn on the family computer, and was finally able to log on after dinner. And what did I find? My account left fully intact with the exact amount I needed to purchase a starry night paintbrush. This kind stranger did exactly what they said they were going to do. I often think back to this as being the golden era of the internet; a time when things were smaller, safer, more sincere. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true, though, and lately I was wondering if maybe neopets was/is just a little golden section of internet. Anyway, I am stoked to see that people are still playing. This used to be my favourite place on the internet, and I am happy to see it is still around :)",

We direct all prize pool posts to this thread for the first 7-10 days to keep the community from being flooded with the same posts. Comments are sorted by new so your comment will be seen! This post will be pinned for the first day and after that is pinned in Community Highlights. If you use New Reddit Desktop or the Mobile App that means we have six pinned posts! This post is also saved in our sidebar/About section. Links Quest Log Official FAQ Jellyneo daily prizes list Jellyneo weekly prizes list General Info The prize pool changes roughly every two months. There is no exact number of days it will stay or set day it changes. It usually does not automatically switch over at Midnight NST. Premium accounts have two Save Streak Tickets each month. This means if you are premium and miss a day it will restore your weekly streak progress. Premium also gives one additional daily quest each day. DO NOT PARTICIPATE ON YOUR SIDE ACCOUNTS earning neopoints or items on side accounts is against the rules and can lead to all of your accounts being frozen. Re-rolling Weekly Prize The only way to change your weekly prize is to pay neopoints. TNT changed re-rolling so that you must go to the Weekly Reward tab and click the \"Re-Roll\" button above your weekly prize. The cost starts at 10,000 NP and doubles each time you re-roll. It maxes out at 1,000,000 NP. After that you can keep re-rolling but the price will no longer increase. It will randomly give you a different item in the prize pool. Items will not be repeated and will keep selecting a different random item until you have re-rolled the entire prize pool. You can re-roll your prize at any point before or after finishing daily quests for the first 6 days. Once you have completed daily quests for the 7th day it will no longer let you re-roll and you must claim your weekly prize. Chart below, from Jellyneo.net , of the cost for re-rolling weekly prizes. https://preview.redd.it/prize-pool-megathread-september-1st-new-prizes-v0-3fwvtp1r3mmf1.png NeoPass Quest Log Jellyneo Guide Jellyneo NeoPass Guide Mobile Games - Referral Codes and Guild Sharing Megathread If your account is connected to NeoPass there are additional quests for playing the mobile games \"Faerie Fragments\" and \"Tales of Dacardia\". Selling or Buying an Expensive Item If you're looking to find the worth of an item we suggest first using Jellyneo's Item Database to get a general idea of the price. Make sure to look at the Price History and Trading Post History tabs! You can also check itemdb for pricing info. It is always important to double check the worth by checking out the Shop Wizard/Super Shop Wizard or Trading Post and Auction House on Neopets to see what it's currently going for on the site. Prices can change quickly and with harder to sell more expensive items (unbuyables (or those that are above 999k and can't be listed on SW)), it can take some time to find the right buyer. For items over 1 million neopoints you can either make a trade lot or auction them. The Trading Post has a 2 million NP limit on offers. Patience is the answer to selling these items, you can always sell it quicker at a lower price if you want. If you want more information this post could be of help! All buying, selling, and trading in this community goes in our Daily Trading Thread. A new one is made each day and always pinned to the top of the subreddit. Excited?! Disappointed?! Let's Talk About It!! What are you excited about? What is not there you were hoping for? What item made you think WTF? Do you re-roll until you get what you want or have a max on neopoints you will spend on it? Do you just accept whatever the Neopian fates give you as a weekly prize?",

Please refrain from posting individual threads and use this thread for your trading purposes! Items Remember that you can use Ctrl + F to help you find items you might be interested in! Please use the following specific formats to make it easier for people searching for either NC or NP items. Format - NP Please use this format when buying or selling items: Buying: item Selling: item - price (or link to your shop/trades/auctions) Format - NC Seeking: item(s) or link to wishlist Offering: item(s) or link to trade list Neocash Trading Please keep in mind that you can ONLY trade Neocash items for other Neocash items and cannot buy them with Neopoints. To trade an NC item you need a gift box that you receive when redeeming NC cards, opening Gift Box Capsules, or other events. To read more about trading Neocash items check out the Jellyneo guide . If you're trading NC items, here are a couple of guides to help you out with values and avoid being scammed: ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR WHEN THESE WERE LAST UPDATED AS THEY MAY BE OUTDATED.

You do not have to post the name of the pet or the name of your account if you do not wish, but remember to check your reddit PMs if this is the only means of communication you are allowing!
