      "content_preview": "So, the humans decided without warning to change the furniture. I couldn’t, and still can’t, believe it. Nobody consulted me about replacing my couch and bed. It just came out of nowhere. Here’s what happened. First, I was quickly whisked into the guest room after the male human said someone they were apparently expecting had pulled up (the female human claims that I bark too much and scare visitors when I’m really just protecting my pack from obvious danger, like the pizza guy.) Upon finally being released back into my lair, I completely froze with shock, one paw raised for what seemed like an eternity. There, in front of me, was a completely different couch. Different smell. Different color, one that I still don’t approve of. No space for me to slide underneath like a cat and hangout. It was big and stupid and I felt betrayed. Both humans started laughing, which only added to my anger. I started barking and doing my “fake sneeze.” I growled. I showed contempt by not going near it. I ran in a couple of circles, then…saw the NEW BED! This was when I lost my cool. The female human tried to pick me up to comfort me, but I asserted my defiance by turning my nose up and storming away. I decided that I would never associate with either of them again. I refused to speak to them for about an hour. The male human decided to take a nap on…that new thing. The female human started watching Judge Judy, who I’m quite fond of. After tricking her into taking me outside so I could get some treats, I fell asleep and found myself on the new couch. I don’t remember jumping onto it but it’s actually quite comfortable. I’m still angry about the bed, though. The female human left to go to the store. Before leaving, she scratched me on the forehead. “Bye, Pumpkin. I love you.” I said I love you, too, and fell back asleep, dreaming about squirrels.",

My little chihuahua right now is not doing so well as he got a eye problem so he taking meds for it right now. But for having a bad eye he happy and still running around playing and doing what he normally does everyday. Now for my other dog jack Russell/ chihuahua he be acting weird ever since I came back from the vets with my other dog he been laying around not being energetic like he always is when I come home he does’nt want to play with his toys. he not so hyped when we take him for walks. But he eating sleeping and weeing/pooing fine. When I look at him from the side of my eye he fine sleeping and laying there chilled but when I look at him and he see me he still shaken that was at for a a few days but after couple more days he just seat there looks at me and just out right ignores me calling him/ trying to playing with him or give him cuddles. At first I thought it could be jealousy but now I just don’t know? It cost some much to take my little one to the vets and maybe cost me more if this meds don’t work. So I can afford spending more money if my other dog is acting I know I sound heartless I love my boys just like my kids but if my little one needs ops on his eye that going to cost me a arm and leg to get it done. so you can see how stress I am with my other dog acting wired right now. I hope some one can help me figure this out. Thanks for reading.",
