      "content_preview": "Aaron COHEN, an IDF special operations veteran was just on Fox News promoting a new program he created called ‚ÄúGIDEON‚Äù that will go into use NEXT WEEK, which uses AI to determine threat assessments of individuals who have not yet been convicted of a crime that are then forwarded to law enforcement. üö®üö®üö®‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è This EXTREMELY DANGEROUS technology was created by modeling ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs approach to counterterrorism‚Äù in collaboration with and backed by Palantir, or course. üôÑ Keep in mind, it is Palantir that creates the ‚Äúkill lists‚Äù for the Palestinians which are used by the IDF. This same technology is being developed by absolutely genocidal PSYCHOPATHS and it absolutely WILL be used against American citizens. Gaza is the testing ground for what is to come. The idea here is called ‚Äúpre-crime‚Äù which is related to the idea of ‚Äúthought crime‚Äù and is absolutely UNCONSTITUTIONAL. An affront and major threat to the free expression and civil liberties of EVERYONE. It‚Äôs one of the pillars of George Orwell‚Äôs 1984, and a hallmark of the technocratic New World Order police state. The Trump Administration is working diligently with Palantir, and Larry Ellison (Oracle) of Project Stargate to collect as much data from the American people as possible to then be WEAPONIZED AGAINST US in the future, if we don‚Äôt comply or conform to their TYRANNY, or if we speak out against it. Dissident voices and those who are a deemed a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù by the Government will be punished for preconceived ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù never even committed based on an ‚ÄúAI threat assessment‚Äù of things you may have have said in the past that don‚Äôt line up with ‚Äúappropriate narratives‚Äù. Based on what Melania Trump just said in her X post, it seems that the pretext for implementation of this will be the trans shooting that just happened in Minneapolis. This will ultimately tie into the Beast System and serve as a barometer for your social credit score as well. WE ARE IN VERY BIG TROUBLE, AMERICA. https://x.com/TPV_John/status/1961143734046695898",

      "content_preview": "\"RFK Jr. is being maligned by the establishment and legacy media for the turmoil at the CDC, but the real story is simpler.  The CDC resisted ACIP‚Äôs attempts to review fundamental questions about vaccine safety and efficacy. These aren‚Äôt fringe concerns. They‚Äôre the kinds of questions any serious scientist would ask, and the public deserves answers to. Among them: Where do mRNA vaccine components travel in the body (biodistribution)? How does the immune system change with repeated boosters? How should vaccine injury be defined, recognized, and treated? According to Retsef Levi, an ACIP board member, past ACIP processes were narrow ‚Äî often rubber-stamping CDC slide decks without engaging the deeper scientific data. The result was superficial risk-benefit assessments that left major uncertainties unexamined. When Levi tried to broaden the scope, he wasn‚Äôt met with scientific debate but with political smears ‚Äî branded ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù for simply asking hard questions. The public deserves transparency and rigorous evaluation, not bureaucratic stonewalling. The tragedy is that those demanding better science are cast as political actors, while those protecting broken processes are celebrated by legacy institutions as defenders of truth.\" --Jason Locasale, PhD Tenured professor at Duke University (& previously at Harvard & M.I.T.)",

      "content_preview": "Whether everyone remembers the reason, the rest of the world observes Labor Day on May 1, in honor of the martyrs of the Haymarket Affair, which began in Chicago, Illinois, in the United States of America on May 1, 1886. The entire story of the Haymarket Affair is as interesting and instructive as it is tragic.  For an overview--and only an overview-- please start --and only start-- here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair and here http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/571.html Some sources claim that Bourbon Democrat (aka, pro business Democrat) Grover Cleveland and Congress fixed our labor day in September for reasons wholly unrelated to the Haymarket Affair. I don't believe it (but cool that they can read so many 1886 minds from the from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries). You may also read that the Haymarket Affair began on May 4, which further deflects from the international observance on May 1.  However, it  began on May 1 with a massive demonstration for more safety in the workplace, including an eight-hour work day.  (Longer daily hours had been shown to result in more deaths, maimings and other accidents on the job.) The Haymarket Affair \"went very left\" on May 4, with a fatal bomb throwing at an outdoor meeting/protest.  Which is likely another reason some \"official\" sources begin with May 4, instead of May 1. (No offense to leftists or left-handed people intended by me.) One of the theories posits that the culprit ran away immediately after throwing the bomb and very quickly left the country.  In any event, he was never found--which did not stop authorities from prosecuting and persecuting others. The imprisonments were unjust, at best, The hangings  were, IMO, more like lynchings, despite \"due process.\" One ghoul viewing the hangings is quoted as saying he just wanted to see socialists hung. Most mourning, if any, was for the cops who were killed May 4 rather than the May 1 activists. Same for the statues and other memorials, although there is at least one in honor of the martyrs. Because of the Haymarket saga, the rest of the world observes Labor Day on May 1, while some Americans are having a May Walk parade and/or dancing around a maypole, partying like it's 299 C.E. in merry olde pagan England. (Compare https://www.countryliving.com/life/news/a35407/do-you-remember-may-basket-day/ ) IMO, the deaths of the martyrs are also why Americans in colder parts of the US see Labor Day as the quasi-official end of backyard grilling season, a day off from work and nothing more consequential. IMO, US schools should teach about the Haymarket Affair. As far as I know, none do. And Americans should observe May 1, along with the rest of the world. Thank you, 1886 activists for the eight-hour work day and other workplace safety activism. Solidarity Forever.",
