      "content_preview": "I am relatively new to the Division 2. I have been playing the game a lot over the past few weeks and while there are aspects of the game that I really like, there are an equal number that have driven my frustration level to an all-time high. Builds I have been trying to replicate or create a build that will work well at the higher levels of difficulty in the game. I have a build that works on normal, hard, challenging and even heroic (except for the final boss battle of the climax mission). However, I would like to have a heroic build that worked better and to be able to take on legendary or master difficulty as well (for the weekly projects, etc.) I have tested so many builds, but almost every build out there for Year 7, Season 1 seems to rely on a couple of components I cannot get. I have spent literally a week, non-stop, trying to get the Memento Backpack and Backfire SMG. I have done everything suggested here and from other sources (e.g., targeting loot in Countdown and the Summit, doing open world activities that focus on these categories, buying caches, etc.). I have gotten lots of exotics, earned or bought tons of caches, but I have had zero luck getting these items. Sadly, I find that my duplicate rate is about 75%. So for all the work, I end up with fewer items and none of the ones I am looking for. I don't mind grinding for items, but when it feels like the effort is wasted, it becomes frustrating. I should note that I have played other titles that can be hard to create builds that work well (e.g., Elden Ring, Remnant 2, etc.), but with some farming and lots of grinding it is possible. This game is starting to feel like no matter how long I grind for things, I am never going to see them. Armor on Kill My current build has 1.8M in armor, with almost 400K armor on kill. Either, I am completely misunderstanding what this feature does or the game is buggy with regard to it. For example, say my armor is in the red, hence low, and I kill an enemy. I expect ~400K armor to be added to my current value, which should take me out of the red. I find that more often than not, I get nothing. My armor value stays exactly where it was. I should point out that I am in cover when I tested this and had no additional incoming damage. I have seen this work the way I expect, but more often than not, it does nothing. The result is I need to burn an armor kit or die. It is frustrating to create a build that depends on a feature, but the feature does not work. Crashes The game crashes on average 2-3 times a day for me. I have played a lot, so let's average that and say the game crashes every 3-4 hours of play. It is not that cut and dry, but you get the idea. It crashes a lot. I have only had it crash a couple of times during a boss fight, but it is super frustrating when you almost have the fight done and it crashes. You come back and have to do the entire thing again. Maybe it is just me, but these kinds of things make me want to never launch the game again. That is the opposite of what they want, but it is where I am at the moment. There are other games with their own issues, but at least they are fun to play.",

It’s on heroic and he’s just bouncing from objective to objective. Most fun time I’ve had just strait grinding the game with a team! I also had a few questions. We grinded so much I started just deconstructing anything that wasn’t exotic. My bag would get too full and my field caches lol there was no chance I could keep up on opening those. Is everyone just looking for specific pieces of gear with max rolls and destroying everything else? Lastly I play a pestilence build I really like, 1.2 mil tics which is great for heroic, kinda bad for legendary I think. I also do dmg with my pestilence I went crit and get constant 500k hits outside the tics. Anyone have pestilence builds they can share or any great builds for PVE check point farming?",

      "content_preview": "hello agents, We all aware of the bug that after killing the boss the game bugs and dont let you finnish so you need to wipe. I may have a solution at least it worked every time for me, so if you interested just please read this post, and may check my video about it which will came out tomorrow. To clarify some things. The bug has nothing to do with status effects. All status effect wont work on boss Boss can oneshot you from cover while she is supressed. If you die while you shocked your hive wont work. So how it works? Well your main objective is to kill the endboss, but theres a twist, you need to eliminate the programmed abount of enemy spawn which is 6-7 I dont remember clearly how many there. So the reason behind it because your main objective is to eliminate the final boss when you do it whille !you didnt kill all the coded amount of enemy spawns (6-7). the game register it as you did main objective and wont spwan the last group of enemies and collapse. That why you stucked in combat after you kill the boss. For solution in a very simple way: ! kill mobs first till boss reamin than deal with boss! You do this for all 3 pahses. At phase 3 you wait until the flame dog dont spawn because its the last enemy, you kill it than you kill the boss. Its simple as that. No status effect, nor session bugs or something like that its just a simple code collapse. Im not sure its will always work cuz we know bugisoft and also theres a chance that the session is actually bugged but as for me 20/20 times worked. So again kill mobs first than boss. Kill the boss after you killed flamer dog. Well I hope it helps you agents.",
