      "content_preview": "Marketplace Please use this thread to post items you have for sale / you're looking for / you want to swap with another member of this community (e.g. merch, tickets, etc.) This also includes fan-made items created for retail that you wish to promote. Self-promotion outside of this thread will be removed. As always, feel free to reach out to us via modmail if you have any questions or need to report a scammer . Safety and Transactions Please rely on trusted ticket exchange / resale platforms (e.g. StubHub, Ticketmaster Fan-to-Fan Exchange) whenever possible or, at the very least, use payment processors that offer some form of buyer protection (e.g. PayPal Goods & Services). Don't use PayPal Friends & Family , or Venmo, Cash App! Do not hesitate to ask the seller for proof of purchase. Screenshots can be easily manipulated, so consider requesting a screen recording (that shows both the ticket vendor's app / website and your conversation) instead of a simple photo. Oftentimes, it can also be helpful to check the other party's post history / profile or to simply ask them to reply to your comment in this thread. That way you can be sure that the user hasn't been banned (banned users are still able to send you direct messages, so be aware of that). If you have any doubts, do not proceed with the transaction! List of Known Scammers Located on our wiki here . This list will be continuously updated as we receive reports of scammers. Tip: Use your browser's search feature (CMD+F or CTRL+F) on the page to quickly look up the names of scammers.",

I have a friend whose birthday is coming up: she adores Phoebe Bridgers, specifically Punisher. I am trying to put together a gift which uses some of her favourite albums, however, the only high-quality scans of Punisher I can find online are unfortunately of the front cover. Any help would be greatly appreciated please! Thank you!",

I want to make an edit and still might someday but I don't really know how people get movie scenes to edit. ANYWAYS. This is for the very specific cross section of Phoebe fans that have also seen the movie \"Under the Silver Lake\". I don't know why my brain made the connection but ever since I saw it I connected it with Phoebe's song Smoke Signals. Sonically and lyrically they just line up so well. The movie, without spoiling if people want to check it out its amazing! Is about kind of a search for a person and also a search for self which really lines up with the meaning in the song. And there is also specifics. The smoke signals motif of sending subliminal signs and breadcrumbs is really present in the film! And the most specific is the line \"I'm sleepin' in my bed again and gettin' in my head and then, walk around the reservoir\". Which is of course in reference to the silver lake reservoir that is featured in an important scene in the movie! Idk This all has just been in my head and its all I can think about when I listen to the song now, so I wanted to share it. Hopefully some people here have seen the movie and if you haven't I do highly recommend! Its in my letterboxd top four. It's got Andrew Garfield and he's incredible.",

It's something about the juxtaposition of the brutality of the narrator mixed with his final, childlike images. Something about how, when we come to the end, we're still the same, hurt children we once were and how we once felt wonder and beauty in spite of the hardening that adulthood requires of us. I know it's an extreme example and, yet, the most poetic dream at the end, the sudden innocence of a broken person who has failed, miserably, remembering when they were happy. It wrecks me.",

Self-promotion outside of this thread will be removed. As always, feel free to reach out to us via modmail if you have any questions or need to report a scammer . Safety and Transactions Please rely on trusted ticket exchange / resale platforms (e.g. StubHub, Ticketmaster Fan-to-Fan Exchange) whenever possible or, at the very least, use payment processors that offer some form of buyer protection (e.g. PayPal Goods & Services). Don't use PayPal Friends & Family , or Venmo, Cash App! Do not hesitate to ask the seller for proof of purchase. Screenshots can be easily manipulated, so consider requesting a screen recording (that shows both the ticket vendor's app / website and your conversation) instead of a simple photo. Oftentimes, it can also be helpful to check the other party's post history / profile or to simply ask them to reply to your comment in this thread. That way you can be sure that the user hasn't been banned (banned users are still able to send you direct messages, so be aware of that). If you have any doubts, do not proceed with the transaction!
