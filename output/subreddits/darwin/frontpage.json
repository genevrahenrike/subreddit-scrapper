I live on a corner so there are 3 sides of the yard exposed for her to \"guard\". She was a camp dog puppy found on the side of the road and now she is 7 years old.  She is used to living in the bush without neighbours but now we live in town in a remote community so there are always a lot of people and unexpected noises happening causing her to bark maniacally. I have researched different ideas advertised but am not sure of which device to buy.  A citronella collar, a buzz collar, a force field electronic gadget........? Has anyone tried something that works?  She weighs 25kg. Thank you for your help.",

I have a good paying job here but feel like I'm missing something. I feel like moving back to Darwin so i can go fishing and enjoy the nice weather. Fishing is my absolute favorite hobby and its just not the same chasing bream in the swan river. It also appears to be easier to get a job in my field there (although less jobs on offer). I also have only really made surface level friendships here so I'm not leaving anything behind. I do really enjoy the large selection and variety of restaurants as well as the options for buying fresh fruit and veg in Perth as well. Am i romanticizing the idea or should i pull the trigger? Btw, I moved away due to toxic family but hoping i can avoid it as much as i can if i move back.",

I also noticed he had a shirt that said World’s Fastest Man since 1980 something. We all live in a diverse world and I’m not here to judge or make fun of anybody, but I’m curious if anybody has any lore or knows the story of our beloved World’s Fastest Man.

Being obsessed with crocodiles , I knew who Matt was because of his show but not much more than that as the show happened after I left. I'm going to cover this case after the trial is over but I would like to hear from people who actually knew the bloke, and the other people involved. There are obviously a lot of rumours about him and his conduct but I'm not going to go off a bunch of rumours. I'd also like to include a section just about Chris and his life, he seemed like a genuinely good bloke. If anyone can help me, please dm me.  Thank you :)",

Currently resting for a bit in Darwin and really wish to explore Kakadu National Park for few days, although a car is absolutely necessary. Anyone here is planning a trip there and willing to share the ride? I'll provide good company and good food, and of course share the expenses. Otherwise, if you can recommend any budget tours in the area I'll be happy to hear about it.",
