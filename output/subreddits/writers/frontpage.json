All of them had at least 3 novels published based on what I saw on their tables. All of those novels were published by big 5 and they all had an agent. They all said they have another job because writing couldn't make living. It was surprising for me. If you have agent and are published by big 5, I would expect the books is objectively good and it would get to the right people. Did they have bad agents who did not tell them the books are not good? Or was it good but there was no target group? What is the problem?",

The edit feedback I got was: More introspection from the main protagonist (who is new in her field), and weighing her job's duties against her burgeoning relationship with the other protagonist More specific procedures & details related to the protagonist's profession A few pacing & repetition issues that still linger Word count--I come up short at only 72,000 words; sweet spot for my genre is 85,000 to 95,000 words A few minor additional tweaks to trim the prologue further and seed some clues for a later twist But in any case, the message was overwhelmingly positive and pointing to a favorable outcome if I nail the revised draft.",

On the other hand, I’m terrified it’s trash. I keep second-guessing myself: Is the plot too messy? Will anyone actually care about the characters? Am I wasting my time editing when no one might read it? Am I wasting my time translating it to English (yep, not my first language friends) For those of you who’ve been here before...how did you push through the “this sucks, I suck” stage? Did you just keep rewriting, or did you shove it in a drawer for a while? I’d love to hear what kept you going, or even some funny “my first draft was a disaster” stories to make me feel less alone. Thanks in advance! This community honestly makes the whole “writing a book” thing feel a little less like screaming into the void.",

I can’t read something without my brain combing it over and rewriting and tweaking it. It’s why it’s sometimes hard for me to get a first draft out, but when I sit down to just edit , it feels so good. I’ve been looking for a publishing job, but who knew breaking into publishing with nothing but a degree would be so difficult :/ I want to practice and get some experience under my belt, so I’m hoping someone out there has a WIP or a chapter or anything, really, that they want a second pair of eyes to look over. Obviously this is for free and for fun, and maybe I can make some new writing friends along the way :)",

When I was active, it was great: a thread, process, a feeling of movement forward. But when I stopped, my wine was a lot. It was not just: \"Oh, I missed the day.\" It was more complicated when I revealed a version of myself, who wanted to become a writer. And this wine can be paralyzed, sometimes preventing me from writing longer. I know that writing is not about punishing myself, but the violation of this cycle is difficult. So I was curious: Are you fighting the same error? How to return to normal after a dry mantra? You only accept it as part of the process, or you still decide to overcome it? I want to know how others deal with it; I don't think I'm lonely.",

I first took a break from writing, then I couldn’t quite bring myself back to it. For a while, I was just spooning in the dirt—writing only a few words a day. Then I realized I didn’t like the text, so I took another break to think about whether I should publish it at all, and also whether I should divide it into smaller parts so as not to overwhelm the reader, since a lot of new characters appear in this chapter. About a week ago, I finally decided to rewrite it—and now it’s much closer to what I wanted. Dobby is almost free now; I just need to polish it a bit more.

Does anyone else still write the old fashioned way or am I just weird? (Btw, I'm perfectly ok with being weird, and I'm pretty much used to it.) It's just something I keep wondering about... Anyone?",

It was only after a few years of working in this field that I realized what I actually wanted to do was writing. I am currently working on my first novel, which is a sci-fi/mystery. I'm really enjoying the process but somedays I'm so mentally exhausted from my job that I can't write anything. I feel like, at least for me, a corporate job negatively affects my writing.

      "content_preview": "I’ve been obsessed with spy fiction for years—Le Carré, Forsyth, Silva, all of it. That love for espionage stories lit a fire in me, and I’ve been chasing the dream of writing my own spy novel ever since. Here’s my problem: because of my struggles with carrying the story forward and fixing plot holes, I’ve ended up writing six different novels halfway through—only to pause, convince myself they’ll never work, and then start another. At this point, I’ve stalled out on six novels in a row, usually around the 50k word mark. It’s not that I don’t plan—I do. I outline in detail, map out chapters, create character backstories. On paper, I know where the story should go. But in practice? I stall halfway, lose confidence, and the manuscript dies on the vine. Has anyone else been stuck in this loop? How did you push through the self-doubt and actually finish the damn book? TL;DR: I’ve written 6 spy novels halfway through (~50k words each) but always quit mid-story due to plot holes or self-doubt. How do you actually finish a novel?",

I do, and I realize that my story is… basically hot garbage. I know that it’s probably better to just get the plot out and then go back, but I’m curious at what stages yall are using things like metaphor and pretty language? Is your first draft just all brutalist concrete writing and then you go back and stick in a metaphor and a motif? Do you write with symbolism on the first draft because it’s important to character evolution? And crucially: How many drafts does it typically take you until you’re looking at one you’re actually happy with? Thanks in advance!",

I’m young, and most people say that this is like the greatest time to be writing and stuff because then you discover who you are sooner and all that and — I mean, I get it. Recently, I’ve been feeling sort of paralyzed, but in a writing sense. It’s not like I have writer’s block, and it’s not like I don’t want to write; I am simply too scared to start back up. For context, I used to write 2-6 pages per day last year. I’ve slowed down a lot now. When I look back at what I used to write, it feels so much better and nicer and fun. Nowadays, blank pages feel daunting. When I write, I still like what I write, but when I compare it to my old work, it’s like comparing a Hilton Hotel to the Empire State Building (to me - my old stuff was honestly pretty bad). I know a lot of other people certainly feel similar. It’s the feeling when you have an idea but don’t know how to vocalize it. It’s not gonna stop me from writing, and I know it won’t stop you, but it’s certainly difficult. Just wanted to share this.",

      "content_preview": "Just want to rant here for a second to get my thoughts out there and see if anyone feels the same. I've been writing for a very long time and have been working on a series over the last couple of years that I intend on self publishing once I'm finished. The only issue is that by \"self publish\" I mean I want to MAYBE hire a freelance editor, have a couple family members also do some basic proofreading and feedback (which they're already interested in doing), commission my artist sister to design some covers, buy some ISBNs to make it semi-official, and throw the finalized series up on a POD platform to buy myself a few copies and give them to friends and family. Whenever I've looked into the self-publishing process, 99% of it is all business and marketing related stuff, and I feel crazy that I just don't care to do any of that and that it almost (for lack of a better expression) gives me the ick just reading through it all. I do not care to make money. I do not care to build a huge audience (or frankly any audience aside from a handful of friends). I do not want to make a facebook page or a mailing list or instagram ads. I sure as hell don't want to do market and genre research to determine how I choose to write my own stories. So many of these self-publishing tutorials seem to be under the impression that I'm writing in order to sell books, and I hate that it makes me feel crazy for being someone who writes because I enjoy writing and just think it would be cool to get my work up somewhere so I can share it with some friends and family. I feel like I'm even at a point where I honestly don't even like the idea of an agent or publicist doing this all on my behalf. The very idea of commercializing my writing and turning it into a business just feels gross to me. I don't want my work that I'm genuinely proud of on a personal artistic level reduced to an ad on someone's social media feed. I don't want my work to be associated with a random newsletter email buried, unread, in someone's inbox. I don't want to cater to strangers. I don't want to turn writing into a job. I have nothing against writers who want to monetize their work. I respect the desire and the hustle it can take to make it happen, and of course it would be cool to have an actual audience that enjoys your work. If you're putting a ton of time and effort into something and people out there are interested you have every right to want to make money off it, but I just cannot possibly bring myself to want to do it with my own work. There's no way I'm the only writer out there that feels this way. Does anyone else here share this sentiment or am I just genuinely insane?",

I have a prologue and full 13 page chapter written, definitely a rough draft if not a pre-rough draft. 😅 but everyone says to just start writing, so that’s what I’m doing. My issue is the dialogue between characters.  I also feel it’s way too simple, or maybe when writing it I will think ah I’ve heard something too similar from a movie or another book before (fantasy novel). Any tips on being creative, say main character interacting with a guard, merchant, or a potential love interest.",

It's been months so I feel a little disconnected from where it started and was thinking it might redirect me to go through it again (I haven't read it at all yet, I've just been adding to it.) BUT, do you think this will make me stall and I'll instead start trying to edit the whole thing? I just don't know what to do now that I'm lagging so close to the finish line... Need advice.",

Of course this is a new venture for me and would be solid to get some perspective from actual humans NOT robots. Of course I could google search a ton, but thought to plant the seed of thought to hear feedback from others if they have been in the beginning stages of the writing process (I have 4 rough chapters done to be exact). Truly seems like a daunting mountain to climb, but definitely still want to climb.",
