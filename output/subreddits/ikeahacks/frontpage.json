      "content_preview": "I'm currently using some PAX cabinets in my garage for storage. IKEA is really missing a huge market by not offering a garage storage solution, but I digress. (I stand corrected)  We had a rodent explosion this spring/summer and I found several mouse nests in my garage, including a huge one under one of the PAX cabinets. I've decided to rethink my garage storage and I want to get everything off the ground.  I've been looking at wall-mounted systems like Flow Wall, but their cabinet storage offerings are very basic.  I used a lot of the PAX trays and basically turned the cabinets into giant tool chests.  The trays make organizing tools, hardware, etc. very easy.  I really don't want to give up this setup, but I want the cabinets off the ground. I've considered looking for a third party option that would fit the Flow Wall cabinets, but I've already spent a lot on PAX cabinet interior fittings and have everything the way I like it.  I just need to get it off the ground.  Has anyone here mounted PAX cabinets off the floor entirely and to the wall?  Any tips or suggestions? https://preview.redd.it/has-anyone-mounted-pax-cabinets-to-the-wall-off-the-floor-v0-3tqnx309ffmf1.jpg",

Ive tried sanding it, priming with Two different primers (one for Wood, one for laquer/industrially coated wood, metal and pvc, painted In Two layers, with a brush, sprayer, roller - litteraly everything. The only thing Where the paint doesnt come off, is when i use a planer to remove the entire white layer, leaving me with basically just an mdf piece to sand and paint. That on the Other hand results In a rough surface (even after sanding with very High sandpaper after planing) and also is not really an option, since the bookcases are assembled and i cant be arsed to dissasemble Them entirely. Oh, ive also tried to use some transparent laquer/clear coat on top of the paint, that looks like a pile of dogs*it though. What to do?",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I recently bought the DYVLINGE chair and wondered if it could be turned into a desk chair. I had searched here on Reddit before for examples, but never found a clear answer — so I tried it myself and wanted to share my results in case anyone else is interested. Here’s what I learned: The bottom of the DYVLINGE has a standard gas lift socket (the same kind office chairs use). The base (“star”/cross with wheels) from my old DXRacer fit perfectly. The socket size for the gas lift is standard, so you can swap in a longer gas lift into the standard DYVLINGE base if you want the chair higher for desk use. Important limitation: the DYVLINGE does not have any height adjustment mechanism. There’s no lever, and the gas lift that comes with it isn’t height-adjustable. That means you’ll need to pick the gas lift length carefully beforehand. If you want wheels, you can’t attach them directly to the DYVLINGE base — you’ll need to reuse a rolling base from another office chair (with wheels + gas lift already in place). Once the chair is set up, you can’t easily change the height anymore, since the DÜVLINGE seat/top doesn’t have the mechanism to release the gas lift. The workaround I used was: take a normal office chair, adjust it to the right height first, then swap the base + gas lift over to the DYVLINGE. The result: I now have a rolling desk chair with the DYVLINGE top. It works, it’s comfortable, but it’s a fixed height — no adjustments after the fact. I’ve attached a picture of my setup so you can see what it looks like. Hopefully this helps anyone who was wondering the same thing I was! https://preview.redd.it/dyvlinge-desk-chair-v0-zxg21w23hjlf1.jpg",

No, I don't want them to be vault locks nor am I ooking for cat/baby locks. I am trying to see if someone figures out a way to use Solstol or any other Ikea locking mechanism on a PAX sliding door. The reason I wish to lock it is I just don't want my family who will be staying over getting all nosy and looking through my stuff. I just want it to be a lock that would have to be broken into/destroyed to open the sliding doors. Just like a kind of seal to inform me that it was opened. On Aliexpress and temu i see a good few stick on corded locks that would work for me, but they might be a little too ugly as they would be visible outside. Would there be anyother method to stick it on from the inside or any 3rd party locking mechnaism that has worked for you without needing precision carpentry skills? Thanks!",
