      "content_preview": "Well, several years after reading the first three ones, I've finally come back to the Malazan world and read House of Chains... I loved it! I don't really know where I would rank it in relation to the previous ones as it wasn't that different (in quality, not in content of course) from MoI... DG is still my favorite though, but it isn't surprising since DG was such an exceptional book... Random thoughts just after finishing HoC. - Let's start by talking a bit about Karsa, of course! I didn't like him a lot at the beginning, but as soon as we reach Silver Lake and begin to see the connections with the world we know I was completely in it (and just before, the little scene with Calm was nice, too). Loved the way HoC sheds light on some of the weirdest parts of DG, by the way. And in the rest of the book Karsa's scenes keep getting better (the horse, Bidithal, the Hounds...) - The worldbuilding is incredible, as usual. One of my favorite parts of the book was L'oric's visit in the memories of Raraku, with the Hounds, the prehumans and the K'Chain. Everything related to the First Empire is intriguing too. - The marines and all the Bonehunters (BTW surprised they didn't seem to officially acquire the name already, I thought it was going to appear as soon as they turn the omen) are awesome. The military bits of the story are some of the best things SE does. Really loved everything in this part of the story. Fiddler, Gesler, Stormy and all the others, it's delightful to follow them. The not-battle at the end is certainly anticlimactic but I liked it: I didn't want any one of them to die so I prefer it that way!😂 And anyway we had a fabulous scorpion fight so what else can we wish for? - Tavore is intriguing. Liked Gamet too. - What is going on with T'amber? There's something weird here. - Speaking of characters who could be much more than what they look like, this infantry sergeant is suspiciously knowledgable about a lot of things... - Grub! We don't see him much, but he looks really interesting (and I love how Erikson just gives us a fascinating glimpse of the future in the middle of an epigraph). - Lostara and Pearl are an excellent duo. - That final scene with the Liosan 😂 - Corabb Bilan Thenu'alas 😂😂😂. Since I saw his name in the character list, I don't know why but I knew he was going to be a good one. I wasn't disappointed. Each of his scenes is a wonder. He's so hilariously lucky! - The backstabbing festival among the Whirlwind followers was excellent. However I don't like that Korbolo Dom is still alive, especially since I remember that it was mentioned that he had accomplices in Unta... I hope he doesn't manage to escape. And there's Mallick Rel too who is still somewhere, he was the one I REALLY wanted to get what he deserves but apparently he managed to get away... - I'm really curious to see what happens next with the rebellion. Leoman will probably be able to create problems for the Bonehunters, but I don't see how the rebellion can hope to win the war now. I think they will just be able to delay a bit the outcome. - I hope we see more of Torvald in the future. - We don't really know Trull yet but I liked his duo with Onrack. - OTATARAL DRAGON!! - Greyfrog. I love him. - Who were the people who \"called\" the Hounds to Raraku (and got eaten as a reward)? Was it ever explained or is it a mystery for now? - The azalan demons that got out of the stones at the same time everywhere around seven cities (I loved this scene). We don't see them in the end... So I guess they had a kind of mission and we're going to see more of it later? - Can we just talk a bit about Heboric's vision of the jade giants??? What the hell is this? I didn't understand anything, it was just two or three pages in the book but honestly it was probably one of my favorite scenes and I'd even say the book is worth reading just for this. Another excellent book!",

      "content_preview": "Reposting as I had a character name in the title of the post and didn't realise that was a no no, sorry! Hi all, currently on Deadhouse Gates and had a question/theory on Fiddler. I got halfway through House of Chains a couple of years back, but life happened and I spent a bit too long away from the series. So I decided to start again. I’m now on page 155 of DG , where Fiddler, Crokus, and Apsalar are about to enter G’Danisban after coming across the renegade army and the Arak tribe outside the city. There’s a moment where Fiddler converses with Apsalar, then thinks: “Don’t fall in love with this woman, Fid, old friend, else you loosen your guard on the lad’s life, and call it an accident of fate...” Did anyone else other than me read that as Fiddler’s own thought, or is it meant to feel like something else speaking through him? It got me thinking about Fiddler’s “knack” for just sensing/feeling things — like the kind Tattersail flagged back in GotM , when he was pacing in that room with the Bridgeburners when Sorry had gone missing before you know, Ganoes... Does Fiddler get that from a deeper connection elsewhere, like Sorry did with Cotillion? I don’t really want spoilers or answers (I’m happy to find out as I go). Mostly I just wanted to share, since I don’t know anyone else who reads Malazan to discuss these kinds of theories with. Happy to pat myself on the back if I’m onto something — or laugh at myself for overthinking everything Erikson puts on the page. I think he's my favourite character too.",

      "content_preview": "I just finished my first readthrough of the main series, and it's genuinely one of the best things I've read. I think the series is the most consistently brilliant fantasy book series of its length that I've read. I'm hyped to start with the spinoffs. Still, I liked some books more than others, so here's my personal ranking, with spoilers. 10. Gardens of the Moon - I had a lot of fun with this one, but it had some serious problems. Erikson is allergic to exposition, it suffers from saggy middle syndrome, and the Azath House had zero foreshadowing.  Still good, but way below the others. 9. House of Chains - I really don't like Karsa. As I read later books I was able to appreciate what Erikson was trying to say with him, but he's at his most hateable here. I also thought the book would give some insight into Tavore, but she was as much of a mystery by the end as she was in the beginning. Andarist was also pretty underwhelming. The stuff with Fiddler was great though. 8. Deadhouse Gates - Carried heavily by the Chain of Dogs. I liked the Felisin and Icarium plotlines more than some people, but Kalam's plotline was just boring. Again, suffers from lack of exposition. 7. Toll the Hounds - Incredibly overhyped. It has some of the most brilliant moments in the series, but most of it was a slog to get through. Erikson spends a lot of time setting up plot threads that go nowhere (unless NotME follows up on them I guess). I liked the experimental narration style though. 6. Dust of Dreams - Way better than most people say it is. Has the best opening sequence in the series imo. The bonehunters are at their most entertaining, and the setup of various plotlines for TCG was great. I'd honestly rate it higher if not for THAT SCENE (if you've read it, you know what I'm talking about). 5. Reaper's Gale - This book had its problems - the Awl and Shake plotlines were boring, Erikson has some kind of personal beef with my guy Toc, and I hated how Janath's character ended up. Still, this book cemented Rhulad as my favorite fantasy antagonist, the bonehunters kick ass, Tehol and Bugg are as brilliant as always, Udinaas is the goat, and Beak made me cry in public. There's a lot to love about this one. 4. Midnight Tides - I think Lether might be my favorite setting overall. Both the Letherii and the Edur suck ass and I love it. I expected to hate Rhulad but ended the book with a kind of horrified sympathy for him. Trull is great, the Beddict brothers are peak, Iron Bars is cool. The entire thing feels like a Greek tragedy. Not nearly as hard to get into as GoTM or DG. 3. The Bonehunters - I'm not going to lie to you, I wasn't a fan of this one going in. The starting was pretty slow, and I was beginning to think it was overhyped. Then I read Y'Ghatan in one sitting. Did the same thing with Malaz City. If this book had better pacing, it could have been number one on the list. 2. Memories of Ice - This book made me fall in love with Malazan. It has all the weird brilliance of the later books while avoiding many of their problems. Capustan and Coral were some of the best battle sequences I've read. The Pannions are horrifying villains, the Bridgeburners are beautifully tragic, Rake and Quick Ben are awesome, and I can't decide whether Kruppe or Itkovian is my favorite character in the series. 1. The Crippled God - Honestly interchangeable with MOI, but I have it a little higher because the Assail feel like more realistic/believable villains than the Pannions. The payoff to the plot threads set up in DoD and throughout the series is brilliant. Most of the character endings are satisfying, if not necessarily happy. A lot of it, especially with the Snake and the bonehunters is devastating, but that's what makes it great. Just peak overall.",

      "content_preview": "What the hell??? I am trying my best to gather my thoughts hahah. I really enjoyed GotM and DG but I feel like this just absolutely blew me away. Paran is the Master of the Deck?? What does that even mean. He is incredibly reluctant to take on a role like that but it seems like it's inevitable. Dude is going through it I feel so bad for him. I can't help but think Kallor is starting to be on to something with him telling everyone how much of a mistake it is to let Silverfox live. I dunno something ain't right there. My heart hurts so badly for Mhybe, what else is there to say? Imagine giving birth to a child that is a host for multiple souls and is feeding on your life force. Shout out Korlat for being there for her when she wanted to kill herself. It was really nice seeing a Tiste Andii care for someone like that. I was so curious about Brood and what his whole deal was only to find out he quite literally has the fate of humanity resting on his back. Do you save the world or let your god die? Impossible choice, glad I don't have to make it! Kruppe showing back up gave me the biggest grin. Dude goes flying through the air on the table, that was hilarious. And then Paran seeing his face on the table and getting transported to the Azath house where we find out so much shit only to come back completely fucked up and Kruppe goes \"Is anyone else hungry?\" I lost it lmao. And after all of that we still have to deal with the Pannion Domin which no one has any clue what they're capable of. And if I'm correct with what Brood and Rake were talking about in the Tent it seems like the Crippled God may have something to do with the Pannion Domin??? A book has never had me going, WHAT THE FUCK, to laughing, to almost crying within a matter of pages. Maaaaan I'm not even close to seeing where all this goes and I am all fucking in now. Holy hell. I'm sure most people are just going to say read and find out lmao and I will be doing exactly that.",

Which raises another question are the Forkrul Assail really that blind? Can’t they see that chaining the Crippled God only leads to apocalypse, dooming themselves along with everyone else? And what about the Errant, Olar Ethil, or Knuckles? Don’t they also realize the jade statues are closing in, and that the only way to save the world is to free the Crippled God?(I am taking about Gods who either did nothing like Queen of dreams,Oponn or Gods who further complicated it like Elder Gods...Seems like only ST,Hood and D'rek were concerned for the threat)",

      "content_preview": "Another volume to add in my re-read! And I feel like I have particular feelings towards RG... It is the end of an arc, and we have now reached a stage where there are so many storylines and characters that it is virtually impossible to like everything. Yet, despite some criticisms I have of individual storylines, I have still enjoyed a lot the book as a whole, and I'll do my best to articulate my thoughts, starting with these individual storylines. This is a constant over my re-read: I have mixed feelings about how Erikson handles sexual violence. On the one hand, he is excellent at writing the trauma carried by the victims, especially as he deconstructs efficiently the idea of the \"perfect victim\". He already showed it with Felisin, Felisin Younger and Scillara, and here shows it again with Seren Pedac and particularly Udinaas. If I remember correctly, there was a controversy a few years ago, when Erikson criticized someone who called Felisin a 'bitch'. He did a thought experiment where Felisin would be replaced by a male character, and called out the sexist double standard by saying that, were Felisin a male character, there wouldn't have been the same amount of backslash regarding her behaviour. Well, if I may, he didn't have to invent an example. Udinaas reacts terribly to his rape, and isn't in a situation where could deal with his trauma in a healthy way. He even physically assaults Seren Pedac and is threatened by Fear Sengar! Yet, nowhere did I see a similar backslash targeted towards him compared with Felisin. On the other hand, as soon as sexual violence becomes graphics in Malazan, it feels gratuitous to me, added to show how dark the universe is, except it doesn't tell me anything more that this dark fantasy series is indeed dark fantasy. And RG has, unfortunately, one of the worst examples of this. Reading about Janath gets raped and tortured, and even when she manages to get free, she gets captured again and is tortured and raped again until she finally kills her rapist? Robin Hobb has been often accused of writing 'misery porn', but I feel like this specific storyline fits better this accusation. This doesn't help that Tanal Yathvanar is such a cartoonist, one-dimension villain, whilst for instance Bidithal was as despicable as him, but he had more depth. Bless Bugg, though, he's the best! I get that the whole message of this storyline is that fascists use rape as a weapon against political opponents... but when I was re-reading RG, I also watched Andor Season 2, and this show managed to convey this message in such a more efficient way. As both a Malazan and Star Wars fan, I can't believe Star Wars did something better than Malazan, but that's just one small, individual storyline. As usual, Karsa Orlong annoyed me so much. His attempts to be badass sound cringe, and he's arrogant, selfish, sexist. Sure, Conan the Rapist, lament about how 'women are complicated' as if you were a Wheel of Time character. And yes, Samar Dev also generalizes about men, but it feels so tame in comparison. And perhaps I'm biased by the re-read, but it was so predictable that Karsa would prevail against Rhulad. Luckily Icarium could bring some nuance, but it also shows how much I find him so much deeper than Karsa. My other complaints are rather minor. I know this was a set-up for Toll the Hounds, but I wasn't invested a lot in Nimander's storyline. Hannan Mosag was teased a lot and falls flat, even though this was probably the point. Also, I don't like how much Masan Gilani is objectified (Baldur's Gate 3 proved you can make sexy characters without sexualising them), by male and female soldiers alike, because at best this makes her a one-dimensional character. I don't want to be unfair against Erikson though, since Masan is pretty much the only soldier where the male gaze is obvious, and he made a tremendous effort to depict a varied cast of badass female soldiers who aren't sexualised. There were also some other... weird stuff? Like when Rucket feels so comfortable transformed into an obese woman, juxtaposed to a scene where the despicable Tanal tells how much women are sexier when they are skinny. But then, contrary to a lot of readers, I've actually enjoyed Redmask's storyline. His relationship with the K'Chain Che'Malle, the rebellion making this new empire unstable, his whole badass vibe, even the revelation he was a Letherri adds to the deconstruction of the whole 'external savior of tribes' trope.  And this allowed me to experience Bivatt and Brohl's camarederie. The only issue for me? His death. Perhaps it's too blamed to the constant POV shift, but it feels like out of nowhere... and also cartoonist, in a way? I had to re-read twice to check Redmask was indeed yeeted, impaled, and then his chopped arm whirls like an helicopter. What? And for him, I won't be original, but oh how I regret I didn't pay more attention to Beak during my first read. Malazan is everything but concise, hence why his storyline works particularly well. He probably doesn't appear more than 50 pages in total and yet leaves a huge impact. First because he's so relatable (and even more autistic-coded than Bottle). But most of all because of his contrast with the other Malazan soldiers and their camaraderie. Erikson succeeded in writing about a poor guy just wanting friends, and then sacrificed himself for them, without being cheesy or cliché and that's a brilliant tour de force. Then, despite my criticisms, I still believe Reaper's Gale is excellent: because it is structured very well despite some bloats, and also for its themes. RG is probably one of the best fantasy examples of the quote \"fascism is colonialism turned inside.\" I loved that the Malazans don't appear until nearly half-way through the book. First because it feels like a natural transition from Midnight Tides, but also because it fits the novel's themes, This new empire embodies the worst aspect of both Letherii and Tiste Edur's societies. It is very unstable, with the Awl rebellion and all the different conspirators. I notably enjoyed following all these fascists wannabes (Karos, Tanal, Triban, Rautos...), even though they felt a bit interchangeable. It was already crumbling, the Malazan just delivered the final blow. And oh how well Erikson can write battles. This is epic fantasy at its peak. Redmask's battles against Bivatt and Brohl's forces, the three dragons fighting against Silchas Ruin and his allies, and the ultimate one. Erikson rarely disappoints with climaxes and he proved it again: while I have some criticisms of the novel's pacing, Chapter 24 is perfectly paced and very intense. There are also several other 'little things' I loved such asYan Tovis and Yedan Derryg (now that I know the pay-off), the Hellian's hilarious comment of \"conquering Lether from one tavern to another\".  It's probably bad storytelling to introduce a whole new cast of characters with their backstory near to the 1000th page of the seventh volume of the series, yet I liked it because it's a perfect illustration of Malazan's roleplay origins: new players joining in the middle of the campaign. And for the transition, Smiles dreaming of killing the Emperor herself. So then, again, Rhulad is one of the best Malazan villains, in my opinion. There is a lot of subtle writing behind him, his presence indirect during the first half. I guess I have a weakness for the \"strong yet pathetic villain\", a perfect deconstruction of a power fantasy, a poor young man so paranoid his own parents conspires against him and he locks them, causing their death. He's so hateable and yet I can't help to feel sorry for him as he becomes more isolated and powerless... And it was natural to finish with Trull Sengar... Perhaps I'm still upset, but it just doesn't work for me. The random deaths were something I didn't like, in retrospect, about A Song of Ice and Fire. I know it's unfair because it's the point, but I just don't believe it was executed properly. Uru Hela, a much minor character, also has a random death, but it serves to illustrate that the Malazans are in unknown territory, and soldiers are expected to die in war. Here, it just feels like Erikson had no idea what to do with Trull now that his entire family is dead, and just chose to kill him too for lack of better idea, even though the appeal of this character was notably how 'disjointed he was from his family... This is probably my longest review, and I probably wasn't exhaustive, so I'll stop it here, but to summarize, RG delivered its promises in spite of its weaknesses. I'm excited to re-read Toll the Hounds next because I remember enjoying it better than most readers during my first read, hopefully this will be confirmed during my re-read! EDIT: That's it. I was excited to discuss about Trull, Rhulad, Beak, Redmask. It's tiring to make an effort to write a nuanced review just to get receive condescending after condescending lectures every time I express an opinion that deviates from the popular ones. I can praise Erikson's prose, battles, themes, characters, give a book a solid 8/10, but that's not enough for some people. Why should I engage with a community that don't accept anything but uncritical praise of Erikson?",

Having a world that's more than 300.000 years old which was at that point already relatively sophisticated as far as I understand (from information about/by the T'lan Imass) but apparently didn't significantly \"evolve\" in terms of technology etc. is somehow challenging my imagination. I mean even Dune where there's been stagnation between the Butlerian Jihad and the events of the first novel is \"only\" dealing with 10.000s of years. If it's possible to answer without spoilers I'd like to know if this is explained/referenced at some point, have there been for example several apocalyptic events throwing society/societies back tens of thousands of years? Otherwise I wonder why from a storytelling perspective it needed to be 300.000 years and not for example just 30.000 :D",

      "content_preview": "I finished the series 2 weeks ago and since I love seeing other people's rankings, I decided to finally type out my official (semi gushing lol) first-read ranking! It's too hard to judge The Crippled God by itself, so I'm doing a 9-book ranking. #9 Gardens of the Moon. I don't remember a ton about my experience reading GotM except that it was enjoyable and an intriguing enough book 1 to get me to continue. Sorry and the massacre at Itko Kan hooked me early on and I loved Erikson's writing style immediately. GotM is at the bottom of the pack mainly because it didn't give me the emotional impact that all the other books delivered. The characterization was also the weakest, I really struggled to keep the Bridgeburners straight (besides Whiskeyjack, Kalam, Quick Ben, Ganoes, and Sorry) and wanted more internal monologues. #8 Midnight Tides. I loved Tehol and Bugg and all the undead shenanigans in Letheras, and the discussions around capitalism and consumerism were interesting. I just wasn't very interested in the Edur (in isolation). I still enjoyed the book, but I enjoyed others more. I think the Letherii politics were better explored and the Edur were more interesting in RG. But, the first Rhulad resurrection scene was incredible. I also had a very broken up reading experience, which probably reduced my immersion and enjoyment of the book. #7 Deadhouse Gates. Incredible book. I was so haunted by the end of the Chain of Dogs, I had to dive into Malaztube videos to help process what I just witnessed. Being true to my reading experience though, DG's low because it was a bit of a slog to get through the Duiker POVs after he sends Kulp & co. to find Heboric and before he meets up with Coltaine. I also wasn't that interested in Kalam's subplot until the final confrontation with Laseen (I don't much care for assassins). #6 Memories of Ice. On any given day, it's a toss-up between MoI and DG. For now, MoI has the slight edge because: 1) it actually made me cry (neither GotM, MT, or DG did. Every book from here on up turned on the waterworks), 2) Itkovian and the T'lan Imass, and 3) the K'Chain Che'Malle!!!! Also, Capustan. My small gripe is that I didn't care much for the Mhybe subplot. #5 House of Chains. I don't think I will ever say that I love Karsa, but I loved his character arc in this book. I love when authors play with perspective and weave things together subtly, like dropping little hints in part 1 to indicate where we were in the timeline, showing Karsa's attack on the Silanda, and finally revealing that we've already met Karsa in DG. On top of that, I loved how I felt the emotional weight of the Chain of Dogs and Coral with every step the Bonehunters took. HoC had lots of interesting lore drops that opened up the world even more: the Liosan, the nascent, Forkrul Assail, Korabas, Deragoth, Drift Avalii and Andarist. I enjoyed every plot thread. #4 The Bonehunters. For me, this is the point in the series where the themes got really interesting. Fanaticism, inequity, the idea of absolution, and the relationship between gods and their worshippers, truth and propaganda. Fascinating discussions about all of these ideas; Mappo & Spite talking about inequity being at the root of fanaticism is a top tier passage. On top of that, it was a really fun read, great action, lots of lore reveals that felt like a reward for getting to book 6, and the start of the convergence of the 3 continents' plots! Why is BH not higher? The ending was... ok. I loved the tribunal scene and Kalam agonizing over what to do, but since I don't enjoy assassins, the big assassin battle through Malaz city was fine (I liked the Bonehunters side of it though). Icarium raging was eye-opening, but it didn't give me a strong emotional ending (although Cotillion sitting with his face in his hands was a nice touch). Basically, at this point, I expect every book ending to leave me in tears lol, and BH did not. #3 Toll the Hounds. I adored Kruppe's narrative voice: the occasional meta interjections, how he set the stage of each chapter, Greek (?) chorus-style- it was wonderfully stylized. Everything in Darujhistan was fantastic; even though Crokus and Challice got annoying, their toxic situationship was extremely relatable. The Tiste Andii plot was filled with fascinating discussions about absolution vs. redemption. On first read, this part of the plot was almost a slog at times because it was so slow and ponderous and I just wanted to know how it all converged. I also didn't love Nimander (he gave me WoT Perrin Aybara \"reluctant but well regarded leader\" vibes). But, I'll probably enjoy it more on reread when I'm able & willing to luxuriate in the prose. I really, really loved the recontextualization of \"Hood's breath\"; the quote about drawing a breath that starts in love and ends in grief will forever reverberate mentally any time I read about another death. The only reason TtH isn't higher is because the Bonehunters aren't in it. But man, what an amazing book. It's a toss-up between this and Reaper's Gale. #2 Reaper's Gale. For me, RG struck a good balance between thematic plots, abstract ideas, and action. I was much more interested in the Edur in RG than in MT b/c of the exploration of cultural assimilation / culture clashes (how the Edur adapt to nominally ruling the empire) and how that contrasted with the Malazan empire. The Patriotists subplot felt extremely relevant to the current moment, and I enjoyed the continued exploration of truth vs. propaganda, power, and un/certainty. Then there's the marine invasion (the demon prince farmers LOL), Tavore's unwitnessed speech, Beak, and an extremely satisfying conclusion. Rhulad is one of the most compelling tragic characters I've ever read, and I think realizing early on that there would be no Icarium vs. Karsa duel probably increased my enjoyment. Also, more K'Chain Che'Malle! #1 Dust of Dreams + The Crippled God. I loved Dust of Dreams: it explored leadership, the search for purpose, and the common soldier's experience from so many different perspectives- I loved it. It also explored the incredibly bleak but thought provoking question of whether civilizations should become extinct & which ones can evolve / should live on through the K'Chain Che'Malle, the Barghast, the T'lan Imass, and probably others. At some point, I interpreted the Snake to be the living embodiment of the \"children are dying\" mantra which kept re-appearing verbatim in at least RG onward. Dust of Dreams is IMO the most evocative title in the series and very fitting for the tone of the book. I enjoyed every plot thread, as harrowing as some of them were to read. And what an insane ending! The Crippled God: what can I say? Tavore, the Bonehunters, Tool and family, Toc and the ascended Bridgeburners, the reunion of Whiskeyjack and Korlat, Hood, Gesler & Stormy & Bent & Roach, the Snake, Yedan, Spinnock's speech. It truly felt like the culmination of the series, with themes from books 1-9 being woven back in (compassion, sacrifice, history, witnessing, children are dying, motherhood, chains, fanaticism, gods and their worshippers, un/certainty, etc.), to deliver a decidedly hopeful response about humanity to the question posed in DoD. There was a clear sense of hope of passing on a better world to the next generation, to the children. While I didn't love some of the final battles in tCG, the strength and beauty of the series finale puts it at the top of my list with DoD. I loved how it mirrored the start of GotM, and it helped me better understand the GotM prologue on re-read (Whiskeyjack stopping before saying to Ganoes \"the world doesn't need another soldier\". But as Fiddler says, \"well, the world always needs more soldiers\").",

What I am wondering is if there are good resources for recapping the novels, the characters, who they are, story beats and maybe other important information for each of the novels? I know that I will likely read a book, take a break, read another and I know that Malazan is long and has a lot of characters and plot lines and I've heard that some books feature all new sets od characters with their own plot lines, so it can be easy for new readers to get lost. If there are good resources for recapping and reminding myself what happens but without spoiling what happens in the future novels then please let me know. And thank you to anyone that can help!",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I have just finished reading The Crippled God for the first time yesterday and I have a lot of thoughts about this series, so I figured this might be the best place to share them. Apologies in advance if this post turns out to be super lengthy or ramble-y, I tend to do that in these kinds of posts xD Malazan Book of the Fallen is a series I've heard about a lot in the past few years. I've always heard it described as very \"advanced fantasy\" that \"doesn't hold your hand\" and is very \"hard to get into\" and \"complicated\". But I've also heard immense praise for it from the fans of the series and I've seen it rank consistently high on a lot of top fantasy series lists. It took me a little under a year to get through the main 10 books and after finishing I can say that I fully understand most of the things said about it. It is indeed really \"advanced\", hard to get into, confusing and complicated but also super cool and epic. I'm gonna try to break down the things I liked about this series the most and also the things that frustrated me the most. Spectacular events One of the things that Malazan is absolutely the best at is building up to absolutely epic events and showing them to you in an extremely cool way. GoM ends with a battle between a dragon and a demon. That itself already sounds pretty cool and yet it's probably the least cool finale of the series! You have gods, demons, dragons, high mages, huge armies all clashing and causing world-changing events and Erikson is so damn good at writing those. At the end of each book after reading the finale I always had the feeling of \"damn that was cool\" in a way that very few other fantasy books have made me feel. Humanization of characters Personally I didn't find a lot of Erikson's characters to be particularly well-written, a lot of the soldiers seemed to just have one trait that was treated as sort of a gag and it didn't really go beyond that (Helian is the most obvious example). But the way they interacted with each other and treated each other was very human and very realistic. I felt like I could empathize with quite a lot of the characters in this series. Not just the soldiers but also ordinary citizens, children, rulers, heck even some gods. They all had something about them that made them very relatable, I could understand them even if I wasn't necessarily cheering for them. Felisin in DG was probably my favorite. She was being an absolute bitch to everyone around her even though they were just trying to help her. I hated her for it and yet I completely understood her. I fully understood why she would act that way after everything she's been through, how that behavior was an irrational but a natural response to all the physical and emotional trauma she's been exposed to. I didn't always understand all the motivations of all the characters in this series, but most of the time their behavior felt very realistic and human (even for the non-human ones lol). Scale I am not afraid to say that in terms of scale this is probably the biggest series I have ever read and I'm not sure if I've even heard of a bigger one. I don't mean that by page count but by the sheer size of the world that was built here. Because of that it can at times feel very overwhelming and confusing, but I appreciate what Erikson was going for here. Telling a story taking place over multiple continents with various races, cultures, countries, religions etc. while making it all at least remotely coherent is a monumental task and I feel Erikson has done a phenomenal job there. The world just works, there was nothing that didn't make sense to me in terms of worldbuilding. The nations were what I would imagine them to be based on their history and geography, the way they treated themselves and other people made sense, the way the main characters interacted with them made sense, the whole picture just worked. On such a massive scale that's a monumental achievement. Pacing Now we're getting to the bad stuff. Pacing is one of the most important things for me in storytelling, I need to have a well-paced story in order to truly enjoy it. If you have a 900-page book where the first 700 is a slog and the rest is pure awesomeness, I'm not going to rate such a book as high, cause the slog drags it down a lot. With Malazan this wasn't a huge issue for me at first. The first few books had some slow starts but generally they got going relatively quickly. But it became worse and worse as the series got on and by the last three books I actually found myself bored for most of the books. The way the chapters were structured also didn't help at all. Now admittedly this is mostly my fault, nobody is forcing me to read a whole chapter every time and I could easily just stop reading mid-chapter and finish it the next day. But I don't want to! Chapters are meant to separate a story into smaller subsections. When your chapters are 30+ pages long and almost nothing happens in them, that really hurts the pacing of the story for me. Like I've just invested like an hour into your book and got almost no progress. Also the way he splits the chapters just seems completely arbitrary. The most glaring example to me was HoD Chapter 2. This chapter is like 60 pages long in my copy and in it Karsa finds and frees a Forkrul Assail, fights a bunch of people, attacks a village and gets captured. Why not split this into 3 chapters? First one about the Forkrul Assail, second one about the attack, third one about the capture and aftermath. I don't remember the chapter exactly but I remember that at the time of reading I could clearly see how the chapter could easily be split into 3 chapters of about 20 pages each, where each chapter would be pretty much self-contained. Why not do it like that? Why have such a long ass chapter for no reason? Even the shorter chapters are pretty long, I feel like 30-40 pages was an average for a chapter. I'm not a fan of that and it made the already slow pacing even worse for me. Juggling plot threads This kind of ties to the previous point and was again an issue for me in the last few books. As the series got on we were introduced to more and more plotlines, more and more characters, more and more continents, countries and cultures. All without any proper introduction, just being thrown in there. I got used to that after the first few books and didn't really mind it but my problem became apparent towards the end of the series, when I understood that a lot of these plotlines are being sidelined or straight up abandoned. I loved the Bridgeburners and the Bonehunters, I loved Ganoes Paran, I loved Kalam, I liked Ap'salar, I was interested in what the gods were doing. There were a lot of plotlines that I was invested in. So when book 8 comes, Erikson makes you spend half of it with a bunch of Tiste Andii that I felt absolutely no connection to. Oh, you like these 15 plotlines I started? Well here's plotline number 16 for half of the book! Maybe it's my fault but I just don't have the mental capacity to care about yet another plotline and yet another bunch of characters 8 books deep into a series when there's a ton of other characters whose stories I'm already invested it. I didn't find the Tiste story in TtH interesting at all and I was kinda dreading reading about it every time their chapter was on. Which was like half of the chapters in the book. Same for DoD and the Barghast plotline. I have nothing against the Barghast, they were an interesting little thread in MoI and an unexpected arrival in RG. But this is book 9 out of 10, you have a shitton of other more interesting plotlines going on, why do we have to spend so much time with what seems to me like tertiary characters at best? There were plotlines that were dragging on for far too long only to have a pretty lackluster ending, the worst one for me was The Snake. I just hated it every time a scene about it appeared. When you are 9 books deep into such a massive series and you have like 20 other plotlines hanging in the air which I'm more interested in, do you really have to give a brand new one about some kids in a desert that I never met before? And do you have to drag it for almost 2 whole books only for the ending to be \"and then they were saved by the Bonehunters\"? What was that plotline with the fallen K'Chain Che'Malle city with the group of people there? I can't even remember any of their names, they weren't even tertiary characters they were like... quinternary characters or something. And yet we spend so much time with them and then they all die. Oh and Icarium was there too and did.. something. Something which I never understood and so that plotline was utterly pointless for me. It really felt like Erikson bit off a little more than he could actually chew and I was getting quite frustrated about it near the end. I get that Erikson was trying to tell some sort of message with that but there were more efficient ways of doing that. And that brings me to my next point. Philosophy vs. plot In the last 3-4 books it felt like Erikson leant very heavily into themes and expressing certain messages to the detriment of the plot. I have no issue with authors taking their time to share some message in their stories, after all that's what art is mostly about. But there were so many times where characters just talked about philosophy for pages and pages while the plot was at an absolute halt. Personally the type of story I enjoy the most is the one that can express a message through the plot. And I feel like Erikson himself absolutely can do that and in fact did do that in the first few books. DG was full of moments like that with the Chain of Dogs going on their long ass walk with people dying every minute, being under constant attack from the rebels. Even here there were moments of Duiker straight up just philosophising and I didn't mind those, because the plot was constantly moving at the time. He didn't just talk philosophy for the sake of it, he was commenting on events that were happening which were moving the plot forward and that's how the author's message was shared with the audience. I preferred that approach so much more compared to Crokus just being depressed for half of TtH while doing absolutely nothing except for banging Kalista a few times. And again, once the plot finally got going, once Murillio died and the dominoes started to fall, it was a really nice and exciting read. But it took like 600-700 pages of boredom and deep conversations to get to that. I'm really not a fan of that. Missing background info I talked about how Erikson is really great at writing huge events and I stand by that, however one thing that really drags those events down for me is the background info to these events which I'm just severely lacking. Once again this was more of a problem in the later books. In DG I fully understand why the rebels are attacking the Malazans, I understand why Coltaine and his soldiers are protecting the citizens and so at the end when they all die, their sacrifice feels very meaningful and sad to me. In MoI I understand the motivations of the Pannion Seer, I understand how and why he did what he did and I understand why they dealt with him the way they did and it all makes sense and it works. This is not the case in the later books. In TtH we have this super important event where Anomander Rake kills the god of death and then sacrifices himself to bring the Mother Night back to the Tiste Andii... or something. I don't really understand how all of that works and what it all means and therein lies the issue. I can't fully appreciate the event that is happening if I don't understand why it is happening. Why did you have to kill Hood? Why did you have to go into Dragnipur and stop the chaos there or whatever you did. Who is actually Mother Night, why were you separated and why did you have to do this to bring her back. And most important, why now? That's the thing I understand the least. Why is all of this happening right now? Why not in the thousands of years prior? The same is true for the Shake plotline at the end for example. It was a really cool battle and I very much enjoyed it, one of the only plotlines I actually enjoyed in TCG before the finale, but I didn't really understand it fully. Yeah we are fighting the Tiste Liosan to prevent them from capturing Kharkanas but... why? Why do they want it so badly? Why can't we allow them to have it? What is the lightfall? Why is there a hole in it now that we've arrived here? Why hasn't it appeared thousands of years ago when there was nobody to defend it? I'm sure there are answers to this in text and I will much appreciate if you guys can provide them but I think a lot of you will agree that a first time reader has no chance remembering all those tiny breadcrumbs that were dropped 7 books ago (I remember Anomander talking to Hood all the way back in GoM but I have no clue what they talked about). And I can imagine that on a reread discovering all these breadcrumbs and understanding them now that you now what they are going to lead to must be immensely satisfying. But that's simply not the type of story that I enjoy. I prefer when that satisfying feeling of the breadcrumbs falling into place comes at the end of the book, during the event that they all lead to, so I can fully enjoy it. If your book requires me to read it twice in order to completely understand the story, then it's not an efficiently told story for me. I fully understand that Erikson most likely does this deliberately but it just doesn't work for me. I'm okay with not knowing everything. I'm okay with having to think a bit and pay attention in order to connect the dots myself. But if I have to literally make notes and huge ass charts on a whiteboard in order to understand what just happened, then you failed me as a storyteller. I'm sure a lot of you as fans of this series like this type of storytelling and I'm really happy for you, but sadly I can't join you on that boat. And to this day I still have no clue why the fuck did the moon explode. The (lack of) payoff So here we are at the end of the series. The finale of TCG was an absolutely huge and spectacular battle with various races and gods all participating and it ends with a massive dragon killing hundreds of other dragons to a point where there's literally \"raining dragons\". It doesn't get more epic fantasy than that. So in terms of a big spectacle, yeah, this finale was awesome. In terms of themes, yeah, the message of sacrifice and camaraderie was delivered very effectively. But in terms of overall closure... I personally wasn't satisfied. I didn't expect to get answers to all the questions I had and I didn't expect to understand the answers even if they were given to me. (An example of this is Tavore being shown to be a Talon, which apperently explains how she knew all the things she knew cause she got info from Cotillion. I got that she was a Talon but I didn't at all make the connection to Cotillion there, I googled that afterwards. Whelp.) But I still felt unfulfilled. There were a lot of things that just kinda went nowhere for me. Gruntle just dies in some random cave, I didn't understand what they were fighting for, who was he fighting with or anything. But he's dead. Draconus gets freed from Dragnipur, showcases his cool wings a few times, hangs around with Ublala and then kills Kilmandaros. And...that's it. What was the point of him really? Why was he even there at the end? Icarium... just all of him honestly. I didn't understand his plotline from the beginning to the end. Yeah I get that he is extremely powerful when he gets enraged, commits atrocities during that and then has amnesia afterwards. But what happened to him in Letheras? I get that he created new Warrens or something but how? Why? Where did he go after and what did he do in that entire plotline with the K'Chain Che'Malle city? Why does he randomly appear at the end finding Mappo's body? Yeah he doesn't remember him which is really tragic but like... he really didn't have any role in the story at the end? It felt like he was built up quite a lot and then did very little and the things he did were confusing as hell and Erikson never elaborated on them. Why did Fener appear in the sky and was killed instantly by Karsa? What was the purpose of that? Why did we need that blood rain to do things? What was the point of Olar Ethil? She spent two books wandering around, harassing Tool and his kids and then she just gets shot in the head with an arrow. What the heck was the point then? Why is Sinn the way she is? Is she just straight up crazy? How does she know so many things? And what about Grub? Why is a tiny-ass kid suddenly leading an army? Why is Heboric suddenly here? How is he the answer to all our problems right now? Just questions and mysteries and confusion piling up as I went along. The moment that I was waiting for, the moment where I would finally think \"ooh, I see\" never came. And again, I didn't expect answers to all of these questions, not even most of them. But at least give me some answers. I didn't get any and when I got some, they were accompanied with two more questions. At least at the very end, in the absolute finale I expected to have a little more understanding, but I just kept getting more and more confused and mystified. Conclusion Sorry if this post comes across as very negative, I don't have overly negative thoughts about the series, it's just the worse parts are more fresh in my mind then the ones I enjoyed more. I also find it a lot easier to write about things I dislike than the things I like, so I tend to ramble about that a little more. I really really enjoyed the beginning of this series and grew more and more frustrated with it as it went on. Now that I've reached the end, I'm just happy it's over and I don't really feel any desire to read more from this universe (at least at this point in time) let alone do a reread. I would like to do a reread at some point in my life, but I feel like that's gonna be at least 5 years from now. And maybe once I finally get around to it, once I see all those breadcrumbs planted in there and will finally connect the dots and see the bigger picture, I will be able to truly appreciate what a huge tapestry this series really is. If and when that happens, I will come back here and tell you that you were all right. But until then, I'll spend my time with some less complex and less demanding stories. Here's my ranking for the Book of the Fallen books: Deadhouse Gates Memories of Ice The Bonehunters House of Chains Midnight Tides Reaper's Gale The Crippled God Gardens of the Moon Toll the Hounds Dust of Dreams I will leave you with a thought that was very often in my mind while reading this series. I thought this often after reading some of the huge events and battles, I thought it at the end of almost every book of the series and it was the first thing that came to my mind after finishing the series as a whole. I think it actually summarizes my thoughts about this series rather nicely: I don't know what the hell happened... but it was pretty cool",
