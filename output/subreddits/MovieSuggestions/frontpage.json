      "content_preview": "I've been on a documentary binge lately and it made me realize how many amazing ones fly completely under the radar. One that really stuck with me was Brothers in Blood: The Lions of Sabi Sand . It's about a coalition of lions in South Africa and their rise to dominance over a huge territory. The way it's filmed and the story it tells honestly felt like something out of a movie and it gave you that adrenaline kick that is rare especially for me where the only thing that gives me that rush is when I play jackpot city. It made me wonder how many other incredible documentaries are out there that don't get the attention they deserve. What's the most underrated documentary you've seen like something you think more people should know about but maybe never got mainstream recognition? I'm always surprised by how many people haven't heard of some of these smaller productions that are just as compelling as the big Netflix releases. Sometimes the best stories are the ones that don't have huge marketing budgets behind them. Looking to add a bunch to my watchlist especially anything that completely flew under the radar but deserves way more attention.",

I‚Äôm a huge horror fan and I mostly only watch horror movies. A lot of horror movies are actually really moving and poignant . I don‚Äôt remember the last movie that makes me feel the same way Sinners does. I just love the themes of freedom, of the beauty of cultures and heritage, and most importantly, pursuing one‚Äôs dreams and live their own lives, instead of becoming part of a hive mind and losing individuality. The movie made me feel like we are all so different, come from different cultures and traditions and we all have our own dreams and our own definition of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù; yet we are so similar, so connected in a way. The desire for freedom really do transcend time and race, you don‚Äôt have to be a black person living in the 30s to relate to it, that‚Äôs what makes this movie so powerful. That scene where Sammie holding onto his broken guitar in the car is something that will forever be in my memory. Is there other movies or series that will bring similar feelings? I like vibrant and colorful movies, great soundtrack, movies that make you painful and hopeful at the same time, but not in a cheesy way.",

More: Fairly accurate recounting of the story of Karen Silkwood, the Oklahoma nuclear-guy I'll plant worker who blew the whistle on dangerous practices at the Kerr-McGee plant and who died under circumstances which are still under debate. Karen Silkwood lives a free-spirited existence with two friends, Drew Stephens and Dolly Pelliker, who work with her at an Oklahoma nuclear facility. It's only when she discovers she has been exposed to radiation that Karen's conscience awakens, and soon she is digging for evidence of wrongdoing.

There are people out there you may not know it but inspire them and wish to be you especially in this modern world, everyone is always comparing eachother on social media",

Movies I specifically remember are Bratz Super Babies, Opposite Day, and Daddy DayCare. Also movies like Zathura and The Cat in the Hat movie? But those are a lot more mainstream. Occasionally something happens and it unlocks a memory of these movies so I'm trying to see if anyone else remembers any of these bad movies that I'll be like OH YEAH I forgot about that insane movie.

While all of them were good one-time watches, none of them really scratched the itch. What I‚Äôm looking for is that mind-blowing experience....the kind where the credits roll and I‚Äôm left stunned, jaw on the floor, thinking ‚Äúwhat the hell just happened!!!\" The last time I felt that way was with Behind Her Eyes (its a mini-series and my god! that last twist really blew me away). Maybe my expectations have become unrealistically high for a movie, but I‚Äôm still chasing that feeling. I‚Äôm desperate for a thriller that actually shocks me again.

      "content_preview": "Chat, I fucked up. My eldest child is about to turn 18 and is entering her last year of secondary school. She has never seen Star Wars, The Truman Show, or Jurassic Park. I know. I KNOW. Presumably there are other major gaps in her cinematic consumption. I have nine months, maybe a year, to rectify my negligence. She suggested a weekly family movie night this year with the aim of remediating these deficiencies. So now I'm compiling a list of ~50 movies that she ought to watch before I send her out into the world. So far, the list includes: Star Wars (4/5/6) Mission Impossible The Truman Show Jurassic Park Ladybird Best In Show Almost Famous Superbad Everything Everywhere All At Once O Brother, Where Art Thou? Get Out something Wes Anderson Rear Window So far, the list is pretty western white male -centric. So is Hollywood; nevertheless I'd like to aim for a more inclusive list. My youngest is 13 and will join us for movie nights. I don't censor the media my kids consume - if they want to read Lady Chatterley's Lover, or watch Y Tu Mama Tambien, that's fine by me. In general, none of us are fans of horror/gore, but suspense is a-ok. (Hitchcock - yes, Saw - no) What movie is mandatory viewing for a person on the verge of adulthood? Edit: I asked, and reddit DELIVERED. I'm compiling these in a spreadsheet as they come in - thus far, there are over 500 unique recommendations. The most frequently recommended movie is Back to the Future, followed closely by Jaws, The Matrix, The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, and The Shawshank Redemption. My daughter has begun to comb through the spreadsheet to mark what she has already seen. She's ticked ~30 boxes so far, but hasn't finished the entire list. We will NOT be watching Oldboy. JFC. I may be remiss in my parental duties insofar as making sure the kids watch Star Wars, but I've been around long enough to know that reading a synopsis is probably a smart move before showing my kids movies recommended by the Internet at large. Thank you for the thoughtful and comprehensive suggestions!",
