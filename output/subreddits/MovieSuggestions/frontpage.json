So I was not prepared. For those who haven't seen it: it's set in a dystopian society where single people have 45 days to find a partner or they get turned into an animal. Also, everyone speaks like an emotionally stunted robot. There’s a scene where a man kicks a child. I REPEAT: A MAN KICKS A CHILD to prove a point to his potential soulmate.I haven't stopped thinking about it. It's equal parts hilarious, horrifying, and deeply weird. My partner now keeps asking if I'd rather be turned into a lobster or a parrot if things don't work out between us. I am afraid he is hinting at something.can you reccomend more movies like this? I really need to go on the road started",

One that really stuck with me wasBrothers in Blood: The Lions of Sabi Sand. It's about a coalition of lions in South Africa and their rise to dominance over a huge territory. The way it's filmed and the story it tells honestly felt like something out of a movie and it gave you that adrenaline kick that is rare especially for me where the only thing that gives me that rush is when I play jackpot city. It made me wonder how many other incredible documentaries are out there that don't get the attention they deserve. What's the most underrated documentary you've seen like something you think more people should know about but maybe never got mainstream recognition?I'm always surprised by how many people haven't heard of some of these smaller productions that are just as compelling as the big Netflix releases. Sometimes the best stories are the ones that don't have huge marketing budgets behind them.Looking to add a bunch to my watchlist especially anything that completely flew under the radar but deserves way more attention.",

It’s this animated film by Richard Linklater that follows a guy wandering through a dreamlike world, having deep conversations about life, reality, and consciousness. The animation style is wild-rotoscoped, so it’s like real people but with this surreal, shifting vibe that makes everything feel like you’re floating in a dream. It’s not a movie you watch for a tight plot; it’s more like diving into a philosophy class mixed with trippy visuals.I was hooked from the first scene, where people just start riffing on existential ideas, like free will or the nature of dreams. It’s the kind of movie that makes you want to pause and talk about it with friends afterward-I ended up texting my buddy at 2 AM about the meaning of life. If you’re into films that challenge your brain, likeEternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindorDonnie Darko, this is a must-watch. Just go in with an open mind and maybe a coffee to keep up with the ideas. Anyone else seenWaking Life? What other trippy, thought-provoking movies should I check out next?",

It's only when she discovers she has been exposed to radiation that Karen's conscience awakens, and soon she is digging for evidence of wrongdoing. But her sudden zeal for safer working conditions may come at a high price as she alienates friends...and possibly even puts her own life in peril.",

Beatty plays Senator Jay Billington Bulworth a tired suicidal McGovern Democrat who has sold out all his values to corporate lobbyists. He decides to hire a hitman to off himself but before his appointment with the assassin he goes scorched earth.The movie has the (probably) correct assumption that every word out of a mainstream Democrats mouth is bland liberal nicety doublespeak.  It made me so happy to see a movie take down what a hollow thing these political facades are.It isn't a perfect movie. There is a subplot that brings Bulworth to the Black community and he takes up rapping after meeting with a magic negro trope. That just doesn't really work but otherwise I was laughing the hardest I've laughed at a comedy in a long time.A great comedy punches up and 'Bulworth' chose a perfect target in the spineless Clinton brand Democrats who sold out the left.",

Not too paranormal and unrealistic is more preferable in general.So the formula is: sensitive, brilliant, somewhat successful in his/her endeavours involving applying his/her intelligence and perceptiveness, ideally making the world a better place.I also liked \"Scorpion\" series about a team of gifted people helping FBI, but it's kinda cheesy and pretty narcissistic (the dude behind the protagonist participated in writing process, duh).",

Some of my favorites: Primal fear, The Prestige, Prisoners, Seven, No Country for Old Men, The Usual Suspects, LA Confidential, Nightcrawler, Mulholland Drive, Memento, Black Swan, Donnie Darko, Triangle, The Sixth Sense, The Others, The Shining… to....Oldboy, Memories of Murder, The Wailing, I Saw the Devil, The Lives of Others, Secret in Their Eyes, Incendies, etc.Over the last few days, I checked out some recommendations from this sub like Frailty, Tell No One, Stir of Echoes, What Lies Beneath, and Arlington Road. While all of them were good one-time watches, none of them really scratched the itch.What I’m looking for is that mind-blowing experience....the kind where the credits roll and I’m left stunned, jaw on the floor, thinking “what the hell just happened!!!\" The last time I felt that way was with Behind Her Eyes (its a mini-series and my god! that last twist really blew me away).Maybe my expectations have become unrealistically high for a movie, but I’m still chasing that feeling. I’m desperate for a thriller that actually shocks me again.Please hit me with your absolute best thriller/suspense recommendations to calm my uneasiness 🙏.(posting this in some other subs as well, if you come across this post twice, please ignore)",

Nolan movies (except Tenet, shoutout to that one because it baffled me, although not in the best way), The Lighthouse, Blade Runner, Donnie Darko, Stalker etc.I want movies that are confusing because they're either convoluted and complex (but not in a bad way, of course), vague to the point it's truly hard to make heads or tails of it, or deeply experimental.A few examples of movies and others that actually confused me:Primer, Timecrimes, Predestination (yes, there's a theme here -- although for Predestination, it was more about the specifics of the time travel than how they reached the conclusion).Serial Experiments LainLynch movies (I've only watched Rabbits, BUT I expect the rest to confuse the heck out of me too).I'm open to literally any kind of movie, just tell me that one movie that still keeps you up at night because you couldn't get it even after watching a 2 hour breakdown and analysis of it on youtube.",
