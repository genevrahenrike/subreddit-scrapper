Not too paranormal and unrealistic is more preferable in general.So the formula is: sensitive, brilliant, somewhat successful in his/her endeavours involving applying his/her intelligence and perceptiveness, ideally making the world a better place.I also liked \"Scorpion\" series about a team of gifted people helping FBI, but it's kinda cheesy and pretty narcissistic (the dude behind the protagonist participated in writing process, duh).",

It‚Äôs this animated film by Richard Linklater that follows a guy wandering through a dreamlike world, having deep conversations about life, reality, and consciousness. The animation style is wild-rotoscoped, so it‚Äôs like real people but with this surreal, shifting vibe that makes everything feel like you‚Äôre floating in a dream. It‚Äôs not a movie you watch for a tight plot; it‚Äôs more like diving into a philosophy class mixed with trippy visuals.I was hooked from the first scene, where people just start riffing on existential ideas, like free will or the nature of dreams. It‚Äôs the kind of movie that makes you want to pause and talk about it with friends afterward-I ended up texting my buddy at 2 AM about the meaning of life. If you‚Äôre into films that challenge your brain, likeEternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindorDonnie Darko, this is a must-watch. Just go in with an open mind and maybe a coffee to keep up with the ideas. Anyone else seenWaking Life? What other trippy, thought-provoking movies should I check out next?",

      "content_preview": "Twilight, Moonstruck, Death Becomes Her, Mamma MiaThere is nothing like the first time viewing experience of these movies with a group of friends. There‚Äôs enough in the aesthetics and the female energy to genuinely enjoy yourself but then the plot/writing is so wild that you‚Äôre all collectively losing it every 5 minutes.Aesthetics: Twilight‚Äôs filter and soundtrack, iconic. Death Becomes Her inspired Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs whole style. Moonstruck has Cher, fabulous. Mamma Mia, another iconic soundtrack. Maybe I should center in on Meryl Streep‚Äôs filmography??Female-Centered: Unhinged male movies are a totally different genre that do not contain what I am looking for. The movie needs to take itself seriously to a certain degree, not a slapstick comedy. Not a gore fest. Probably not R rated. Moonstruck and Death Becomes Her are definitely self-aware comedically, but they are also sincere.Unhinged: No spoilers here, but the plots of these movies are simply ridiculous. It‚Äôs impossible to watch with a straight face. You almost can‚Äôt believe that they wrote the words that are being delivered on the screen. Shock value is essential. Being a little embarassed about what you‚Äôre watching is good. But not in a way that is trying too hard, which is where it gets tricky. An example of that would be Anyone But You. That movie wanted to be unhinged but it had no substance. Its source material, The Proposal, is a good contender for this category, though.Please recommend more of these movies. I need more. Thanks!!",

Playing with Fire and the kids movies the Rock has done have been enjoyed.We managed to watch Twisters a few times because of the actor in Maverick but Mission Impossible was a no-go.Mama Mia was too weird, Legally Blond too boring, She loved the new Freakier Friday movie.Any ideas?!
