      "content_preview": "Government vows to end pill testing, despite private funding The Crisafulli government has vowed to shut down a free pill testing service, which had been funded by the previous Labor administration, after it secured private funding to continue its services. The Loop Australia, which offered the drug testing services, announced on Friday it had received philanthropic support to keep the service running until next April. But on Saturday, Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie said the LNP government would do all in its power to shut the service down, despite its cost no longer being a burden to taxpayers. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt support drug testing, either privately or publicly funded,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf people are proceeding with privately funded pill testing, then the government will take whatever action is necessary through regulation or legislation to ensure that there are no privately funded pill-testing centres open in Queensland. ‚ÄúWe do not tolerate it, we will not allow it and we will legislate or regulate against those private providers.‚Äù Almost one in 10 samples tested by the organisation during its year-long operation at the CheQpoint sites at Bowen Hills and Burleigh Heads, contained unexpected or unwanted drugs. The Australian Medical Association previously warned ending the service would lead to higher rates of harm. Opposition frontbencher Charis Mullen said any move to shut the testing down would be a case of government overreach. ‚ÄúWe know that pill testing works and we know that because we have listened to the experts,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat is very clear is that, in fact, there have been more deaths from unintentional overdoses in 2023 than there were car accidents and road accidents, so we‚Äôve got to do something. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got philanthropists wanting to provide this service and to have a government saying that they‚Äôre going to shut it down speaks more to ideology than it does to facts, to science and to listening to the experts here in Queensland.‚Äù Mullen said shutting the program down would put young lives at risk. ‚ÄúI have teenage children. I would hope they would do their very best and never take anything illegal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut what this is, is a safety measure and I would rather have children alive, having had those pills tested, than having this ideological take on it, which puts more lives at risk.‚Äù https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/government-vows-to-end-pill-testing-despite-private-funding-20250830-p5mr3i.html",

However, then-Transport Minister Mark Bailey cut the permitted intersections from 55 to 17 about seven years ago before cancelling the scheme in 2021. ‚ÄúCutting needless delays will help keep Brisbane moving, which is why we back left turn on red,‚Äù Cr Schrinner said. ‚ÄúOur trial showed it‚Äôs both safe and effective, saving drivers time on more than 15 million turns.‚Äù http://archive.today/2025.09.02-054534/https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/brisbane-city/lord-mayor-adrian-schrinners-push-to-bring-back-left-at-red-lights-on-brisbane-roads/news-story/3c58e6f2ebbd7e47df3403fec2f0596f?amp",

The house got put up for sale and sold. However, the new buyers are using the FHO scheme, where they need to move in within 6 months. The buyer went to the agents office, hat in hand asking to start negotiations on a figure to get us out within 6 months. We sent a reply asking for ~17k, with a full detailed cost breakdown. We currently pay $625 for a 2 bed, 2 ‚Äòstudy rooms‚Äô, 1 bath, no car We said we were open for negotiations but the cost breakdown essentially‚Ä¶ There is no guarantee that we will get a rental at the same price so we compared to similar houses on the market and they are between 7-800. Adjusted again against the projected ~12% rental price increase for the Brisbane metro area (we grabbed the lowest %) 3.8k ‚Äì ¬†in projected increase rental payments for 5 months (expected move out date to end of lease) 5.7k ‚Äì My take home pay for needing to take a week off work to move. 1.5k ‚Äì Removalist, rubbish removal, carpet and bond clean. 6.7k ‚Äì 8 weeks rent compensation at the aforementioned projected rent price. We stated multiple times in our email that we are more than happy to negotiate, as the above prices are only estimated costs. The real estate agency came back and said ‚Äòhahahaha, that‚Äôs fucking ridiculous, but I‚Äôll send it to them, don‚Äôt hold your breath‚Äô We did not add into the costs, my housemates wage loss for taking time off work or an inconvenience tax as we only JUST moved out of an absolute shitter, into a space we finally had room to breathe. We used 8 weeks compensation as that was their original offer, just that. 8 x 625 does not cover my unpaid time off. Negotiable on that front, I guess this is partly an inconvenience tax. Any insight from others who have been in similar positions and what you offered? I have spoken to multiple coworkers and have said that this is usually the cost of this type of business. We are not trying to be greedy but I am not losing a dollar to get the roof ripped off my head. Especially when there is no guarantee that there will even be ANY rentals available 6 months.

      "content_preview": "Hi just wondering what the annual curbside collection etiquette is for perusing other people's lawns. I'm assuming people put things out like a week early because they expect others to take things, so is it ok to take items from people's lawns? The main reason I ask is I noticed anything electronic had it's cables cut, and things like lamps were too close to the case to rewire. There was a nice electric piano down the road and looked in good knick. Went to get my husband and when we walked back someone had cut the cables on that too, despite it being intact earlier Are we not supposed to take stuff, or is there a serial cable cutter in the area with a vendetta against curbside collection day?",

We are doing a special introduction-to-D&D session, which can lead into a beginner's campaign, on occasional mornings. Share this with friends who have very little to no experience playing D&D, that you want to hook into this wonderful hobby. Send them to this link: https://www.meetup.com/learn-dungeons-and-dragons/events/310671893/ Everyone gets a FREE 20-sided die and set of character sheets to take home and keep playing with! (I am also teaching anyone how to run D&D games but this particular event is not ideal for that) It is on Thursday morning next week in a sunny park in Spring Hill. This location may be ruined by a stadium soon, so enjoy it and meet like-minded people who want to save it. Click the link for exact location and time. Anyone who has played more than a couple times would find this too basic and slow. The tradeoff is that nobody will feel left behind-- so share this with a friend of any capacity who can benefit from a generous teacher in a gentle environment. This is designed for those over teen-age-- that's an equally great but different vibe. (I supply free material for high schools to run a similar event, so message me if that's your thing) More events, entertainment, and background here: http://linktr.ee/teachdd",

      "content_preview": "Hey all. Looking for some advice regarding a family situation that is currently ongoing. The crux of this issue is my family member (mother) who has problems with mental health and alcoholism. I recently managed to 'escape' the situation after financially supporting them over the course of my 20s and have moved in with my partner of several years. As I was the only person supporting them, the last time I signed the lease I gave them 6 months to sort out an alternate living situation, find a job, quit drinking, etc, because I was moving out. As you may expect, nothing changed and five months later, as she had no-where else to go, she checked herself into rehabilitation. Approximately 8 weeks later, she leaves rehabilitation, saying that it was the worst thing she has ever done, and with the help of my sister, we managed to find her a temporary living situation in a share house. Two weeks later, she went back to drinking, but subsisted paying her share of rent and bills via centrelink payments. Fast forward six months later to today, we have been advised via the person who helped us get her temporary housing, that due to the state of her room/bathroom (smoking indoors, not cleaning, stains in the carpets, etc) she is going to be given notice for 7 days to leave the property. The place myself and my partner moved to has a spare bedroom, however that is obviously not ideal, and there is no other family or friends aside from my sister (who has a family and no room), so we are at a bit of a loss on how to proceed. Does anyone have any advice, have been in a similar situation or know of someone who I may be able to contact with a situation like this? Edit: Thank you all for your advice and support. I have a few calls to make to different support agencies.",

      "content_preview": "It is that time of year again- swooping season! To report a swooping bird call Council on 3403 8888. (BCC specific). It's a 2 minute process where you talk to the real person at council and give the details and (if warranted) they will install swooping bird signs. Another great way to report is a national system via www.magpiealert.com You can report swooping birds and they will add to the national database for the season. In addition, you can create a free account and get alerted whenthere are any reports of swooping in your area. Very helpful. Screenshot below of Brisbane area with 2025 season data showing so far. (It will look about 10 times worse that that in about a month!) https://preview.redd.it/reporting-swooping-birds-psa-v0-l465eb65ofmf1.png",
