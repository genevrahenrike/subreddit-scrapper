However, I would like to have some with common qfn, qfp etc. to save some time. I have been looking for a while, and to my surprise, I can hardly find anything besides the ones chipquick-mouser-digikey sell, that I believe are the same and are way too expensive for me (10-20usd each footprint or a couple of -50usd larger ones with half a dozen footprints). I know that their usage is very limited, but I realize that in most of my projects there is a main IC that I often solder first, so I think I could use these templates. My question is, has anyone been able to find any cheap source for common smd ic footprint stencils? AliExpress is full of bga stencils, and the closest I could find was this one below, but still doesn't have the most common packages.

Im working on a product that uses alligator clips to connect to a piece of wire, but getting the wire to attach to the alligator clip is proving very hard. I got these alligator clips but it takes about ten minutes to get it to stay on the crimp connector with solder, and even then the slightest tap breaks it off. I cant take a file to grind away and expose a good surface on the inside of the connector without meticulously unfolding each one then trying to re-fold and re-crimp. I'm already barely making a profit on this product, and this would bring it below minimum-wage territory for the labor to profit ratio. Does a true \"crimp connector\" with alligator clips exist? I cant find anything that would stand on its own as a connection. How are yall doing this in bulk? I really don't want to spend more than ten seconds per connection.",

      "content_preview": "Haiyo! I've recently been trying to learn how to replace a CPU Socket on a Motherboard. I have no problem with the BGA Machine, but I just couldn't get the hang of how to clean up the pads correctly with the solder having kinda like a ball instead of being flat. Most of the time when I try to clean the pads, it always ends up being quite flat, which makes the socket have empty solder after going through the BGA Machine, and after like roughly 3 to 4 attempts on replacing the socket, the solder pad either starts to tear or just comes right off. Was wondering if someone has any general advice on how to properly clean up the pads and have the solder look more like a ball to ensure proper soldering on the BGA! We do have a lot of boards that are used for practice, so I'm not too worried about breaking boards. (Already broke 6 board this month) Some general info, I'm using Lead Free Solder, Flux, Soldering Iron at 420C(788F) with I believe a C4 Tip. And the socket used already has solder ball pre-applied to it. I see a lot of tutorial seems to just clean off the solder completely with a wick and just apply the new socket directly to it. Would that work better? I am being taught by others to have solder ball on both sides, probably to ensure better contact and more solder between the CPU and the Socket?

      "content_preview": "I'm going to (finally) buy a GeeBoon HC24 solder station with the C470 handle and 2 tips not going to bother with the C470 and C210 handle bundle, as i wouldn't use the 2 tips that come with the C210 handle as part of that 'deal', so it'll be cheaper to buy a C210 handle and the chisel tips i do use later but i am adding a C245 handle to it and a few tips to the order. Are the geeboon C245 cartridges / tips any good? this is for occasional hobby only soldering, and the geeboon store does not have that many tips to choose from, But looking on other stores that sell the C245 tips, they can vary from suspiciously cheap to stupidly expensive, and they are all brand names like 'xyzzyx' and not JBC which cost even more again. .. if i was soldering for money then yes i'd get the JBC ones, but i'm only soldering my own projects occasionally. So i'm sort of looking for middle of the road quality tips, any suggestions of a brand / store to get them from.",

I'm new to this sub but have been interested in soldering for quite a while, mainly because I like tech and think it would be pretty rewarding to fix small stuff like controllers, or similar small gadgets. Also, I'm already 24 and still haven't started to build every man's dream: his own set diverse tools for any situation imaginable, and figured this would be a good start. I'm mainly looking for a soldering iron or station, and after checking several posts here, I decided to get myself a Hakko FX888DX, however (and this might be simply my dumbass not knowing where to search), it seems that this particular soldering station is sold in only a few places in the EU (at a reasonable price, at least). I live in Portugal, just to give a bit of context, and am a bit swamped. So all this text to simply ask: Does anyone have any recommendations on soldering stations that are commonly sold in the EU? My budget is around ,120-150€ but I could stretch it for a really good deal or if I felt it was justified. Sorry for the long read, and thank you! PS: Has anyone ever tried the iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit? Looking to buy at as well and heard good things, but if any of you could give me insight on other options that would be great :)",

      "content_preview": "Hello, I need someone to give me a few tips about microsoldering, I'm almost totally new to it. I recently started buying used consoles and reselling them online, just by fixing some tiny issues or giving them a better look, to earn some money (about 20-30ish euros for every console, living in Italy). I find this little side hustle very interesting and I would like to upgrade a bit my service by fixing some more important issues on consoles, like replacing charging ports that do not work, or something like that. I'd be totally new to the world of microsoldering. I watched a few tutorials on YouTube about changing the charging port on a Nintendo switch and it does actually seem not so difficult. Do you think it's possible for me to start doing this? I am not interested in fixing major problems that I don't now, I just want to do these kind of little things. I have a bit of experience in the world of soldering, on a larger scale (i built a taser by myself just a few months ago using basics large-scale soldering tools, but it actually was kinda easy). What should I buy? (with the lowest budget possibile, but not buying trash) What should I look forward to learn? What are your tips? Thanks to all of you in advance. P.S. I know some basics of electronics but I am definitely not an expert. I do not want to diagnose problems, I just want to fix them.",
