      "content_preview": "Like the title says.  I've got a 6x8 greenhouse that runs E-W and is under shade during spring-fall.  Despite the shade trees (tall oaks), it still got ridiculously hot in there, even with fans, vents and an open door.  The bulk of my plants in there are orchids, and while many of them are heat-tolerant, I would very much like to avoid cooking the whole collection but still keep it bright in there.  My questions: Would a shade cloth be a worthwhile or necessary purchase? What percentage should I get? How big?  Do I just cover the sunniest sides or the whole thing? While I welcome any answers, I would specifically like to hear from those who are growing orchids or other tropicals in their greenhouses.  Granted, come November, I'll be bringing the group inside, but part of me still wants to go for year-round. I'm in zone 8a in NC.  Thanks!!!",

      "content_preview": "I have a relatively small 7x8ft greenhouse. It already has three openings, a roof vent, a floor level vent, and the door which is always wide open. I want to install a fan opposite the door. Generally I know exhaust is better, but does it matter as much with the door opening? The reason I'm waffling is that having the fan be an inlet would feel a lot nicer for me since it would blow across my face whenever I'm in there. From what I've read exhaust is better because inlet just pushes the air around the space and not out, but wouldn't this be negated by the door opening being directly opposite the fan? Or am I going about this all wrong?",

      "content_preview": "Hey all, I hope I'm not breaking any rules. My father is really into plants. But here in Canada land, the winters are harsh on the desert plants he likes to grow. He's currently growing stuff in the basement but it's not working too well, since the plants need some humidity and we've got a dehumidifier to avoid mold. He's currently using these to store the plants: https://www.costco.ca/seville-classics-6-tier-nsf-steel-wire-shelving-rack.product.100266862.html And a rectangular version of these to provide light: https://marshydroled.ca/products/mars-hydro-ts-600?variant=44697889767622 He's got a nice setup of these lights attached on the underside of each rack and stuff. But he now wants me to take it a step further for him. He wants to build a \"greenhouse\" around each unit of racks. Here's a very rough idea of what I mean: https://preview.redd.it/building-a-simple-home-greenhouse-out-of-steel-racks-v0-ohclm2lyzlkf1.png The enclosure would be slightly bigger than shown in the image (i.e. provides a bit more room). The bottom panel would have 4 holes so that the rods fit through them. The bottom panel itself would rest on top of the wheels, perhaps with rubber grommets attached to the panel in an attempt to seal the humidity inside. The entire thing would be similar to a wardrobe made of polycarbonate sheets. The front would be a \"door\" of some sort, also designed with edges that seal humidity. Keep in mind I know nothing about greenhouses. Neither have I built much stuff myself. That's why I'm here. Any glaring issues or advice? I wonder if I need something to manage the humidity inside, a sloped top to avoid water dripping back on the plants, issues related to mold, or something else.",

      "content_preview": "I want to build a ~1000 sq ft greenhouse in 9a Texas for a large cactus/dragon fruit collection that I have. I’ve been researching passive solar and would like to incorporate the “lean to” design and an elevated pond to help moderate temps. Also looking at installing diy GAHT with black tubing, fans, etc. My first hurdle is, even making it 20’ deep x 50’ wide, the roof slope to keep the height of the rear wall only 4 ft taller than the front requires 2/12 pitch. I’m concerned this will not get enough southern sunlight in the winter and too much in summer (though in Texas, so maybe less of an issue at 30 degrees latitude?). Shade cloth planned with large ventilation capacity. Is the lean-to concept just bad for this scenario, and should I just do a gabled roof? If I did poly panels on the S/SE-facing side of the roof, would this be adequate sunlight for the whole greenhouse?  I plan to build with wood framing on concrete footers; 6mm poly double wall panels; in ground insulation and GAHT; heavily insulated N/NW wall. Snow has been very rare excluding 2021 and snowmageddon; winds are generally sub-50mph at peak but there is a 25ft tall barn North of the greenhouse that will block a good bit of the wind. A high tunnel would certainly be less expensive but I’m concerned about heat loss in winter. Am I off-base in not utilizing this structure instead? Would appreciate any and all suggestions/insights. Thanks",
