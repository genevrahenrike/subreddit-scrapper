      "content_preview": "2044: Shards of Harmony is a unique NFT trading game that I'm currently developing for Harmony. Its set in the tunnels under a world destroyed by WW3. Players build up a collection of 'relics' - NFTs, scavenged from the surface by repurposed battle bots, and trade for the in-game currency GRIT. It's played as a card game, your goal is to increase the value of your assets, both your NFTs and GRIT, by using game theory to make optimal bids on opponents cards. The final goal is to trade your way to a House in the sanctuary on the surface. You can read the Lore, the first version of the rules, and the tokenomics on the website . I'm developing a test web2 version of the game now, which is almost ready to play, so that we can play, test and iterate to get the gameplay right before developing the full web3 version. It'd be cool if you could check it out, you can join the discord , follow the Twitter , help it grow. I'm also giving GRIT for feedback, suggestions, or other help. I want to get the community involved and make this a really awesome game. For those of you who don't know me, I also developed Good Times Coin, my first hobby project, and run High Stakes , so I've been around. Shards of Harmony is a step up again and I hope it can become a main feature of the Harmony ecosystem.",

I’ve rebuilt my position over the past couple years buying at the lowest lows so am doing well, but understand people who are seething still. I took a different kind of L back before the OG bull run by selling millions of $one to go chase other gains that seemed more immediate at the time. Was young and got caught up with leveraging and Binance not being available in US for minute. So my regret is  different in a way.. I feel like things could really improve, but like I’ve said in the past- public relations and community management MUST be part of what’s invested in by the Harmony team. And not just a few slightly drastic shillers + some tech updates on Twitter. Needs to feel like there are some real, personable humans involved. Otherwise it seems like the only real people are the ones who are pissed off.. that’s an impossible uphill battle if something doesn’t eventually give. Just my two cents though.",

It appears that the harmony extension is no longer supported. When I try to download it again in chrome, I get---Item not available. I have harmony tokens on the mainnet, https://stak ing.harmony.one/validators/mainnet, not staked, but I can't sign in because it wants a wallet address, but I don't have a wallet attached.  the tokens are in my portfolio but I have no way to move them because I can't sign in. I used to be able to sign into the mainet with my PW. Now it wants a wallet address. I've had these tokens for several years. I'd appreciate a solution, thank you. I hope this made sense.",

      "content_preview": "We're rolling out a BTC/USDC vault on Harmony, built to help users earn yield while holding BTC exposure. But how does it really work? And how do we manage risk? Inspired by great explainers from partners like Hummingbot, here’s a breakdown of how these strategies function behind the scenes: 🧠 How the Vault Generates Returns Funding Rate Arbitrage: When funding rates are high on perp exchanges, LPs earn by passively taking the opposite side. Range-Bound Liquidity Provision: We concentrate liquidity in high-volume price ranges to capture trading fees efficiently. Hedged Positions: The vault uses hedging to stay close to delta-neutral. This helps reduce risk while compounding fees. ⚠️ What Risks We Monitor Volatility Shocks: Sharp BTC moves can push positions out of range. We track volatility metrics and adjust ranges as needed. Funding Flip Risk: If funding turns negative, the vault shifts to avoid staying in unprofitable positions. Liquidity Concentration: We monitor slippage and on-chain volume to avoid trapping LPs in illiquid price zones. 🔍 Why This Matters Traditional funds already use strategies like this. Our goal is to bring them to DeFi in a way that’s simple, accessible, and transparent. We're here to answer questions and would love your feedback. What would you like to see next... risk dashboards, yield calculators, or LP tutorials? Let’s build DeFi that works. 💙 Harmony Team",

I have tried to do all sorts of manipulations such as log in through the Trust wallet either on the mobile app dApp browser or the Chrome extension but whenever I login to staking.harmony.one , the wallet address is not the same as my Trust Wallet app \"Receive\" address and shows zero balance on the Staking website. However, on my Trust Wallet it does shows a few coins remaining while the rest is staked correctfully. I also tried transfering my wallet with the mnemonic wordings from Trust to MetaMask or Math Wallet but same as the Staking website, the wrong wallet imported gets imported and shows 0 balance while it should have my ONE in it. Has anybody successfully managed to retrieve their staked ONE after being in a similar situation? I have tried everything and just cannot seem to find a solution to my issue and would really appreciate some help. Thank you!",
