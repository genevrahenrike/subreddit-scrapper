I heard the commotion from my apartment nearby and saw everything that happened right after the stabbing. A houseless man was stabbed on NW Irving this morning and you were among the first to respond. I saw you jump into action, stay calm, apply way more than your standard first aid/fashion a tourniquet, worked with the nearby people to communicate and control the scene until police and EMS got there. I heard you say that you saw the whole thing, and your statement to police will hopefully help catch the person that did this. Thank you. That must have been incredibly stressful and terrifying. The victim remained conscious and lucid as he was being loaded up into the ambulance so i‚Äôm hopeful he survives. I really hope you get to take the rest of the day off today ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Just ‚Äúmarket rates.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ the market rate for what? My bathroom fan still sounds like it‚Äôs coughing its last breath and the hallway light hasn‚Äôt worked in months. Sometimes I swear Portland landlords just pull numbers out of a hat. I was honestly ready to sign because I didn‚Äôt think I had a choice, but my best friend saved me. She‚Äôd read some blog about rent negotiations and gave me a crash course. The two things she drilled into me were: 1) point out that I‚Äôve always paid on time, and 2) let them think I was ready to walk and looking at other units nearby. So I sent back this super casual reply, flexed my autopay streak, and hinted I wasn‚Äôt locked in. Couple days later, they came back with +$70/month instead. Still sucks, but saving $180/month is a huge difference for me. That‚Äôs groceries, that‚Äôs gas, that‚Äôs not living paycheck to paycheck quite as hard. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a big win, but in this city, even clawing back a little feels like victory.",

I didn‚Äôt claim ownership of this thread but I was there and I appreciate you. Without swift and efficient community organizing, our city will be infested with this tree within 5-10 years. IMO, we must pursue the following steps with urgency, in order of priority: ‚Äî-> POLITICAL ACTION Demand Portland City Council to allow / incentivize the immediate removal of mature female trees from private properties (what could this actually look like?) pursue support from state and federal legislators ‚Äî-> MAPPING HOTSPOTS (arc-gis? Google maps? Does this already exist? OSU?) To be labeled: mature seeding females male clone stands access notes ‚Äî-> PDX TREE OF HEAVEN INFO DOC, streamlined to include: Link to map Best removal practices- links to videos and resources Tools PPE Recommended Herbicides & local retail sources Community ally contact info (by neighborhood- on map?) Links to educational flyers/pamphlets WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK?",

Then we went in 2024 and it was a ghost town.  Went there again this weekend and saw signs of growth with actually interesting shops.  Big kudos to Stoopid burger, jumbos pickleball, and the second hand pet store.  It‚Äôs also still one of the only places with a public ice rink in Portland. Do y‚Äôall think Lloyd Center can continue this, or is it doomed like all malls?  Secondly, when I read about the James beard food hall struggling to open downtown, I‚Äôm kind of thinking they should try Lloyd center first to prove concept. Interested what this sub thinks about Lloyd center recently?",
