I have never lived in Florida before. This is my first job post grad. I hear Naples is super nice and while thats where my company will be, of the apartments I've looked at, everything seems so expensive. Would it be better to live a little outside of Naples for rent that is possibly cheaper? If so, where?  Or should I splurge a bit on my rent to stay more local?",

Is this the case in Naples? It’s clear a lot of units are vacant right now due to the off season, but what is happening in terms of the coming season and even just rentals for services/support workers? I’ve heard anecdotally that never-rented-before people are considering renting out for short term visitors or <6 months, but don’t see it being worth the hassle due to less interest. Any insight is appreciated, I get this is a contentious subject at times so not looking for snark (but this is Reddit).",

If you or anyone you know of are looking for an annual tenant or could refer me the right direction I would be forever grateful.  Property management companies and realtors that I have reached out to have not been very helpful and I’m coming down to the wire as I need my lease to start September 15th Under $5,000/mo North Naples area preferred 3+ bedrooms Updated fixtures/would love an open floor plan Unfurnished 2+ car garage Prefer a private pool Prefer a fenced yard I am leasing out my own home in the Midwest so I promise I am a careful, well qualified tenant and will treat your home like it’s my own!

Do you have any new and exciting clubs? Like flower arranging, cooking, or maybe a car club? Bars and the like are completely out of my league. Recommendations would be great. I'd appreciate your suggestions. Just a friendly inquiry, hoping to find some new directions. Don't delete, thanks!",
