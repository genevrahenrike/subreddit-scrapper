What keeps me puzzled is that more than one of those guides suggest to tame pterodactyl early, craft saddle and explore from the air, while the players are still in cloth amor or naked, and often don't have a permanent base {one is level 25). The saddle in question unlocks at level 38 according to my game. Do they use console commands, mods or just grind to 38 to get the saddle asap? Thanks in advance and happy hunting",

After updating my private server to 76.1 on a Windows 10 machine dedicated to server hosting for Ark I get a crash after the server posts \"Server has successfully started\". The command shell closes itself though it does copy a crash report to my clipboard. This crash happens to ANY server I start up after this update. I spun up a new server instance on my cluster with no mods in the load list and on TheIsland_WP as a test case to try and fix this. But no luck as it crashes in the same place. I even spun up an entirely fresh server from a fresh SteamCMD install in a separate folder and it too will crash in the same manner. This is the crash log from the fresh, text server instance: Fatal error!

I have everything transferred and running smooth (World State, Bases, Dinos). My only (and very big) hiccup, is that whenever anyone joins they're prompted to create a new character, even though they have one already on that world. Even after you create a character that's back to level 1 you can still see your old body on the ground like it's a different player. I've tried doing the admin work arounds of giving all the structures and dinos to myself, but since my buddies play with me and want their shit to be theirs, I'd have to unclaim every structure and dino so they could claim. Which I DO NOT want to do. The way I got my character from Nitrado over to private was to join the Nitrado server, upload survivor, then download onto the private server. I was hopeful that it was gonna be that easy, but it's not. Even if I use the EXACT same character from the same world, just hosted on a different machine, I'm still not in the Tribe and owner of anything. But it did however despawn the doppelganger along with everything on it. So it knew that it was that character on the server but still didn't allow me to do anything with admin commands. All I'm wanting is to just tell me buds, \"hey, new IP address is this, just join and it'll be the exact same\". But everything is pointing to me going to have to walk all them through dumb work arounds with basically a multiverse, and HOURS of unclaiming/reclaiming. Which is just not fun, and afraid they'll just put the game down after that point. The files I was unable to copy, and probably would fix this whole mess. Is the profile/character files inside the saved folder of the world. For whatever reason Nitrado gives every single file you need to save and copy your world, except the most important one. I'm just seeing if someone has had something similar and can tell me what their solution was? Or someone who knows where the hell mine and my buddies character saves are stored on Nitrado.",

They are useless when they are not together, I cannot even fight anything with purely Monga, when with Mongo I could OBLITERATE origins, even though i needed to lay on the ground once or twice to press shift+C, which destroyed 60 million of hp after only 15 seconds of wait So basically, Monga is good only with Mongo and Mongo is good even without Monga (minus the fact that the super good attack cannot be used) All of this is compared to a buffoon liopleurodon that I've been using to destroy bosses for a while now",
