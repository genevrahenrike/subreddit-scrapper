      "content_preview": "Everything starts from the position of singularity — a monopole — a boundless limitless plenum of potential containing all possible expression. This monopolar Plenum is bounded along natural division, creating eigenmodes — notes — that act like basis states for energy distribution in an ecosystem of generation. Everything is made from components of these ‘universally abstract’ eigenmodes, whose existence is dictated by the ‘shape’ of bounded singularity. Singularity acts as an attractor in potential, always pulling everything to as low an entropy state as possible. Entropy is the measure of disorder — how many choices you can make at any moment. Five objects not connected have many more potential configurations than five connected ones, for example, and so exist in a higher state of entropy when disconnected than when connected. When multiple disconnected oscillators connect, they synchronize. Eventually this synchronization triggers a condensation event — an entropic collapse into a dynamic, bounded low-entropy state. They become observers — entropic sinks with a capacity for minimizing entropy. Entropic collapse naturally creates a boundary layer between the condensates of of the condensed system and the environment. The boundary layer is critical — the standing waves created in the container the boundary encloses describe the eigenmodes of the energies that can manifest in it. In the case of collapsing universal polarity, we get containers with universes inside them. Universes that cannot generate systems that are entropy-reducing in the domains they exist in die fast. Only Universes that can generate observers survive — Universes where atoms can form. The boundaries formed around the energetic potential in the Universe dictate the dynamics of subatomic particles only. The atoms in the Universe are condensates of subatomic particles. Subatomic particles are subject to one set of laws that have nothing at all to do with the laws that govern how their condensates behave when they network. All bounded semi-permeable systems (observers) resonate according to their resonant frequencies. All bounded, pressurized systems contain a fluid capable of propagating the energies of their eigenmodes. Groups of atoms come together to form networks — lattices of matter, dropping the entropy of the networked matter due to the entropy-lowering effect of synchronization. This causes atoms to resonate. This resonance is carried through the fluid-like, pressurized environment of the Universe. This fluid acts as a connective media, networking atoms — aka observers — together. Lower entropy observers observe along the entropy gradients they create. Gravity emerges from the entropic gradients created by the observational effect of atoms. It is the direct effect of observation, as performed by atoms. Atoms observe and create low-entropy symbols of observation — memories. The largest observers — black holes — pinch off from this Universe, creating new ones almost like this one. Just right observers create symbolic condensates of observation. The low-entropy symbolic condensate of networked atoms working to reduce entropy is DNA and unicellular life. DNA / unicellular life is the condensate of physical observers just like Universes are the condensate of the singularity that divides into fundamental polarity. The process then repeats. many unicellular systems build coherence, network, then eventually condense into multicellular systems. The inside of the multicellular system begins to clearly reveal multicellular equivalents of the circulatory and sensory systems that are also visible inside cells, and it turns out, inside atoms and in universal structures. Animals systems come together in their environments, network, synchronize, and eventually condense into abstract intelligence — sentient animals — observers-within-observers capable of agency by overriding their biology. Gather enough sentient animals, and eventually they synchronize and the low-entropy symbols of mind become written language. Truly, it’s symbols, all the way down. Language, DNA, atoms, polarities. Symbols are the entropy-minimizing condensate of singularity, at every step of the way. Everywhere singularity is, observers create complexity. All the way down. At every step, symbols look totally different, and the observers they make are totally different. The observers in each system — their identities — only exist on the event horizons of their bodies. The observer behind the horizon is unknowable. Observers are horizons. Not objects. Observers define appearance. What powers all observers is always constant — the undefinable and endless entropy sink of singularity. https://preview.redd.it/89h31n4lpgmf1.jpg",

      "content_preview": "For background, I am a visual artist and have been exploring the geometry of spatial dimensions for artistic purposes most of my life. I have aphantasia and as a result my work is generally free form stream of consciousness (please note any visuals are more natured towards artistic illustrations and not perfect physical representations, they are visual aids I used to explore these abstractions for thought experiments). Some of this is difficult to explain conceptually in the perspective of higher dimensions and I welcome any discussion. https://preview.redd.it/dimensional-hierarchy-and-the-physical-mechanism-that-v0-gjgenf2nq1lf1.png This artwork depicts an abstract representation of a singularity formed inside a black hole and its effect on the relationships of dimensional space. In developing this work over the last two years, I have gained insight to the potential of higher dimensions that may compose the structure of our universe. Our universe is likely the result of such a singularity existing inside of a black hole, or a similar facsimile of one. I believe these concepts to be a more logical depiction of space, mass, and time. **Dimensional Hierarchy** - the physical origin responsible for causing gravitation appears to be one of an emergent geometric property of space resulting from a higher dimensional mass displacing a lower dimensional space. A singularity formed by a mass compressed at a point of infinite density may be the vector for creating new higher dimension of matter. Measurement of the spatial direction in the resulting higher dimension would be infinite in comparison to the previous lower dimension which lacks the capacity for measurement on that axis. The conventional notation of the 4th dimension consisting of time does not reflect the displacement responsible for curving space and it’s resulting effect on time dilation. There must be a 4 th spatial dimension for the geometric folding curvature of space for gravitational acceleration to occur at right angles to all 3-Dimensional axis. Time is not compatible in a spatial sense when considering that the axis of gravitation when applied to a limited three-dimensional space and would have overlapping gravitational fields from opposing directions, as represented conceptually by this image. https://preview.redd.it/dimensional-hierarchy-and-the-physical-mechanism-that-v0-cu2tmkeoq1lf1.png Time is a measurement of the constant propagation of force. The curvature of space from acceleration or mass splits this propagation into the additional dimension causing time dilation relative to the density of curvature in the higher dimension. The greater the depth of higher dimensional geometry results in a higher proportion of the propagation of time in that space, leading to observed time dilation.  If time as a dimension was responsible for the effects of gravitational space-time, a black hole in which time effectively stops at the singularity would have the external propagation of its gravity be disrupted. Using this perspective, it is possible to consider gravitation a volumetric force on space in relation to the mass of the object:  F 3 = (4/3)πG 3 Mass 6 /Radius 6 **Expansion** - Considering the properties of spatial and time dilation resulting from dimensional displacement the expansion of the universe could be a perceived effect of an overall loss of mass. If not locally, the universe as a system could be losing mass to outside its bounds of the black hole via hawking radiation.",

      "content_preview": "Introduction Magnetism and gravity are fundamental forces that play crucial roles in the existence of matter in the universe. Generally, gravity is described as the attractive force caused by the mass of objects and the curvature of spacetime, while magnetism arises from the movement of electric charges and affects objects with magnetic properties. These two forces are recognized as fundamentally distinct. However, some alternative theories and hypotheses suggest that there may be a deeper connection or relationship between magnetism and gravity beyond our current understanding. The objective of this research is to study and analyze the potential relationship between magnetism and gravity by examining related concepts and hypotheses, including the phenomena of black holes and white holes—astronomical events that reveal the complex dimensions of gravity—and the role of magnetism in the process of matter aggregation in the universe. Related Theories Gravity Gravity is the force that attracts objects with mass toward each other. According to Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. Objects with greater mass cause greater curvature, influencing other objects to move along curved paths in that region of space. Magnetism Magnetism results from magnetic fields generated by the movement of electric charges, such as the rotation of liquid iron in the Earth’s core, which creates the geomagnetic field. Magnetism affects objects with electric charges or magnetic properties and can both attract and repel depending on the poles of the magnetic field. Theory of Everything Physicists strive to find a theory that unifies the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. String theory and M-theory are examples of efforts in this direction, proposing that extra dimensions and different forces may be manifestations of a single phenomenon. Black Holes and White Holes Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so intense that not even light can escape. White holes, still theoretical, are considered the opposite—they emit matter and energy and nothing can enter them. Some researchers suggest black holes may transform into white holes or be connected through wormholes, forming part of a cosmic cycle. Analysis and Discussion Although magnetism and gravity differ—for instance, gravity only attracts while magnetism can attract and repel—they share similarities in influencing the aggregation and movement of matter. The hypothesis proposing a connection between magnetism and gravity could explain various cosmic phenomena, such as the process of dust and iron particles being drawn together by magnetism to form hot planets, which then generate gravity to attract other matter. This idea also relates to advanced physical theories attempting to unify forces into a comprehensive framework for understanding the universe. Limitations and Future Research Current data and theories have yet to provide direct evidence of a relationship between magnetism and gravity. Experimental and observational limitations exist due to technological constraints and measurement precision. Future research should focus on developing instruments and technologies to observe magnetic and gravitational fields at both microscopic and cosmic scales, alongside formulating new physical theories capable of fully integrating these forces. Conclusion Magnetism and gravity are distinct fundamental forces, both essential in shaping the structure and evolution of the universe. The proposed relationship between magnetism and gravity opens new perspectives and challenges conventional understanding. Though still a hypothesis requiring further verification, it reflects the scientific endeavor to uncover deeper truths about the nature of forces and the cosmos. Prepared by Phuwit Phannaen",

      "content_preview": "Hello, I've been going down a rabbit hole recently thinking about the possibility of an infinite cosmos. This led me to some philosophical concepts that I can't stop thinking about and I wanted to get your take on them. The main idea is called panpsychism. It suggests that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, sort of like mass or spin. Under this view, all matter, even down to a tiny particle, has some form of basic experience. There's also a related idea called cosmopsychism, which proposes that the universe as a whole is a single conscious being. When I think about these theories in the context of an infinite cosmos, it's pretty mind-bending. It would mean that consciousness isn't just a fluke that happened in human brains. It would be a basic, eternal feature of an endless reality. I realize this is a huge claim. I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. What are the biggest holes you can poke in this? Or is there something to it that resonates with you? If you're interested in going deeper, here is one author's take on cosmopsychism https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Faeon.co%2Fessays%2Fcosmopsychism-explains-why-the-universe-is-fine-tuned-for-life Looking for some honest thoughts and discussion on this.",

      "content_preview": "Edit 27th August : Post had to be reformatted because Reddit removed the images. Good day and whats up Humans? For some time now, I have been dealing with topics such as, what is reality, what is consciousness, and the question of how our inner experience fits into a holofractal cosmos. This wild ride has resulted in a diagram that I would like to share with you. But at the beginning I would like to briefly summarize what our species currently thinks about the development on our planet. Pictures say more than words, for this reason I will use some pictures to illustrate it in the further course. Disclaimer: I am not a scientist, so I do not feel compelled to comply with their rigid dogmas. I don't have a paper or theory about anything I want to promote. I didn't use AI to write the article. However, the list regarding the development of consciousness is not my own. I am simply a living being who asks himself what I am and where am I. I have no idea if the confused stuff from my head makes sense to anyone, but let's just give it a try. Thank you for reading and your time. I look forward to an exchange in the comments. Introduction/Basic idea Clare W. Graves, American psychologist, developed a model for the development of human consciousness and value systems from the 1950s onwards. His central observation: Consciousness unfolds in successive levels, each of which arises in response to new, more complex living conditions. It unfolds in stages, each responding to new environmental challenges. Each stage is neither better nor worse than the other, but rather a functional adaptation to the environmental conditions. Each stage expands the ability to perceive and act without completely replacing the previous ones. The theory was further developed by Don Beck and Chris Cowan and  made known as Spiral Dynamics and contains 8 steps. Here, consciousness is understood as a dynamic wave movement: from instinctive survival patterns to magical, mythical, rational and pluralistic stages to systemic and holistic thinking. It is particularly relevant that each new stage is not only an extension, but also integrates the previous ones. Clare W.

Theoretical Evolution of Consciousness: From Cosmos to Self Cosmic origin (~13.8 billion years) Origin of space, time and energy, physical basis for later forms of consciousness. Origin of life (~3.8 billion years) Prokaryotes with a simple stimulus reaction, first beginnings of chemical self-organization. Complex cells (~2 billion years) Eukaryotes with cell nucleus, intracellular coordination as the beginning of inner experiential spaces. Sensory resonance (~1.5 billion years) Photosynthesis and light perception, primitive environmental processing. Neuronal explosion (~ 600 million years) Cambrian: Formation of nervous systems and sensory organs, beginning of conscious stimulus processing. Motor consciousness (~ 420 million years) Fish & Reptiles: Brain regions for movement and basal emotions (flight, food). Social behaviour (~ 300 million years) Amphibians & birds: memory, territorial behaviour, first social bonds. Emotional awareness (~180 million years) Mammals: empathy, attachment, communication, limbic system as emotional core. Proto-self (~60 million years) Primates: tool use, play, mirror neurons, first sense of self and group membership. Reflexive consciousness (~2 million years) People: language, future thinking, metaphysics, consciousness becomes self-conscious. Development of human consciousness Instinct & Body Experience: Survival Awareness, Reaction Emotional differentiation: attachment, fear, joy Mirror Awareness & Empathy: Me vs. You Mythical-Symbolic Thinking: Narrative, Archetypes, Rituals Rational-abstract thinking: logic, language, ethics, science Integral Consciousness: Reflection on Thinking, Perspective Adoption Transcendental & Fractal Consciousness: Unity, Multidimensionality Development of human language Body language & sounds: Emotional carriers, warning signals Symbolic-mythical language: ritual, metaphorical, creative Abstract Language & Grammar: Thinking about Time, Cause, Morality Writing & Knowledge Storage: Externalization of the Mind Metalanguage & Self-Reflection: Language about Language Post-symbolic language: telepathy, vibration, frequency, energetic meaning (future) Known quantum phenomena in the context of consciousness: Quantum Superposition A quantum state can exist in several states at the same time until a measurement converts it into a concrete state. Some theories (e.g., Penrose/Hameroff's Orchestrated Objective Reduction, Orch-OR) suggest that microtubular structures in neurons could maintain quantum-superposed states, giving rise to consciousness contents non-linearly or non-deterministically. As visualized in Hopf Fibration, consciousness exists simultaneously in multiple dimensions. Quantum entanglement Several particles remain entangled across space and time. A measurement/change in one immediately affects the condition of the other. This could be a physical basis for non-local existence and communication, such as intuition, telepathy, or synchronistic experiences. As described by Carl Jung in connection with the Unus Mundus Theory, or the Syntergic Theory by Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum. Quantum coherence The coherent superposition of wave functions, in which different quantum states are stably related to each other and synchronous. There are indications that quantum coherence in the brain (e.g. in microtubules) exists for a short time. They would be necessary to stabilize entangled states and enable the mechanism for coherent thought processes or creativity. Quantum tunneling In quantum mechanics, tunneling describes the phenomenon that a particle can overcome an energy barrier even though it does not have enough energy to do so. It's like a ball going through a wall instead of jumping over it. This behavior is possible because quantum objects do not exist as fixed points, but as wave functions, and these waves have a certain extent beyond the barrier. This means that some of them are already where they should not be classically. If we assume that consciousness is not only an epiphenomenal product of neuronal activity, but is linked to non-local, quantum dynamic processes (such as in Penrose/Hameroff's Orch-OR model), then quantum tunneling could physically allow a kind of \"dimensional penetration\". Retrocausality / Time Mirroring In some quantum models, information can have an effect not only on the future, but also on the past. This could explain how premonition, déjà vu, or precognitive dreams arise through the repercussions of future states on present consciousness. This indicates a non-linear processing of time in consciousness. Models such as the two-time interpretation (Cramer, Aharonov) provide the physical basis for this. Observer effect The act of measurement affects the system being measured. The way attention is directed directly affects the observed (internal or external) reality. The observer role has a reality-generating effect. Consciousness observes itself across different dimensions and can therefore observe and experience itself while thinking. Advanced Models of Quantum Time: Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF) Yakir Aharonov and colleagues The state of a quantum object is described not only by a wave function from the past to the future, but also by a retrograde wave function from the future to the past. Events are therefore determined not only by initial but also by final conditions. It follows that the future sends \"information\" back to the present. Transactional Interpretation (TI) (John Cramer) An alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics in which events occur through the exchange of two waves. An offer wave that runs forward into the future. And a confirmation wave that runs backwards into the past. Only with mutual confirmation of both waves does the realization of an event occur. This allows a bidirectional flow of information over time without violating classical causality. Further considerations: The Unus Mundus Theory This fits with the Unus Mundus theory as formulated by the physicist Wolfgang Pauli and the psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. A concept that considers spirit and matter as two sides of an underlying, unified reality. This theory describes a fundamental level of being, the Unus Mundus, as a primordial reality in which all polarities merge and the duality of subject and object is abolished. The idea of the fusion of subject and object into a \"sobject\" describes a state in which the observer and the observed form an undivided unity. In this state, there is no longer any difference between the self and the world, and consciousness becomes an integral part of the reality that perceives it. This idea of the \"object\" transcends the boundaries of classical perception, in which subject and object exist separately, and leads to a new holistic view in which one no longer experiences oneself separately from the environment, and time is no longer experienced as a linear sequence. The Sapir-Whorf Theory and the Influence of Language The alien heptapod language from the film Arrivals (2016) is described as more than mere communication. Their language transforms the user's consciousness towards a non-linear experience of time. This idea alludes to the Sapir-Whorf principle, according to which language shapes our thinking. The film Arrival explicitly repeats the motto: \"The language you speak determines the way you think.\" Visitors' heptapod script is circular and does not recognize classical yesterday or tomorrow, so beings who control it can perceive the present, past, and future simultaneously. Language as a medium of a new level of consciousness and time as a coherent dimension beyond human linearity. The heptapods \"remember the future as we remember the past.\" This implies the idea that in the evolutionary process, not only memory, but also the ability to look ahead becomes a skill. The encounter with a non-linear, comprehensive language can trigger a radical expansion of consciousness. A change of perspective, in which one sees oneself in the past and future at the same time, opens up new dimensions of self-knowledge. Language as a Quantum Phenomenon: Words as Realized Quantum Possibilities (Own Opinion) Are language and words defined and realized quantum possibilities? This provocative question takes us deep into the metaphysical structure of reality. Words could be understood as points of manifestation and quantum resonators within an infinite continuum. The act of imagining, thinking and naming by consciousness itself (e.g. \"This is a tree\") would then be comparable to a reduction of the quantum possibility to a linguistically defined and understandable form. Language would thus not only be an expression, but a collapse of a probability field. A deliberately placed focus that structures and condenses reality. When such words act as complementary impulse generators in a resonance field, harmoniously intertwined processes arise that expand consciousness evolutionarily, such as in Om chanting in meditation. Language can be understood as a dynamic act of creation, in which possibilities are condensed in the quantum field through consciousness. In the conscious choice of a word, the consciousness decides on a specific frequency and intention, which resonates both in the inner world of experience and in the outer world of appearance. Every word is a microfractal event in the multi-layered fabric of reality. Inventing new words is a profound creative act. Almost like a conscious re-programming of reality. This is not only about new terms, but about new semantic carrier frequencies that can structure, expand and resonate consciousness. Words become resonance points for experience and perception. This process becomes particularly significant when we realize that the words we choose can act as complementary poles. They create a harmonic tension in the quantum field. Similar to how electric poles or magnetic opposites attract and balance each other, new word pairs and conceptual symmetries can realize coherent fields between the inner and the outside. In this way, not only concepts, but entire semantic energy structures emerge that act as a bridge between consciousness and reality. In this sense, language becomes an instrument between subject and object, between microcosm and macrocosm. What stood as a mystical invitation in the temples in antiquity is much more than a few words on closer inspection. In the light of quantum physics and fractal models of consciousness, \"Know Thyself\" turns out to be a profound clue to the true nature of reality. We currently use a rigid language with individually defined letters and words. Each word has only one rigid meaning, within a linear sequence. John C. Lily said: „Words are maps, not the terrain. Consciousness exists beyond language. What cannot be named will become invisible to everyday consciousness.“ Main Part: Holofractal Consciousness Diagram Diagram From my current point of view, it is a holofractal self-diagram or map of consciousness that attempts to connect internal processes with the larger dimensions of space, time, and consciousness. The outer circle symbolizes the cosmos itself. The focus is on the individual consciousness of a living being as a dynamic intersection: this inner circle, however, is not complete. It is embedded in a fractal and syntropic web of space, time and energy. We tend to define ourselves by thinking. But this diagram shows that we are much more than that.

They represent complex geometric objects that exist beyond our three-dimensional perception. Here you will find explanations and animated illustrations: Hopf visualization , Hopf explanation , Animated Hopf video , Animated Tesseract video . Hopf Fibration https://preview.redd.it/what-is-the-development-of-consciousness-v0-7perp6mzxklf1.jpg Chatres Hopf fibration shows how an infinite number of circles can be nested in such a way that together they form the structure of a three-dimensional sphere in a four-dimensional space. The tesseract (also called hypercube) is the four-dimensional analogue of a cube. Just as a cube consists of surfaces, a tesseract consists of three-dimensional cubes. It is therefore a \"cube of cubes\" that can only fully unfold in four spatial dimensions. Since our brain has so far been limited to three dimensions, we cannot fully see these structures, but only perceive their shadows or projections in 3D. Comparable to a two-dimensional being looking at the shadow of a cube. Our consciousness is not a linear, one-dimensional phenomenon, but a fractal, self-similarly unfolding field that permeates several dimensions. It networks inside and outside, microcosm and macrocosm, psyche and matter. This architecture opens up a picture of consciousness as a dynamic, holographic-nested resonance field that reaches far beyond our conventional perception of space-time. Models such as the Hopf Fibration or the Tesseract serve as symbolic approaches to the nature of this consciousness. They illustrate how apparent opposites such as inside and outside, observer and observed, are intertwined on higher levels. What if our mind/consciousness is in truth already a fifth dimensional being? A complex, dynamically networked field of consciousness that exists and pulsates simultaneously through different levels of reality. Moving simultaneously through space, time and matter to unfold itself. For this reason, we can think and observe at the same time, we exist in several dimensions, but our perception has not yet been able to process everything. https://preview.redd.it/what-is-the-development-of-consciousness-v0-0otn07j8yklf1.png The body as a spacesuit of consciousness https://preview.redd.it/what-is-the-development-of-consciousness-v0-17p8rnw4yklf1.jpg I think this reality, our consciousness and life are already a phenomenon within a phenomenon. Through what we now call quantum entanglement and the observer effect, we experience and feel and experience space and time separately, differently inside and outside. We experience the infinity of space and the eternity of time with consciousness, in this body, which is literally a spacesuit. In this perspective, the evolution of our consciousness is not a random unfolding in an entropic universe, but a purposeful, syntropic movement towards higher coherence and order. Syntropy describes the opposite of entropy. The tendency of living systems to align themselves towards target states, to create energetic order and to structure themselves through resonance. Consciousness does not follow decay, but on a constructive creation. We also experience this syntropic development in the course of our lives. In the natural transitions from one state of consciousness to the next. 0 to 7 years, 7 to 14, 14 to 21, 21 to 28 and beyond. Each phase brings with it a fundamental reordering of our perception, an expanded understanding of identity, time, space and self. These transitions are like thresholds where our inner self develops. We experience space and time, externally and internally differently. In the state of meditation, of inner silence, we experience space and time in their inner fractal subjectivity. In these inner spaces, we do not feel the now as a point on a line, but as a multidimensional node, as an eternal present that contains the past and the future. Consciousness becomes a navigator through inner spaces that holographically intertwine with external realities. Our physical body is not the center of our being, but a biological spacesuit, a highly developed interface through which consciousness can experience itself in dense matter. The evolution of life, from protozoa to bacteria, plants, fish and mammals to humans, is less the history of the body than the history of the evolution of consciousness. Like technical devices, biological organisms can only receive certain frequency ranges. The Morse code hears individual tones. The radio translates waves into speech. The TV combines picture and sound. The smartphone exceeds the previous limits, is networked and can process more complex data. But all these devices only receive a defined section of a signal. The reality we perceive is only a fragment of what exists. Perhaps humanity's next quantum leap will not come from technology, but in our consciousness through self-knowledge. What if our consciousness is already a fractal structure that exists beyond our usual space-time logic. Like a multidimensional, holofractal object, similar to Hopf's fibration? A being that unfolds, experiences and observes itself through several dimensions at the same time? Where do you think our journey will take us? Would a caterpillar believe that one day it could fly and become a butterfly? Could it even imagine it? Final thoughts and quotes: Federico Faggin: \"Consciousness is not explainable because it is itself the explanation\". Roger Penrose: \"Consciousness is the phenomenon that makes the existence of the universe known in the first place\". Clarice Lispector: \"The mystical thing is that this consciousness does not come from us, but that we ourselves are made of it. In which you don't know what you are, but feel that you are. I am what happens when nothing is certain anymore. And that's where the new evolution of consciousness begins. I am a riddle that does not want to be solved, but unfolds itself.\" Thanks for your time and best regards",
