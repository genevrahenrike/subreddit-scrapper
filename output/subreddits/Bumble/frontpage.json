We were on our 3rd date getting brunch this morning and we started chatting about past jobs, particularly restaurant work since we have both been there. I was telling the story of the one time I got fired from a serving job, how it was more of this funny ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired/well I quit‚Äù type of situations when I was in my early 20s. That‚Äôs the only job I‚Äôve been fired from, in case anyone cares. At that moment he told me ‚Äúeh, I‚Äôve been fired from at least 10 jobs.‚Äù My brain kinda halted for a minute. He said it very casually. I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I just responded ‚Äúwhy??‚Äù as if there is one answer to this. He mentioned a couple of restaurant jobs when he was younger which I can be understanding of. But then he mentioned his most recent firing from a job as a salesperson (that‚Äôs his line of work). He said he got suspended because of a disagreement with a co worker and then two weeks later he got terminated because of yet another disagreement. After this, the conversation just moved on and I had a nice time as usual, but I‚Äôm sitting here now kinda concerned. He has a well paying job now and it seems like he can hold one, but what does this say about him that I might not be seeing? Behavioral issues? It seems so odd because he comes off as really kind and gentle. He‚Äôs very polite and considerate wherever we go. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so caught off guard. He did mention having some PTSD after the military, but that‚Äôs it so far (not to minimize ptsd) I can‚Äôt decide if I should ask more questions about this or just let it go, but pay attention. Any insight would be helpful I‚Äôve never come across this type of snag in such early stages of getting to know someone.",

He was/is my first boyfriend so I was super nervous about any dates as I‚Äôd never even been on one before. I was a senior in college though and my college‚Äôs social dynamic was strange, to say the least so I hopped on Bumble to give it a try after making a bet with some friends of mine. They believed I would have no problem finding a guy on a dating app and that I‚Äôd have hundreds of options in a day. I was terrified. And then I saw my now fianc√©‚Äôs profile. We have a 5 year age gap and I actually almost decided I didn‚Äôt want to see him a second time because our first date was a mess - like I thought I was going to be kidnapped type of mess. We were going to go on our first date the day after we actually had our first date‚Ä¶ well we changed those plans and he made dinner for us both at his place for a first date. I could tell he was just having a bad day and saw him a second time despite my hesitation. The second date went much better and was more comfortable for us both because we went and did what we planned for our actual first date which was to go see Oppenheimer and have dinner. We still swear now that the second date was our first date and we are only now telling people about our actual first date and laugh about it with them. Anyways, we went on hundreds of dates and now we are engaged! Our families get along well and I‚Äôve never been treated better by anyone in my life. We now have a homestead together and are planning our wedding which happens in summer next year.",

After reading no through your comments and realizing I was not overreacting , but also having him still messaging me like ‚Äúhello? Are you there?

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôve never used a dating app prior to downloading bumble 5 days ago. I‚Äôm a woman who lives in a major city, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm particularly attractive and I‚Äôve often been told that I‚Äôm really weird. So, I figured I could use all my likes, match with 2-3 people, and focus on them. I was incredibly wrong. After I got my first 2-3 matches, more matches just kept coming in from people I had liked those first 2 days. At first, I tried to focus on more people, but it‚Äôs just way too overwhelming. I don‚Äôt even want to open the app anymore to talk to the first matches I originally wanted to focus on.  I tried looking for some adjustable match limit in the setting and I couldn‚Äôt find one, so I just keep getting more and more matches. I feel horrible. I genuinely do like something about all of these people‚Äôs profiles. All of them deserve a fair shot and conversation with effort, but I just don‚Äôt have the wherewithal to respond to everyone. In the beginning, I tried responding to everyone, but it was too much and I accidentally ghosting people. (On the off chance someone I ghosted is reading this, I‚Äôm so sorry.) But I still can‚Äôt do anything about the new matches. So, I‚Äôm left with either having to let the match expire or unmatching them, both of which feel like rejecting someone I otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have. Am I in the minority for wanting a match limit on Bumble? Is this just how online dating is and I should get over it?",

You also might have to ask them on the date. If you and them are constantly waiting for the other to move then it will always be a stand still. Don't think that just because you have to initiate it means they are not interested. It could just mean they are awkward in new situations or shy.",

Emergencies can happen, but other than that I'll be there. But is it unreasonable to expect others to do the same? I've had this happen now twice to me. The last time someone cancelled about 45 min before we were supposed to meet for a second date. I was just about to put on my shoes. He said, he still had cleaning and chores to do and couldn't make the time we agreed on. Wanted to switch an afternoon date in a public place to an evening date at one of our houses. Hell no, not for a second date. This time someone cancelled on me at least over 48 hours ahead. But still, the reasons he gave was that he didn't realize how exhausted he was from last week and how busy he'll be this week. Which to me reads like a lack of time-management plus poor self-knowledge. (Or just a way to buy more time for dating someone else and have me as a backup?) I'm just a little exhausted from dealing with people's fuck-ups. Right now I feel like just ending the conversation completely. Other than that, he seemed like a great guy, asked lots of thoughtful questions, seemed really interested in me. So am I overreacting?",

      "content_preview": "https://imgur.com/a/LPJ38xC First pic is the last ‚Äúgood‚Äù picture of me. Other pictures wouldn‚Äôt go on an app, just to show objectively how I look My understanding is that dating only happens online now and the idea of a woman seeing pictures of me and thinking I‚Äôm attractive is laughable. The other places people meet partners are through friends, which won‚Äôt work because the women my friends hang out with all ignore me, and work, and I‚Äôd get fired if I asked out one of my coworkers. The rest of my life is pretty good (active lifestyle with good social life, cool job, not high-earning but financially secure) so on paper I‚Äôm ready to start dating but I have no idea if that‚Äôs even possible since no woman has been attracted to me. Is it even feasible or should I just learn to be happy alone? EDIT: the big advice is always ‚Äúget a haircut‚Äù but I just payed $60 for one, I don‚Äôt think anything looks good on my hairline and head shape",

I‚Äôve only been taken out to an actual date once. I can‚Äôt even tell if some of them are just looking to hook up. I just need to know if I‚Äôm making a mistake by rejecting them everytime.",
