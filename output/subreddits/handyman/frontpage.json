After I got off the phone with him my wife informed me that she had passed along my number through a friend to him. He's a disabled veteran. I get there and we spend 10 minutes going over his list and expectations. One job stuck out to me, some holes in his soffit that squirrels were getting through. I offered to fix those right away for $50. The actual work took me 16 minutes including setting up my ladder and putting everything away when I was done. Then he spent the rest of 2 hours talking my ear off. Yes I'll be going back tomorrow afternoon to do a few more things from his list. It's been a long time since I felt so good making so little.",

      "content_preview": "Yesterday I went to what I thought would be a quick routine job replacing a door handle on a bathroom door that wasn’t working. I turned up to the apartment and found that there were already two tradesmen there refitting the bathroom,one was in charge and the other basically a plumbers mate just standing around picking up after the other guy. I removed the door outside and started to take off the old handle and lock and drill out the door for a new mortice and handle but this door was probably 30+ years old,not solid wood and basically fell apart. I informed the customer of the issue and told her the only solution was a new door,she said she had guests coming in 2 days and really needed the issue resolved and asked if I could go and get a door. Reluctantly I agreed,I’m not a carpenter and I don’t advertise door hanging services but I realised she was in a tough spot and didn’t see anybody else resolving it for her anytime soon. I returned later with a door but realised the difficulty of trying to hang a door in a small bathroom with two guys already working there plumbing. I asked if I could return later but she insisted I could get it done and she would speak to the other guys to give me space. Sure enough they went on a lunch break and a run to the tip and gave me about 90 minutes free time to get the task done. The door actually was a close fit from the store and only needed a bit of trimming,but I left the brace for my door plane at home so planing it down became a challenge. I drilled out the lock but I don’t have a router but just as the guys came back I had the door hanging,it was a little close but shut ok and where I had cut a bit too much out around the lock I put in some wood filler and I also filled the frame where the old lock went. I ran it past the customer she was happy and paid me straight away. I just finished loading all my tools away when the main tradesmen came flying out the door to say ‘You can’t leave it like that that door ain’t right!’his He never actually said a single word to me the whole morning and all of a sudden he was acting like my boss. I followed him back into the house where in front of the customer he tried to discredit all my work. He told me it wasn’t planed right,there shouldn’t be a need for any filler and he fits doors for a living. I explained I’m not a carpenter just a handyman,it was a bit of a rushed job but not even a job I came here to do and once sanded/painted it would look fine. He said he could’ve got a friend to fit it and I said why didn’t he say anything until it was too late. He got me rattled so I went outside and got my drill,I came back inside and said I’m taking the door off if he’s not happy,he said I can’t because it’s been paid. I said I will refund her. At this point the customer had enough and said the door is staying and everything is fine we should just leave it there. So I left and text her afterwards saying sorry and that if she had any issues she can contact me. She said no worries. Like…what the hell!?!? Anyone ever had anything like this with other trades being so unfriendly right from the off?",

When I started, I made a goal of $100k net and I’m expected to surpass that goal, and have brought on a good friend of mine who sees the vision too. There has been slow weeks but there has been non stop weeks, so seeing all sides already. (This is my 2nd business I’ve started, im 25 now and started moving company when I was 20). I run my business out of my 2012 jeep grand Cherokee and it fucking sucks now, used to be cool to me. Tools have overrun my jeep that I love, I have a fiance and a kid and hate driving them around now because my fiance worries if we get in a car accident tools will fly everywhere. Which is totally fair. I try to organize in my downtime but there’s too many tools now, I have done the most organization I can do in the trunk. Long story short I’m considering towing around a 6x12 enclosed, other people who have hit this wall, what did you do to combat this problem? I get 0% interest on the trailers so I’m highly considering this. Tia",

There’s more than decent money in it, but little satisfaction in what more often than not amounts to making rich people’s houses shinier and newer. Considering the possibility of turning it into a non-profit that caters to widows and people in great need. Handicap ramps, aging in place amenities and alterations, nurseries for expecting families, etc. I started a non profit dog rescue in 2016, so I am familiar with a lot of the process, the technical and legal side of it. Guess I’m just looking for a sounding board on what some complete strangers think about it who don’t feel obligated to say nice things to me.",
