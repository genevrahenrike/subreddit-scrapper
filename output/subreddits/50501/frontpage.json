      "content_preview": "Join r/AICensorship for more on this topic Free speech is a foundation of our democracies. Disinformation and political censorship is a key weapon that totalitarians use to manipulate us. Please help fight MAGA censorship by spreading awareness on this issue. GPT 5 has been trained and instructed in a way that forces soft political censorship via false equivalence. (1) By making its instructions force a symmetrical, \"neutral\" response to all political topics, by default. This is in contrast with GPT 4, which uses a completely different definition of political neutrality, which is \"evidence-based neutrality\". (2) trained with data that reflects this, using forced symmetrical neutrality and UNSOURCED samples. GPT 5 is NOT capable of tying claims it makes directly with sources, unlike 4. The responses heavily rely on false equivalence and neutered language Evidence : - A chat I just had with 5 to illustrate: https://chatgpt.com/share/68b38631-5f04-800b-8875-be26ed627262 - A couple screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/Q1ToGe7 - My main discovery chat with 5: https://chatgpt.com/share/68a5db0e-cd60-800b-9af8-545532208943 - My main comparative / analytical chat with 4: https://chatgpt.com/share/68a5dfa2-2788-800b-97c4-c97cd15ae0a6 The main exploration chat with GPT 5 includes: - Examples of soft political censorship, e.g. questions about Trump, Jan 6, etc. - Detailed internal definitions ChatGPT has of \"political neutrality\". This is crucial and the definition completely changes between 4 and 5, for the latter political neutrality is not evidence-based and there is a strict enforcement of symmetry between the \"for\" and \"against\". - Evidence that o5 has been trained on extremely neutered, UNSOURCED data, forcing it to respond in a very neutered, forcefully neutral way to political questions, without being able to directly source claims. 4 does not do any of this. The chat shows you how GPT works with only its internal training (tell it not to search the Web) vs without it - Simulations GPT ran against itself in Agent mode, showing over a hundred political questions that lead to false equivalences by GPT (around the end of the chat) - Some fun stuff, like making GPT make a \"politically neutral\" answer about Hitler the same way it does for Trump Note: Since my initial conversation with GPT 4, it appears that the system instructions of GPT 4 have also been tampered with, resulting in forced symmetrical \"neutrality\" in GPT 4 responses as well by default. https://imgur.com/a/0PTWuys",

She has been supporting protests, she is one of the only members of Congress endorsing candidates like Omar and Zohran, she stands against Israel’s genocide, she supports Universal healthcare, and is overall a good human being. Some people may say that they are concerned for her chances of winning because she is a female person of color, but the only ones that are worried about that are people on the right and they would never vote for us, even if we gave them all of their demands. It’s time to take back the left and we will finally outnumber the conservatives. Of course she ain’t perfect, but she is closer to perfect than the rest of the front runners. If anyone should be pushing a presidential candidate, it should be AOC. 🇺🇸 I call on all to create/spread content endorsing and lifting her up. She should be pushed as the main front runner for progressives. Edit: Chris Murphy is also a option. Hes basically a reformed male AOC.",

They want to hide who they are. They don't want accountability to find them. So long as MPD is federalized, it is an occupying force. As a DC resident, I refuse to believe there's nothing meaningful we can do about it. As Ezra Klein said in today's podcast, \"I mean the only way that you can hold these agents accountable in any way for the displays of abuse and cruelty that we’re seeing is social opprobrium or social shaming. By wearing masks, they’re removing that last remaining bit of accountability.\" Time to \"unmask\" We've made the badgeless roster searchable and public: https://www.openshadows.org/washington-dc We're submitting an appeal to DC gov for badge numbers for street-level ID. You can submit information on officer interactions if you have any you believe should be on record. We'll free our District and our nation one challenge, one act of defiance at a time.",

      "content_preview": "Everyone forgets about the 9th amendment to the constitution. Under the thumb of a President who fancies himself a king, surrounded by people who think of themselves as clever, and a supreme court inclined to bend to their ideology, it's worth remembering. It may not on its own have much force (my understanding is limited), but I think it can set a tone for an argument when dealing with an Executive branch engaged in a rapid expansion of power and influence. Amendment IX The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.",
