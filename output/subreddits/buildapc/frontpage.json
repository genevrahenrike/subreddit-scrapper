It was a good time for productivity (adobe) and my games.Sticking with my same budget as before, I recently upgraded, and without with replacing my mobo, I maxed out to a 14600KF for cheap.  I am happy, my game don’t crash and I never been one to chance FPS or overclock.  And productivity is the biggest surprise of all.  A render that took 2 hours now takes under 10min.I also got a work laptop with an ultra 7 268V. And it’s blows away anything I used in the past for office and general work crap.It’s crazy to me that every single build I see is with team red now. What am I missing here?  Is AMD truly that much better in real world proformance:price ratio?I guess I my real question is, was it worth me spending a couple hundred dollars on my new 14th gen chip versus getting a new mobo and switching to team red chip?For context, I’ll admit to having some brand loyalty to team blue, and I have actually only built six computer rigs in the last 20 years. So I guess I’ll admit to my view being skewed.  I tend to hold on and upgrade only when necessary.486 (1990) ➔ Pentium 1 (1995) ➔ Pentium 4 (2000) ➔ Mac Pro (2006) ➔ Xeon E3-1230 (2012) ➔ 12600K / 14600KF",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I'm 30, and I just went through the biggest health scare of my life. Recently, I started noticing random pain in my arms and hands, even spreading to my back. At first, I freaked out and thought maybe I had something serious like a herniated disc. After a lot of panic and some check-ups, it turns out it was \"just\" repetitive strain injury (RSI)...This was a big wake-up call for me! I realized I’ve been sitting too much, eating all the wrong foods (inflammatory junk food), and not exercising at all. So, I’ve decided to quit gaming for a month, give my hands a break, and focus on fixing this. I’ve started running and researching anti-inflammatory foods. I thought, if it’s this bad at 30, I can only imagine how bad it will get by 50 if I don’t change. After all, things don’t fix themselves, right?As part of this lifestyle overhaul, I also realized I need to address my equipment. I spend about 16 hours a day in front of my computer (work + late-night gaming), and I know my current chair is a big problem. I’m planning to invest in a chair that won’t wreck my body, with a budget of around $450. If you have recommendations in different price ranges, that’d be awesome!I’ve also looked at some chairs, and I’m particularly interested in a AndaSeat X-Air Pro Office chair  and the Steelcase Leap V2 . Since I can’t try them in person, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Based on looks alone, the AndaSeat seems more comfortable.Thanks in advance for your suggestions, and feel free to make jokes about me being \"old at 30\" to give me a good laugh! :)",

You guys are so sweet, I've seen a lot of comments about \"the budget\" and \"the cancer\" and i wanted to explain those things! For the budget, i genuinely have no clue. All i was told was that i was eligible to make a wish, that'll be granted further on my journey ( I'm guessing after my 4-5 chemo sesh, I'll be told more.) as for what type of cancer, i have stage 3 germ cell tumor that's located behind my heart/lung (closer to my lung) I don't think it's terminal because I'm sure they would've told me if it was, that's all i know for now!

When I talked to the keeper and asked for advice he told me I shouldn't switch to AMD because in recent years they're no match for Intel, so he instead advised me to buy an i7 14700.This seemed REALLY odd to me since I only hear good stuff about AMD, and the opposite with Intel. Someone who's an expert in this field has an entirely different take from what I usually hear, so I'm pretty confused. Does he have a point or is he talking nonsense?Specs for context:RTX 4060Intel i7 7700DDR4 32 GB",

The GPU temperatures will then be hovering around 70-75°C. I hated the loud fans so much that in some games I would set (tolerable) framerate limits just so my GPU wouldn't hit 100%, which meant I couldn't use framegen either.Last week I undervolted my RTX 4070 Super. Now I can get the same framerate in games, but my GPU temperatures will only be around 60-65°C at 100% while the fans are VERY quiet. Witcher 3 with raytracing, 100+ FPS. Wuchang high settings, 130+ fps. Silent fans. Life's good.If you think it's hard or complicated, it's really not. There's plenty of tutorials on Youtube, it takes less than an hour to do, might need a little tinkering afterwards, and you'll benefit from it permanently.",

Part of me wants to just stick to the plan since it’ll easily get the job done, but the other part is saying “this is your chance to step it up.”Not sure if it’s smarter to put that extra money toward a better GPU, future-proof the CPU, or maybe just save it for peripherals/monitor.If you guys suddenly had an extra chunk of change after planning your build, where would you put it?",

To be fair I let nvidia optemise the games so usually it is with DLSS, medium RT and two settings turned down to medium.Mostly when I read online people are saying that the 3080 can barely handle 2k and the VRAM isn't enough, but it feels like either I am missing something or gamers calls anything under ultra settings without DLSS unplayable. Especially since nvidia auto optemises settings for specific games (the faster paced the game the more aggressively it targets settings).",

      "content_preview": "(Cross post)Hiiiii Reddit!Okay, so I’ve been wanting a gaming PC for a little while now but i am completely clueless about any of this stuff. For reference I want to play games ranging from Phasmaphobia, to Baldur’s gate. Again, i have no idea how any of it works, what computer i would need and all that etc.Please could people give me suggestions on what i need/ just where to start in general please! I am aware that they’re quite expensive so are second hand ones a good option?Thanks, guys!",

I tried to look on my own but all of the components just look like letters and numbers to me. I have no idea what’s considered good and what’s considered shit. If any of you kind souls could direct me somewhere I can learn what is worth splurging money on and what is a marketing rip off in disguise I’d really appreciate it. I don’t want to break the bank but I do want something that will play modern games well.",

Is there no way to get in the price point of $2,000 anymore to be able to play a highly intensive game while streaming it and get a good FPS?Or maybe I’m picking the wrong parts to buy?I am utterly shocked at how the price has just been increasing to a point where a middle class person has to think about how to be able to afford a computer to continue their hobby since childhood.",
