      "content_preview": "Hi all!After years of gaming on my trusty 1070/i5-7600K, it’s finally time for an upgrade. After going through different reviews, youtube videos, best buy guides, and posts here from the last few months, I came up with the following list for my next PC (see bottom).The PC will mainly be used for gaming at 1440p on ultra/high settings. Aside from that, it’ll also be used for work, mainly coding and photo editing.I chose the Meshify 2 specifically for the space it provides for HDDs in combination with great airflow and dust filters. It can actually fit more HDDs compared to the Meshify 3 and even the 3XL (!). I also prefer having the power button at the top.I do have a few points I could use advice on:Would you recommend buying aftermarket thermal paste? If yes, which one?Would you recommend buying extra fans for the case? If yes, which ones? I prefer air cooling. Silence is a big plus, but it doesn’t have to be completely silent.I opted for a PCIe 4.0 NVMe since I read PCIe 5.0 NVMe isn’t worth it (yet) and might even have some issues with ASUS boards. Do you guys agree?Ideally, I would have gone for the MSI VANGUARD 5070 Ti, but that card is overpriced in NL, so I went with the ASUS TUF instead.The PC will be bought in the Netherlands where the total price comes up to ~2100 Eur (excluding some cashbacks).Any tips and pointers are welcome!TypeItemPriceCPUAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor$359.00 @ AmazonCPU CoolerThermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler$34.90 @ AmazonMotherboardAsus ROG STRIX B650E-F GAMING WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard$255.47 @ AmazonMemoryCorsair Vengeance 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory$124.99 @ AmazonStorageSamsung 990 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive$159.99 @ AbtVideo CardAsus TUF GAMING OC GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card$989.99 @ AmazonCaseFractal Design Meshify 2 ATX Mid Tower Case$174.99 @ B&HPower SupplyCorsair RM850x (2024) 850 W Fully Modular ATX Power Supply$144.95 @ iBUYPOWERPrices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discountsTotal$2244.28",

Currently from my research I've been left with these options that tick those boxes but want to get further opinions before I jump on anything. I've also only really evaluated B850 and X870, not any of X870E, or others that could be relevant. And all of my evaluation has been from a rather popular motherboard spreadsheet (not sure if I'm allowed to link it so I wont) if that matters at all. Below are also some questions I'd love answered to help me decide between these, and just in general.ASUS ROG STRIX B850-F WiFiIs a 2x8+2+2 VRM phases noticeably better than 2x7+2+1 or 2x8+2+1 (in case of the X870 LiveMixer)?ASRock B850 Riptide WiFiWhat's a functional difference between 10GBps USB-C and 20GBps USB-C as that's the main difference between this and the STRIX?ASRock X870 Riptide WiFiWhat's a functional difference between 10GBps USB-C and 40GBps USB-C as that's the only difference between this and the X870 other than the B850 having one more M.2 Slot?ASRock X870 LiveMixer WiFiWhen would I want a 4x4 PCIe slot over a 3x4?What is a good use case (if any) for 10GBps USB-A over 5GBps USB-A?Thanks Y'all.

I would care for higher graphics settings then fps, anything above 80 fps would be lovely. I run linux, not sure if it matters.in terms of budget, I wont mind to invest in a good card that will last a few years, I love video games and would be willing to invest for a good experience. I would not pay anything above 900-950 bucks, and for anything in 800-950 dollars I will consider very carefully before buying.I wont mind if you guys will be technical or give a lost list of recommendations, I am not up to date on the latest tech but in the past I was + I am tech savvy enough to follow(I run linux afterall)Edit: cpu is i7-8700 3.2ghz",

So, growing impatient, I just decided to remove the 2 TB SSD from my old PC and plug it into my new one and use it as the boot drive. But now I still have a new 4 TB which is faster and would like to use it as my boot drive but also enjoy a fresh install with nothing else on the computer.So my question is: is there a safe way/program to move ONLY windows to my new SSD and simultaneously delete everything else? Or rather, a way/program to delete everything EXCEPT windows off my current SSD, and then just move windows to the new one?",

I can't find any documentation on that or even photo to compare that side. I don't want to buy GPU that won't fit in my MB and am approaching this question with caution to save time. Right now I have Gigabyte RTX 3060 Eagle and it barely fits (its like 3-4mm of free space left above) if it was few millimeters taller on the backplate side it wouldn't fit due to the limitations of the motherboard mounts and other wires in it.MB - ASRock B650M-HDV/M.2 CPU Cooling - BeQuiet Dark Rock Pro 5Other sides and case are completely unobstructed and supports this type of GPU.",

Among the important components: 9800x3d + MSI GeForce RTX 5080 Gaming Trio OC, and the whole thing is housed in a Cougar MX600 ARBG. The problem begins with the CPU cooler. I've never used an AiO cooler before – I didn't trust their software, and I was concerned about its reliability and the potential damage resulting from such a failure. I planned to install a Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 in the new computer. I'd also install three 120mm fans in the front and one 140mm in the rear (everything PWM by bequiet!). The question is: will this be enough to keep everything nice and cool?",

Is it actually faster to run your OS on one SSD and your games on a second SSD, or is a single large SSD basically the same in terms of performance? Trying to figure out if splitting them makes any noticeable difference or if it’s just for organization.So I'm just confused on what preference to give to os / other games and apps. Like, put os in nvme and rest in sata ssd, Or put games in nvme and os in sata ssd. Which would be better? Or there's no difference at all?Thanks in advance!",

My present is 460mm long as well as very deep which makes it too long to fit on a desk or shelf. But I am happy to look at any and all suggestions. Deep and tall is better than slim and long if you get me.Current hardware:MSI X570 Tomahawk wifi full ATX.5800X3D,64gig PC3600Zotac 5070Ti,Thermalright Assassin Spirit 120 V2 PLUS CPU tower Air Cooler,Seasonic 850w modular ATX psu.2X conventional HDD along side all my m.2 drives, I can afford to lose the HDD's if need be and stick them in an external caddy.

I don't use it that much, but I also tend to fire it up sometimes, when my PC is blocked ^^Current specs are ASROCK B450 itx Fatality, AMD 3600X, 16 GB Memory and a 1080ti. System is fully watercooled.I just ordered 2x 16 GB on ebay to increase memory on short term, but I want to increase the overall system performance, so I can play Diablo 4 with max graphics and also Star Citizen, which is already arguing about memory, Target resolution is 3440x1440 due to a 34\" WidescreenMy current idea is to get a 5700X and a 7800XT. That would surely increase performance noticeably and I just need to change CPU and plugin the GPU. So we are looking at an investment around 500 - 550€ if I get the GPU used, the CPU is currently at around 120€Alternative would be more future proof, switching to AM5, but keep the 1080ti and replace Board, CPU and Memory. Here I would go for a B850 µATX board but haven't decided yet which, preferably MSI, a 9700X and a 32 GB Kit, maybe 64 if I get a cheap one, or something used. That would also end up around 550 €My CPU block can be kept, as AM4 and AM5 have the same mounting mechanic and if I don't replace the GPU it can be kept in the loop. Adding a different GPU, I would keep it aircooled for a while but I would need to have watercooling in mind, if I buy one, so I know there is a compatible block out there.Here is an old picture of the rig, reservoir has been changed, otherwise it's still the same:https://ibb.co/XR89fWT",

      "content_preview": "Last night my room’s power tripped (breaker flipped) and when I reset it, my PC wouldn’t turn on. Turns out the motherboard got fried.For context: I had a portable AC, a high-end PC, sim racing equipment, and 3x 1440p monitors spread across 3 different outlets in my room. My house is older, and while the breaker has tripped a few times before, I usually just reset it and everything’s fine. This time, not so lucky. It wasn’t raining or storming or anything either, so I don’t think it was weather related.I’ve already picked up a surge protector, but I’m honestly worried about this happening again. What’s the best way to prevent damage like this in the future?",

I’m feeling fairly confident(for now!) and read up and watched plenty. My last query though is windows.What’s the best way to get it onto the new build. I my current setup has a 1tb SSD which windows is installed to and a 1tb M2. I hadn’t planned on keeping the SSD, but was going to keep the M2 for additional storage like photos, music etc. though I don’t suppose there’s any disadvantage to keeping the SSD as well?Would reformatting both and just moving them to the new build be fine for a hassle free way to get windows up and ready on the new build? Or would it be better doing a fresh install using a usb?Further, if I did just move the current hd’s across, can windows then be easily transferred across to the new and much faster 4tb M2 I’ve got?Thanks!",
