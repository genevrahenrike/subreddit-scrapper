      "content_preview": "Rereading the series. (Read it about 20 years ago the first time, so specific details are fuzzy) A third of the way through Wastelands. And I know Roland is pretty convinced that Shardik was the actual guardian (and he was around the place where the beam began, so that does seem to make sense), but surely that’s not the REAL Shardik? It was created by NCP. And as we saw in It, the Guardians have the ability to subtly influence reality to send messages or protect humanity. They’re more cosmic in nature. They’re not artificially-created cyborgs. Obviously this is probably explained in some of the supplemental works, but why would Roland be so certain that the cyborg modelled after Shardik is the real Guardian? Is it a symptom of his mind-bending Jake alive/dead paradox that he’s struggling with? Or could it be that the Guardians were, in fact, created by people long ago? Thoughts?",

My hope is that the show is a continuation of the novels where it follows the book but since Roland has the horn now we see what actually happens if he makes it to the dark tower with it. Would be extra exciting if you never see the horn until the very end when he pulls it out of his jacket. Non  readers may be confused but those who read the series would have an oh shit moment.",

I wanted to put together some memorable passages from each book. Would love to hear others! The Gunslinger: “Go then. There are other worlds than these” - Jake to Roland “All right,” the gunslinger said, and then asked the world’s oldest question. “Will I succeed? Will I win through?” “If I answered that question, gunslinger, you’d kill me.” - Walter to Roland The Drawing of the Three: “He walked out of nowhere toward nowhere, a man from another time who, it seemed, had reached a point of pointless ending” - Roland near the Western Sea \"He taught me if you kill what you love, you're damned. \"I am damned already,\" Roland said calmly. \"But perhaps even the damned may be saved.\" - Roland to Eddie The Wastelands: “See the turtle, ain't he keen? All things serve the fuckin’ beam” - Eddie “Kill if you will, but command me nothing!” - Roland to Blaine the Mono Wizard and Glass: “Who sent you west, maggot? The soul of a man such as you can never leave the west.” - Roland to Jonas “If you love me, then love me” - Susan to Roland Wolves of the Calla: “Eddie raised first one finger and then two. The dust of another world was beneath the nails” - Eddie in Keystone Earth with Calvin Tower “Roland!” he cries. “We’ve been betrayed! We’re outnumbered! Our backs are to the sea! We’ve got 'em right where we want' em! Shall we charge?” -Cuthbert on Jericho Hill Song of Susannah: “I hold to no God. I hold to the Tower, and won’t pray to that.” -Roland to Henchick “When he fell back into the seat, he looked both exhausted and exalted. The eyes which rolled to meet Eddie's were blue, ancient, glittering. \"Drive on.\" - Roland to Eddie The Dark Tower: “Death, but not for you, gunslinger. Never for you. You darkle. You tinct. May I be brutally frank? You go on.” - The Dark Tower to Roland. “This is your promise that things may be different, Roland—that there may yet be rest. Even salvation. A pause, and then: If you stand. If you are true.” - The Dark Tower to Roland",

I've seen people say Roland could or should have stopped trying to get to the tower after stopping the beam breakers. His job was done, purpose fulfilled, etc. If he'd stopped there, he wouldn't have gone on to free Patrick and erase the Crimson King. So, was he supposed to stop right after that? Or was he supposed to cry off as soon as the tower was safe? After reading Insomnia it seems blatantly clear that Patrick has to be saved and fulfill his purpose. So following the above, Roland seems justified feeding his tower addiction by sacrificing everyone on the way. I'm not sure why Gan punishes him by sending him on another loop. Was he supposed to just.. appreciate them more? Thanks in advance for any discussion!",
