      "content_preview": "I went out to walk my dog today (46th and Redman area) and this guy had his hand around a girls neck in the apartment next to mine. I yelled at him to keep his hands off her and he came up to me and threatened to shoot my dog and myself. He had his hands in a satchel type thing so I couldn’t be certain if he was armed. I did call the police but by the time they got there the guy wasn’t around, presumably inside or something. Idk I’m just honestly a bit scared that he may try some shit later on, and I’m unfortunately not legally allowed to carry. Sorry if this isn’t allowed here but I am a bit shaken lol Edit to add: Thanks for all the comments, I wanted to update here for those who don't wanna dig through comments. The police took my statement of what happened when they got there maybe 5 minutes later. I gave them as much as I could remember. The guy must have left or went inside the apartment complex. They went into the one he had been at with the girl and heard nothing, so realistically (I think) there's nothing they could have done at the time. However, there is now record of a call there and a report of it. I'll be safe, keep my eyes alert and everything. Unfortunately, in my situation financially I can't afford any cameras to properly set up or anything and I'm not legally allowed to carry or I would. I just did what I thought was right at the time and only after did I think about he might come for me later or anything. I'm not too aware of things that go on around 'the area' so to speak, so I've no idea if he was in a gang or anything of that nature. I'll keep the post updated if anything else happens. Thanks for all the kind words. Second update: A fight broke out between a few females and couple of males, from what I gathered maybe someone cheated or whatever. I called the cops as fists were thrown, and that same guy threatened a neighbors dog in the same way. They all scattered once the cops arrived, there isn't much they can do as obviously nobody will come forth. This time I parked my car in a way (dashcam) that would see the whole area and I locked the doors when it started, which turned on my dash cam for recording. It caught a good bit of the fights but, not any real faces or anything. The police are going to stay in the area as a deterrent. That's the current situation.",
