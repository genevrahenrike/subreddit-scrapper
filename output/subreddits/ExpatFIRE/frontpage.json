I do have a Social Security Number and driver’s license, and I pay taxes here, but I’m not a permanent resident. Here’s my situation: I’m here on a student visa and I don’t know if I’ll be able to stay after graduation. If I find a job, I’d love to stay, but if not, I’ll probably need to return to Europe in 1–2 years. Right now I only have a HYSA (high-yield savings account), which feels like the bare minimum. I want to start investing (mainly long-term), but my uncertainty about staying in the US is what’s holding me back. My questions: Should I open an investment account here in the US, invest for 1–2 years, and then withdraw everything if I have to leave (accepting taxes + converting USD to EUR)? Or should I just send money to my family in Europe and start investing there, even though I’m currently earning and paying taxes in the US? My goal is to maximize my earnings and get started with long-term investing, but I don’t want to create unnecessary complications if I have to leave. Would really appreciate any advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation!",

Has anyone here tried something like that? And if not — I’m curious, what kind of support would actually make it worth paying for?

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I'm a long-term traveller who has spent the last decade moving between different cities, mostly in Europe and the Middle East. Recently, I made a rather unconventional move and have been exploring Shenzhen, China, as a potential medium-term base. What's surprised me is the reality on the ground versus its reputation. The day-to-day quality of life, particularly the sheer convenience (instant delivery, incredible public transport), feels leagues ahead of many Western cities, and the cost of living is unexpectedly manageable. This has sparked a genuine curiosity in me. I know there are legal pathways to stay here longer-term through surprisingly affordable study or start-up routes, which seems to open up some interesting possibilities for nomads. However, I'm acutely aware that I have my own biases and blind spots. That's why I'm turning to the collective wisdom of this community, especially those who have direct experience with life in China: For those of you who have lived in or seriously considered China as a base, what were the real, non-negotiable deal-breakers for you? What are the \"hidden costs\"—not just financial, but social or mental—that a newcomer might completely overlook? I'm less interested in the generic talking points and more in the blunt, \"lived-it\" realities. Was it the internet situation? The visa runs? The challenge of forming deep friendships? Appreciate any and all perspectives.",

Basically curious if it is worth to put money there vs. high yield savings account or mutual fund. My situation. Home equity approximately 500K with $160,000 balance. Mutual Fund balance approximately $560K. High Yield Savings at 51K and 401Ks/IRA balances 360K.  I currently contribute 15% to my company's 401K plan and of that they are matching at 4%. I have not contributed to Roth due to previous alimony payments. I could likely divert some of the 401K to the Roth at this point but is it worth it?  The goal is to FIRE either overseas in the next couple of years of stay in the states and work another 6-8 years. I will have access to social security (mine or ex) and workplace pension and home will be paid off in eight years. Thoughts?",

For now, I’m enjoying the chance to stash some extra cash into my company’s tax-deferred 401(k). Here’s my current financial snapshot: Roth IRA: $140K Traditional IRA: $165K New Traditional 401(k): $10K Brokerage Account: $100K Rental Property: $115K mortgage balance (fully paid off in 20 years), current equity ~$100K. Rental income is slightly positive, covering mortgage, HOA, taxes, and insurance. Once paid off, it will free up about $1,400/month today or roughly $3,000/month in 20 years (inflation-adjusted). Short-term plan: I’ll invest $80K of my brokerage funds into income-focused ETFs tied to gold and bitcoin volatility (IGLD, IAUI, BTCI, YBTC). Based on recent returns, this should generate about $1,500/month without touching my retirement accounts or cash reserves. Next step: I plan to start a 72(t) SEPP withdrawal from my IRA to increase monthly income to around $2,200/month while keeping the Roth IRA intact for unexpected expenses. I’ll also keep about $20K in cash for a potential property purchase in South America—looking at Colombia, Peru, Paraguay, or Bolivia for their low cost of living and affordable real estate. The goal is to withdraw the minimum needed so the portfolio can maintain or even grow over time. Longer term, the rental property income will provide additional financial security when the mortgage is paid off around age 60.",

Things I like about Costa Rica: Landscapes Good weather Taxes Generally peaceful I already know it (I admit that starting from scratch feels a bit daunting, especially since my main interest is fiscal residency) On the other hand, things I didn’t like: It’s an expensive country (though I accept that) People are often late (I think Paraguay is similar?) and not very direct Limited convenience (I shopped several times on Amazon USA, and with customs and everything, it cost me double) I’m not very fond of insects (but there are always solutions) Honestly, I don’t know much about Paraguay. The only clear advantage I see is that it’s much cheaper, but on the downside, the climate is worse than in Costa Rica. What about the other aspects?

My plan is to live entirely off passive income and avoid working. Here’s my situation: I’ve got about $750k in equities. I also own some real estate, but I don’t plan on using that for income right now. The allocation I’m considering: $250k in JEPQ and other dividend-focused stocks $100k in cash/CDs/HYSA for stability $400k in S&P 500 (VOO) as a long-term, untouched growth bucket The idea is that the JEPQ + CDs/cash will generate enough to cover my ~$2k monthly living expenses, while the VOO chunk keeps growing untouched. On paper, this feels like it works, but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s off. Maybe I’m missing a risk factor or making an over-simplified assumption. Does anyone else rely on JEPQ or similar ETFs for FIRE income, especially abroad? What are the pitfalls I should watch out for?",

      "content_preview": "Hi guys, So I have a health condition that gets bad in when the weather is humid. I've lived in Australia for most of my life and it gets worse every year. So I've been thinking about FIREing overseas. My condition rules out a lot of the popular FIRE destinations in SE Asia, Southern Europe, South America, etc. So what are some other popular FIRE destinations that are not so humid? I'm looking for typical things like decent quality of life, affordability, expat-friendliness, good healthcare etc... I know I won't find the 'perfect' place. At this point I'm just looking for ideas for further research. There are so many cities in the world that I don't know where to start... I'm hoping to eventually narrow down a short list of places and then do some travelling/staying to test things out. My FI number will likely be around $3m AUD (or $2m USD) once I reach it. Still have a few years to get through. Sorry if this sounds like a noob question, any suggestions/advice is welcome",

My goal is not to limit my taxes or hide income or anything like that. I will report everything to the IRS. I don't have a particular destination at this point, but I have the ability to live/work in the EU and most of South America, so my goal at this point is finding a general solution that balances: having access to my funds worldwide allows me to hold funds in multiple currencies allows assets to continue grow at some nominal rate, even if somewhat lower than US growth doesn't add a boatload of complexity to my US tax filings Any advice on how to start learning what the options are and deciding which one might be right for me?",

      "content_preview": "51M married with 2 kids (boys at 13 & 15) with single income from employment over 450k/yr and NW at $4.0m living in VHCOL. Profession in Corporate finance and operations. Current expenses pre-tax are ~200k/yr (but could take it to $150k if needed or lower if we moved to lower cost of living area in US). We live pretty well (2 cars, vacations, eat high quality food, gym, and don’t track spend much anymore). Our portfolio is currently 80% stock, 15% bonds, and 5% cash (a little real estate through REIT and a bit of Crypto). 30% is in various retirement accounts (401ks, ROTHs) and rest in investment. About $150k (not included above) set aside for kids education. No real estate investment (we rent for flexibility and low stress). Started with $0 (no inheritance) and have been working since the age of 14 with goal of financial independence. We save between 15-30% of my income in any year (depends sometimes with large purchases such as car). I don’t currently own real estate since it’s much cheaper for me to rent in the local area. Only liability are taxes on un-realized capital gains on non-retirement investments is approx $400k. Here’s my dilemma. I’m good at what I do, well respected, and paid accordingly. I’ve been in a similar line of work for ~25years. Problem is that this role and prior roles require a heavy investment of my time with consistent 60-75hrs work weeks (typically 8a-10p workdays on weekdays and part of the weekend). Every time I try to take vacation or day off, I have to work part of most of that time. My dedication to my profession is both reason for success, but also adds to growing dissatisfaction and stress. I barely have time to spend with my kids while they are growing up and stress from work spreads into my family. I feel bad watching my kids grow up and my contribution is more financial vs raising them / teaching them. Even if I had better work/life balance, I’m probably burned out from my type of Corporate work. I’m thinking about 3 options moving forward : FIRE: Continue as is until NW gets to $5m (probably 3 more years) and then move to lower cost of living in US (OR or ID) or South/Central Europe (we have dual citizenship). Kids will have option to attend US/European advanced education/University/trade school. We’ve also thought about doing slow travel across the world. Lean or Expat FIRE: Resign now and move low cost of living areas (Bangkok or Bali). Focus on raising my kids. Downside is the kids will eventually need to move away/back to US or Europe for their career & family and concerned there won’t be enough net worth for me to live next to them / help them out  through their 20s. CoastFIRE. Find a job that pays half of what I make and stay in current location. Problem is that I can’t find a role that can do this for me and working no more than 40hours. I’ve also read a lot about others doing consulting, but I’m not sure there’s much consulting work in my specialty area. I understand that I have a 1st world problem. I very grateful and thankful for everything I have, but looking for advice from all you Redditors on ideas and appreciate any advice from those that retired early with teenagers.",

Or Vietnam, possibly, which has been rumored to be coming out with a 5 to 10 year visa of their own. Or are there potential downsides to having PR?

I will also consult a tax professional, but just wanted to get a sense of what actual folks are and aren't doing. I heard a lot of locals don't even report personal income, and that DIAN can't really enforce, especially foreigners. So self-reporting on foreign international assets seem like an even further stretch.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, sorry for long post but wanted to get your thoughts if you think my plan is solid?  It is scary to do what I’m planning to do so I appreciate your patience and feedback. I just turn 37 and have about 270k today outside of my 401k.  (I do not want to include 401k since its not much and will not be touch until I’m 60+ when likely I will have higher cost of living but will recalculate and figure actual full retirement later in life). My plan is that in 1 year, on my 38th birthday to quit (if I’m not laid off already).  I work in a lower level IT role that is being slowly eliminated by AI and offshoring so we are already being asked to learn and certify in other areas to pivot (but I’m too tired/unmotivated to study).  Also I don’t enjoy my job. By my 38th birthday I an shooting to have 300k invested in SP500 index funds and 12k in cash/CDs, so total $312k, which I will then move to SE Asia (Mostly Da Nang, Vietnam but will also live in Chiang Mai, Thailand and Kuala Lumpur for some time.  (As a Viet Kieu, I will have visa that allows me to stay in vietnam for 6 months) The $12k cash is to help me avoid drawing from the 300k the first year while i figure out and get comfortable seeing my investments and expenses going as expected.  Then the 2nd year I will start drawing the 4% on my 300k investment (SP500 Index Funds) to live on $1k or less per month. For the first 6 months, I plan to only focus on setting healthier food, exercise and mindfulness routines (since I’m in a very bad state now) and recover mentally and physically. After that, then slowly, I will try to figure put how to start my own business/income.  My goal to make enough to move to Spain on their digital nomad visa, and then eventually be able to FIRE in a city with cost of living like London ultimately.   I am starting in SE Asia since I can’t really afford to be anywhere else that is as nice and safe for the same price. I think it may take me many years to figure out how to start my own business/income but I already have many ideas I’m excited to try. The risks are : I feel will struggle to find another job that pays as much if i change my mind given my industry’s trends and existing work experience and skills.  Also with age discrimination in tech, it will be hard to compete in lower level positions at my age. The other risk is I will not be successful in starting a business at all, which is bad since I know I do not want to stay in SEAsia more than 2 years. I have no other safety net outside of myself, no family that would house me if i fail and have to go back to work in the states, which is why i absolutely want to leave the $300k principal untouched,  only live off its yield of $1k or less unless its an absolute emergency. What do you guys think?  Is this a good plan?  Any advice on how I should quantify or minimize the risks to feel more confident about my plan?  Thank you to anyone who read all of this.",

However, the way I understand it, a QDOT conflicts with Civil Law countries like France.  France recognizes IRA accounts in the tax treaty and IRA's are trust accounts. Given my spouse is the beneficiary and France doesn't tax estates of surviving spouses how would a QDOT work in this scenario? If our son is the follow-on beneficiary of the QDOT upon my spouse's passing and he is NOT a resident of France, would there be a tax implication of a US citizen not living in France for a U.S. asset of a French resident?  Would France have any jurisdiction at all?",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I've hit a wall, and I'm hoping to get some honest advice from this community. I moved to Toronto a couple of years ago for a corporate job as a data analyst with a salary of around $6,500 CAD per month. While that sounds great, after paying Toronto's incredibly high rent and other monthly expenses, I'm left with very little. It feels like a major step back from being my own boss. What happened next has me completely rethinking my path. About six months into my new job, a friend back home in Pakistan called. He was struggling to make ends meet and asked for a huge favor: to buy him a car so he could drive for a ride-sharing app. After some thought, I went for it and bought him a new Japanese 600cc car costed me around $13,000 USD. It took a few weeks to get everything sorted, Insurance, paperwork etc. but when he started, the results were honestly a shock. He paid me back $325 USD in the first month. That’s a 2.5% return on my investment in just 30 days. He's been consistently paying me that amount every month since. I mentioned this to a colleague at work, and his father, who had just retired, was looking for an investment. I set up the same arrangement for him, and all of our investors have also invested and bought the same car for the fleet. For my role in managing everything from sourcing the cars and vetting the drivers to handling the legal work, my profit share is 30% of the net revenue from each investor's car. Word got out, and now, as of June 2025, we have a total of 24 cars with eight investors. The business is going great, and the returns are consistent, with cash flowing in every day. In the last four months, we've even started a new initiative to double-shift 10 of the cars to maximize their potential, which has increased our net profit by an additional 1.5%. We have also agreed with the owners to replace all the cars with new ones every five years to keep the fleet modern and mitigate maintenance costs. The total monthly net profit from the 23 investor-owned cars is now between $9,360 USD and $10,400 USD. Here's my dilemma: I'm not just asking for business advice anymore; I'm asking for life advice. This business, which is a registered private limited company, is giving me a level of financial freedom and satisfaction that my corporate job in Canada simply can't. The thought of being my own boss again and moving back home to run this full-time is all I can think about. It’s a completely different league from volatile market returns; with this business, the cash is flowing in every day. My plan is to use my personal savings to invest in 4 cars for myself, which would match the \"take home\" income I earn from my current job. I’m confident we can scale this to at least 150 cars, but I’m terrified of making the wrong move. Is it too risky to quit a stable, well-paying job for a business I \"accidentally\" created? Should I make a website or a proper online presence if I am taking a decision to dive in full time to attract more investors? I'm getting more and more interest from friends and family. Should I be taking more investments? How should I scale this properly? What are the biggest risks I should be thinking about before I take the leap, especially considering the long-term asset value of these vehicles and operational costs? Any advice, particularly from people who have left a corporate job to pursue their own business, would be incredibly helpful. I feel like I'm sitting on a gold mine, but I'm afraid of messing it all up. Disclaimer: This post is for informational and discussion purposes only. I am not offering or soliciting any investment opportunities, nor am I providing financial advice. All numbers, except for my salary, are in USD. My salary is in CAD. I encourage everyone to do their own due diligence.",

Culturally, Spain and Italy resonate with me the most, but Portugal looks the most advantageous on paper. I can live well on $2.5K/month, and I’m looking for a place where I can eventually buy property and start a family.

Moving to a lower-cost country in SE Asia or Eastern Europe. Living on ~$2,500/month all-in (rent, food, insurance, travel). On paper, that’s ~$30k/year. My portfolio could almost cover it at a 4% withdrawal rate… but I’d be cutting it close. I have a Dubai setup that lets me pay no taxes on all my capital gains and active income. I’m invested using WIO bank, emirates NBD and IBKR. I did this by registering a free zone company. The company I used is GenZone, they specialize in crypto and in my opinion are the most reputable company for dubai setup. Originally they are how I came to learn about nomad lifestyle. The upside: I’d gain a decade of my life back now, while I’m young and healthy. The downside: If my investments tank or I lose work, I could be forced to come back to my home country broke in my 40s.",

      "content_preview": "I'm looking for some outside perspective on whether or not to leave the US (DC) next Spring for France or to wait another year to save more money. My wife (French) and I (American) are both early 40s, and want to make the move to France soon to raise our two kids (5 and 1), for better quality of life and for obvious political reasons. The 5-year old understands French well enough but can't really speak it, so we'd like to make the jump as soon as possible. My fear though, is that I have a high paying job here that will in no way translate to finding a job in France, so it'll be on my wife to find a job and net ~€2.5-3k/month which we know isn't much with two kids. Our finances are as follows: Retirement account savings: $800k Nonretirement savings: $1m I also have a military inflation-adjusted pension that will net me $4k/month for the rest of my life, so even though I probably wouldn't work in France I would be earning a good amount by French standards. Expense-wise, I think we'll spend at most probably €6-7k/month in France, but it's hard to be sure. If we stay in DC another year, we could probably save another $100k to provide a buffer in case of a severe market crash or a weaker dollar. My job is stressful and I'd love to quit, but I know I won't be able to earn anything close to this again given the certs/clearance I'd be giving up. I know we're in a great position with the savings and pension, but the draw of one more year is strong. What would you do in our position?",

Some concepts like the Five Flag Theory (diversifying residency, citizenship, banking, business location, etc.) or more general international tax optimization could pair really well with FIRE goals. Same with how small businesses or solopreneurs sometimes structure things to reduce tax drag. I’m curious: Has anyone here integrated tax optimization or international planning into their FIRE strategy? What worked, and what turned out to be more trouble than it was worth? Would love to hear real experiences, even just in theory vs. practice.",

I should probably consider fully relocating to EU or reject this job offer. I am EU citizen working in the UAE for almost 6 years. I received a remote work offer from an EU company which can only hire me within EU. They also do not accept contractors, so they'd have to register to the country of my choice and hire me there. They are already registered in a few countries but they'd consider registering to a new one for me, as long as it is in EU (so UAE not possible). For personal reasons it would be more convenient to keep my main residency in UAE, which could be possible since work will be mostly remote. This leads to some issues such as for taxes, health insurance, etc.: Is there any EU country that would allow avoiding taxes by spending 183+ days in UAE and being taxed there (where there is no income tax). Highly unlikely, as from what I understand most countries consider income made within them as taxable locally, even for non-tax residents. Since (1) is a long shot, which country would be more favourable to be hired in, to lower tax and other associated expenses if I don't intend to live there? I found Bulgaria to have fairly low tax, but also several other countries seem to offer tax incentives for people that move their tax residency there.",

The rough plan is to split the year between: •\t4–6 months in the U.S. (near family)\n•\t4–6 months in a low-cost, family-friendly beach town (thinking Central America or Mexico). Budget for the year: about $50k total. We’re aiming to live on $3k–$5k/month in the beach location. Priorities are: •\tWalkable community with access to good surf\n•\tSafe and family/kid-friendly environment\n•\tReasonably priced childcare/preschool options\n•\tBalance of affordability and quality of life After the sabbatical, the default plan would be to go back to international teaching (our current path). But honestly, we’d love to find an alternative lifestyle/career setup that doesn’t require returning to full-time teaching in order to stay on the FI trajectory. Questions for the community: 1.\tFor those who’ve done something similar, what beach towns would you recommend for ~6 months of slow travel with kids? 2.\tAny advice for managing the transition back to work after a year off — or strategies for building alternative income streams so we don’t have to return to the same career path? 3.\tAnything you wish you had done differently in planning your sabbatical or “Coast FI” stage?

We can do ACA plans for them, but the big fear is that Republicans end ACA leaving them without healthcare. 2 of our kids have pre-existing conditions that make good healthcare a necessity. Our disabled kid does have Medicaid coverage as well, but we're worried about cuts if that is their only insurance. That kid is also trans and I doubt government medical benefits will cover gender affirming care much longer. Our kids are also EU dual citizens. Each is also planning to move abroad eventually but all have different reasons for not wanting to move just yet (building career, in a serious relationship, finishing school). Meanwhile spouse and I are very ready to go! The older two are both supporting themselves now, with the exception of healthcare. And even though they are adults, I don't want to force them to do the health care stuff on their own like our folks did to us, it's just so expensive for young folks just starting out (especially for the meds 2 of them need).
