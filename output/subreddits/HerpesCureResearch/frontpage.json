      "content_preview": "Camel Nanobodies Show Big Promise Against Herpes--100% Protection in Mice, Even Drug-Resistant Strains and severe Brain Encephalitis. Reference: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58669-7 Herpes simplex virus (HSV) affects billions of people. HSV-1 ‚Üí cold sores, eye infections, brain infections. HSV-2 ‚Üí genital herpes. Current drugs (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) only slow the virus down. They don‚Äôt clear it from your body, and resistance is rising. The virus hides in nerve cells and keeps coming back. üî¨ The New Breakthrough: Camel Nanobodies Scientists discovered tiny antibodies from camels (called nanobodies) that can neutralize HSV. Two nanobodies, Nb14 and Nb32, attack different weak spots on a key viral protein (gD) the virus uses to enter cells. Researchers fused them into one ‚Äúbispecific antibody‚Äù ‚Üí Nb14-32-Fc. Where it succeeded: Blocked the virus before and after it attaches to cells. Stopped HSV from spreading directly between cells (a sneaky immune evasion trick). In mice, gave 100% survival against lethal HSV-1 & HSV-2 infections--including brain infections and acyclovir-resistant strains. Outperformed the best existing clinical antibody. What are the gaps? Not tested in humans yet--only in mice. Doesn‚Äôt remove latent virus hiding in nerves. Needs safety, dosing, and long-term studies. ‚ö° Why This Matters? Could become a new drug class for severe or drug-resistant herpes. May work as prevention for high-risk patients. Gives researchers new targets for vaccines and even gene therapy approaches (CRISPR, AAV). We‚Äôre not at a cure yet, but this is a huge leap forward. Nanobody therapies could finally give people powerful options when current herpes drugs fail.",

      "content_preview": "BD111 injection, developed by BD Gene, is the world's first in vivo gene-edited antiviral gene therapy product. On July 21, 2025, the first subject in a Phase II clinical trial was successfully dosed at the Eye and Vision Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The study is estimated to have 40 participants and is expected to have its primary completion in December 2026. Phase 1 of the study had 16 participants and is expected to be completed on March 16, 2026. Although the Chinese company has not yet released any statement, the fact that they have started phase 2 may mean that they have obtained good results with phase 1. For those who do not yet know about this treatment, BD111 is a gene therapy that targets HSV-1 to cure and treat Herpes Stormal Keratitis (HSV-1 inside the eye / cornea) by delivering the treatment to the trigeminal ganglion. In 2022, they released results from three patients who after treatment had no more recurrences. The company has a treatment for HSV-2 in its pipeline, but it is still in the preclinical study phase. I know that for many people this is not the treatment yet, but if it is successful it could be a huge step forward for new herpes treatments. In my opinion, since gene therapy is still very new and not much is known about the risks, companies have prioritized Storm Keratitis because it represents the greatest risk and therefore has the greatest chance of approval by regulatory agencies such as the FDA. https://www.bdgenetherapeutics.com/news/111.html",

I found another clinic in Rochester, NY: Atlas Clinical Research Where else have people found the trial? I don't know why they're making it so hard to find.

Discovery research and preclinical development were performed by leading European CROs and renowned French Universities in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur Paris. OXYMO Technologies has successfully completed the preclinical development of its first clinical drug candidate Oximo, and submitted a pre-IND application to the US FDA for the treatment of Recurrent Herpes Labialis (RHL). Oximo is scheduled to enter Phase I clinical trial in 2026 and Phase II trial in 2027, in collaboration with the University of Washington in Seattle, USA, to demonstrate proof of concept (POC) in RHL patients.‚Äù https://www.oxymotech.com/",

We're interested in people with herpes experiences of talking to partners and healthcare workers about having herpes, especially during pregnancy. We're looking for people to complete a 10 minute online questionairre and then if willing take part in a short interview or focus group (these are optional).  We plan to use the things you tell us to create educational resources to help people talk about herpes. If you are - Over 18 - Live in the UK - Have been diagnosed with herpes by a healthcare professional Please email uhsussex.letstalkstudy@nhs.net and we can send you more information about the study.",

I‚Äôm scheduled for my first pre dose visit on July 18th. To my knowledge, this is being seen as a potential therapeutic vaccine that could drastically reduce or hopefully completely eliminate shedding either for life or for a period of time until a booster can be administered, even though it was initially being designed as a prophylactic. I know a few other people have participated in this trial or the MRNA 1608 one. If you have, please tell us your experience with how the trial went. If it‚Äôs possible please tell us if your shedding has gone down or been eliminated, or anything else you might wanna share with us. Personally I‚Äôm hopeful for a functional or sterilizing cure within the next 5-10 years.",
