I am a private renter and earlier received a call from an 077 number claiming to be the council. they wanted to confirm my name and address and arrange a time for a “compliance check” of my property, as it’s been a few years and they’re due to check there is no mould or damp. I asked if there was any way I could confirm they were actually from the council, as it was a private mobile number and I didn’t want to give out information/arrange for someone to come into my house without being sure! he said he would send me a text with further details, but I haven’t received a text. I’ve been searching on google for anything to do with a “compliance check” from the council but can’t find anything - maybe I’m misremembering what he said? I have never had this requested of me in all the time I’ve been renting, or even heard of it from friends. does anyone know if this is a normal thing, or if I’m right to be feeling a bit iffy about it? thanks all in advance :-)",

It'd been a long day and I was dead hungry so stopped by maccies just off market square for a quick bite. Just minding our own business and there's a drunk couple 40s-50s (severely weathered) arguing about a girl the man was texting. All of a sudden gets out of hand and the man starts yelling, throws his full cup of Fanta at his girlfriend, but actually hits me and my gf sat on the table over. I'm just like 'um that just went all over us, why did you do that?' and the geezer responds with 'WHAT YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT'. Obviously nothing because I don't want to fight some random twat in maccies. So I just ignored him and we got up and left, while he keeps saying 'you fucking what?' 'come here then pussyhole' etc. etc. Should also mentioned my gf was wearing a rainbow jacket so he called us gay pricks  and 'fuckin pride wankers' (???) Unprovoked. Seriously, a Friday night on payday is one thing, but a Sunday?? What's going on in this town... Can anyone offer some words of wisdom because I'm just about done with Notts at this point. Edit:for those asking, it was Angel Row maccies. Honestly never had a problem with maccies before, lots of good advice to just steer clear of this fight club. Also someone mentioned 'why did you say anything at all' - I feel it's a natural reaction to be like 'yo wtf', I didn't engage otherwise, hardly looked at the guy, he just wanted to brawl.",

This is because I have not done my maths and english, I also failed all my exams in school and I have no grades and no qualifications, I have applied to volunteer at The Pride Shop, as I wish to volunteer there, they have advised they will be in contact with me when they next have a volunteering interview available which is understandable and fair so I am happy to await this opportunity. Outside of Base 51/NGY, I have tried both LGBTQ+ and general groups ( Both in person and online groups ) such as groups on Meetup, LGBT Notts Network, Notts Trans Hub, Trans4me, Discord Server Groups, The Wolfpack Project, Autistic Nottingham, Jigsaw Youth Club, Mencap Youth Club and their groups, Space Inclusive, The Dice Cup, Nintendo Nottingham and NAMSOC as a few organisations I have tried all throughout these years that have not worked out due to my employment/education status. I have also tried talking to the social prescribing team from my GP but they have pointed me back to all these groups above due to them not knowing what else to suggest which is understandable and fair and I have shown my appreciation for their advice. I am a Cyclist, I love keeping myself energetic and healthy and being out in nature, I am Vegan, I have a Nintendo Switch, Cycling around, gaming & the gym are a few of my hobbies. I was just wondering if there is any people that are open to making friends with people who are unemployed and not in education or volunteering? Only this has always been a dealbreaker to all people I have encountered in my experience and I am unsure how to navigate around this? It would be nice for the opportunity to have at least 1 friend at some point in life so I can feel less lonely as I feel isolated, I was just wondering if anyone could advise me around this if possible? Any advice from anyone on this would be very greatly appreciated if possible, sorry for the lengthy post, for reading and for your help. Thanks!",

Saw some casual mild sexual harassment of some girls. Then saw a fight by the lions where a grown ass man punched a woman, she punched him back, security tried to break it up, got punched.

It's a 3 bed semi-detached that is part furnished so everything we have will likely fit in a luton van. If you've moved recently, did you get them to do the packing? How much more did this cost compared to packing things yourself? Thank you",

I met your brother on the steps of a very crowded alley filled with bars and had a very colorful conversation with him that didn’t end so well. You came over to understand the situation and ended up hanging out with me and my friends for the rest of the night. We introduced ourselves, got to talking while waiting out a huge rainstorm and though we were both a little drunk, we hit it off and had a great time chatting and flirting a bit. In the midst of our conversation, we completely forgot to exchange info with each other before the night ended due to circumstances outside of our control, and we had to go our separate ways. It’s been almost a year and I still regret not exchanging contact info to this day. All I remember is that you were around 6’2 or 3” 27 (in 2024), Black British, born and raised in Nottingham and worked for an energy company. I remember your first name but I’m not sure if I should reveal it here. I don’t know if he’s on Reddit but I figured why not give it a shot? TLDR: American girl from NYC meets charming man from Nottingham on vacation in Croatia and regrets not exchanging information before going our separate ways.",

And if we actually decide to email, they say it takes 10 days. The last time I did that it took 2 months!
