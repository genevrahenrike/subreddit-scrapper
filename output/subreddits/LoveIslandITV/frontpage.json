Why is it wrong for Toni to be upset that Helena did the exact same thing that Harry and Shakira did to Helena. She is also a hypocrite, acting all happy for Toni one second and then the next acting like Harrison held her down on that daybed to kiss her. As if she had no choice. What a chump, and honestly I was really banking on her happiness after what H did, but she's just as shitty as he is.",

      "content_preview": "It’s very confusing how Harry can do whatever he wants while Dejon is made out to be so horrible when he never actually did anything except flirt. And then once he went exclusive he stopped flirting. Harry actually hurt Helena and treated her horribly. Harry has some serious problems and straight up enjoys his ways, he even bragged about it to Harrison. And other times also. Dejon was a flirt. And then stopped once he committed to Meg. Also- Toni would have been with Harrison if he picked her but he didn’t. And then she went back to Cach to stay in the show and that was just okay with everyone. And Shakira could move around however she wanted. Why was Dejon treated like such a villain? I’m confused. Harry was by far the worst. EDIT: So after reading your comments, I see nothing to actually dignify Dejon’s treatment while Harry got to go to the finals and get second place. Yall think Harry is charming and Dejon is manipulative. But Harry is just as manipulative. If not more. Because he got you all to like him. Maybe some of you are more prejudice than you realize or can admit. Dejon did not commit some crazy crime and deserve this kind of hate just bc you don’t like him. There’s something deeper here, whether you can see it or not. I love reality shows but the intensity and hate online is ruining them and making them dangerous. And it’s just getting worst. So maybe remember that Dejon didn’t actually do anything. To you or to anyone. Men treat women much worst than that every day. And visa versa. And Harry was worst. But he’s charming? I didn’t think so. I think she’s 22 and he’s 30 and that he knows exactly what that means. And if you don’t- then you’re probably too young to understand. (And I don’t think an 8 year difference is too much to be together.)",

      "content_preview": "After watching the baby episode and seeing Yaz and Megan being very grounded in their stances on not wanting children was, in my personal opinion, very much appreciated. I relate very much to Yaz in that I have never felt any desire to be a mother (I’m 34F) and am constantly forced into conversations by coworkers about having children, why I dont have any, how “I’ll change my mind soon”, or having to listen to them talk about their kids and their literal birth stories, and it’s so obnoxious and disrespectful. I’m always polite and quickly, but respectfully, disengage from the conversations, but it feels like not wanting children is not an acceptable answer. Every season that the baby challenge is featured, the Islanders all verbalize their want for children in the future and that’s totally ok! But I wish there were more Islanders who could be just as vocal about not wanting children because I feel like it’s just such a taboo thing still to be an adult and not have or want kids. I was really happy the girls were confident in their decisions, but I don’t feel like it’s widely accepted. Am I overthinking this or imagining there’s an issue here when there isn’t?",

When people say, “I just can’t believe he’s attracted to her,” I actually don’t doubt that he is. What I do doubt is his character. I don’t think he’s a good person. And honestly, if he were a Black man, I know the backlash would be far worse. The way he acted on the show was unacceptable, he got away with things that were honestly disgusting. He came off as manipulative and slimy, and yet people keep giving him the benefit of the doubt. I think Olandria deserves better and I’m tired of Nicolandria. I wish she was with someone better. None of the men this season were good, all extremely misogynistic and slimy.",

      "content_preview": "For context: I just finished watching episode 60. I started watching Love Island Uk series 12 a little late this year and I was confused why everyone loved Shakira. I didn't get the best vibes off of her in the first episodes but I am always so open to changing my opinions on Islanders because I love a good least-to-favorite arc (Maura Higgins, Jess from season 1, Harriet). She never ever grew on me. I'll give two reasons why 1) So her and Toni claim that they were isolated by the other girls (Meg, Megan, Helena) from week 1, but my roommates and I all got the same vibe that Toni and Shakira were cold. I always got the vibe from Shakira that she is better than every other girl there; this proved to be true, at least in the case of Helena when she called her a \"good time girl\". Her and Toni becoming friends (at least at first) was out of connivence. Yes, the girls were absolutely threatened by Shakira, but I don't think Shakira gave off a welcoming vibe necessarily. So I think that's how the cookie crumbled with the divide; like it was always present. 2) The shit-talking. Yes, ALL the girls are shit talking. I love shit-talkers. This is reality TV and I want drama. But omg Shakira and Toni are so hypocritical about talking-shit and being mean girls. They definitely do talk more shit than Meg and Helena, I don't think anyone can deny that (at least, production has shown us way more content of Shakira, Toni and Yasmin gossiping/ bad mouthing people). I just think they're very hypocritical about it when they hear other people talking shit about them AND I think when they get called out for talking behind people's backs they use \"being real\" as an excuse to be fucking mean. I feel like a lot of people hide behind being \"real\" to really just being able to say anything about and to anyone. I am just..... not seeing what y'all are seeing? Like I feel like my opinions of the Islanders usually aligns with the public's as well, but it seems that everyone really likes Shakira, Toni, and Yasmin. I feel like I'm missing something...... but I know I'm not, lol. Also I'm not saying Meg isn't a mean girl either and doesn't also talk shit, but I think the other girls are just more unlikeable than her.",

Shakira taking Harry back after leading another girl on for weeks. That wouldn’t fill me with genuine hope. Toni only took Cash back because there was no one else after Harrison left, let’s face it. And then you have the families. Shakira’s mother doesn’t like Harry (if you remember the family episode?) Dejon’s brother on TikTok about Meg, and Cash’s sister showing her dislike for Toni also in the family episode. I don’t see any of them lasting outside. And they kept flip flopping between each other. I couldn’t remember who was with who 🙃",

She took Harry out of his bed he was in with Shakira  NO girl code . Asking if he wanted to f888 her ,She started that convo and others .How many times after he finished it did she keep saying \"I need to talk to Harry and tell him im done\" Each time she just wanted him to change his mind and she would not have cared about Shakira .Not a nice person .",
