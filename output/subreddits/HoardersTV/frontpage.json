There used to be this one episode me and my friend were obsessed with because the mother (hoarder) was just super awful. She’d sit in an armchair surrounded by trash, clutching a trash grabber she’d occasionally poke around the place with, all whilst ordering her poor kids around to make her food etc. The kitchen was full of what turned out to be deadly spiders, and if I remember correctly, the lady also had a medical condition which required the use of needles and she just threw them on the ground after use?! Honestly this woman was just the absolute worst, I felt so sorry for her poor kids. I’m going to assume the video with the episode was taken down, and it’s been years and I just can’t find it. I don’t suppose anybody knows the title or has a link to anywhere I can watch it for free in the UK? I’m desperate to relive the horror.",

I was curious because I always thought of my mother as a bit of a hoarder. However the show I am watching (3 seasons in) seems to be more of a How Clean is Your House? (British series) situation than what I think of as hoarding??? 🤔 I hear 'hoarding' and I think of someone who never wants to run out of water or toilet paper or beans and has cases and cases of the stuff. I think of someone who has a ton of a certain thing because it's bought on a good deal. I think of someone like my mother who has a drawer full of nuts, bolts, nails, screws, and washers 'just in case', a collection of broom and mop handles just in case another gets broken, file folders filled with her bills from the electric and water companies dating back to 1977 so that she can prove she always paid her bills...even though I keep telling her that if she owed them they would be sure to put it on her current bill. Growing up I was never allowed to throw away any clothes I outgrew or any of my books because either I or someone else 'could use them one day'. Fashion be damned I guess 😂  I even had to keep my toys in case some child visited and wanted a toy to play with. Despite that our house was clear and immaculately clean. In the case of my room I would hide and sneak old stuff out and have to hide it in the bottom of the garbage to be able to get rid of it. I guess I was expecting to see a lot more of that. What I'm watching seems to be people who have shut down on house cleaning. They live amongst vermin, animal hair and faeces, dust and mold in quite large quantities with tons of things just piled higgledy piggledy everywhere - clothes, old pizza and food boxes, empty soda bottles etc. Sir Patrick (S3E2) is the most different one I've seen so far as he basically just has collections that overtook his house and life... Just curious if anyone was expecting something different when they first watched this...",

Either one of the therapists, organizers, or the hoarders and their families themselves? What were they like? Carl (S13 E4) actually took place in the downtown of the city I grew up in. I never actually saw him or his house, but my 6th grade history teacher actually lived pretty close to him, and she actually saw the hoard for years, as well as the days the crew came to clean it out! I paid a visit to St. Louis last Thanksgiving and I walked past the mansion from Carol’s episode (S11 E1), as well as through the rest of that gorgeous neighborhood. I wish I’d met the Halloran family, too, but regrettably they didn’t own the house anymore, and it was also a holiday, so I didn’t wanna bother anyone lol. I’ve heard from people on here that Dorothy is just as, if not an even bigger sweetheart than she is on the show, and that she doesn’t hesitate to give out free hugs (which I wouldn’t mind). Same goes for Matt, but I’ve often heard that most of the therapists are fairly withdrawn from participating in the cleanup and only interact when cameras are on, but people have said that they are often nice.

I spent half the episode yelling at the TV, \"because SHE'S AUTISTIC YOU IDIOTS!\" Please tell me somebody else out there noticed this. I actually adored Coral and feel like, if they could have recognized this and operated from that understanding, the whole episode could have not only been handled much differently, but also have been an opportunity to show/teach their viewers about the connections between neurodivergence and hoarding behaviors. I just feel like something that was painfully obvious to me, should have been noticed by licensed and experienced professionals",

That’s an INSANE amount of clothes to wash in order to be donated. Once again, anything that would need laundering would have been discarded. So are things just done differently in Canada?

Most youtubers doing this work are not even licensed therapists and they're so good at calming and counselling the hoarders. Then why is this team of professionals not able to. They just cry for them and shout at them. They come in with this huge overwhelming team and start with their job. The hoarders is told they have 2 days and they need to start throwing atuff out. Can't they take an hour to counsel them first about how they can keep xyz stuff and must let go of boxes and broken or scratched out stuff. One lady said she'll keep a brown box for art projects and the guy starts yelling at her. Like sir, she's mentally unwell and highly overwhelmed. The only thing he had to say was, lady there's 1000s of boxes here and you can keep the last 5 if you want them but let's first focus on letting go. Youtubers who work with hoarders will go there 2 days and help one room at a time, then another 2 days next month for next room and likewise. These guys will tell them their entire house plus 12 storage units get 2 days. Youtubers take time to help them with the overwhelming sentiments, these guys start shouting or crying themselves. This seems like they're not their to help but create max drama for trp sakes. Its addictive watching it but also annoying.",

For those who don't remember, she was the woman who hoarded Bath and Body Works and Christmas stuff, and her husband was DM1. All he wanted was a clear path and she just didn't care. It was all about her, and she actually had the audacity to scream at him for not wanting to risk gangrene! She was completely insufferable, but I feel like Dr. Tompkins and the organizer (I think it was Standolyn) did a really poor job on this episode. Unless it didn't make it into the final edit of the show, NO ONE asked her how she feels about her husband's health, what would happen if he lost a foot or limb because of her nonsense, and also no one mentioned that there was NO WAY she could use all that BBW stuff. Even if she used 1/10th of a bottle of all that shower gel a day (and that's being overly generous), she'd never get through it. She could probably burn candles 24/7 for a year and not get through them all for a looooong time. No one mentioned that. No one suggested she donate some of the products to a women's shelter or something. It just infuriated me that there was so little confrontation with her, no one seemed to put any pressure on her. She was one of the hoarders that really deserved to sweat a bit. And I haven't been able to find any updates. But I'm guessing her husband didn't grow a spine and leave her. EDIT: I know Anne is super unpopular, and I definitely have no sympathy for her. But I really feel like the doctors and the organizers were lazy on this one.",

      "content_preview": "Title says it all. I went down the rabbit hole, did some digging, and found comments from Carol's family, information and additional background to the whole story in the hopes of dispelling some rumors and answering some questions... Carol’s Financial Fuckery: When Carol and Dave were married, she had herself added to the deed of the house (and presumably the bank account he used to share with Be). She convinced him to sign almost everything over to her. Dave, still heartbroken over his first wife’s death, and assuming he could trust Carol, was not the first person she had done this sort of thing to, hence why it came so easily to her. She took out the 2nd mortgage under Dave’s name in 2014. The storage units that Carol was paying for with Dave’s money, as mentioned by her stepdaughter-in-law, she eventually lost access to after the family cut her off, and everything inside was auctioned/thrown out/donated. One of the two houses she was, once again, using Dave’s money to pay for, actually belonged to the son she lived with. The other house she lost ownership of, everything was thrown out and the house went up on the market. The Hoarding: Carol had always been a hoarder, and was one even at the music shop she used to work at. The house on the episode just happened to be the third one she had hoarded up completely. The hoarding started fairly quickly, but didn’t get bad until around year 10 of her living in the house (circa 2009). Matt was able to go over once or twice as a child and was able to get into the kitchen, but that was just about it. The family, as Missy said so in the episode, had done some of the cleanup prior to the filming, and they did have to clear some degree of an area in order for the crew to set up and film in. They cleared the driveway of 5 hoarded cars, and cleaned up the front porch and the foyer on their own, and it took 5 dumpsters and an entire summer. Why did Dave and the family not stop it sooner? Be’s death jolted the entire family + town, and Dave and the whole family were raw and wracked with grief when Carol, a supposed friend of the family, including the deceased wife, moved in. Carol isolated Dave from everyone. The kids assumed that they were giving him space by staying away. And then he chose her over them and the hurt pushed them further. And after a while, the family wasn’t allowed inside the house at all. Any time they wanted to see Dave, it had to be someplace else. They would call him ahead of time and tell him that they wanted to visit, and he would usually tell them to meet him at his favorite restaurant. But Dave did this mostly because he was embarrassed. Being a fireman, he knew how much of a hazard the house had become, but he was passive (and being controlled by Carol, as said in the episode), getting increasingly ill, and just couldn’t stop it. In 2010, Dave was diagnosed with leukemia and just didn’t have the strength to deal with the hoard after that. Basically, he just laid dying in the mess until the family decided to “drop by” unannounced one day. When they saw that he had no way of getting to his kitchen or bathroom and realized he needed out immediately. So they removed him from the house and began working on getting him to more appointments and fixing his finances that Carol had obliterated. Carol wasn’t even living there, and hadn’t been for several years, but she had neighbors who would call her every time they saw Kevin’s car in the driveway, so she would show up and start screaming at him. This same sort of thing happened when Matt and a friend of his were getting photos of the house to send to Hoarders, whose producers asked they get as many photos of the house as possible to see if it was a good candidate for the show. The 3rd floor: Carol was most likely bitching about the third floor initially because she forgot what she put up there, since it was one of the first places in the house she filled up with stuff. The stuff that was in that floor were the remaining Halloran family heirlooms that she didn’t sell, and photos of the family, the frames of which (the ones on desks, shelves and tabletops, not on the walls) Carol had replaced with photos of herself and her own family. The main room in the middle, Kevin’s room, had tubs full of these in the closet, as well as his old military uniforms and high school sports jerseys. While Matt was getting photos for the show, he gathered what he thought was important (tubs of family records and photos) for his dad, took photos, and climbed back down the hoard. Carol’s behavior: While not quite to the extent that was on the show, Carol always had a very mean and manipulative streak. The reason the family had to call Hoarders in the first place was because Carol was so hard to talk to or interact with. Matt didn’t spend much time around her ever, but it was enough to know that she had always been a battle axe. There were definitely times when she was deliberately provoked , but it was mostly all of her own volition. In contrast to many subjects on the show, Carol was actually a little more tame when the cameras were around, which didn’t even capture some of her most exciting outbursts , like when she defended her mini-hoard on the porch from Kevin with a rusty kitchen knife. Was Matt being deadnamed? In an essence. Matt had come out as transgender a few months prior to filming (that hat you saw him wearing he got at his first pride festival). Kevin and Missy (his parents) had a hard time with it at first and were still coming to terms with things when they started filming the show. Matt wasn't even supposed to be on the episode, but he showed up the third day of filming to help clean stuff and take care of his grandfather. Matt did make sure to change his name in a way that was accurate to his grandmother’s in her honor, because she is someone who is highly respected in the family and community. He’s even using the initials that she used, “M.B.H”; Her full name was Mary Elizabeth, but she just used “Be” (derived from Beth), so he’s using the B instead of the E just like she did. Where was Carol’s own family? According to her biological granddaughter, it was more than just her son she lived with that didn’t show up. She has three sons and a daughter that all did not show up because she had terrible relationships with all of them. As stated by her great-niece, Carol was very emotionally abusive to her father and mother (Carol’s nephew and niece-in-law), and would often criticize her great niece for being related to her mother, and then act like nothing happened. It’s safe to say that her own children suffered through the same thing… No one cared about her getting better because she has fucked over every single person in her life and they were all sick of it. She only had a relationship with the son she lived with, and the other two want absolutely nothing to do with her, and her daughter doesn’t either. That’s why they, and the rest of her family didn’t bother showing up either. It’s worth noting, though, that the son she lived with and her daughter accepted large sums of money from Carol following Be's death and Kevin and his brothers received no monetary compensation whatsoever after her death. The Hallorans are, however, quite fond of her other two sons and speak to them often. Did the family really want her back afterwards? Matt said that them, or at least him, being so happy for Carol to move back in turned into acting towards a certain point at the end of filming. They all hated her. Dave, as we saw, didn’t even look her in the eye or sound happy when he said that he wanted her back, and his heart still belonged to Be. The last year or so of his life, when he moved in with Kevin and Missy, he never once talked about Carol, whom he was perfectly content to live apart from, but 80% of the time, he was telling Matt and his girlfriend, Emily, stories about the love of his life. That’s all he cared about, even to the end, he was just excited to be with her again. (the other 20% was firefighting stories and trains, btw) At the end of that week, however, they had really reached some sense of peace with Carol, or at least Matt had. He was picking her up and driving her home every day, and they got some extra off camera time to talk about things and she seemed truly happy about the way life was working out for Matt and his brother, and also shared some really helpful family information with them when Matt was asking genealogical questions around the time Dave’s health took a nosedive. The Aftermath: As we all saw in the post-script, Dave’s health took a severe downturn shortly after the filming, and he stayed in the hospital until he passed away about 2 months later, so he was never able to go back to the house, unfortunately. He is, however, buried next to his beloved first wife, like he wanted. The last time any of the family saw Carol was at Dave’s funeral. They were all pretty cordial with her, but she was still her same old self. She had some nice things to say about the eulogy Matt gave, but that was just about it. He wished her the best and knew that would probably be it. In February of 2021, Carol had a stroke and died. When they finished filming Hoarders, the family still had a lot to clear out from the attic, the basement, and the 2-car garage. It took them a while to clean up the rest, but once they did, the house had become too financially stressful to hold onto because the mortgages and repairs were too expensive, so it had to be sold by the end of the year. In March of 2020, a local redesign company purchased the home for $75,000, refurbished it over a two year long process, and sold it to another family in March of 2022. It was sold once again in December of 2023 for almost $400K. The family trauma will obviously still be there, but the whole experience tremendously healed the Hallorans. They learned to communicate and listen better than they ever would have before. They still keep up with some of the producers and talk about it as an embarrassing but also much needed helpful and healthy experience they all didn't know they needed. Be's Old Convertible: Carol actually used her old boss to find someone to buy it , and that someone just happened to be an old friend of the Hallorans who had no idea why Carol was selling the car and thankfully wanted to keep it safe. It still resides with them in the old neighborhood. Matt has not gotten the car back yet, and unfortunately doesn’t foresee acquiring it any time soon because life right now is too tumultuous for him to be able to put energy and money into getting it and fixing it back up. He does hope that life levels out to a point where he can seek it out again, but he’s not terribly pressed about it anymore. He’s just happy that the house is filled with life and joy again, and that his family has had the closure to move on. Regarding the down payment the crew gave him for it, he actually never cashed the check. He said it just didn’t feel right, like everyone was overcompensating for him. Bonus (the story): The story, compared to what was portrayed on the show, is a lot more rich and interesting than people would think … But in what ways? Dare I ask? Shoutout and special thanks to each and every one of the Redditors who were brave enough to make these comments and shed some light on the situation. Especially (sorry for the notif): - u/matthewbhal - u/emilyorien - u/ameliadams -@Chlochloeee_ (YouTube) - u/faolanpup It takes guts to talk about/reveal these kinds of things and trauma like the kind that Carol put you all, your families & loved ones through. You have my utmost sympathy, and I pray that you are able to heal from the worst of this and find peace, especially now that the old hag is dead and hopefully paying for her sins down in Hell. Enjoy, everyone! ETA: The downvotes are obviously people who can’t get their heads out of their arses and accept that Carol is the one who is in the wrong and is the greater of the two evils. That, or Carol‘s Reddit account in Hell.",

She spends the entire episode talking about what she can get for something and how she has people lined up to buy things on her property. I kinda wish that someone would shout out \"NO YOU DON'T!  IF YOU DID, YOU'D HAVE SOLD THIS CRAP ALREADY!\"",

In the introduction of the episode the organizer&doctor commented that Donald would be the most difficult. I mean on the surface it makes sense to start with the most challenging part, but the organizer & doctor always say that they waste time when the hoarder isn’t making a good decision. (Because there are only 4 days to clean) I wonder if the organizer & doctor didn’t want to go to Donaldʼs house first and they were pressured by the producers/network to do so.",

My memory is a little foggy, but from what I remember, The woman had a garage that had an RV in it and a lot of stuff and she was hoping to sell that stuff for a couple hundred thousand dollars. And the psychiatrist or somebody else confided to the camera that there was no way that they would sell for that much. Like I said, my memory is pretty foggy. If anyone can help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.",

Both do have hoards with human fecal matter amongst them and are most likely crippled with serious cognitive defects, I will say that. I mean, when Shanna is mentioned on this subreddit, we needn’t say anything about how bad her hoard is. She was awful, I will say that, but at least she put her poop in jugs and in buckets (presumably in private) in a house with broken plumbing. LINDA, on the other hand, was pooping on the FLOOR and in cups IN FRONT OF HER GRANDCHILDREN, whom she HANDED THEM TO when she was done, even in a house with FUNCTIONAL PLUMBING.",
