I just started on my next project but I’m genuinely so lost when it comes to writing for front ensemble. Generally, I can just transcribe the music and arrange it to fit the drum corps style. However, with front ensemble, there’s not a lot of material to work with. It’s as if you’re practically writing it from scratch in the context of what’s already been arranged. So not only is there that, but I have no clue how each instrument functions in the context of the entire ensemble. What are marimbas primary purpose compared to vibraphones? What instruments outside of mallet instruments are even in the front ensemble? I know next to nothing so I’m asking here for help. I tried finding books on front ensemble arranging but I don’t see many promising ones that are relevant to drum corps. If you have sheet music from your marching band or drum corps that I could look at I’d appreciate it! Any info at all is very appreciated though! Thanks :)",

      "content_preview": "tl;dr I am pretty sure drum corps is almost solely responsible for my lower back issues. Anyone else? I marched long-ish ago (apparently) and at the time, the dominant approach to posture (and teaching posture) was an extreme forward presence with almost no weight on the heels. There was really no emphasis on pelvic orientation and, of course, moving the weight of the body forward naturally results in an anterior pelvic tilt. So anyway, in my mid-30s and I’ve been fighting off lower back and hip related issues. I’ve also assumed my feet have always been almost flat but I actually can’t remember being aware of that fact in college. So my wife sends me this video: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1b8yEz6Tt9/?mibextid=wwXIfr And when they draw the posture line showing the alignment of the body and start explaining how this is related to a flat arch and therefore any number of THE SAME ISSUES I AM DEALING WITH, I was like, “Whoa. That is EXACTLY how I was taught to stand in drum corps.” So twofold question… Anyone else that marched in that 2000s era have similar issues or noticed similar things? Is that extreme “forward presence” still being taught today? I see less folks in the arc leaning forward and pushing their hips back the same I can vividly picture drum corps in the era I marched.",

Sure there are some all-ages corps, but often not convenient or practical for many of us. Consider checking out drumming in a pipe band.  Many bands are in need of drummers. No age limits! The time involvement can be quite minimal depending upon the level of the band and your desires. People in pipe bands tend to be busy professionals, students, and even retired people. And no big tour fees! If you are unfamiliar with pipe bands, they aren't all like the parade bands or some of the ceremonial bands sponsored by Shriners, police and fire departments.  Some of them take their music very seriously. For examples of the higher levels of the art https://www.facebook.com/rhythmmonsterllc The art form is quite challenging! I am actually involved with bands in the Denver area in need of drumming so I would love to talk with you. If you live somewhere else,  will gladly facilitate putting you in touch with a band in your area.",

I’m talking about the short, staccato “Blue!” that members themselves yell on the field as part of their shows. Does anyone know when the corps first started doing this in their performances? Was it tied to a specific show, a certain caption head, or just something that organically became part of the performance style? If you marched or remember seeing an early example, I’d love to know the first year you heard it. Thanks in advance!",

This past weekend, they had the Pepsi Battle of the Bands. Later this year, they will have the Honda Showcase. Fortune 50 companies are sponsoring these events. DCI has gone from being broadcast on national TV to paying to broadcast on ESPN. Now being streamed online. Streaming is the future, or present. But TV brings in people who don't know the activity. That's how I found out about it. To my knowledge, DCI doesn't have any major sponsors outside the activity. Asian and South American units are growing at a great rate. And they all march indoors. It reduces cost with less equipment. Why is it growing in these areas and not in America? What can DCI and the activity learn from others?",
