Two scenes stood out to me: after the trek to Alice’s soccer match ( which itself has magical overtones), Donny finds Jimmy out of the blue? At a high school soccer game where he has no personal connection Then of course, the climax with Jimmy and Louis. Jimmy just happens to show up at the right train stop at the right time? So yes, I love the show, but let me know if there’s something I am missing from these two scenes to make them more realistic",

I don’t know if it’s because I have such an attachment to his Roy character but I never saw him as the “bad guy” on this show (though I’m not sure you’re ever actually supposed to), I always felt love and compassion for him.

To preface, I haven't really stretched my critical thinking skills since high school, so this might just be me out of my depth here. I don't understand what I'm seeing. I enjoy the wholesomeness, I like the feel-good nature of the show (I really liked Ted Lasso for that reason) but I don't know the message I should be getting here. It seems like the show is saying that his unethical practices are working? I'm definitely skeptical, but I don't know if I'm skeptical of the show for pushing that message, or if I'm skeptical of the character because the show is about to show the consequences, and I just have missed the storytelling signposts of that. Edit: I don't know if I articulated what I'm feeling. I feel like the show isn't going anywhere particularly. Like I just can't see the direction it's leading me. You watch Star wars for the first time and you get all these signposts that set your expectations that the hero is about to go on a journey, but I cannot for the life of me tell where the show is going.",

Maybe like taking the baby was her Jimmy-ing her patient a bit by going outside the client therapist relationship and She had been impacted by jimmy as opposed to being super caring all along",
