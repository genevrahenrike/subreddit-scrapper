      "content_preview": "Hey. This is a question for lategame. Paragon 221 on Eternal Realm, 5 boards, glyphs at 46. I have 3 Aspect slots: Amulet, Ring and Focus. I'm trying to figure out what to use for an Ice Shards build. I've concluded that without Aspect of Frozen Memories, my pure Ice build is unplayable. Therefore, I will be using that one. The question remains what to slot into the other two, and which one to put on the Amulet. My current choice is: Aspect of Frozen Memories (Amulet) Elementalist Aspect (Ring; this gets me to 98% crit when above 100 mana) Aspect of Piercing Cold (Focus; this one also seems like a must have) Other Aspects I have considered include Storm Swell, but I am not sure how the damage there works. Would it work as a global multiplier? There isn't a single mention of it on the very long but ultimately not very useful Maxroll Detailed Damage Guide. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",

      "content_preview": "Hello. I'm fairly new to this game so I thought I'd share my stats and gather opinions. The reason I'm asking is because my damage output feels a bit underwhelming. I've recently reached Torment 4 on the Eternal Realm playing an Ice Shards sorcerer with only ice skills on the action bar. That's the build and also the theme I want to stick to. I was just reading through the skills and paragon boards as I played the game, and took what seemed like it would maximize my damage output. A lot of the builds online are suggesting skipping Legendary nodes on the paragon boards and going for dex and crit, but trying those builds made me struggle a lot more at the same level of difficulty. Perhaps it was an issue of gear, I don't know. Anyway, what do you think about these numbers? Are they too low for Paragon 221? I've recently cleared Pit 55 (T4 unlock), and I can do some Lair Bosses on T3, but I mostly do them on T2 (few hits and they die). I can share more info upon request. https://imgur.com/a/IfBIyXd Gear is basically: Hail of Verglas, Raiment of the Infinite, Fists of Fate, Iceheart Brais, Penitent Greaves/Esu's Heirloom/Yen's Blessing, Azurewrath, Storm Swell Gorilla's Eye, Blue Rose, Captive Stone of Piercing Cold, Jade Relic of Frozen Memories. I have 165 Mana and the build revolves around spamming Ice Shards (level 12) and relying on Vulnerability from the weapon and passives like Avalanche (upgraded with Aspect of Frozen Memories), Glass Cannon (6/3), Snap Freeze (3/3) and Frigid Breeze (6/3). The boots give me an extra 23% against chilled targets. Weapon and focus have the 40% chance to do cold damage (innate to the weapon and on the focus via tempering). Paragon boards: Base board, Frigid Fate, Icefall, Enchantment Master and Fundamental Release. Glyphs: Warding, Elementalist, Winter, Tactician, Eliminator. All upgraded to level 46.",

      "content_preview": "Hi. New player here. I need some help understanding some things because I never played a Diablo game before, and Diablo 4 is not very good at providing information to the player via the UI. I have two questions regarding this. First of all, if on my skill bar I can see Ice Shards has a 28% lucky hit chance, and in my Stats panel I see my Lucky Hit Chance Bonus is 75%, does that mean I'm capped with regards to Lucky Hit (if all I use for damage is Ice Shards)? Second question: does lucky hit do anything inherently with Ice Shards? Or, to put it another way: if I don't have any gear or passive skill that does something on a lucky hit, would I benefit at all from when my Ice Shards hit \"luckily\"? Thank you.",

And I am tired of my hydra, hated pulverize druid and got bored of Fell Soothsayer never activate on pit bosses. I have decent gear, a 4ga asswrath with 3 crits on cold damage, 2ga axial (hit twice and DR), 1ga FOF with 2 crits on lhc, aspect 295. Mythics 1ga, tal rasha 25% GA CDR. 2ga int/inner flames with non-GA glass canon. I have 2 mw crits on most implrant stats, and 3 on weapon, as mentioned. I do pit 97 now, with 3-4mins left, my glyphs are 97-98, self-made with this build. I will be able to do pit 100 with better masterwork, but man this build feel weak compared to my hydra. And worse, it's squishy AF. My Lurkin burn hydra can survive a nuclear war, but my CL dies from poison ground stuff, and the lilith things in boss fight, unless I am really careful. I made a rookie mistake and landed 2 crits on glass cannon, it got better when I moved them to inner flames. And it helped when I got pants with GA DR. The build works perfectly for speedy farming, the Shako version. But I am disappointed about the Heir version for pit push. I thought it would be a bit stronger, and not thaaat squishy Is my experience how the build is, or am I just rusty playing shock builds?",

I'm not much into spending a minute trying to kill a bunch of elites. So basically I use Hydra build, just that: hydra is what I think is my main source of damage, casting Ice shield usually up all the time, Ice Blade always on cooldown and familiars. Ultimate only on bosses. I tried mekuma's but I don't like having to cast Ice shards while occasionally throwing a Hydra. That's kind of my style of play, with that in mind, usually I start with Fireball enchantment (teleport is always the other one) since I like to see a bunch of mobs chained blowing up. When I use familiar it feels to me that I have to spend probably 1 more second killing a bunch of mobs (yeah, first world problems right?) and I can see them spawning probably 1 every 10 hydra casts or so, meanwhile I can keep casting them and have probably 2 or 3 most of the time. So that's my question, how much of a difference makes having Familiar instead of Fireball as enchantment? I even been trying Chain Lightning as Enchantment. I guess I'd like to know how much better is Familiar as Enchantment. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I started about 2 weeks ago and have about 40ish hours on my character. Paragon 212. Playing an unoptimized hydra build entirely solo. I would like to continue to just play the game solo and improve but have hit the dreaded gear wall. Frustrated by the fact that the game essentially forces you to trade on a 3rd party site to improve your gear at a certain point. And youre selling your items for gold you cant really acquire yourself, its obviously farmed by bots or duped somehow. I have about 400m just by playing but thats nowhere near enough to really buy much of anything on Diablo Trade. So youre spending your time on doing something tedious on a 3rd party website instead of playing. Selling things for illegal gold, to buy duped runes, items and summon mats to be able to farm to improve your gear. Its just such a broken system. I really dont understand why the devs arent doing something about it",
