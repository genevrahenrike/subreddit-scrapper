Every other contractor I knew said PSLF wouldn’t apply to them because they worked for for-profit companies. I assumed the same. But in my case, I was actually hired through a non-profit institute that partnered with a for-profit contractor. The non-profit was my official employer (something I sought out intentionally, since the non-profit worked on behalf of public education causes), though the arrangement always felt a bit muddied. It only dawned on me a month ago that those  22 months at the non-profit did qualify for PSLF. I submitted everything I needed--and it counted! That means I’m now just 4 months away (January 2026) from 120 payments, instead of 2 years and 6 months away. :-D",

It has shown up in my account for almost a year. My save litigation forbearance period with r2rr didnt count for pslf. Meanwhile, after I switched to IBR (w/ r2rr), the tracker has counted two zero dollar payments with zero percent interest rate as pslf eligible. I'm at 118/120 and have to make two real payments to finish. Is this r2rr thing going to mess up the last two payments? Should I call and try to remove it? Otherwise the account just says in repayment/IBR and generates monthly bills (now ~$300) but with a zero percent interest rate.",

Was sent around 2:30 pm. It was for 7 SAVE months (starting July 2024- Jan 2025). I was at 113 QPs at the time the SAVE forbearance started. I did not request to buyback any non-SAVE months. The monthly buyback amount was listed was “Repaye” and was almost on the dot what I had been paying monthly before the forbearance kicked in. I originally submitted for the buyback in Feb 2025 and was assigned case # beginning with 269. Since then, I submitted additional reconsideration requests with the last one being assigned a 304 case number. I submitted multiple feedbacks, all came back with the usual “we’re working on it” and closed out the next day except the last one which I submitted on 7/26. Has remained opened since. They did not request tax information (I’m assuming bc I was on an IBR plan pre-Save) Thank you to everyone on here for sharing your experiences and advice. Don’t lose hope!! Also, take breaks from reading posts on here. I was starting to lose my marbles.",

My job still remains PSLF eligible and I plan to stay there for the long term To my understanding SAVE/PAYE is or eventually will be dead and we need to switch to either IBR vs RAP, which it looks like needs to happen by or on July 2026? And IBR, in more cases than not, should still be a cheaper monthly option to RAP? At this point I'm missing 15 payments due to the forebearance. Assuming I go onto IBR now, once I get to 105/120 I should have the option to buyback those 15 months? What are the advantages of just holding it out until we get forced off vs getting onto IBR now?",

I’m sharing my experience in the hope that it helps someone else—or at least gives them the energy to keep going. My loans were forgiven in January 2025. At that time, I was informed that I would be receiving a refund because I had overpaid for a year and a half. Like I said, I didn’t know I was eligible. Mohela was my servicer. I tried calling them about the refund, but I could never get through. I sent messages through their website but always got the same response: 90–120 days. Today, eight months later, I got a check in the mail! It feels amazing to finally be done with this. Thank you all for the information you've shared throughout this journey—it kept me going. To everyone still on this path: keep fighting. I’m rooting for you!",

I've considered jumping off SAVE so I can get back to progress towards forgiveness, but... I can't shake the feeling that riding it out in SAVE is an act of defiance at this point. The administration clearly wants us off SAVE. So, even though it is clearly futile and no one probably cares much at all, I'm just going to park right here in limbo until limbo no longer exists. I'm going to make the big, stupid, scary \"them\" figure out what to do with me. I'm not doing a damn thing to make any of their jobs easier. Meaningless? Probably. But there's value in even the smallest fight, even if we lose. Anyways, as a long time lurker, just wanted to add this perspective for anyone in the same boat. You aren't alone.",

My undergrad loans have been certified for PSLF since I started repayment. There are 5 in total that have \"47 payments remaining\" until forgiveness (I did a Master's program and my payments automatically deferred during that time and did not count toward forgiveness). I took out student loans to pay for my doctoral program and have another 5 or so loans from that that have 90-110 payments left on them because I did that program much more recently and have not made many qualifying payments. I just switched from the old SAVE plan to the PAYE plan and originally left my loans un-consolidated (all are direct). That leaves me with half of them being paid off in 4 years and half being paid off in 9-10. When I do the repayment simulator it suggests I consolidate and shows that my one big loan would be eligible for forgiveness in 2033 (8 years) because it seems like it averages out the forgiveness period. Is this worth doing so I can just be DONE with this in 8 years, or will I end up costing myself some money? The estimated payment is exactly the same un-consolidated as it is under the suggestion for consolidation because both are based on my income. Please help. Thanks!",

I am 102, (probably like 112 with buyback). I just want to be done. The amount that Borrower’s Defense would forgive is like- $300 of my nearly $100k balance.  So basically I don’t even care about it. I’ve reached out to Mohela about how I can get back into repayment and haven’t heard anything. The forbearance says it’s until 2040. Strong chance I may even not be alive then. This is so frustrating. Has anyone had luck getting out of this forbearance?",

My payments, of course, stopped being tallied in March. I think this is pretty common right now. I did my employer verification in August, which was emailed to my employer (it's just the 2 of us, I work for a non-profit that small, so we have many regular check-ins). The employer verification signature was emailed to my boss as \"Signature request expired\" at the bottom - so she couldn't sign. On my end, it says my employer has 50 days to verify my employment. I've tried resending the email because that is an option, but it never gets sent. Any advice on what to do here? I thought I'd verify in August, so then I could do the final verification in September and request to have my loans forgiven. This issue has never happened to me before with any previous employer. Do I cancel the request and start over? Call the DoED? I'm so close - shoot, even my boss is excited for me. Please help!",

      "content_preview": "https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-15665.pdf Summary of draft regs: TLDR:  they pretty much kept the final proposal language we ended with in the meeting in June with the exception of going back to \"preponderance of the evidence versus \"clear and convincing\" evidence So if this goes through as written today an employer that was deemed to have engaged in substantial illegal activity on or after July 1, 2026 would lose their PSLF eligibility after that date.  To be clear, the activity would have to be illegal under state or federal law, the activity itself would have to happen after July 1 2026 and the employer would have an opportunity to defend themselves and/or put in a corrective action plan prior to losing eligibility.  No past PSLF counts would be removed from a borrower working for that employer.  The borrower would be warned if the employer was at risk and then notified if the employers eligibility was removed.  The employer can get their eligibility back after 10 years (that's one change from where we left off - it was five years) or if they submit a corrective action plan accepted by the ED. The proposal by the ED would allow the ED to remove an employer from PSLF eligibility if they found that said employer engaged in \"substantial illegal activity\" around immigration laws, terrorism, medical transgender activities on children, child trafficking, illegal discrimination and violation of state law against trespassing, disorderly conduct, public nuisance, vandalism and obstruction of highways (think protests). The proposal would allow the ED to remove the PSLF status from such an employer if a court found an entity had fit the above, or the entity pleaded guilty and admitted to such things or if there was a settlement where they admitted to such things and finally, and most importantly, if the ED themselves found that the entity had done these things.  This last part is the most concerning. Sadly, they chose not to make any changes to buy back despite the proposal i submitted. I can't emphasize this enough - the actions by the employer would have to be deemed actually illegal under federal or state law and none of this will be retroactive. EDIT to add - see page 88 for the following: \"As explained in the Paperwork Reduction Act section, the Department believes that there would be less than 10 employers affected annually.\"   That doesn't make this proposal right - but I wanted to highlight the scope of this. I still firmly believe that this will go to court and likely get overturned.  The law to me and many others is clear as to the definition of a qualifying government or 501c3 employer and there's no wiggle room for this regulation there. Nothing else about PSLF is changing in this proposal.  It's just the qualifying employer as defined above. Using this post as a place holder so we only have one consolidated post.  I'll add a summary to this later.  I'm going to lock comments for now until the summary is up.  The official version..which will be the same..will be out Monday.  Remember you can submit your own comments once the official is out. You can read my original summary here https://www.reddit.com/r/PSLF/comments/1lr1cun/neg_reg_summary_what_we_might_expect_and_why_i/ I will add the instructions on how to submit public comment when they come out next week to this post.",

In 2025, in a world with instantly-updating checking account balances, Venmo, crypto, blockchain, etc... FSA and MOHELA can't get payment history correct? Of course in practice they'll either (a) figure this out or (b) I'll make one extra monthly payment and get forgiven after 121/120. While others are hopelessly stuck in PSLF limbo for way longer. But really... you can't get the payment history right? We just had to endure a forbearance like 14 months ago so that they could revamp the system. What was that for, if you're still not getting payment histories correct? And by the way, this isn't a government thing, the US Treasury Department does billions of USD per day in receipts/payments of bills/notes/bonds. It's technology we had in like 1980.",

System updates have been implemented to correctly report PSLF eligible payments on a go-forward basis. However, remediation activities are in progress to report prior months and update PSLF payment counts. Affected borrowers will not see updated PSLF payment counts for these missing months until September 2025. In October, if your constituent does not see the PSLF payment counts they are expecting, then they are encouraged to submit a reconsideration request . Please note that submitting duplicate requests through various channels will not update payment counts any sooner and may cause additional delays. This includes sending multiple inquiries through reconsideration requests, complaints with FDMS (Ombudsman), controlled correspondence (letters), and PSLF buyback requests. Best, You may follow up with our office if the portal is not updated in October. Again, thank you for contacting Senator Duckworth. If you have any questions regarding this response or any other matter of federal concern, please do not hesitate to contact me at (312) 886-3506.",

I won’t go through all the work I have done over the past year, except to mention that what finally pushed me across the finish line was due to comment in this PSLF Reddit account. When I submitted my most recent application for a new IDR (application #4) in April, I was not switched into a processing forbearance while they figured out my payment. I submitted a complaint to FSA and asked them to apply the forbearance. That pushed me across the finish line with 121 qualifying payments. While it’s sad that this Reddit channel had better info than the servicer or FSA, it is pretty awesome to see this community of people helping one another. I’m excited to hopefully pay that kindness back by continuing to engage in this chat and hopefully share ideas and insight that can help others reach this same point. I’m very happy, but I’m saving my big celebration (whatever that means, lol) for when my $101K drops off my credit report! And it couldn’t have come at a better time as I am buying a house right now.

      "content_preview": "I have about 70k in federal student loans (hasn't really reduced over the years on IDR), mostly from pre-2014. I was on IDR (I forget exactly which one, I believe it was the 'mid-tier' IDR plan) until Biden's SAVE plan. I applied, obviously it never took off and now we have interest resuming August 1. I figured I should finally look into switching only to find my payments are drastically higher than I expected! My past payments were around $200-250/mo. I know it's been several years so I didn't expect it to stay so low, but I wasn't expecting the cheapest repayment plan to be nearly $700/mo!!! That's more than the original 10-year payment plan was when I first graduated! I'm 37, single, living in rural southern California. I've been planning to finally buy my first house, but with this extra cost there's no way I can afford a mortgage *and* these inflated student loan payments. Right now, it seems like my choice is to either give up on owning a home any time soon, or stay on SAVE and hope some future court case or election changes the situation. What are my options? What can I do? Is there any resource for finding cheaper student loan repayments that I didn't know about? Any class-action lawsuits around the changes applying to existing loans? I haven't had a govt policy change blow up my life plans to this scale before.",

This doesn’t start until July ‘26 and organizations have to be involved in ILLEGAL activity based on federal and state regulations. One or the other is grey area. Thank you to the knowledgeable moderators! Hi Everyone, How are people reacting to Trump’s new rules for PSLF that disqualify employers that offer services to undocumented immigrants and gender affirming care for children/adolescents? This likely applies to me - not sure if I should be looking for a new job, or just praying that the courts will land on my side. I’m 8 years in and do not love my job. It’s already predicted to take an additional several years to get approved once you apply because of the skeleton crew operating the Dept of Ed. I haven’t seen people posting about it so just curious what others’ take on it is.",

That was my 119th payment (technically, my 121st due to the two months of mandatory forbearance last year during the platform switch), and I’m getting nervous about achieving 120. I’d imagined I would be able to fill out the final ECF by 10/26, but at this rate it seems like it may be December before Student Aid’s data is updated. Would be a hell of a Xmas gift, but it’s absurd that it takes this long to sync between these systems. Am I just especially anxious given the proximity to 120 or is this atypically slow? Sure seems like it’s been faster in the past, but maybe it’s a watched pot situation here.",

She can apply for buyback this month, we're just waiting for August to hit her count on student aid. I know buyback is extremely slow. But if we switch to an IDR now, her payments will likely be higher than what the buyback calculation will be. I'm thinking I just keep her in SAVE forbearance and worst case scenario, buyback takes so long she might forced into a new repayment plan. But the less monthly payments she has to make while waiting the better, in my opinion. Anyone have any thoughts/advice or confirmation on receiving a buyback offer while still in forbearance?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I currently owe 51k in federal loans while making 81k in a healthcare setting. I am worried that I am not understanding my situation and stress about PSLF every day. My employer does currently count as qualified for PSLF, but being in Delaware I have a feeling we are at risk to get that taken away given the current administration’s goals (Blue state + offering gender wellness services). I am currently in SAVE forbearance and originally planned on riding this out and then doing buy back, but I’m not even sure if that’s an actual option. I paused at 70/120 payments so my assumption is I can do buyback once I’m forced into another plan and still be done by 2027 (10 years post graduation, I’ve only ever worked in qualifying no profits). I’m feeling a lot of internal pressure to change into a different plan that can restart my qualifying payments, so I’m torn between leaving everything alone or restarting payments. I have two loans at 5.8%, one at 4.66%, and the rest under 4%. I also recently invested my $35k in savings in a HYSA at 3.5%.  I am married but don’t have kids, and think that filing separately may be what I should do. I don’t have many bills, so while restarting payments would take away from putting that money in savings, it may not be completely life shattering if I continue to budget well. All this to say, I feel like I may be in a rare situation of having either option of restarting payments or riding this out as pretty equal. I don’t know which option to go with, so I was hoping this sub could help at least confirm that I’m seeing my situation accurately.",

These are different than in school status or grace. I submitted my first buyback request this year on June 3 and this past Thursday I received my buyback contract with total amount due. I was attempting to buy back 17 payments from 2014 to 2015 that were in school deferment payments.  Those were approved and I did not have to submit tax information. I made a payment the same day and have not yet received green banners. But will update when I do. This is mostly just to share that I truly don’t think that there is any rhyme or reason to how they are processing buybacks. I did submit a reconsideration request in July asking about those specific payments and detailing that I had over 140 months of public service and that I was wanting to specifically buy back those in school deferment. I don’t know if that helped or not. But I think I’m definitely in the minority in regards to having my buyback processed within three months. I do also have 15 months of eligible SAVE payments for buyback but those were not mentioned.",

So looking in my tracker, April thru present payments haven’t counted towards forgiveness. I’m still employed at the same place. I guess what I’m wondering out loud is how the heck green banners work! By my counts I’m at 120.  Do I submit another ECF? I have Edfinancial as a services, fwiw.  Thanks for your help.",

      "content_preview": "I graduated in May 2020 as a teacher and have been one since the 2020/2021 school year. I made payments whenever there’s not been a forbearance. I have approximately $81,000 in loans ($50,000 was mine and $30,000ish was from my son that was once a PPL, but I used the double loophole consolidation when it was available and it now can count toward my PSLF). Right before the second forbearance, I updated my work to show my qualifying payments that included the first forbearance, but I haven’t sent in paperwork since because I keep forgetting. I’m in the SAVE program at the moment. Last time I checked before this last forbearance, I had 42 qualifying payments between the ones I made and the first qualifying forbearance. Am I correct in understanding that this current forbearance doesn’t NOT count toward PSLF? I have a reminder on my phone that says I need to reapply for a new payment plan September 1st (tomorrow), but I can’t remember why I put it in there or when I did. I work for the same school since I graduated college and can easily get the paperwork sent in to prove my months of eligibility, but I’ve not made any payments on my loans since this second forbearance with the courts. I’m so lost about what to do. Should I apply tomorrow for a new payment option, stay with the SAVE until it no longer exists, start repaying on my loan as much as I can since it’s now accruing interest, or what? Even if these last forbearance months wind up not counting, I should have close to 4 years already approved for PSLF. If these last forbearance months DO wind up counting, I’ll be over halfway toward PSLF with my $80,000. I just feel so lost with all of this. I make practically nothing as a teacher, but my husband makes pretty good money—however, we are paying mainly cash for our other two kids’ colleges so they don’t have to worry about having major debt in loans when they graduate. They only take out the $5,000ish they can get on their own as dependent children, as they are both going for teaching and nursing and will get PSLF for those loans. We made the mistake of PPL with my son, hence the $30,000 I had to double consolidate when the loophole was still a thing so it’d count for PSLF with my loans. (Teaching is my second career choice, that’s why my kids’ loans are happening the same time as my own were taken out in my 40s) Please, please help me. I don’t know what steps to take next and this is all so confusing. None of my family went to college, so they’re no help. Thank you SO MUCH in advance. I truly appreciate it.",

The hospital network I work for has hospitals in both NH and MA. I have been reading that the government is trying to take hospitals off the list of qualifying organizations. This is mind boggling to me because healthcare workers make up such a large percentage of the people who go into dept for poorly paying degrees in underserved areas. I still have 6.5 years to go before 120 payments. My PT school loans total $250,000. I feel trapped. I'm confused and pissed off that I might have wasted the past 4.5 years of my life. Can anyone give me hope?",

It’s more of an average I’m assuming because I qualify now for state retirement system (with the assumption I’ll work average 30hrs weekly aka 1200 hrs annually) but actual hrs varies week to week, some being over 30 some under. Is this going to be an issue, or as long as my HR department of the city signs off as approved as I’m working it on average it’ll be okay? Hopefully this makes sense",
