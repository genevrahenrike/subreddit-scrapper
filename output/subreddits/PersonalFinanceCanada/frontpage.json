This, of course, routinely gets debated now with a forward looking lens - are we in a bubble, who can afford to own a home, likely evolution going forward. This article instead looks backwards and crunches the numbers in different cities in Canada over the past 20 years and uncovers that ... it depends.We can debate the methodology, of course, and his specific assumptions. But I think it supports the belief thatNeither financial market investing nor (residential, leveraged) home ownership is a clear winner in long-term return as an asset classWinners have been those who have pursued a disciplined savings and not overly reactive investment strategy...Which as historically been psychologically easier with the forced discipline and lower liquidity of home ownership...But is far from the only way, hasn't necessarily been the best way recently, and so is not the be-all and end-all going forwardOf course, there are unfortunately many Canadians where finding affordable housing (rented or owned) is an immediate-term challenge. This post is focused instead on the received wisdom that somehow the path of home ownership, if only it were attainable, is obviously the preferred one to achieving long-term financial stability. It's more complicated.",

      "content_preview": "As someone who has worked in debt management and in collection for 8 years, some advice.1st Anyone who owes debts: should read collection laws in your province, and you will learn what actions the creditors can take and can't take to recover the balance. As well as under which circumstances you are protected under consumer protection act. For example some provinces if balance owed is less than 5k and some 2k they can't take legal action if the debt is older than 2 years form the date of your last payment they can't take legal action. Any debt older than 6 years can't be collected and should be removed from the credit bureau and so many more ways.2nd, most banks, especially the top 5 banks in Canada they have options that can help you with your debt. For example, if you owe something on your CC and pay normal interest 21%. You can change your visa type to something with lower % and can help you with your monthly payments or freeze you interest for 3-6 months and pay just $10 a month which you can contribute more to bring principal balance down. Banks also offer low interest consolidation loan and pay your debts directly for you but you must qualify for that the pre qualifications is very easy and most people qualify as long as they still hold decent credit score above 450 and don't owe CRA any tax money.Same goes for PLC and mortgages they have few temporarily options that can help you for few months and some long options as well. Just call them to deal with it first before you're acount is assigned to 3rd part collections.3rd If your debts are already sent to collection, make sure what I mentioned on 1st point  read. Since you are already with collections you're credit score is already fucked because after a month or 3 they will report your debt as a collection iteam on your credit under the trade line. At this point you can make the decision to somehow come up with the money to pay or just tell them to fuck off and ignore the calls and emails and letters. Which you can also ask them formaly to stop contacting and they will stop the  calls and emails. If its significant amount they can take legal action( again my 1st point) but most collections they don't want to pay for lawyers fee and go to small claims court. Also when you file is in collection feel free to offer them 50% of original debt as settlement.The older the debts gets there is lower chance of collecting them so they would have Settlement options and it will depend on your negotiation skills how far down you can push them.4th if you Can't pay your debts in full(PIF) or settle it in full (SIF)  and your making small monthly payments that is not doing anything STOP IT you are wasting your money it's like your dropping a stone in ocean it won't do any good for you and Creditors they don't care you will end up paying them and they will continue charging you interest and your principal balance will not be paid off. unless it's some type of arrangement that after some monthly or weekly payments, your debts will be paid off.5th, this is not 100% accurate for everyone it's different with Equifax  and Transunion. Everyone reports to one of these two or both. Any late payments can bring your score down somewhere from between 40-50 it depends, collection iteam around 200 score and how you use your credit and manage your bad and good debts can bring your score down and up, and credit bureau gets updated quarterly. If you read how to utilize your credit after you pay off your debts or you have a bad credit score, it can really help you to build a credit score, so you must read about this too.6th Bankruptcy, consumer proposal is not free, and not everyone will qualify to file it unless someone offers to do it for free for you. Also, if you have income higher than your total owed debt, you can't file, and you can't include any secure debts. Also, if you are a co-signer on an account and one of your files for bankruptcy or consumer proposal, the other person is still liable, and the creditors can come after you to collect. It is best to do debt consolidation if you run out of all options.FYI I just wanted to post this because a lot of people don't know they are protected under consumer protection act and it's always good to know what you can and can't do in case of your debts and where to ask for help.Hope this helpled a little, there is alot more to be said but I don't want it to get too long best to read online and learn ways to get out of debts and manage it better.",

During our conversation the topic change to how best for a single elderly person to protect her nest egg in retirement, how to protect oneself from scammers etc. My friend is pretty financially literate, she has fully invested registered accounts, plus a pension and some investment in non-registered accounts, all filled with low cost etfs. Let's say when she retire at 65 she has a nice nest egg of 3 million (not that much 30 years from now), what is the best way to protect her nest egg in case she becomes disabled, demented, incapacitated, etc? We did not have any good ideas, but she raised the point that even though annuities are poor financial investment, but at least one can convert a lump sum of money into a month payment, making it harder for scammers to take everything at once. What are some good methods for a single elderly to protect her financial nest egg?",

On the buyer’s side, it feels like the value-add is minimal compared to the conflict of interest baked into their commission model.Am I wrong here? Have any of you actually had realtors go to bat for you as a buyer — or are they really just along for the ride until they get paid?Edit 1: Just for context I have worked with 3 different realtors (different purchases) it seems most of them these days are looking for low-hanging fruit...

The TSX performance this year and my upcoming mortgage renewal in the new year has me wondering if it ever makes sense to take your capital gains early and make a lump sum on your mortgage.My HELOC balance is ~$130k (I've been capitalizing interest). My investment portfolio is a basket of Canadian dividend stocks, that essentially resembles XEI, it's currently worth ~$150k.Hypothetically, on Jan 1st, 2026 I could liquidate my portfolio, pay off my HELOC, and be left with $20k to use as a lump sum when I renew my mortgage. I could then restart the Smith Maneuver with a lower mortgage payment, and more HELOC room. Any capital gains tax would be due when I file my 2026 taxes in Spring 2027.My plan with the Smith Maneuver has always been to pay down the mortgage component as quickly as possible, hence why I've been buying dividend stocks. I haven't 100% decided what I will do after paying down the mortgage, but I'm leaning towards liquidating investments and paying off the HELOC rather than maintaining an interest deductible loan.I haven't thought this out completely but am I missing anything from my thought process? I'm not sure if this seems impatient, or like some version of timing the market.",

About a month ago we booked a nice one to Costa Rica (nice resort), through Costco Vacations leaving home early Saturday morning (flying AC of course). Now, due to the looming flight attendants' strike and cancellation-notice policies, I'm in a real financial dilemma. I've done as much investigation as possible into cancellation policies with the travel agency (Costco) and the credit card I used to pay for the trip (TD Aeroplan Visa). So it looks like I can either wait until midnight tomorrow - if there's a strike the airline will cancel and refund the airfare but I will be on the hook for $6-7k resort fees - or I can cancel the resort today with a 10% non-refundable on their fees and (drum roll) of there's no strike then we can travel but won't have a place to stay. Have I left any stones unturned to minimize my losses, given the complete uncertainly of the airline strike tomorrow night?? TIA for any thoughts!",

Want to get up, read and write all day, exercise, watch a movie with a friend, and go to sleep. Eat super cheap. Not an expensive lifestyle at all.Financially, any reason for me not to retire and watch Netflix all day if I live in a rural area where cost of living is quite low? Zero interest in living in bigger cities like Toronto or Vancouver. Rural Alberta or Saskatchewan is totally fine for me.Only considering financially for now, nothing else. Yes retire?UPDATE: Thank you ALL who have responded thus far, very much appreciated. In response to some of your queries, I may not follow through with retirement, but for now just wondering how possible it is. Sounds like it is and the consensus \"yes\" agrees with my numbers as well. Will also have a dog or two which I know can be expensive (especially vet bills in case of health issues), but if I'm living on 40-50k/year I figure I should be fine. Will also have a part-time gig writing, but income not guaranteed. Worst case scenario is what I've described above, my income levels can only go up from there. Yes, factoring in other things as to whether to retire, but for this query only considering the financial aspects and those milestone numbers. Totally agree with many posts that retirement could get boring, etc. and totally considering all of that as well. But for now, only considering the financial aspects and worst-case scenario numbers. Right now, just knowing whether I have the option to retire and live the lifestyle I (think) I want is enough for me. Yes, kind of terrifying being \"out\" of the workforce but equally satisfying is being able to walk my dog, work on projects I want at home, and other things I want to do (music, gardening, etc., and community social activities too).The thought of not having a regular income is terrifying, as well as leaving money on the table by leaving the workforce. I think we're conditioned to keep making money as long as we can, but it comes at the opportunity cost of living each day entirely on our terms.Thank you again! Will try to get back to many of your follow-ups and appreciate the time you took to respond.",

We were strongly advised not to close any accounts, which I understand, because it will make everything more difficult in the future.My father is \"executor son tort\", we have not yet discovered a will. We do have the Death Certificate. We would like to know if we can get a \"snapshot\" of her finances at this bank.  Scotiabank.We believe that the bank will clam up and offer little guidance, based on research.However, what is the possibility that they will allow us to use some of her finances to pay towards some significant bills? (i.e.. funeral)  I believe that we would have to set up another account to handle the affairs of the estate from here on in.What are some pitfalls to avoid?  What can I do to prepare and be effective for tomorrow?How do we stop bill payments and stop accruing interest as soon as possible?  How do we find out her utilities, etc..Much of this information is difficult to attain as she lived quite a distance from us.Thank you for reading, I apologize in advance if this topic has been covered, but the amount of duress I am feeling is significant.",

      "content_preview": "1. Overpaying for car insuranceThe average American saves a whopping $410+ a YEAR (source) when they switch auto insurance carriers - sometimes significantly more than that: I saved $1,300 this year.The reason: some carriers offer discount prices to new customers when they switch.Take 30 seconds and go to a 3rd party comparison site (Coverage.com and Auto-Savings.com are both fine) to see if you can find cheaper rates. You’ll likely save yourself a bunch of money.Some people suggest switching every 6 months, that's a little bit overkill imo. Once a year should be fine.2. Overpaying when you shop onlineBig stores like Amazon know that no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites, so there’s often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices.I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but Capital One Shopping has always worked well for me and I'd recommend trying it (link here).When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will automatically compare prices for you, and auto-apply coupon codes when possible.3. Dealing with debt on your ownIf you’ve got $10k+ in unsecured debt (think credit cards, medical bills, etc), you can ask a debt relief company to come in and negotiate it for you. You typically will save around 23% on average (after their fees).Here’s a link to a savings calculator from National Debt Relief's website if you want to see how much you could save: link here.4. Not having a financial advisor.You know why so many rich people have financial advisors? It isn't because they're better at picking stocks (spoiler alert: they're not)It's because a good financial advisor will help you with all of the bizarro tax implications you never would have thought of. People with financial advisors end up making ~3% more/year thanks to better tax planning.If you don't know an advisor personally, use a 3rd party comparison site to find somebody with good reviews (WiserAdvisor is solid).5. Using normal, low-interest savings accountsI'm always shocked at the number of people still using garbage savings accounts that pay 0.5% (or less) a year. There are literally hundreds of banks that will pay you 8x that, usually 10x that rateHere's a link to a bunch of options.--There are tons of other things (obviously) but these are the ones that I see the most. Hope that helps.",

      "content_preview": "Just curious when one should stop retirement contribution.I'm 43yo, tfsa maxed out but planning on continuing to contribute the allowed limit per year until I'm 65.100k in RRSP and might contribute more or maybe not400k in a holding company invested in low-dividend, but somewhat 'risky' etfs, aka, VEQT and similar. Here I have to pay taxes yearly on the dividends. For example VEQT did 12.2% out of which 1.4% were dividends.So it's 10% growth.Just these 3 if I leave alone are projected to grow quite a lot.TFSA might go to 970k in 22 years, tax free, @ 8% returns. That's 38k/year without tax @ 4% withdrawal/yearRRSP : 360k in 22 years @ 6% returns. That's 14.4k/year, taxable @ 4% withdrawal/yearholdco: 2.2M in 22 years @ 8% returns. That's 88k/year, taxable @ 4% withdrawal/year.If I pay 50% in taxes, that's still 38k/year + ( (14.4+88)/2 = 51.2k ) = 90k of after-tax money + whatever will come from qpp/cpp .Are my returns estimates reasonable ? What would be some worst case scenarios ? I tried doing some Excel calculations where I invest aggressively for 17 years and last 5 I switch to safer etfs but the numbers are somewhat similar.Just curious to know when others are stopping to put money in for retirement.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone,I really need help and advice because I feel completely scammed by a Rogers door-to-door sales agent, and now I’m being told I owe over $1000.Here’s what happened: •\tBack in January 2025, I was with Telus Wi-Fi when a Rogers/Shaw sales agent came to my door. •\tHe told me there was a special promotion where: •\tRogers would pay Telus directly to cancel my existing plan so I wouldn’t be on the hook. •\tI’d get a $200 promotional credit on my next two bills. •\tSince I already had a Rogers mobile plan, he said I might be able to bundle for more discounts.I believed him (so did my roommates who were there) and signed up under my name because I was already with Rogers for mobile.What actually happened: •\tNone of his promises were real. No $200 credit, no Telus cancellation paid by Rogers. •\tInternet speed was terrible, and he even convinced me to get Shaw TV. The installer came with a broken adapter and barely knew what he was doing. •\tWhen I tried to reach the sales guy (he had given me his personal number), he first denied making those promises and then stopped answering my calls completely.I contacted Rogers customer service, and they said there was nothing they could do and that if I wanted to cancel, I’d have to pay $300 for breaking the contract.I ended up canceling because the service was terrible, but Rogers kept charging me for two more months even though I wasn’t using their services. Now, a collections agency is calling me saying I owe over $1000.This feels completely unfair because I was misled by a Rogers representative. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What can I do here — should I contact the CRTC, Commission for Complaints for Telecom Services (CCTS), or a consumer protection office?Any advice would really help.",

I can't remember for sure but I don't recall the form saying anything about classing this as an HBP withdrawal, it was just withdrawal. So, subject to tax. This was a crazy time and I didn't claim it on my income tax nor did I opt into the home buyers tax credit.This week Manulife sent the docs to the CRA causing my income tax to be reassessed, so I did an adjustment on that tax year, claiming the RRSP withdraw was for home buying, submitted my purchase agreement and all the proof I could find to also claim the tax credit. The $10,000 tax credit will above and beyond cover this RRSP amount as far as income tax goes -- the issue is actually the claw back on my child tax credit from 2024.But now I'm doing research and I see that manulife classed it as income, withheld a chunk for tax and submitted it to CRA. I can't get anyone who understands anything on the line at Manulife but what are the chances they adjust the withdraw details? Foregoing that, has anyone successfully convinced the CRA to adjust it anyway? I have a T4A, I have since filled out and submitted a T1036 and of course never received a T4RSP.

      "content_preview": "New data on Canada’sgross domestic productfor the second quarter of 2025 are now available. Here are a few key highlights:Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined -0.4% in the second quarter of 2025, following a 0.5% gain in the first quarter.  The contraction in the second quarter was driven by significant declines in the export of goods, as well as decreased business investment in machinery and equipment.On a per capita basis, real GDP was down -0.4% in the second quarter, after an increase of 0.4% in the previous quarter.Household spending increased 1.1% in the second quarter after rising 0.1% in the first quarter.The household saving rate fell to 5.0% in the second quarter of 2025, down from 6.0% in the first quarter.Prices for total exports (-3.4%) and total imports (-2.3%) fell in the second quarter as businesses on both sides of the Canada-US border likely absorbed some of the additional costs of tariffs by lowering their prices which weighed heavily on the aggregate prices for international trade.***De nouvelles données sur leproduit intérieur brutréel du Canada pour le deuxième trimestre de 2025 sont maintenant disponibles. Voici quelques faits saillants :Le produit intérieur brut (PIB) réel a diminué de 0,4 % au deuxième trimestre de 2025, après avoir augmenté de 0,5 % au premier trimestre. La baisse observée au deuxième trimestre est principalement attribuable au recul considérable des exportations de biens, ainsi qu’à la diminution des investissements des entreprises en machines et matériel.Le PIB réel par habitant a diminué de 0,4 % au deuxième trimestre, après avoir progressé de 0,4 % au trimestre précédent.Les dépenses des ménages ont progressé de 1,1 % au deuxième trimestre, après avoir augmenté de 0,1 % au premier trimestre.Le taux d’épargne des ménages a reculé pour s’établir à 5,0 % au deuxième trimestre de 2025, en baisse par rapport au taux de 6,0 % enregistré au premier trimestre.Les prix des exportations totales (-3,4 %) et des importations totales (-2,3 %) ont diminué au deuxième trimestre, les entreprises ayant probablement absorbé une partie des coûts additionnels des droits de douane en diminuant les prix, ce qui a exercé une forte pression sur les prix agrégés du commerce international.",

One of the dealership was trying to explain to me that it is because this reduces the risk on the lessor as the car can be returned to the dealership and the lessor is not stuck with an asset that might have depreciated in value from a potential collision claim.But this does not make sense to me. Why do I care as the driver, how others value my car (sidetone: this is a whole another question why the market sees car collision claims this way, but let's leave that for now)? If I need a car, and the car is good (since it's been fixed) why would I care about depreciation (on an assets that anyways depreciates quickly) from a collision claim?What am I not understanding?",

      "content_preview": "Hi folks,Looking for some general advice on next steps with property purchasing.I currently own a 3br leasehold trailer (in trailer park) that is rented for $2100/month. Pad rent is 390/month, loan is almost paid off (payments are 500/month until then). Most recent BC Assessment was 170k. It's in a town with very strong, long-term rental demand. I'd like to keep it for the rental income if it makes sense (and I love my tenants).My job is very secure, 80k/year, government, union position. I currently rent ($1400/month) in a different town to where my trailer is. Not planning to stay here long term, looking to move somewhere more affordable and quieter. One option that's appealing to me is to purchase a 3br house in a town that has long-term appeal to me, and rent it out in the meantime until I move there. The area I'm eyeing off has a high rental demand.I'm not sure how to calculate whether it makes sense to sell the trailer to muster capital funds towards this goal, or keep it and somehow leverage that into the deal. Not sure how that would work exactly - can I take a HELOC (or similar) to make a large down payment on the new home?I'm looking for advice on how much spending power I'd have with either option. Not sure how the leasehold/trailer factor affects things - would banks see the trailer property as a liability, or a benefit? Would I be better off with keeping the steady rental income to bolster my ongoing funds? Or better off selling it to get the lump sum and using it that way?Also curious about the tax implications with neither of them being my primary residence (initially).Thankyou for reading all this - happy to add in any extra info that I haven't thought of.",

      "content_preview": "There’s nothing wrong with ETFs. I like ETFs. I use ETFs. There’s also nothing wrong with stocks and bonds. Or GICs. or (good, 5 star rated) mutual funds. They all have a place.And there’s nothing wrong with self directing your investments… if you are willing and able to manage the tech, educate yourself (navigating the mess of conflicting and often flat out inaccurate information out there, including on Reddit). Self directing your investments also requires a high enough risk tolerance, and the intestinal fortitude to weather 2008 and 2022 style corrections.Self directing is best suited for those who are younger, tech savvy, comfortable educating themselves using online resources, and a relatively simple, straightforward financial situation. That’s likely a decent chunk of Reddit users, but it’s not at all suitable for many others, and I’d suggest a majority of Canadians.Ask yourself, should your grandmother self direct their investments? Should your parents? Should that crypto bro buddy? Should your aunt who falls for Facebook scams and fake news? What about the huge number of people who just don’t want to or aren’t confident enough to manage their own investments? Here are some analogies: I could probably learn how to change my cars oil, tires and other basic maintenance. But I’d rather pay an expert to do it. I could build my own deck too, but I’d rather pay a (good) contractor to do it better.Now there are real problems with the financial services industry in Canada: most people calling themselves an advisor are just mutual fund salespeople for a bank, limited to selling a few retail bank funds that are poorly rated closer index funds with ridiculous fees. Or they’re new to the industry and have no experience or designations. Or they’re new work for an institution that only sells proprietary funds. Or, they’re dishonest (though I find this group is the smallest).There are however many excellent advisors with designations, who are fiduciaries (legally required to put their clients’ interests first), have multiple designations and do holistic planning for their clients. Most people just don’t know how to find these advisors. A good advisor usually has CFP/CLU designations, has been working for 5+ years, has staff, and provides a holistic financial plan for clients.(Real) Advisors teach their clients basic financial literacy, organize their financial life, provide regular service, and disclose and justify their fees.What most Reddit posters promoting self directing and ETFs seem to miss is that there is so so sooo much more to financial management than just picking a few ETFs and then forgetting about them for 20 years. Here are some of the common things that require some guidance:• RESP and RDSP accounts are much more difficult to self direct (because there are government grant programs).• Figuring out how to prioritize between accounts and financial objectives can be much more complex with kids, aging parents, multiple properties, blended families, business interests, or debt.• asset draw down in retirement requires managing where and in what order to access funds. It also requires strategically managing household taxable income. When and how to sell properties, when to take CPP/OAS, etc• actual retirement and estate projections• protection: investment management is only one aspect of financial planning. Insurance, tax management and contingency planning are essential.• estate planning. The single largest missed opportunity by most people is poor estate management resulting in massive tax inefficiencies.• behavioural coaching. This is the second key area that is absolutely necessary for most Canadians. Most people panic in a downturn, and are swayed by crappy media, online posts, or bad advice from ignorant friends/family/coworkers. The confidence of so many redditors promoting self direction doesn’t apply to the average Canadian (and likely not to some of those who are posting so loudly and confidently right now).Finally, why ETFs are not a panacea or universal solution:most ETFs are baskets of 100% equity. That is an aggressive and volatile position which is just completely unsuitable for many people, situations and goals. Your risk should always be aligned with your time horizon. If you don’t need your money for 20 years… a higher risk position is fine. But if you need your money this year, it’s should be in a no risk position (cash, money market, GICs etc). Most advisors use a “bucket” system that pools your money to align with various time horizons. If you’re 60, with a kid in university, and a few years away from retirement, you will have large pools of money with very different time horizons and thus different risk profiles. Most ETFs are not at all suitable for this (though some of the newer ones are designed with this in mind… but then you start running into the same issues as with mutual funds).Then you need to manage which accounts should hold those various pools of risk. Growth should be as sheltered as possible (TFSA, LIRAs etc) and lower risk investments as accessible as possible (non-reg).If you’re a 25 year old with a 20+ year time horizon and lots of TFSA and RRSP room, you have a really simple straightforward financial situation and self direction is pretty basic. If you’re a remarried 55 year old with some old pension accounts from previous employers, a mortgage, LOC, and a blended family with two kids about to go to uni, and are looking at retirement in 5-10 years… your situation is way way more complex. And managing the tech is more daunting, educating yourself is more confusing, and finding the time for all that is more difficult. You also likely have related needs for insurance, retirement projections, estate planning and possibly a plan for your own parents and helping them with their finances. Advisors who can manage all that are much more valuable to this type of person. And the fees make much more sense in that context.Finally, compare apples to apples in looking at ETFs vs mutual funds. An ETF is a basket of stocks. A mutual fund is a curated basket of various investments with a specific objective in mind. That objective might be growth, but it may also be achieving lower risk and volatility to align with a specific goal or time horizon. Comparing an income fund to an S&P etf is stupid. That’s like saying “my corvette is faster than your minivan”. It’s true, but it’s stupid because they’re designed to do different jobs. If you compare growth mutual funds to ETFs, it’s much closer.Then there’s quality. Most mutual funds are dogshit. There are a few ways to compare funds, but the easiest is Morningstar. It’s an independent third party that compares and rates mutual funds to their peers. A 5 star fund is consistently top decile in their category over 3, 5 and 10. If you compare a collection of 5 star growth oriented mutual funds to ETFs, they do very very well, and often outperform, even after fees.Most Canadians will need financial advice at some point. A good advisor is almost always the best source for that. The tricky part is finding a good one.Finally, I’ve rarely tried to convert a self director or talk a client out of it if they want to start self directing themselves. But almost all of the actual wealthy people I know use an advisor. These people are smart individuals and understand the value of holistic management. A decent number self direct their TFsA, but they all use an advisor for their overall plan and management.",

      "content_preview": "I am in Ontario.Last week I was in a McDonald's Drive through and a lady Rear ended me.I was at a complete stop paying for my order.I have video evidence from the security camera at the McDonald's.The lady that hit me was driving a car with a yellow plate, a mechanic service shop plate.She refused to give her insurance just her license.I went to the Collision Center and showed the police officer my video and made a reportNOWMy insurance is telling me they contacted the lady and she refuses to give them the insurance info.I was under the understanding that insurance can pull insurance info direct from a Service Plate in Ontario.My insurance claim rep is telling me I will have to pay $300 non insured deductible.At the very least shouldn't insurance fix my car and then sue the lady the $300 deductible ??Can I get the police involved? What are my options??It's crazy to me we have to pay such high insurance rates in Ontario and someone can drive with no insurance or deny access to insurance and get、 with it.",
