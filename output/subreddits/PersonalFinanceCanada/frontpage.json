      "content_preview": "Let‚Äôs get a few things out of the way first. I can‚Äôt sell the car as it will be seen as massively disrespectful if I do and I do not want to create family drama. I do not want to bring up any aspect of this situation to my relatives because I might be viewed as ungrateful which I absolutely want to avoid. It was gifted to me so I don‚Äôt have a car payment on it. I currently drive a 20 yr old japanese car that costs like $2000/yr to operate. The car in question is a big american suv well into the 6 figures (think cadillac escalade, ford expedition, etc, i dont want to be too specific here). They also bought 6 months of insurance for me which will expire soon. I‚Äôm literally so grateful that I own a new luxury car without a payment but the problem is it‚Äôll still drain me dry. A full tank of gas is $200 which barely lasts a week, an oil change is like $390 at the dealer and ICBC is charging around $8k/yr to insure it. This isn‚Äôt counting depreciation as well which I‚Äôve chosen to ignore as I can‚Äôt sell the car. From a financial pov, it makes total sense to just park the car somewhere safe and not drive it right? My income is around $100k before tax and I‚Äôd need to budget at least $18k/yr to operate it which is insane to me since I only spend $2k/yr currently on my old car.",

      "content_preview": "I was having a conversation with a close friend recently about our respective jobs and whether we were happy where we were at or if we would consider leaving. I work in a government role in healthcare. Here‚Äôs an overview: Gross Salary: 94k 4 weeks paid vacation Employer-matched DB Pension (I put in 6.9%, they put in 9.2%) Dental, vision, life insurance, orthotics, etc are covered by my benefits, I use these regularly and have never had to pay out of pocket. 100% WFH (Which I love, and saves me a ton of money because I live downtown and don‚Äôt need to own a car). I started at ~63k and have been at my job for about 4 years, so about a 10.8% increase in salary on average per year (I got a big promotion last year which pushed the average up). In general, I really like my job. Reasonable workload and expectations, great boss that doesn‚Äôt micromanage, feel very secure in my role. I can easily imagine doing what I‚Äôm doing for at least another 5 years. I mentioned to my friend that I‚Äôm pretty happy where I‚Äôm at, and I probably wouldn‚Äôt consider switching jobs unless it paid at least 125k/year if it meant giving up my current benefits and perks. His response seemed to indicate he felt like I was over-valuing my current job and I should be willing to leave for a smaller raise than that. Am I? I get that some of this is quite subjective (e.g. how valuable is WFH), but I wanted to get other people‚Äôs opinions. If you were in my shoes working in my role, how much would a different employer have to pay you to get you to switch over, assuming that you would lose your government benefits and WFH perks in doing so?",

I am the kind of person who would keep the car for several years, so for me going the financing or lease route just comes down to the interest rates (with lease I'll pay the residual and buy the car out at the end). But, I see people who only lease and perpetually keep paying several hundreds each month with no end in sight. One of the dealership was trying to explain to me that it is because this reduces the risk on the lessor as the car can be returned to the dealership and the lessor is not stuck with an asset that might have depreciated in value from a potential collision claim. But this does not make sense to me. Why do I care as the driver, how others value my car (sidetone: this is a whole another question why the market sees car collision claims this way, but let's leave that for now)? If I need a car, and the car is good (since it's been fixed) why would I care about depreciation (on an assets that anyways depreciates quickly) from a collision claim? What am I not understanding?",

At the end of the day, his incentives are at odds with mine ‚Äî he gets paid faster and more if I close quicker and at a higher price. So why should I believe he‚Äôs actually working in my best interest? On the buyer‚Äôs side, it feels like the value-add is minimal compared to the conflict of interest baked into their commission model. Am I wrong here? Have any of you actually had realtors go to bat for you as a buyer ‚Äî or are they really just along for the ride until they get paid? Edit 1: Just for context I have worked with 3 different realtors (different purchases) it seems most of them these days are looking for low-hanging fruit... No one wants to work for the money.",

There are comparably sized apartments to what I have now in the $600,000-$650,000 range and so I am now wondering if this is a smart thing to be doing? A mortgage payment would not be much bigger than what I am currently spending, and my overall non-housing costs are fairly low (car paid off, no expensive habits).

      "content_preview": "As someone who has worked in debt management and in collection for 8 years, some advice. 1st Anyone who owes debts: should read collection laws in your province, and you will learn what actions the creditors can take and can't take to recover the balance. As well as under which circumstances you are protected under consumer protection act. For example some provinces if balance owed is less than 5k and some 2k they can't take legal action if the debt is older than 2 years form the date of your last payment they can't take legal action. Any debt older than 6 years can't be collected and should be removed from the credit bureau and so many more ways. 2nd, most banks, especially the top 5 banks in Canada they have options that can help you with your debt. For example, if you owe something on your CC and pay normal interest 21%. You can change your visa type to something with lower % and can help you with your monthly payments or freeze you interest for 3-6 months and pay just $10 a month which you can contribute more to bring principal balance down. Banks also offer low interest consolidation loan and pay your debts directly for you but you must qualify for that the pre qualifications is very easy and most people qualify as long as they still hold decent credit score above 450 and don't owe CRA any tax money.Same goes for PLC and mortgages they have few temporarily options that can help you for few months and some long options as well. Just call them to deal with it first before you're acount is assigned to 3rd part collections. 3rd If your debts are already sent to collection, make sure what I mentioned on 1st point  read. Since you are already with collections you're credit score is already fucked because after a month or 3 they will report your debt as a collection iteam on your credit under the trade line. At this point you can make the decision to somehow come up with the money to pay or just tell them to fuck off and ignore the calls and emails and letters. Which you can also ask them formaly to stop contacting and they will stop the  calls and emails. If its significant amount they can take legal action( again my 1st point) but most collections they don't want to pay for lawyers fee and go to small claims court. Also when you file is in collection feel free to offer them 50% of original debt as settlement.The older the debts gets there is lower chance of collecting them so they would have Settlement options and it will depend on your negotiation skills how far down you can push them. 4th if you Can't pay your debts in full(PIF) or settle it in full (SIF)  and your making small monthly payments that is not don't anything STOP IT you are wasting your money it's like your dropping a stone in ocean it won't do any good for you and Creditors they don't care you will end up paying them and they will continue charging you interest and your principal balance will not be paid off. Unless if it's some type of arrangement that after sometime of monthly or weekly payments your debts will be paid off. 5th this is not 100% accurate for everyone it's different with Equifax  and Transunion everyone reports to one these two or both. Any late payments can bring your score down somewhere from between 40-50 it depends, collection iteam around 200 score and how you use your credit and manage your bad and good debts can bring your score down and up, and credit bureau gets updated quarterly. If you read how to utilize your credit after you pay off your debts or you have bad credit score it can really help you to build credit score so must read about this too. 6th Bankruptcy, Consumer proposal is not free and not everyone will qualify to file it unless someone offers to do it for free for you. Also, if you have income higher than your total owed debt you can't file, and you can't include any secure debts. Also, if you are a co-signer on an account and one of you files for bankruptcy or consumer proposal, the other person is still liable, and the creditors can come after you to collect. It is best to do debt consolidation if you run out of all options. FYI I just wanted to post this because a lot of people don't know they are protected under consumer protection act and it's always good to know what you can and can't do in case of your debts and where to ask for help. Hope this helpled a little, there is alot more to be said but I don't want it to get too long best to read online and learn ways to get out of debts and manage it better.",

Then I waited until too late in the day to call them Friday, the house is in a different time zone and their regional office had closed for the day. Just got off a very short phone call where they said that since my closing date had passed they can't insure the home (even if it had just been a couple days), referring me to their \"sister company\" or something like that (small insurance company I've never heard of), which I'm sure would be more expensive. They ask questions in their online form about how long you've owned the home and whether or not you've had insurance yet, but don't mention anything about this policy, just to tell you on the phone that they won't cover the house because my closing date was a couple days ago? Is this a common policy I'll run into trying to get home insurance now? Edit: For those asking or confused, yes no lender.",

About a month ago we booked a nice one to Costa Rica (nice resort), through Costco Vacations leaving home early Saturday morning (flying AC of course). Now, due to the looming flight attendants' strike and cancellation-notice policies, I'm in a real financial dilemma. I've done as much investigation as possible into cancellation policies with the travel agency (Costco) and the credit card I used to pay for the trip (TD Aeroplan Visa). So it looks like I can either wait until midnight tomorrow - if there's a strike the airline will cancel and refund the airfare but I will be on the hook for $6-7k resort fees - or I can cancel the resort today with a 10% non-refundable on their fees and (drum roll) of there's no strike then we can travel but won't have a place to stay. Have I left any stones unturned to minimize my losses, given the complete uncertainly of the airline strike tomorrow night?? TIA for any thoughts!",

Want to get up, read and write all day, exercise, watch a movie with a friend, and go to sleep. Eat super cheap. Not an expensive lifestyle at all. Financially, any reason for me not to retire and watch Netflix all day if I live in a rural area where cost of living is quite low? Zero interest in living in bigger cities like Toronto or Vancouver. Rural Alberta or Saskatchewan is totally fine for me. Only considering financially for now, nothing else. Yes retire? UPDATE: Thank you ALL who have responded thus far, very much appreciated. In response to some of your queries, I may not follow through with retirement, but for now just wondering how possible it is. Sounds like it is and the consensus \"yes\" agrees with my numbers as well. Will also have a dog or two which I know can be expensive (especially vet bills in case of health issues), but if I'm living on 40-50k/year I figure I should be fine. Will also have a part-time gig writing, but income not guaranteed. Worst case scenario is what I've described above, my income levels can only go up from there. Yes, factoring in other things as to whether to retire, but for this query only considering the financial aspects and those milestone numbers. Totally agree with many posts that retirement could get boring, etc. and totally considering all of that as well. But for now, only considering the financial aspects and worst-case scenario numbers. Right now, just knowing whether I have the option to retire and live the lifestyle I (think) I want is enough for me. Yes, kind of terrifying being \"out\" of the workforce but equally satisfying is being able to walk my dog, work on projects I want at home, and other things I want to do (music, gardening, etc., and community social activities too). The thought of not having a regular income is terrifying, as well as leaving money on the table by leaving the workforce. I think we're conditioned to keep making money as long as we can, but it comes at the opportunity cost of living each day entirely on our terms. Thank you again! Will try to get back to many of your follow-ups and appreciate the time you took to respond.",

      "content_preview": "I'm a 33 Y/O Ontarian with physical disability. Born with a congenital abnormal blood vessel, which my family and I were completely unaware of. It ruptured in 2013 and I have hemiplegia. I've rehabbed to the point where I can walk on my own with just an ankle brace, but my left arm is no good. (not functional at all) I managed to return and finish my degree after taking a year off from education as well. Even with disability and benefits, I believe everyone should try to work to their capacity, so I'm constantly looking for one. Had limited interview offers, but all got rejected at the end. I am on ODSP, and also have RDSP which was opened in 2015. Been contributing with little I have while having it on mutual fund, it just passed 125k as of August. I can't touch it anyway, so I just don't care about it because I have a pre-authorized contribution set up for it. My parents are retired and receive pension. Also, my mom received a few ounces of precious metals from my grandparents when they decided to settle their assets and distribute them among my uncles(and my mom) last year. I believe my mom received like 11oz gold and 100oz silver along with some funds (like 100k?). I think she'll have them saved for me and my sibling in the future. (She has that fund in her investing account for growth ATM) I guess one silver lining is that I was fortunate to have been offered a subsidized housing unit a few months ago by the region. I moved in in May. Adjusting well. Trying to be more independent as well. Even with housing support, I still want to find a proper job. Sure, I may lose my housing support and ODSP if I earn income, but I think it's worth more to find work. Im prepared to go to other provinces if necessary. As for my family's precious metals, I'm kinda treating them as an inflation hedge atm. Also diversifying with what I have. (Well, my mom's, but she's pretty much given those to me with full access) Any suggestions on what to do more to improve? Are there any tips for a disabled individual? TYIA.",

An investment planning specialist from my bank recommended: Open an FHSA account and contribute $8,000 each year until I reach the $40,000 limit. Open an RRSP account and contribute to it until I reach the $60,000 home buyers plan limit. Open a TFSA to save the remaining $50,000. They recommended investing the money inside these accounts in either: A bond fund (3.53% yield, minus 0.5% management fee), or One of their managed portfolios (75/25, 60/40, or 40/60 fixed income to equity). After fees, the 5 year historical returns for these portfolios are 1.7%, 3.7%, 3.7% and 5.7%. When I asked about ETFs as an alternative, they only said ETFs only have lower fees because they are not actively managed. Is this plan good value for the returns? Or would I likely get lower fees and similar returns by using an ETF instead of a bank managed portfolio? Any thoughts and recommendations would be very much appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "Hello all! I'm in my late 20s and have been trying to come up with a plan for myself and my partner for retirement. What I've been having trouble with is estimating expenses during retirement. We are in the GTA and don't have many expenses. All our expenses (fun money, travel, rent, groceries, etc) are in the range of 45-50k a year. That will likely go up to 60k in a few years with a bigger apartment. We are happy with our spending, although we are a bit frugal, so I think an income that provided $72,000 a year after taxes in todays dollars would be more than sufficient for our lifestyle. I know that I have to factor in inflation and other costs for an income in 20-30 years time (which would be around 120-180k in future dollars, depending on retirement age and inflation). What I'm unsure about are any unexpected costs that I'm forgetting about in retirement, especially during old age. I've spoken to seniors who have mentioned large costs from things like cancer drugs, senior health care, end-of-life care, etc, which make me worried that we could retire too early and find ourselves struggling to make ends meet as we reach an old age. Are there any crucial details I should include in my retirement planning? Thanks in advance for any advice!",

My understanding is I should start selling the equities into CASH.TO but I‚Äôm not sure when. I had originally started my FHSA with XEQT but stopped when I realized it was more long term (>10 yrs) growth which is why I hold so little but still something.

I will work during the summer and most likely on weekends once school starts and i can get settled into a routine and have a better idea what my work load will be. Either way i will not be spending much money if at all during school and i dont think i will be making these cards worth their price. I am thinking i am going to cancel them both, i have 820+ credit and always have and i do not plan on any big purchases like a house etc for ~10years. So i think taking the credit hit is worth it and it will rise back up in plenty time before it matters, correct? Also i am wondering: Should I get some sort of free credit card with no fees to use for 2 years, or would that not even be worth it and should i just use debit for all my purchases or (wealthsimple cash account card maybe?)",

I would be 400k in debt with 200k in government loans and 200k in private loans. Paying off 400k is financial suicide for most people but for a dentist who can make upwards of 300k in rural Alberta, would it be not so stupid? If it is a stupid decision I would appreciate an answer that has some depth to it which explains why the debt is too much. The schools I would apply to would have its dental degree recognized in Canada. Btw I wouldn‚Äôt mind living like a broke uni kid for a couple years to pay off that debt. Also I am from Alberta so I would be practicing there.",

Admin fee (not applicable for Quebec residents) So, for a purchase of $4000, equal monthly payments: $4,000 √∑ 12 = $333.33/month + (one time)$39.99 annual fee. So the financing essentially costs $40 extra but I understand all this falls apart if I miss a single payment which I don't plan to. Hopefully they have some sort of auto-pay feature(?)

      "content_preview": "There‚Äôs nothing wrong with ETFs. I like ETFs. I use ETFs. There‚Äôs also nothing wrong with stocks and bonds. Or GICs. or (good, 5 star rated) mutual funds. They all have a place. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with self directing your investments‚Ä¶ if you are willing and able to manage the tech, educate yourself (navigating the mess of conflicting and often flat out inaccurate information out there, including on Reddit). Self directing your investments also requires a high enough risk tolerance, and the intestinal fortitude to weather 2008 and 2022 style corrections. Self directing is best suited for those who are younger, tech savvy, comfortable educating themselves using online resources, and a relatively simple, straightforward financial situation. That‚Äôs likely a decent chunk of Reddit users, but it‚Äôs not at all suitable for many others, and I‚Äôd suggest a majority of Canadians. Ask yourself, should your grandmother self direct their investments? Should your parents? Should that crypto bro buddy? Should your aunt who falls for Facebook scams and fake news? What about the huge number of people who just don‚Äôt want to or aren‚Äôt confident enough to manage their own investments? Here are some analogies: I could probably learn how to change my cars oil, tires and other basic maintenance. But I‚Äôd rather pay an expert to do it. I could build my own deck too, but I‚Äôd rather pay a (good) contractor to do it better. Now there are real problems with the financial services industry in Canada: most people calling themselves an advisor are just mutual fund salespeople for a bank, limited to selling a few retail bank funds that are poorly rated closer index funds with ridiculous fees. Or they‚Äôre new to the industry and have no experience or designations. Or they‚Äôre new work for an institution that only sells proprietary funds. Or, they‚Äôre dishonest (though I find this group is the smallest). There are however many excellent advisors with designations, who are fiduciaries (legally required to put their clients‚Äô interests first), have multiple designations and do holistic planning for their clients. Most people just don‚Äôt know how to find these advisors. A good advisor usually has CFP/CLU designations, has been working for 5+ years, has staff, and provides a holistic financial plan for clients. (Real) Advisors teach their clients basic financial literacy, organize their financial life, provide regular service, and disclose and justify their fees. What most Reddit posters promoting self directing and ETFs seem to miss is that there is so so sooo much more to financial management than just picking a few ETFs and then forgetting about them for 20 years. Here are some of the common things that require some guidance: ‚Ä¢ RESP and RDSP accounts are much more difficult to self direct (because there are government grant programs). ‚Ä¢ Figuring out how to prioritize between accounts and financial objectives can be much more complex with kids, aging parents, multiple properties, blended families, business interests, or debt. ‚Ä¢ asset draw down in retirement requires managing where and in what order to access funds. It also requires strategically managing household taxable income. When and how to sell properties, when to take CPP/OAS, etc ‚Ä¢ actual retirement and estate projections ‚Ä¢ protection: investment management is only one aspect of financial planning. Insurance, tax management and contingency planning are essential. ‚Ä¢ estate planning. The single largest missed opportunity by most people is poor estate management resulting in massive tax inefficiencies. ‚Ä¢ behavioural coaching. This is the second key area that is absolutely necessary for most Canadians. Most people panic in a downturn, and are swayed by crappy media, online posts, or bad advice from ignorant friends/family/coworkers. The confidence of so many redditors promoting self direction doesn‚Äôt apply to the average Canadian (and likely not to some of those who are posting so loudly and confidently right now). Finally, why ETFs are not a panacea or universal solution: most ETFs are baskets of 100% equity. That is an aggressive and volatile position which is just completely unsuitable for many people, situations and goals. Your risk should always be aligned with your time horizon. If you don‚Äôt need your money for 20 years‚Ä¶ a higher risk position is fine. But if you need your money this year, it‚Äôs should be in a no risk position (cash, money market, GICs etc). Most advisors use a ‚Äúbucket‚Äù system that pools your money to align with various time horizons. If you‚Äôre 60, with a kid in university, and a few years away from retirement, you will have large pools of money with very different time horizons and thus different risk profiles. Most ETFs are not at all suitable for this (though some of the newer ones are designed with this in mind‚Ä¶ but then you start running into the same issues as with mutual funds). Then you need to manage which accounts should hold those various pools of risk. Growth should be as sheltered as possible (TFSA, LIRAs etc) and lower risk investments as accessible as possible (non-reg). If you‚Äôre a 25 year old with a 20+ year time horizon and lots of TFSA and RRSP room, you have a really simple straightforward financial situation and self direction is pretty basic. If you‚Äôre a remarried 55 year old with some old pension accounts from previous employers, a mortgage, LOC, and a blended family with two kids about to go to uni, and are looking at retirement in 5-10 years‚Ä¶ your situation is way way more complex. And managing the tech is more daunting, educating yourself is more confusing, and finding the time for all that is more difficult. You also likely have related needs for insurance, retirement projections, estate planning and possibly a plan for your own parents and helping them with their finances. Advisors who can manage all that are much more valuable to this type of person. And the fees make much more sense in that context. Finally, compare apples to apples in looking at ETFs vs mutual funds. An ETF is a basket of stocks. A mutual fund is a curated basket of various investments with a specific objective in mind. That objective might be growth, but it may also be achieving lower risk and volatility to align with a specific goal or time horizon. Comparing an income fund to an S&P etf is stupid. That‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúmy corvette is faster than your minivan‚Äù. It‚Äôs true, but it‚Äôs stupid because they‚Äôre designed to do different jobs. If you compare growth mutual funds to ETFs, it‚Äôs much closer. Then there‚Äôs quality. Most mutual funds are dogshit. There are a few ways to compare funds, but the easiest is Morningstar. It‚Äôs an independent third party that compares and rates mutual funds to their peers. A 5 star fund is consistently top decile in their category over 3, 5 and 10. If you compare a collection of 5 star growth oriented mutual funds to ETFs, they do very very well, and often outperform, even after fees. Most Canadians will need financial advice at some point. A good advisor is almost always the best source for that. The tricky part is finding a good one. Finally, I‚Äôve rarely tried to convert a self director or talk a client out of it if they want to start self directing themselves. But almost all of the actual wealthy people I know use an advisor. These people are smart individuals and understand the value of holistic management. A decent number self direct their TFsA, but they all use an advisor for their overall plan and management.",

At the very least shouldn't insurance fix my car and then sue the lady the $300 deductible ?? Can I get the police involved? What are my options??

      "content_preview": "I've seen a few posts lately asking whether it's even worth saving, so I thought I'd share a quick story. A few weeks ago, I was cleaning out an old filing cabinet and came across an investment statement from Investors Group. It was dated 2003, showed about $200 in an RRSP fund, and was registered to an address from two houses ago. Back in the early 1990s, I had been depositing $200 a month with them. Eventually, I moved my investments to TD but apparently, one of those monthly deposits got missed in the transfer. I made a phone call and booked an appointment with an advisor. (yes, I had to meet with an advisor) To my surprise, that forgotten account was now worth $965. Given the high MER of the fund, I was shocked... I figured it might be worth $400 at best. I had completely forgotten about it, but this was a powerful reminder of the magic of compounding. Sure, it's not a life-changing amount, but it showed me how a small investment, even in an expensive mutual fund can grow over time. Hopefully this gives someone a bit of encouragement to start or keep saving. I know, cool story bro. I‚Äôll show myself out. Edit. My apologies,  I did use copilot to clean up my otherwise incoherent ramble and have fixed the telltale signs. I realize if I put this in an ETF it would be worth substantially more.  I cannot recall if they existed back then, and for sure IG would not have had them. I moved the IG account to TD in the late 1990's, this one payment did not get moved, so it sat there since whenever it was withdrawn from my bank account.",

Should point out that most people don't make rational decisions about real estate investing.  Most don't even know what they should be looking for or costs they should be considering. Investors in new builds are called speculators for a reason, they are guessing and betting on real estate going up no matter what the product is.  A sub 300sqft 1 bedroom is ridiculous,  bachelor's used to be bigger than that, 1 bedrooms needed to Be at least +500sqft People don't understand carrying costs,  new builds, budget that the condo fee is likely to double in fist 3 years because the original budget is old, and doesn't take most needs into consideration.   Mortgage costs, make sure you can carry it if rates increseÔºå5% was the norm to budget, but people got used to ultra low rates.  If you were paying it down like it was 5% from beginning when at only 2%, mortgage movements would not have made a huge impact.   You would have been socking away equity for a rainy day. figure out market rents and bank on not being paid for 2 months of the year.  Can it carry on 10 months rent after all expenses considered and have positive cashflow then it is no longer a speculative gamble but an investment. Investments are supposed pay you money, you pay money to gamble, so if it doesn't positive cashflow and you have to pay to keep it it isn't an investment.   People prefer to gamble than actually invest because proper investments are boring and don't get the heart pumping.",

Reading other posts here it seems that making a homeowners claim is not the best but even my credit card requires I claim on my home owners first before I get their coverage. Is that right? Or do I eat this?",

      "content_preview": "My husband and I had been moving all of our accounts over to WS as we liked the simplicity of using the robo advisor and having all of our accounts together.  We finished moving them all about 18mo ago which resulted in us becoming generation-level account holders (>500k). A few weeks ago my husband received an email that stated his accounts were permanently closed and that he had 30 days to move his accounts to another institution or all of the funds would be liquidated.  At first he thought it was spam, but then realized that he couldn't login on the app or web.  Calling WS, they told him that it was real, all of his accounts would be closed and he had 30 calendar days to move everything.  They would not explain why, stating that they didn't have to give us a reason.  My husband tried several times over the next few days to escalate this situation and get some sort of information, we believed that it was an error as we cannot think of any reason why our accounts would be flagged. One lower level employee was shocked when we explained what was happening, he looked at our accounts and could not understand why and resolved to get to the bottom of it.  We didn't hear from him again. We have RESPs, RRSPs, TFSAs for us and the kids and a few random stocks that we are holding.  We are both T4 employees and do automatic monthly transfers for savings.  My husband receives RSUs from his employer a few times a year, these are transferred to TD and then to WS as we weren't able to connect the RSU company and WS directly.  We do not send/receive foreign funds or large transfers from family members, we don't transfer with anyone else.  We don't do anything that looks like day trading.  Our accounts are boring and I believe quite standard, I can't see anything that we've done that looks risky or suspicious. We have received no information, other than a list of links for the terms & conditions of each account type we have.  They refused to tell us even which account was the one that broke the rule.  They continue to state that they were within their rights to do this and they don't need to tell us why.  They have told us that my husband can never open a WS account again. We have been moving all of our accounts, but the process has been arduous.  WS removed my husbands access entirely and would only send pdf statements so each account had to be moved manually by filling out forms.  Some of these forms were rejected due to errors (ie. some accounts types can't be moved in kind) so they had to be re-done.  The new FI said it could take up to 20 business days to transfer the accounts so we are now at risk of having our accounts liquidated if the transfers don't complete in time. My main concern now is that whatever activity we have done that has resulted in us being banned will continue at the new FI and then we will be kicked out from there as well.  This situation has cost us >40 hours of time this month and it's not something I wish to repeat.  Is there any way we can get more information to figure out what has caused this to happen?  Is there any recourse?",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I really need help and advice because I feel completely scammed by a Rogers door-to-door sales agent, and now I‚Äôm being told I owe over $1000. Here‚Äôs what happened: ‚Ä¢\tBack in January 2025, I was with Telus Wi-Fi when a Rogers/Shaw sales agent came to my door. ‚Ä¢\tHe told me there was a special promotion where: ‚Ä¢\tRogers would pay Telus directly to cancel my existing plan so I wouldn‚Äôt be on the hook. ‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôd get a $200 promotional credit on my next two bills. ‚Ä¢\tSince I already had a Rogers mobile plan, he said I might be able to bundle for more discounts. I believed him (so did my roommates who were there) and signed up under my name because I was already with Rogers for mobile. What actually happened: ‚Ä¢\tNone of his promises were real. No $200 credit, no Telus cancellation paid by Rogers. ‚Ä¢\tInternet speed was terrible, and he even convinced me to get Shaw TV. The installer came with a broken adapter and barely knew what he was doing. ‚Ä¢\tWhen I tried to reach the sales guy (he had given me his personal number), he first denied making those promises and then stopped answering my calls completely. I contacted Rogers customer service, and they said there was nothing they could do and that if I wanted to cancel, I‚Äôd have to pay $300 for breaking the contract. I ended up canceling because the service was terrible, but Rogers kept charging me for two more months even though I wasn‚Äôt using their services. Now, a collections agency is calling me saying I owe over $1000. This feels completely unfair because I was misled by a Rogers representative. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What can I do here ‚Äî should I contact the CRTC, Commission for Complaints for Telecom Services (CCTS), or a consumer protection office? Any advice would really help.",
