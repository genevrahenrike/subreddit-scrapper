This, of course, routinely gets debated now with a forward looking lens - are we in a bubble, who can afford to own a home, likely evolution going forward. This article instead looks backwards and crunches the numbers in different cities in Canada over the past 20 years and uncovers that ... it depends.We can debate the methodology, of course, and his specific assumptions. But I think it supports the belief thatNeither financial market investing nor (residential, leveraged) home ownership is a clear winner in long-term return as an asset classWinners have been those who have pursued a disciplined savings and not overly reactive investment strategy...Which as historically been psychologically easier with the forced discipline and lower liquidity of home ownership...But is far from the only way, hasn't necessarily been the best way recently, and so is not the be-all and end-all going forwardOf course, there are unfortunately many Canadians where finding affordable housing (rented or owned) is an immediate-term challenge. This post is focused instead on the received wisdom that somehow the path of home ownership, if only it were attainable, is obviously the preferred one to achieving long-term financial stability. It's more complicated.",

My salary is around CA$58k a year. Before this, I only worked part-time and minimum wage jobs. Right now, I live alone. I don't have any family here in Canada.With this money I want to save, not obsessively but enough for future trips and meetups with friends. I want to spend on things I love like building my dream computer, buying clothes, improving my diet, getting a hobby (buy a piano) :) ! I want to enjoy my life to the fullest.I've always lived frugally, Now I’m earning more, so I don’t want to waste money, but I also don’t want to save so much that I can’t enjoy life.I’m not great at investing and I don’t want to waste money. Should I get a financial advisor to help me invest? I’m not very confident with investing. what do you guys suggest I should do?Thanks you!",

      "content_preview": "As someone who has worked in debt management and in collection for 8 years, some advice.1st Anyone who owes debts: should read collection laws in your province, and you will learn what actions the creditors can take and can't take to recover the balance. As well as under which circumstances you are protected under consumer protection act. For example some provinces if balance owed is less than 5k and some 2k they can't take legal action if the debt is older than 2 years form the date of your last payment they can't take legal action. Any debt older than 6 years can't be collected and should be removed from the credit bureau and so many more ways.2nd, most banks, especially the top 5 banks in Canada they have options that can help you with your debt. For example, if you owe something on your CC and pay normal interest 21%. You can change your visa type to something with lower % and can help you with your monthly payments or freeze you interest for 3-6 months and pay just $10 a month which you can contribute more to bring principal balance down. Banks also offer low interest consolidation loan and pay your debts directly for you but you must qualify for that the pre qualifications is very easy and most people qualify as long as they still hold decent credit score above 450 and don't owe CRA any tax money.Same goes for PLC and mortgages they have few temporarily options that can help you for few months and some long options as well. Just call them to deal with it first before you're acount is assigned to 3rd part collections.3rd If your debts are already sent to collection, make sure what I mentioned on 1st point  read. Since you are already with collections you're credit score is already fucked because after a month or 3 they will report your debt as a collection iteam on your credit under the trade line. At this point you can make the decision to somehow come up with the money to pay or just tell them to fuck off and ignore the calls and emails and letters. Which you can also ask them formaly to stop contacting and they will stop the  calls and emails. If its significant amount they can take legal action( again my 1st point) but most collections they don't want to pay for lawyers fee and go to small claims court. Also when you file is in collection feel free to offer them 50% of original debt as settlement.The older the debts gets there is lower chance of collecting them so they would have Settlement options and it will depend on your negotiation skills how far down you can push them.4th if you Can't pay your debts in full(PIF) or settle it in full (SIF)  and your making small monthly payments that is not doing anything STOP IT you are wasting your money it's like your dropping a stone in ocean it won't do any good for you and Creditors they don't care you will end up paying them and they will continue charging you interest and your principal balance will not be paid off. unless it's some type of arrangement that after some monthly or weekly payments, your debts will be paid off.5th, this is not 100% accurate for everyone it's different with Equifax  and Transunion. Everyone reports to one of these two or both. Any late payments can bring your score down somewhere from between 40-50 it depends, collection iteam around 200 score and how you use your credit and manage your bad and good debts can bring your score down and up, and credit bureau gets updated quarterly. If you read how to utilize your credit after you pay off your debts or you have a bad credit score, it can really help you to build a credit score, so you must read about this too.6th Bankruptcy, consumer proposal is not free, and not everyone will qualify to file it unless someone offers to do it for free for you. Also, if you have income higher than your total owed debt, you can't file, and you can't include any secure debts. Also, if you are a co-signer on an account and one of your files for bankruptcy or consumer proposal, the other person is still liable, and the creditors can come after you to collect. It is best to do debt consolidation if you run out of all options.FYI I just wanted to post this because a lot of people don't know they are protected under consumer protection act and it's always good to know what you can and can't do in case of your debts and where to ask for help.Hope this helpled a little, there is alot more to be said but I don't want it to get too long best to read online and learn ways to get out of debts and manage it better.",

During our conversation the topic change to how best for a single elderly person to protect her nest egg in retirement, how to protect oneself from scammers etc. My friend is pretty financially literate, she has fully invested registered accounts, plus a pension and some investment in non-registered accounts, all filled with low cost etfs. Let's say when she retire at 65 she has a nice nest egg of 3 million (not that much 30 years from now), what is the best way to protect her nest egg in case she becomes disabled, demented, incapacitated, etc? We did not have any good ideas, but she raised the point that even though annuities are poor financial investment, but at least one can convert a lump sum of money into a month payment, making it harder for scammers to take everything at once. What are some good methods for a single elderly to protect her financial nest egg?",

On the buyer’s side, it feels like the value-add is minimal compared to the conflict of interest baked into their commission model.Am I wrong here? Have any of you actually had realtors go to bat for you as a buyer — or are they really just along for the ride until they get paid?Edit 1: Just for context I have worked with 3 different realtors (different purchases) it seems most of them these days are looking for low-hanging fruit...

      "content_preview": "1. Stop getting price-gouged when you shop online.The ultra-rich obviously have personal shoppers to compare prices for them, but most people don't have that kind of time…I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but Capital One Shopping has always worked well for me and I'd recommend trying it (link here).When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will automatically compare prices for you, and auto-apply coupon codes when possible.2. Your home equity is a gold-mine. If you need cash, stop taking out high-interest loans.So many people take out high-interest payday loans – please don’t do this. If you get into trouble you can typically get a relatively low-interest HELOC (a home equity line of credit).Essentially with a HELOC, you’re borrowing against the equity you have in your house and use it for whatever you need (much like a credit card).Typically, you’ll get lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms compared to traditional loans.Here’s a calculator you can use to see how much/little you could borrow (link here).Side note: if you hate debt, you can still get money out of your home’s equity by using something like Hometap, where you more or less sell investors a portion of your equity without a loan)3. Switch auto insurance companies every 6-12 months.If you haven’t compared auto insurance rates in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$400/year¹).Example: I cut my car insurance bill by ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers (same exact coverage too) and it took me a whopping 5 minutes.Take two minutes and pull up a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, Auto-Savings.com is fine too) and compare multiple offers from different companies in one go.Worst case scenario: you stay with what you’ve got. Best case scenario: you save a few hundred dollars a year.Here’s a link to a good comparison site: link.4. Get yourself a dang advisor.Most people are under the false impression that financial advisors are just for wealthy people.They absolutely aren’t: if you have a net worth of $100k+, you can typically qualify for an advisor. Having an advisor can boost your yearly net returns by 3%¹.If you don’t have an advisor in your family, use a site like Datalign to find somebody with good reviews in your area.5. You don't have to pay off your debt by yourself.Very few people know about it, but If you have $10k+ in debt, you can technically ask a debt relief to come in and take over the process for you.It’ll typically save you 23% off your total debt, after fees (according to NDR, a big debt relief company).They’ll negotiate with your creditors and try to get your debt reduced (then they take a cut of the savings).Typically people who are struggling with debt save 23% on avg. when they ask for help from debt relief companies.Here’s a little calculator you can use to see how much you’d potentially save: link.6. Save on home insurance.Some homeowners save $1k+/year just by switching home insurance providers (typically saving them more than changing auto insurance policies).If it’s been over a year since you’ve reviewed your rates, it might be worth taking a few minutes to compare offers. Here’s a home insurance comparison site I’ve used: (link).",

The TSX performance this year and my upcoming mortgage renewal in the new year has me wondering if it ever makes sense to take your capital gains early and make a lump sum on your mortgage.My HELOC balance is ~$130k (I've been capitalizing interest). My investment portfolio is a basket of Canadian dividend stocks, that essentially resembles XEI, it's currently worth ~$150k.Hypothetically, on Jan 1st, 2026 I could liquidate my portfolio, pay off my HELOC, and be left with $20k to use as a lump sum when I renew my mortgage. I could then restart the Smith Maneuver with a lower mortgage payment, and more HELOC room. Any capital gains tax would be due when I file my 2026 taxes in Spring 2027.My plan with the Smith Maneuver has always been to pay down the mortgage component as quickly as possible, hence why I've been buying dividend stocks. I haven't 100% decided what I will do after paying down the mortgage, but I'm leaning towards liquidating investments and paying off the HELOC rather than maintaining an interest deductible loan.I haven't thought this out completely but am I missing anything from my thought process? I'm not sure if this seems impatient, or like some version of timing the market.",

I remember the suggestions of maximizing the grant portions, but nobody ever underlines the idea that you’d get back your contributions in as little as 10 years.",

About a month ago we booked a nice one to Costa Rica (nice resort), through Costco Vacations leaving home early Saturday morning (flying AC of course). Now, due to the looming flight attendants' strike and cancellation-notice policies, I'm in a real financial dilemma. I've done as much investigation as possible into cancellation policies with the travel agency (Costco) and the credit card I used to pay for the trip (TD Aeroplan Visa). So it looks like I can either wait until midnight tomorrow - if there's a strike the airline will cancel and refund the airfare but I will be on the hook for $6-7k resort fees - or I can cancel the resort today with a 10% non-refundable on their fees and (drum roll) of there's no strike then we can travel but won't have a place to stay. Have I left any stones unturned to minimize my losses, given the complete uncertainly of the airline strike tomorrow night?? TIA for any thoughts!",

      "content_preview": "I’ll share a couple that have helped me out in the past:It pays off to be an early bird, at least on one day of the trip. Specially in very busy cities like Rome or Paris, making the effort to be up before dawn and walking around will help you experience a very different vibe of the city, not to mention amazing pictures you can take without the crowds and with nice, golden hour lighting. In a lot of Europe, it doesn’t get light so early, so it might not even be too much of a sacrifice to do.Stupid and Cheerful. I think I read it here sometime ago, but I’ve tested and it’s true. Cheerful always works better than aggressive when having to deal with an inconvenience, and playing a bit dumb turist might get you out of some light trouble.While a lot of people know that it’s a smart idea to always check out a hotel’s or appartments official site instead of booking on a travel platform, a lot of people don’t know there is a free tool you can use that helps you find the right place and even compares the price for you. It’s called Directo extension and it’s free to use.What are yours?",

Want to get up, read and write all day, exercise, watch a movie with a friend, and go to sleep. Eat super cheap. Not an expensive lifestyle at all.Financially, any reason for me not to retire and watch Netflix all day if I live in a rural area where cost of living is quite low? Zero interest in living in bigger cities like Toronto or Vancouver. Rural Alberta or Saskatchewan is totally fine for me.Only considering financially for now, nothing else. Yes retire?UPDATE: Thank you ALL who have responded thus far, very much appreciated. In response to some of your queries, I may not follow through with retirement, but for now just wondering how possible it is. Sounds like it is and the consensus \"yes\" agrees with my numbers as well. Will also have a dog or two which I know can be expensive (especially vet bills in case of health issues), but if I'm living on 40-50k/year I figure I should be fine. Will also have a part-time gig writing, but income not guaranteed. Worst case scenario is what I've described above, my income levels can only go up from there. Yes, factoring in other things as to whether to retire, but for this query only considering the financial aspects and those milestone numbers. Totally agree with many posts that retirement could get boring, etc. and totally considering all of that as well. But for now, only considering the financial aspects and worst-case scenario numbers. Right now, just knowing whether I have the option to retire and live the lifestyle I (think) I want is enough for me. Yes, kind of terrifying being \"out\" of the workforce but equally satisfying is being able to walk my dog, work on projects I want at home, and other things I want to do (music, gardening, etc., and community social activities too).The thought of not having a regular income is terrifying, as well as leaving money on the table by leaving the workforce. I think we're conditioned to keep making money as long as we can, but it comes at the opportunity cost of living each day entirely on our terms.Thank you again! Will try to get back to many of your follow-ups and appreciate the time you took to respond.",

For example VEQT did 12.2% out of which 1.4% were dividends.So it's 10% growth.Just these 3 if I leave alone are projected to grow quite a lot.TFSA might go to 970k in 22 years, tax free, @ 8% returns. That's 38k/year without tax @ 4% withdrawal/yearRRSP : 360k in 22 years @ 6% returns. That's 14.4k/year, taxable @ 4% withdrawal/yearholdco: 2.2M in 22 years @ 8% returns. That's 88k/year, taxable @ 4% withdrawal/year.If I pay 50% in taxes, that's still 38k/year + ( (14.4+88)/2 = 51.2k ) = 90k of after-tax money + whatever will come from qpp/cpp .Are my returns estimates reasonable ? What would be some worst case scenarios ? I tried doing some Excel calculations where I invest aggressively for 17 years and last 5 I switch to safer etfs but the numbers are somewhat similar.Just curious to know when others are stopping to put money in for retirement.",

      "content_preview": "1. Overpaying for car insuranceThe average American saves a whopping $410+ a YEAR (source) when they switch auto insurance carriers - sometimes significantly more than that: I saved $1,300 this year.The reason: some carriers offer discount prices to new customers when they switch.Take 30 seconds and go to a 3rd party comparison site (Coverage.com and Auto-Savings.com are both fine) to see if you can find cheaper rates. You’ll likely save yourself a bunch of money.Some people suggest switching every 6 months, that's a little bit overkill imo. Once a year should be fine.2. Overpaying when you shop onlineBig stores like Amazon know that no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites, so there’s often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices.I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but Capital One Shopping has always worked well for me and I'd recommend trying it (link here).When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will automatically compare prices for you, and auto-apply coupon codes when possible.3. Dealing with debt on your ownIf you’ve got $10k+ in unsecured debt (think credit cards, medical bills, etc), you can ask a debt relief company to come in and negotiate it for you. You typically will save around 23% on average (after their fees).Here’s a link to a savings calculator from National Debt Relief's website if you want to see how much you could save: link here.4. Not having a financial advisor.You know why so many rich people have financial advisors? It isn't because they're better at picking stocks (spoiler alert: they're not)It's because a good financial advisor will help you with all of the bizarro tax implications you never would have thought of. People with financial advisors end up making ~3% more/year thanks to better tax planning.If you don't know an advisor personally, use a 3rd party comparison site to find somebody with good reviews (WiserAdvisor is solid).5. Using normal, low-interest savings accountsI'm always shocked at the number of people still using garbage savings accounts that pay 0.5% (or less) a year. There are literally hundreds of banks that will pay you 8x that, usually 10x that rateHere's a link to a bunch of options.--There are tons of other things (obviously) but these are the ones that I see the most. Hope that helps.",

      "content_preview": "This is my fault, so lets get that out of the way.In 2023 we were fortunate enough to buy our first home and I took my RRSP out. I can't remember for sure but I don't recall the form saying anything about classing this as an HBP withdrawal, it was just withdrawal. So, subject to tax. This was a crazy time and I didn't claim it on my income tax nor did I opt into the home buyers tax credit.This week Manulife sent the docs to the CRA causing my income tax to be reassessed, so I did an adjustment on that tax year, claiming the RRSP withdraw was for home buying, submitted my purchase agreement and all the proof I could find to also claim the tax credit. The $10,000 tax credit will above and beyond cover this RRSP amount as far as income tax goes -- the issue is actually the claw back on my child tax credit from 2024.But now I'm doing research and I see that manulife classed it as income, withheld a chunk for tax and submitted it to CRA. I can't get anyone who understands anything on the line at Manulife but what are the chances they adjust the withdraw details? Foregoing that, has anyone successfully convinced the CRA to adjust it anyway? I have a T4A, I have since filled out and submitted a T1036 and of course never received a T4RSP. Been on phone listening to music at the CRA for 36 mins :)",

      "content_preview": "Hi folks,Looking for some general advice on next steps with property purchasing.I currently own a 3br leasehold trailer (in trailer park) that is rented for $2100/month. Pad rent is 390/month, loan is almost paid off (payments are 500/month until then). Most recent BC Assessment was 170k. It's in a town with very strong, long-term rental demand. I'd like to keep it for the rental income if it makes sense (and I love my tenants).My job is very secure, 80k/year, government, union position. I currently rent ($1400/month) in a different town to where my trailer is. Not planning to stay here long term, looking to move somewhere more affordable and quieter. One option that's appealing to me is to purchase a 3br house in a town that has long-term appeal to me, and rent it out in the meantime until I move there. The area I'm eyeing off has a high rental demand.I'm not sure how to calculate whether it makes sense to sell the trailer to muster capital funds towards this goal, or keep it and somehow leverage that into the deal. Not sure how that would work exactly - can I take a HELOC (or similar) to make a large down payment on the new home?I'm looking for advice on how much spending power I'd have with either option. Not sure how the leasehold/trailer factor affects things - would banks see the trailer property as a liability, or a benefit? Would I be better off with keeping the steady rental income to bolster my ongoing funds? Or better off selling it to get the lump sum and using it that way?Also curious about the tax implications with neither of them being my primary residence (initially).Thankyou for reading all this - happy to add in any extra info that I haven't thought of.",

      "content_preview": "Hello,On July 21st, I made two separate deposits at an RBC branch in Montréal, both above 1000$. The first one went through, but once the bills for the second deposit were sucked in, the machine took a long amount of time to count them, only counting two bills, before completely shutting off and becoming unusable.One of the employees there witnessed the situation and told us they would have someone come in to check the machine and that the deposit should be made in the following weeks.It has now been six weeks. I called several times to ask about it.The first time they told me it was still being checked out, and I would have to wait a bit longer. The second time I was told there were no investigation going on, but that they would start one to start one and make sure it was handled. I called again in mid August and once again they told me there was no issue, that I should receive the money by end of August/first week of September.Now I called again today, and their response was that it had already been handled, and the two 20$ bills that were stuck in the machine had been credited to my account. So, they had mistaken my two deposits as one, since one had gone through already, and they hadn't accounted for the second one, only the two bills that were stuck in the machine. I explained what had happened, and they told me they would start another investigation, this time with the \"higher bureau\" and it should be handled in the next few weeks.Now it's already been 6 weeks, it was a large sum of money (for me anyway) and it's quite exhausting as well as stressful and I'm afraid they might reach the same conclusion as before, since it has been four times now. In my mind, this could have easily been verifiable as there are cameras there and an employee that witnessed the whole thing. I'm sort of scared they'll deny me having made two deposits and I'll be left with the loss of over 1000$ that they lost.Is there anything else I can do? I needed this money for rent + school which has all been on hold and it's really getting to me. Any help will do, thank you",

I don't expect to be part-time forever, since I've made it clear that I'm done my studies and have a free schedule and I'm open to being full-time. I also plan to reopen the full-time conversation once the 3 month probation period ends.I live with my parents, have no major financial responsibilities and no major personal expenses either.My only debts are:Student loan (17k, $160/mo starting Nov)$30/mo subscriptions fees$100/mo \"fun money\" (variable value) ==== $300~ per monthI don't leave the house much since covid kinda decimated my social life so theres not a lot of worry about \"hanging out\" etc.My hobbies are pretty simple, I love computer stuff and to digitally draw and I love working out / hiking, so theres not many expenses there if any.With the way retail banks work, workers often rise up the ranks fairly quickly. Many of my colleagues & others I've spoken to have worked in my position for a year max, and then rose up. So my salary is subject to change for the better.What I'm thinking is to take advantage of my current position & lifestyle and save up as much money as possible. I want to reach that $100,000 mark because thats when compound interest really starts showing its strength, and I don't want to delay that benefit.What I have in mind is this:Keep my day-to-day banking and work paycheques at Big Bank for convenience.Use my Big Bank Direct Investing TFSA (not their regular TFSA savings) to invest my annual $7,000 contribution into ETFs.Open a separate HISA (EQ Bank, Tangerine, or Simplii) for excess funds above the TFSA cap, so I earn closer to 4–5% instead of what Big Banks offer (1.65%~).My ultimate, biggest goal is to honestly leave Canada for the US. The economy here is terrible, and given that I'm in banking, opportunities are much nicer in the US.Is this a solid plan? Should I consider anything else? I've heard of Wealthsimple but I've never used it. I know rates are subject to change, so I'll keep shopping around for which accounts offer the best yield.I have an appointment at a different branch with the same bank I work for financial advice, but I'm honestly not sure what to talk about aside from this. I know they'll push for me to sign up for their services no matter if I work for them or not, but I know online banks like Simplii offer way better rates so I'll likely decline.Please let me know 🙏",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I need some advice regarding the transferring of my TFSA. A few months after i turned 18, I opened a TFSA with, unfortunately, World Financial Group. I didn’t know then, but I do now, that this was a mistake :( the account has been open for 4.5 years now. The gains have been good, and it’s in an iA Financial account.I recently opened an account with Interactive Brokers in hopes of transferring the funds, but I’m not sure how to start the process and close my iA account. I asked my WFG agent “friend” but obviously they said there’s nothing they can do on their end to help and I would have to pursue this independently.Additionally, my employer does a 2% RRSP or TFSA match with Manulife. Now I’m wondering if I open another TFSA with Manulife and contribute the minimum to get the 2% match or just ditch my Interactive Brokers Account for the Manulife one completely? Or do I open another TFSA RRSP? My after tax income is about 62K a year, for reference.My current TFSA contribution room as of Jan 1 2025 is about $21,450. I have contributed 19,750 over the last few years in total, and currently with return on my investments in the iA/ WFG account, I’m up to $29,150.Need some advice on best next steps. 😊 thanks!",

      "content_preview": "Let’s get a few things out of the way first.I can’t sell the car as it will be seen as massively disrespectful if I do and I do not want to create family drama.I do not want to bring up any aspect of this situation to my relatives because I might be viewed as ungrateful which I absolutely want to avoid.It was gifted to me so I don’t have a car payment on it.I currently drive a 20 yr old japanese car that costs like $2000/yr to operate.The car in question is a big american suv well into the 6 figures (think cadillac escalade, ford expedition, etc, i dont want to be too specific here). They also bought 6 months of insurance for me which will expire soon.I’m literally so grateful that I own a new luxury car without a payment but the problem is it’ll still drain me dry. A full tank of gas is $200 which barely lasts a week, an oil change is like $390 at the dealer and ICBC is charging around $8k/yr to insure it. This isn’t counting depreciation as well which I’ve chosen to ignore as I can’t sell the car.From a financial pov, it makes total sense to just park the car somewhere safe and not drive it right?My income is around $100k before tax and I’d need to budget at least $18k/yr to operate it which is insane to me since I only spend $2k/yr currently on my old car.",

Some say we’re on the fence about borrowing this much, since average mortgages are around $600–700k. It feels like a very large mortgage for us, and this is our first home purchase.5 year planMarriage and kids are also part of our 5-year plan. While we could start with an older home, given our timeline we feel it’s better to buy in a good location now, close to family and well suited for raising a child since we plan to settle here long term.QuestionsIs taking on a$900k+ mortgagesustainable and reasonable for a young couple in our situation?Is saving$2k/monthafter expenses good enough?How can we protect ourselves if one or both of us lose our jobs?
