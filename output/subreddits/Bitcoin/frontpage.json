    "description": "Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.",

      "content_preview": "This might be a bit long lol, I am looking for feedback. Any advice is welcome, all I ask is please be nice :)I started investing in BTC beginning of July 2025. I didn't even know about it, but in my search for Retatrutide(GLP1 Medication) I found a comparatively cheaper company which only accepted BTC as payment. This was my first exposure to BTC. I downloaded CashApp and bought 800 dollars of it, paying 750 to the company for the product.With the 50 dollars left over, I wondered what to do with it. I would watch the numbers go up and down and eventually decided to explore reddit about BTC. I looked at charts of its crazy spikes and people around me had always talked about it being super risky due to volatility.I am in a unique situation where my parents pay for my housing(im starting a CC nursing program so i live at home), car insurance, and gas. I've been working part time as a CNA which has allowed me to have 1.5kish per month while going to school. Basically my only expense is food. My mom made me open a ROTH IRA in March of 2025. I only made 2.5k last year due to fulltime school but this year I had periods of working 40+ hrs per week so I maxed my ROTH as much as I could. I have 10.8k in the ROTH and plan to max it out each year till 30.I wanted to diversify my investments and since I am capped at 7k per year for roth contribution I decided to open a brokerage account with fidelity. I put 1.5k a few months ago into FXAIX and have left it alone. The more I read about BTC the more I am convinced it is one of the few ways Gen Z can \"make it\". With real estate having such a high barrier of entry and jobs paying like shit, BTC is the light at the end of the tunnel.I started randomly buying 25, 50 dollars of BTC when I saw it fluctuate, however my average BTC cost is 114k as of now since I didn't get to take advantage of the times it dropped to 100k and even lower early this year. It makes me so mad that I missed the 100kish price of early June because had I been one month earlier I could have secured a much lower price. Right now, I have only 0.01313507 BTC or $1461 if converted at the current fiat price.I have my account setup to DCA 10 bucks a day and I have been buying 25 or 50 bucks of it whenever I see BTC drop into the 108-109k range. My questions are as follows: Is this good for my age? Do you recommend I move my 1.5k in FXAIX to BTC, and if I do should I wait for more of a dip? I will likely receive a 7k bonus from my job this month so with that should I lumpsum regardless of price or increase my DCA? Any other types of advice is appreciated. I know i don't have much BTC right now and I am having a hard time putting in more money since it feels like btc is too expensive at 110k. it was literally 80k earlier this year man i feel like I was stupid for not knowing earlier but it is what it is. Hoping for a drop :/Also I plan to work a little bit each month to contribute to the Roth while starting nursing school later this month, anything extra I will use to fund my DCA for BTC.Thanks so much guys :)",

      "content_preview": "I had a nice thought pop in my head that I wanted to share. Bitcoin is the Ron Paul trade.Remember when Nassim Nicholas Taleb described the Bob Rubin trade? Named after Clinton treasury secretary and Wall Street financier Robert Rubin, the Bob Rubin trade is a trade that externalizes tail risk to a third party while providing ‚Äúsure‚Äù, small payoffs. These payoffs seduce the counterparty into accepting the terms of the trade without fully understanding their exposure. Think the US housing market before the crash and how buying real estate was a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù investment.I also remember congressmen Ron Paul and his courageous defense of the gold standard against fiat. While I sympathize with his cause, there was always one problem: he could never hold anyone‚Äôs feet to the fire, as he did not have authority over the central banks and their printing press (another Bob Rubin trade if there ever was one). People listened, they smiled, and nothing was done.Enter Bitcoin and its ethical counterplay. I‚Äôll say that Bitcoin is the Ron Paul trade, because it‚Äôs a trade between people who want sound and people who want an easy way out. The trade is as follows: so long as fiat prints, Bitcoin goes up. The asset is negatively indexed against fiat printing.The genius of Bitcoin here is that it actively punishes those who used this nasty trick to rip off hard-working, honest people from the sweat of their brow. They want to keep printing because, alas, this is all they know. Bitcoin says ‚Äúgreat! Keep printing and helping me deflate faster.‚ÄùInstead of trying to advocate for a fairer world, we simply win when the counterparty does what was always morally wrong to begin with.How cool is that?",

Ledger Nano X vs Trezor Model T? Keystone vs Coldcard Mk4? Or something else entirely?Would love to hear where the technical community is leaning.Edit: formatting.",

If you do self custody, please do yourself a favor and run your own nodes.Running your own node means you verify Bitcoin yourself.

Sure you can trust their nodes, but isn't this all we want? maximum sovoreignty? then you shall run your own nodes to verify that your bitcoin is real and unspent.If \"not your keys not your coin\", then \"not your nodes not your rules!\" running nodes keeps the dirty hands away from the network!Watch Bitcoin University video on how to run one, or Bitcoinnotcrypto video about it, btcsession have detailed guide about it too.It's very easy to setup, and simple.Hardwares that you need is simply: Working computer (could be work machine or spare, mac, Rasbery, Linux, Windows), Free storage 1-2tb & Stable internet.To sum it up, have free space, download bitcoinknots from bitcoinknots.org > let it run > download sparrow > connect your sparrow to your own nodes > connect your hardware wallet to the sparrow. That is it. To add one more thing, always verify your download (hash) of each (knots, sparrow, anything else) with pgp suite.Very-very worth it!!!!Do more research about it yourself and study why it's VERY important.",

      "content_preview": "Bitcoin is now an alternative currency that has its supply limited, so, all things being equal, if the supply of dollar money rises and/or the demand for it falls, that would likely make crypto an attractive alternative currency. At the same time, it has important disadvantages in a time of turbulence, such as that it can be monitored and potentially controlled by governments, and it's conceivable that its programming can be cracked with new technologies. Also for these reasons, it's not likely to be a reserve currency, while gold is the third largest reserve currency that governments, as well as people, hold when they feel that they are threatened by others. It also has a much longer and well-established track record, though it has its drawbacks too. For that reason, I have a little bit of Bitcoin and a lot more gold, but the most important thing is to have alternative moneys that are effective storeholds of wealth because most fiat currencies, especially those with large debts, will have problems being effective storeholds of wealth and will go down in value relative to hard currencies.",
