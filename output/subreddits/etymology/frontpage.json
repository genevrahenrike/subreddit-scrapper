I think the phrase is older than that and originated in vaudeville, which had no set start time.  When the bill of acts started up at the point where you had entered, you would realize you had seen all of the acts, and you would leave, perhaps turning to your companion and saying, \"This is where we came in.\" instead of \"Let's go.\" Example of the use of the phrase: The last line in the 1937 Preston Sturges movie \"Easy Living\" My friend wants a reference establishing the origin.",

      "content_preview": "I was just watching season 1 episode 1 of the original Addams Family show (1964), and about one minute in the mailman says to the truant officer “Good luck, Charlie” in regards to going in to meet the Addams family. I tried to search the origin as when I heard the expression I thought it was in reference to the Disney show of the same name. All that google provides is information about the disney show, which was created much later. There is one quora post saying the same thing as me. The writer says that they’ve heard the expression said to them much before the Disney show was released. It seems to just mean good luck in a situation that they know will not go well. However, Id like to know if anyone knows when this phrase became popular.",

      "content_preview": "I recently noticed something very unusual and possibly unique about the English word SEPARATE. Etymology: Latin separare = se- (“apart”) + parare (“prepare, arrange”) Old French separer = “to divide, part, set apart” Middle English separate = to divide, isolate, distinguish Modern English: separate retains this meaning What’s striking: if you rearrange the letters of SEPARATE, you get “SEE A PART” A perfect anagram. Even more astonishing, the phrase “To see a part”  literally defines what the word does: to notice or isolate a part of a whole. Is this just a linguistic coincidence? It’s a demonstration embedded in the very structure of the word, the hidden anagram mirrors the semantic function of the word itself. Not only that but the whole phrase “ To see a part is to separate” alludes to something much deeper within the philosophy of perception itself, in order to see something you must separate it from everything else; form from space, figure from background, tree from forest, wood from tree etc. So, interestingly, the word separate seems to behave in a way that i can find no other word to do. It contains within itself its own definition as a phrase. You must apply its own action to itself in order to reveal the phrase by separating the word into the phrase and the phrase itself describes the very essence of perception and consciousness itself as a mechanism of separation of the whole into parts. I sum it as follows: TO SEE A PART IS TO SEPARATE The word contains the phrase. The phrase explains the word. The act reveals the meaning. Perception requires Separation. Anagram. Aphorism. Axiom. Aphogram I. By Tayonn Brewer (The Psyche Deli) *Aphogram (n.): An aphorism encoded as an anagram. A short maxim that performs its own definition and description.

      "content_preview": "What do Alan Alda’s surname and the city of Łódź have in common? These proper names are in fact cognates, both derived from PIE **Holdʰu- , alternately reconstructed as *h₂eldʰeh₂ or *h₂oldʰeh₂, meaning “dugout canoe”. This word changed very little, in either meaning or pronunciation, through Pre-Germanic **Holdʰō(n) , Proto-Germanic * aldǭ , and Old English ealdoþ . But there the trail goes cold. I can’t seem to locate any words in Modern English that derive from this root. Does some obscure dialect in some faraway corner of England or Scotland still preserve a reflex of ealdoþ , as an archaic, very local, or deprecated / slang word for something like a wooden boat or trough? I’m comparing in my mind the etymology of English nesh , “cold-intolerant”, which is usually described as archaic or local slang by most English speakers who know the word at all, and almost disappeared from Modern English entirely, but in fact has a pedigree that can be traced all the way back to PIE. “Boat” is what the Polish word łódź means. In the Nordic languages, this word took a semantic jump overboard, as it were, and became alda “wave”, which is the origin of Alan Alda’s surname. You could say it’s an * oldi but goodie, hardy-har-har.",

But what’s actually happening in terms of chemistry and physics is that the metal object’s atoms are simply entering into solution with the acid. So by this logic, wouldn’t it make more sense to call this process “solving” and to use “dissolving” for the process of precipitating things out of solution? Now, having taken a few languages now I know their evolution seldom follow logic like that. So what’s the story here? If the word “dissolve” predates the chemistry usage of the word “solution”, then I wonder why chemists picked that word instead of something else. And if it’s the reverse that’s even more strange since the “dis” prefix seems totally at odds with the physical reality being described.",

      "content_preview": "I have done my research online and I know that it originated from AAVE. However, my question that I could not seem to find an answer to online is: What specifically about the world cool made it transition into a slang? I first assumed it was due to it's association with temperature, as opposed to an angry person like a \"hot-head\", leading to associations with calmness. I tried to research from my assumption, but got nothing. What I am specifically asking about is the etymological roots of the word \"cool\" itself as slang. The type of answer I am looking for is for example: \"rizz\" comes from the middle syllable of \"charisma\", dropping the \"s\" and adding two \"z\"s.",

      "content_preview": "The term \"hero\" hasn't always been synonymous with \"good guy\". In ancient Greece, a hero was often defined by their strength, extraordinary feats, audacity/courage...not necessarily being defined by their moral goodness. Greek heroes, often of divine or noble lineage insert Zeus joke here , were revered for their prowess in battle and bravery in the face of nigh impossible odds, regardless of their methods or personal flaws. For example, Achilles, a renowned warrior in the Trojan War, is considered a hero despite his pride and rage, which led to the death of his companion Patroclus. Similarly, Odysseus, while celebrated for his cunning, also used deception and displayed infidelity, actions that might be seen as morally questionable by modern standards. Over time, the concept of a hero began to incorporate moral and ethical dimensions. During the Middle Ages, the ideal hero was often associated with chivalry, honor, and adherence to Christian virtues. The Renaissance further emphasized virtues such as justice, clemency, and honesty in the definition of a hero. This era had heroes like St. George who slayed the dragon and King Arthur who was a fair and just despite his origins. King Arthur's woes specifically stem from those around him that fall to sin and vice (unchristian, and thus unheroic, behavior). In modern times, the definition of a hero has expanded to include individuals who exhibit selflessness, compassion, and a commitment to the common good. Today's heroes can be ordinary people who perform extraordinary acts of kindness or bravery. The focus is no longer solely on fears of strength but must include moral integrity and a positive social impact. This is primarily seen in children's entertainment like The Higglytown Heroes and Paw Patrol where heroes are nice people that help others without expectation of reward or praise. The best modern example is Superman who is meant to symbolize hope and justice in their most uncorrupted form.",
