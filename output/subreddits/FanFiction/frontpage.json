      "content_preview": "My main fandom has almost 50k fics on AO3. Out of those, almost 10k have zero comments. That’s one out of every five fics and that number is insane to me. Some are short, some are long, some have thousands of hits and dozens to hundreds of kudos, yet no one, not a single person in years in some cases, has stopped to even say a simple \"nice, loved it, thanks\". The oldest fic with no comments is (or was) from 2013. Someone posted that twelve years ago, at the inception of the fandom, and they didn't get a single comment since. That hits me harder than I expected. Now, I only came back to fandom recently after years away, but I’ve been trying to chip at that number. I always made it a point to leave comments on anything I read, no matter how long or short. Just to give someone that small kick of dopamine that will get them writing again. And yeah, I know that it's impossible to fix a lack of comments for 10k fics all on my own, but even a couple comments a day on short drabbles feels like a small win. This post isn't for myself as an author. I nuked my account (for non-comment related reasons) and haven't posted anything since. I'm not here to fish for comments for myself, but for other people. So here's my challenge: take five minutes, go on ao3, and search for your fandom with no filters to see the total number of fics. Then filter for fics with <1 comments. See how many fics are sitting in silence and feel the heartbreak. Depending on your fandom's size, you could be looking at anything from tens to thousands of fics, like I am. Anywhere from hundreds to possibly tens of thousands of collective hours spent planning, drafting, and writing, agonizing over research, small details, character accuracy, titles, and tags. Only for all of that work to smash into a wall of absolute silence. Writing fanfic is ultimately a labor of love, I know that. Authors should do it primarily for themselves. No one owes anyone comments, sure, but by that logic, no one owes anyone fics, either. Fandom thrives when everyone gives back for every bit they take. So thank you for reading my PSA/vent. And thank you on behalf of all of the authors whose days were made better by someone leaving a nice comment. Now go and chip away at your own fandom's silence.",

      "content_preview": "Today while l was looking around for writing tips, I came across one of the worst pieces of advice I think I have ever heard for writing. When I lose interest in a story (and it does happen), it tells me that I need to change the story, but not abandon it. If a character bores me, then either I need to kill them off, write them out, or - and this is where it really gets nasty - torture the complete hell out of them. When a character seems to dull, write a backstory for them. In that backstory, you have to severely traumatize them, emotionally, physically, or both. Interesting characters have baggage and we can feel the weight of it when we read. I feel like people sling around the weight of trauma onto their characters without knowing what it means. Not to say you can't write characters without trauma, because when it's written good, it's interesting and I enjoy it! But it feels like a lot of modern writing hinges on trauma being a character's main trait. My thoughts on the matter is that, if you can't write a good character without trauma, then adding trauma doesn't magically fix that. Do not just sling trauma onto characters because you feel like it, it's a topic with a lot of nuance to it, and it should be treated as the heavy subject it is! Go forth, write traumatized characters! (I have a few of them myself-) But please, handle with care.",

I'm not talking about things that are heavily implied to the point that it actually is a legitimate interpretation of canon, I'm talking about things that simply did not happen. Specifically, fanon ideas that started in fanfic spaces and then became so popular that lots of fans actually treat it like canon. Can be things you like or things you dislike! I'll start: In Supernatural fandom, Dean Winchester having been physically abused by John on a regular basis, while Sam never or rarely was. It's already unclear if their dad being physically abusive happened much at all, but especially the idea that it happened a lot AND that it only happened to Dean is... pure fanon. In canon adjacent materials he IS canonically physically abusive, but exclusively towards Sam, never towards Dean. Yet, this is an extremely common trope in Supernatural fics, to the extent that many fans genuinly forget that it didn't actually happen. I would love to hear your takes.",

      "content_preview": "Especially in anime or cartoons I've always noticed that if someone wants to potray a \"bad\" and \"evil\" character, they give them a unattractive appeirance. I understand that especially in visual media, character design can do a lot, in a way that evil repulses you ebcause of their appeirance or the hero's appeirance seems pleasant, so we sympathise with the character more easily. But it also just perpetuates stereotypes, that ugly people are inheritly bad, and beutiful people are angels in human form. But also, I understand another reason why this is done. If a villian is physically attractive, they will be romanticized, even if they literally killed babies and commited terrible atrocities in the story.  And have you ever seem a morally grey character that wasnt attractive, especially talking aboout the love interest or someone whos clearly supposed to be simped over? No, coz if they were average looking, or forbid ugly, their actions would not seem so hot anymore, but that they're a asshole. But I got a bit off topic, what also annoys me is that when a physically attractive antigonist is included, not because of fan service and romanticization reason, its in a evil stepsister/highschool mean girl type of way. \"Haha, Im pretty and youre a ugly loser, I have a pretty boyfriend, and I totally wont be humbled at the end of the story and my boyfriend wont definatelly leave me for the ugly loser nerd girl in the meantime.\" Anyaway, I think that if it isnt somehow actually significant to the story, characters shouldnt be written so often as \"pretty\" or \"ugly\", but just characters. This might help with fixing the same body and face sydrom as well. In the real world, people arent usually one extreme or the other, but somewhere in the middle. Giving your characters their own unique desigh, not caring if they end up looking beautiful or not, unless the appeirance is supposed to be a plot point. This was a bit of a long rant, but what are  your thoughts?",

I mostly watch shows that are mostly white(supernatural, ncis, and pll), but i want to add more poc to the mix. When i do people have been much less likely to interact with my stories, but i’ve seen those same people complain about people using the same face claims over and over(popular with those shows would be phoebe tonkin, aj cook, nina dobrev, etc). It’s a bit discouraging and i’ve taken down my stories cause of it. Not just on my own stories though.

I’ve been reading quite a bit (from various fandoms), and so naturally I thought that I might want to give it a go. However, I am an absolute beginner at writing creatively, but I have written quite a bit in other disciplines, so I thought I’d try it. I do have a fandom and premise in mind, but I won’t talk about that because it could skew the responses. I’d just like to get some general advice, methinks. So this brings me to you, O lovely reader! What do you find helpful to do/keep in mind when you’re writing, and what do you think writers should avoid/be conscious of? If you have any other comments I’d love to hear them. :) Sincerely, a fanfiction rookie.",

Hate comments are low-hanging fruit, I have never received nor seen on a fic I'm reading a hate comment which was not a bot. The one that sticks out to me more, though, is the abandoned work marked complete. I've seen some fics do that before, but they've always got something saying they're abandoned or incomplete in the summary, tags or title, and I've never read a fic that surprised me with that at the end.",

I'm sure it's fine, I never directly copy, and it really helps me get over the hurdle of starting or ending scenes (the most difficult part for me). Hell, this might just be the way you get better at writing, since it's similar to a observe-and-do method used in art lol, but I just wanted to ask about it because other than practice, I never really hear people explain how to get better at writing aaa",

It's all very confusing and it makes me sad and yapping to strangers on the internet sounds reasonable right now :/ that's just my little thought piece I guess",

The longest I had before was a 4.7k word fic, but that was just a series of silly 100-word drabbles (that I ultimately never finished…and probably never will, oops) I know it’s a rather small amount compared to what some of you have been writing, but I only just got back into writing fanfiction recently after an 8 year hiatus (last time I wrote was when I was a cringy teen) and this is only my 4th fanfic since coming back from the hiatus. It was a character study on one of my favorite characters, exploring a missing scene from the canon material in detail. I’m so happy that despite a lack of motivation at various points in the writing process, I managed to see it out to the end and I’m hoping one day I’ll be able to write an actual multi-chapter fic to break the 10k barrier 💗 I have various new fic ideas for my current fandom (it’s genuinely rekindled my love for writing) so hopefully that will soon become a reality!",

I've always loved writing, and I've experimented with different styles, etc. After struggling with years of anxiety and depression (the good ol' 1-2 combo), I've gotten back into writing again, specifically SI or y/n FF (generally not my actual name, but an OC of my likeness). I cannot tell you how much joy it has brought me. I can literally sit at my computer for hours, just writing, spilling the world that I've built in my head into a word document. However......as a neurodivergent individual who also happens to work in the mental health field, I know it's ridiculous to be embarrassed over a hobby, but I still feel shame. My husband doesn't even know that I write FF, especially the y/n stuff. He likes geeky things and writing, too, and while I don't think he would judge me, I still find it hella embarrassing. I mean, he knew I was weird way before we got married lol. Why do I do this to myself? I feel guilty for keeping this secret, like I'm doing something bad . I need some consolation, knowing that I'm not the only person who struggles with this 🥲 Edit: words/grammar Edit 2: Omg I wish I could respond to all of these comments. It feels so good to know I'm not alone 😭💜",

I am British, so naturally I use British English when writing most of the time (colour not color, etc.), but it just feels quite out of place in this one. I mean, the characters are talking in full southern accents, and then in the next line I describe something in the most obviously British way of all time. Though it pains me to do so, do you think it would make more sense for me to switch to American English for this fic, for a better sense of consistency?",

      "content_preview": "I recently joined a fandom that I've really been enjoying. After a few comments on some fics, I was invited to a discord for the fandom. I've only been there a few days, but they've been super welcoming. I mentioned I was rereading a fic by name and said I really liked the chemistry between the pairing. Someone mentioned that they had been the target of a harassment campaign by the author of said fic and detailed some of what had happened, mentioning that it was all documented by said author. I'm not going to go into detail for privacy's sake, but I was beyond horrified. I did not chase this down as I think it would be really bad for my mental health to go down that rabbit hole. It kind of broke my heart just hearing about it, and I know I'd be a wreck in their shoes. Until this point, I have managed to steer clear of all fandom drama in any fandom I've been in. Like, literally all of it, I've never even been aware of any. I've never seen a nasty comment firsthand, never come across anyone being inappropriate, and certainly never dealt with it myself. I'm kind of at a loss. I have no intention of getting involved, because like I said, I think it would seriously affect me, and I feel like we are all way too old for this kind of behavior in the first place. But I'm kind of unsure how to feel or what to do. Is it wrong to separate author from work and keep enjoying this fic in the future while just avoiding interaction with the author and never mentioning it again to the affected party? Or am I now obligated to step away from a fic I was sincerely enjoying as one of my favorites in the fandom? This is entirely new territory for me and I was wondering what you guys would do in this situation. I feel like I stepped into a minefield. Are there other authors I'm now supposed to avoid too? Do I just never mention a fic by name in this discord again just in case they're part of this mess also? Besides the occasional comment exchange, I've never really known the people behind the works I read, and now I feel like I've been doing something wrong for years without even knowing it. I'm pretty sure that's overthinking it but I could really use some outside perspectives.",

I recently published my first multi-chapter fanfic. My heart was pounding when I hit post. The first comment called it “so good I teared up.” I almost logged off but then I realized this is exactly the community I needed.
