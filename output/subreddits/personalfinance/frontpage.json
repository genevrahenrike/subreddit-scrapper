      "content_preview": "So long story, my dad owned a house and gave it to me in his will. My sister filed probate to which I became executor to because she showed up to court with no lawyer like an idiot. The whole thing was a shit show and incredibly drawn out for someone with minimal assets my siblings just wanted to make things hard for no reason. So finally once probate came to and end 2 years later I was free to get the house put in my name. So I transferred myself the deed and filed it with the recorders office. Next I go to get the mortgage assumed and this is where things get weird. So before probate ended I was told by my lawyer that under the Garn-St. Germain act I could just assume the mortgage without refinancing which is what I wanted to do given my dad had a 0% interest rate. I've been trying to get in touch with them for weeks and when I finally get someone on the phone they said that \"those kind of homes are not assumable\". Now my lawyer has closed out probate months ago and had stroke since then so as of right now I'm having to navigate this on my own. After doing some digging I think my dad's home was a habitat for humanity home but even with that being said everything says I can still assume the mortgage under the protected circumstances of inheritance due to my father's death. Does anyone have any knowledge about this? Or what I can do or do I just continue to pay the mortgage under his name?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all!So I have been working in the USA for around 10 years. I am not big of an expert when it comes to 401k, retirement, etc, so I usually follow the guidelines provided by the companies I work for. Now, I have saved around $75k in my 401k (71k pre tax and 4k roth).I currently contribute around 50% of my max yearly contribution ($12k of a max of $23.5k), which is around $550 per pay period (twice a month). I feel like I could contribute more, but I would have to cut some expenses like travel and entertainment. I live alone, no family and I rent (NJ literally next to Manhattan). I make around $100k at work.I am afraid I am WAY behind when it comes to building my retirement funds (I lived and worked in Italy before moving to the states in late 2014) and I'm also afraid I screwed my future. My company matches only 1% of my contribution, so that's really little (but I like my job and they pay me well).Can someone with more experience than me give me advice?EDIT: I am getting downvoted to oblivion yet the answers I'm getting are great and positive. Did I do something wrong?",

I used to be not great at managing my finances, over the last year ive improved a lot, but i think hes doing this to show me just how much i can be saving, so im cool with it.Now last week I wanted to withdraw a bit for a bday present for my grandma, which he sent me, but I also asked how much is in there, i thought it would be around $7k or so, and then he flat out says $76,000. I was so confused.He told me that the rent i have been paying him (i live with my parents) for last 5 years or so, hes actually been putting in this secret savings account, and then he was also matching the amount I put in.Also, I live in Australia and this in AUD.I dont know what to do with this now, and im hoping people here can give me some solid advice so it doesnt waste away. And no im not going to spend it on frivolous stuff, i want invest it and grow itFrom what i know i should diversify it, should i buy like stocks? crypto? gold or silver? I really dont know what the options are with this stuff.P.s I wont be using this for a investment property, thats something ive been working on for a while and am looking at getting one early next year, the deposit I have separately, its just a very complicated family matter on that situation, so i wont get into it.Any and all advice is much appreciated!",

Also, leave me pretty much everything in the house except their personal and sentimental belongings. Most would jump on this deal in a heartbeat, but being 20, just starting on my career, I only make about $20 an hour plus OT, Shift differential, etc, etc. My house payment with Escrow is approximately $ 1,500 a month, which is about 50% of my net income every month. After receiving the first-time homebuyer grants, my closing costs will be around $ 6,000, and that's it. But also having the stress of having to pay my bills and feed myself on $1,500 a month will be tight, but also I have the feeling that this is too good an offer to pass up, and if that means I need to eat ramen every day for the next few years till my income improves, that will be something im willing to do.

I only have about 500$ out of the 4,000$ I make a month in bills for car insurance, cell phone, gas, and groceries. I obviously want to move out been planning on doing first time homeowners' loan and getting my own house instead of renting and I also have a girlfriend who can help with monthly payment to live with. but what I'm asking is just to get some ideas what to do with my money? I want to become financially free obviously like most people would but I in the past year or so have put aside all unnecessary things in life no partying no drinking or drugs so that I can work hard now and enjoy the rest of my life. retire early, start a business, invest, learn a high-income skill etc. I'm curious what you would do in my position any small ideas or tips will help just doing some research and going to try to make the best decisions to better my life. thanks for any information!",

      "content_preview": "Last year I went on holiday to America and I had a skiing accident and ended up in hospital (torn ACL, the classic). I had insurance when I went over for winter sports, so my insurance company could cover the medical fees. HOWEVER, this dumb ass hospital I was treated at (they completely misdiagnosed me) will not stop harassing my family friends in america for my bill even though my insurance company said they have sent a stamp of payment to them numerous times. The hospital has been asking me to pay them directly (which is not how UK insurance companies work) to then get reimbursed by my insurance - which won’t work with the contract i signed. This was so long ago now that I emailed the hospital today and they have told me it will be going into bad debt?!?! WTF DOES THIS MEAN? Am I now never going to be let back to america because of this? Is there some big black X on me? It’s not my bill to pay😭😭😭😭😭. Americans please help!!!!!EDIT: This blew up way more than I expected and I really appreciate everyone’s help thank you!!!!!UPDATE! (if this sounds bizarre this is just how UK insurance companies often work overseas). My insurance company sent a confirmation/ validation of payment to the hospital the day after my visit to them. The hospital never put two and two together and essentially lost the document, therefore didn’t have the correct billing information and hence why they have been harassing myself and my family friends. Absolute idiots lmao. 8 months of pain with this bollocks !",

      "content_preview": "i saw something similar posted but wanted to post my situation.So I got a job offer in a new state (LCOL) that I have never been to, or visited. I virtually toured this apartment and liked it, and got the deposit free because im subletting off of someone who broke their lease early (due to relocating for a diff job i believe). The rent is $1050 for a 1 bed 1 bath. Now it's time to sign the lease (they have 9 month, 10 month, and 12 month lease, possibly 3) but I am being told by family members that it's smarter for me to rent a hotel for a month, or an airbnb to get a feel of the city and the job and if I hate it, I can leave with no venality. I am also scared that I could be laid off, and then i'm stuck in a lease I can't get out of. Hotels for a month I checked are around $2000 - $2500.So, should I rent a hotel, get a feel, or just sign the lease? I could also ask them to hold off on the lease, visit for one night (400 for flight + 134 hotel) and see how the city is, but then the area could be nice and the job could suck.",

      "content_preview": "Parents are both in their mid-70s, dad is still working. I couldn't understand why he wouldn't retire, despite both him and my mom having significant health problems, and why they wouldn't hire help that they both obviously need, such as with housekeeping and yard work. I finally sat them down last night to talk about it and he told me that he's worried about money. But they have over a million in retirement savings that they haven't touched, plus Social Security, and their house is paid off and valued at about $400,000. They have no other debt. They don't lead an extravagant lifestyle. They've always been fairly frugal and lived within their means. We live in a low COL state. Dad told me he's worried about medical bills, but they have Medicare and a supplement and it sounds like the $5,000 deductible is the most they'd ever have to pay out of pocket. I could see one or both of them ending up in a nursing home due to their health issues, which is probably the biggest financial question mark in this situation.Dad has refused to sit down with his financial planner to discuss all of this because the financial planner wanted him to calculate his monthly discretionary income, but he \"doesn't know how.\" This man has worked in a job for decades that involves managing large organizational budgets, so I think this response is more one of overwhelm and anxiety than not actually knowing how. I did finally convince him to call the financial planner and have a discussion about this instead of continuing to avoid it, so that felt like a win.I'd love to hear anyone else's take on this situation. I'm an only child with no other family nearby, so it's all on me to help them navigate this, and I don't exactly know what I'm doing.EDIT: Thank you all for your comments, this has been very helpful! I want to add a little more context to answer some questions.My main reason for wanting my dad to retire is that I don't think he's up to it physically or mentally anymore. He commutes an hour each way. He's started working from home some, but it's still too much for him. He had a triple bypass a couple years ago and hasn't been the same since, and he's now in the process of getting diagnosed with what we're pretty sure is Parkinson's. He is actually planning to retire at the end of this year, so this is less a matter of trying to convince him to retire and more a matter of trying to ease some of his anxiety about it.Some years ago he had a lawyer friend draw up his and my mom's wills, powers of attorney, and advance directives. All of these documents need to be updated for various reasons (for example, their PoAs name each other, not me) and all the copies they have are unsigned/un-notarized. This same lawyer friend advised them that they did not need a trust to protect their assets, and perhaps they don't; my grandmother died in a Medicaid nursing home and it was terrible. I would rather they spend their money to be somewhere slightly less miserable than set it all aside for me to inherit. That said, if there are more sensible ways to set all this up, we need to explore them. I will find us an estate planning attorney to discuss this.I did offer to go with my dad to the financial planner and he was noncommittal, but I think I will call him tomorrow and reiterate that I want to go. He did seem open to my help, if very anxious about the situation. We have not had a very good relationship for most of my life, so it is a strange shift in dynamic for both of us.I appreciate all your comments, and to the couple of people who said they hope their kids never try to interfere with their finances, I sincerely hope for all your sakes that they never have to.",

For the remainder years of my grandfather's life, my grandmother would pester my grandfather on the money and he  would say it does exist and mention a vague bank. The thing is we didn't believe my grandfather because he had a stroke and his speech and memory was not good.  My grandmother went so far as accusing my mother of stealing it. That was obviously not true. Which cause the huge fracture in my family.Fast forward to 20 years after my grandfather's stoke and 10 years since he past away I see people in the NYC subreddit reminding people to make sure you claim your unclaimed funds etc.Out of curiosity I entered my grandfather name in the system NY comptroller website and to my surprise his name came up. His name was linked in a bank vaguely similar to the bank he said it was at, to an address that of a restaurant he frequently visited. I distinctly remember my family getting a call from the restaurant 2 years after my grandfather had a stroke, but the caller never informed us of why they called. They only asked where he was and what happened to him.The funds was reported to the state in 2014, two years after he had past away. Earlier this year I looked it up in the NYC system and it was still there.But now, with the website revamped I can not locate the record.I was able to locate the record!Keep in mind this \"missing money\" was a HUGE point of contention in my family. My grandmother claimed it was XXX amount of money, where my parents said any money was transferred to her when my grandfather was alive.I want to do two things.Confirm it is his unclaimed moneyInquire how much is the unclaimed money (if this is worth pursing) as this inquiry could potentially open up a can of old wounds and worm.",

I have access to a 401k through my employer, but no match.Right now, we both fund our 401k to the annual employee pre tax contribution ($23.5k). I have recently learned that my employer’s plan allows me to contribute an additional $46.5k after-tax contribution into my 401k and then convert it to my Roth IRA. If I do this, however, we would be extremely cash strapped - my paychecks would be only a few few hundred bucks. We are considering cutting back my husband’s 401k contribution to only hit his employer’s match, so that we can free up some cash flow so that we can contribute more of my paycheck to my 401k. Is there any downside of doing this?A bit about us - our HHI is about $320k, expenses are about $10-12k a month. We are 30 with no kids (yet).",

      "content_preview": "So this is going to be kind of long and it's my first time posting to this community so apologies if it seems drawn out.So I live in Maryland and my mom passed this weekend and why this is relevant is because I can't tell if I'm in a good spot or a bad spot. We live together she had a house. It's around 53,000 left on the cost of the house she did not put my name on the deed. Before she passed we were able to get it notarized a new deed that would make me a joint tenant but she passed before it has made it to the Deed process right now it's going through the lien process. My thought is worst case scenario the loan is unassumable I already contacted the mortgage company and this is before she passed about the loan. From what I'm understanding I will just about have one of three choices one once I notify them on my mom's passing they either let me continue the payments, make me refinance, or they tell me I need to pay for the home upfront.I'll be honest I was not making the best financial decisions in the last few months I did manage to put myself in some debt and I was behind on One credit card and its gone to collections for $2,000. With the money she's left I was able to pay off about give or take $13,000 in debt. So that knocks out just about all the credit cards I'm waiting for one other insurance amount to come through and that'll be the last $6,000. With that I'll have about 6,000 left in a savings and then from her I'll receive maybe 60 to 70,000k give or take in life insurance. I already covered her funeral cost and things that are associated with it.So now is this weird Crux of making sure I can afford things including the home. Trying to navigate what's going to actually happen with the house my mind is like worst case I'll be able to pay for it anyway but I can't imagine I'll get a 5% interest rate like she did 25 years ago. These are the numbers that I've run and I'm trying to see if anyone else thinks they're realistic.I don't have a car I use public transportation and Ubers and lifts to get around. I split my cards up so that one is a bucket every two weeks for the mortgage one is a bucket every two weeks for saving and one is a bucket every two weeks for like living life.My bi-weekly check is about $1,900 a week it is a salary position.Bills: Water: $190 avg (due 21st)Gas/Electric: $200 target (covered; $150 credit sitting for Sept)Verizon: $75 (next due Oct 7)Comcast: $70 (paid Sept 3, next Oct 3)Roth IRA: $200Life Insurance (Northwestern Mutual): $75Yoga: $75Financial Advisor: $69.95Subscriptions: $32Savings and Investment:HYSA: ~$6,300 now, +$550/month going forward.Mini-Savings: $81 now, +$100/month going forward.403(b): $23,292 + $116.35/pay + $116.35 match (≈ $466/month).Roth IRA: $1,300 + $200/month.Traditional IRA: $5,300 (no new contributions).TOD Account: $10,630.Discover Checking cap: $350/pay for transport, food, fun.Uber/Gym rides: estimated $100–150/week max → needs bus/scooter support to keep within budget.Mini-Savings cushion: covers small overages without dipping into Marcus.",

The insurance company decided to total it and sent an offer of about $10.5K.  I went on cars dot com and searched that make/model/year within 50 miles of us and found 4 listings averaging about 12.5K.We pointed this out and said “can you do better?”  The insurance company came back with “well, there was pre-existing damage” and a couple of other caveats.  But the end of it was “in the interest of helping, here is a revised offer.” $12K.  We pretty much got $1500 for doing an Internet search and sending an email.  Always ask for more.",

I have 20k in a HYSA, 12k in personal checking, and 125k in 401k. I put 20% of my income into 401k and my company matches 100% up to 7%.I just recently bought a condo after selling my previous starter home and renting for several years. I put 100k down and the condo was purchased at $216.5k. 6.25% which I plan to refinance once rates get down to the 4's.My payment is $950 with a $250/m HOA.I live fairly modestly and am pretty frugal.My bank account will fluctuate but generally stays the same or increases slightly when I don't have unexpected expenses or splurge on something that I want or need.The condo is about 18 years old and is above a restaurant. I realize that it will probably need a new HVAC and other repairs soon.Am I stretching myself to thin with my financial situation?What would you change if you were in my place?Thanks!",

We have been in a stable and healthy relationship, we often stay together anyways for a lot of the week, switching back and forth between places. We live in California.So, this would be happening August of next year, when his lease ends. His credit is around 800, making around $110k a year not including his raise at the end of the yr. He has about 4 years of good rental history. All were houses shared with roommates.Mine is a little under 600, making around 50k, I work in education with stable income. No rental history, have a car payment that was never late on. Made lots of progress in increasing my score since getting a car payment. Never been evicted or anything, don’t have outstanding crazy amount of debt like student loans, he doesn’t have student loans either.I know it’s different in other states. Will no places accept us because of this difference? It is not an option for us for only him to apply, we both have to together. Both names must be on the lease. For context, we would be looking for a place to share with budget of ~$2500. I just want to know if it’s possible, especially in California where it’s so hard to live literally anywhere.",

I’m about to receive a workers comp settlement of $36,000. On the surface, that sounds like a blessing - but for me, it’s scary too.I have a gambling problem. I used to blow money on crypto trading and casinos, and I’m working hard to stay gamble-free. I’ve been clean for a while now, but I know myself, and having a lump sum of money like this could be a huge trigger.I don’t want to go back to old habits. I want to use this money in a way that helps me build a stable future - saving, investing responsibly, maybe even setting myself up for long-term goals after graduation. But I know if I’m not careful, I could spiral, and I really don’t want that.Please, I’m asking kindly: I’m already in a fragile state, so if you respond, I’d appreciate no hate, judgment, or meanness. I’m not proud of my past with gambling, but I’m trying to do the right thing now.Has anyone else here been in a similar situation - coming into money while battling addiction? What worked for you? How did you protect yourself from temptation? Are there practical safeguards (like accounts that are hard to access, annuities, or professional help) that made a difference?Thank you to anyone who takes the time to share thoughtful advice. Even just knowing I’m not alone in this means a lot.",

He was court ordered to provide me with insurance, but he recently switched me to one of the worst plans possible, so they only covered about $60 of it. Now he’s telling me to set up a payment plan with the hospital so I can pay it. I’ve asked him multiple times whether the bill is under my name or his, but he refuses to tell me and instead tries to guilt trip me into paying it. I honestly don’t care if I end up paying, but since he won’t give me any actual details I literally don’t even know where to pay it at. I don’t want to risk my credit getting completely screwed if it’s under my name.Edit: the comments are getting a bit much to respond to individually but imma just make sure the debts not in my name and not tell him anything he got the bill so he knows what he has to pay and there’s no reason for me to tell him I’m filing myself under taxes since he legally shouldn’t be doing that anyways and he knows thatUpdate: I called the billing department and they said I didn’t have a debt under my name so I’m just not gonna worry about it",

      "content_preview": "I’m not sure what to do. The housing market is terrible. My house has been on the market since February, and I’ve lowered the price by $25k and I’m losing money. Feedback from showings have said the price is fine, they just don’t like the layout. I had to move out of state for work, and I’m basically paying rent and paying for the house. I can technically afford it for a short while, but it’s really stressful being able to maintain it from far away.When calculating how much it would be when putting it up for rent, my property tax would go up about $2.5k, and insurance would also go up about 25%, then I’d have to pay a management company…. If I set the rent to comparable amounts in the neighborhood, i wouldn’t be able to break even.I’m getting frustrated letting it sit. We’ve gotten a couple offers but they backed out. Showings have slowed to maybe 1 a month. We are also getting offers from resellers but I’d have to pay a ton out of pocket for their cash offers, and it is too risky to let them take over my loan. What is the best option? Continuing to let it sit? I can’t imaging the market getting any better…. It’s just so hard to worry about it from half way across the country.Edit: Maybe I should redirect the question a bit. I’m pretty sure it doesn’t make sense to rent it. What are my financial options if I have to pay out of pocket for the difference in sale price and remaining mortgage balance? I have maybe $50k or so i could probably pay out of pocket, although I’d prefer not to. Is short sale or foreclosure the only options if the difference is more than what I could afford? Would I have to dig into my retirement savings? What happened to people in 2008?",

      "content_preview": "I don’t know what to do. My mom never took care of her teeth and avoided the dentist for years, and now at 74 she’s losing the rest of her teeth from a severe infection. She’s lost so much gum and bone that dentures won’t stay in. My uncle, who she lives with, said he can’t cosign because he’s retired, so he asked me to. But I’m really worried.The loan for implants is huge, and my mom’s health is fragile ... I’m not sure she’ll even make it through the 36 months it will take to repay. She would be using her Social Security, about $1,100 a month, to pay $500–$600 toward this loan.At the same time, I need two implants myself that will cost around $4,000, and I was planning to finance them. I’m scared cosigning for her will hurt my ability to take care of my own dental needs. I feel guilty saying no, but if I say yes, I risk being stuck with a loan I can’t afford and undoing all the progress I’ve made paying off my credit cards and rebuilding my credit.What should I do?",

If I keep going it will take me another 4 years to pay off my car.However, that payoff quote has been soooo tempting. If I paid it now it would save me a little less than 3k in interest. On the other hand, I'd have to build my savings back up and only be left with about 3 or 4 months savings if something out of the blue happened to my job. With how long it takes to apply and find something new I'd much rather have at least 6 months.I also am currently renting and buying a house is definitely a goal of mine in the next few years. Not only would I need savings, but I'm not sure how my credit would be affected as my folder is pretty thin aside from this loan (I'm young).I think I'm just really enticed by the idea of having a paid off car but would love to know if I'm missing any of the logistics or if this is an obviously dumb or not so dumb idea.",

      "content_preview": "Yup, just took $200/mo off my monthly payment by sending an email to the mortgage co.I'm 1) pumped how easy this was but 2) pissed I didn't do this 2 years ago.We bought our house in 2020 and only put down 10%.  I have not been paying anything early because im in no rush to remove the cheapest debt i have (3%). Our home value (as most have) has gone up a lot since we bought in 2020. I just passed the 20% equity line based on original home value, but the mortgage company doesn't automatically remove PMI until you hit 25% which in my case would've been 2 more years. All i did was fill out a 1 page form and email it to Service Mac and they took off the monthly charge. Cant believe how easy that was.The bummer is that because of how much home values have gone up in my area (Southern NE), my equity level based on current value has been above 35% for like 2 years.. which means i couldve done this very simple task much earlier.Im a lurker by trade but feel compelled to share this with as many people as possible... if you bought a home with less than 20% down between 2019 and 2022, please, please, go check with your mortgage company and see if you can have PMI removed early. $200 a month may not be life changing but it does offset some of the big increases in taxes and homeowners insurance from the last few years.",

      "content_preview": "I’m 21 years old and I recently just parted with girlfriend and was covering the rent, groceries, both phone bills, and more but you get the idea. I was strapped for cash 24/7. Well now that we split I moved in with a longtime friend who’s (simply put) very well off and has welcomed me in rent free, doesn’t ask for money for groceries, lets me use their vehicles (no gas bill) so needless to say my bills are for my phone and insurance for my own vehicle. I moved out as soon as I turned 18 which was pretty stupid because I didn’t take the time to learn ANYTHING about keeping the money you make. I’ve just spent it this whole time. I’ve learned slightly about 401ks and other investments but I truly have no clue where to start. I’d like to start putting away 80% of my weekly paycheck for at least a few months. Any advice helps!!Edit: emergency fund, retirement and 401k is going to be where some of it goes. I plan on investing into stocks as well after learning a little more about it.Another edit: I didn’t mean 80% into a 401k. Sorry for the confusion I meant 80% of my paycheck into a broad range of different investments.Third edit: I agree it looks like I’m totally leeching off my friend, but we’ve been friends since my childhood, they’re 5 years older than me and took care of me like a sibling since I was about 4 years old. We fell out of touch when he moved for a job when he turned 18. He came back two years ago and we’ve been just as close since. I’ve asked a couple of times and he blows it off and says to stop bothering him with that. Like visible annoyance when I ask to help out with the money or move out until I’m 100% stable. It’s been almost a month week since I’ve asked and the most annoyed he’s got at me was when I smoked without him.Fourth edit: I asked for financial advice. I do value all your comments but I don’t need anymore regarding how to help out around the house. That’s not finance. Thank you thoughI’m understand the importance of a 401k but what about money that I’d like to spend and use often would it just be a high yield savings account? Is there anything else that I could use to have my money grow and be able to use it similarly to a HYSA?Update: a commenter brought up how I should put away 1k a month into an HYSA as if I was still paying rent, and once I end up moving out offering it to my friend as a lump sum.  Since he refuses to make me pay rent maybe seeing it all in one place would make him feel different.",
