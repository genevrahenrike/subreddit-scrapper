      "content_preview": "I’m a career fed and have some significant health problems that have already secured a remote work agreement for me. Unfortunately, there’s little doctors can do other than keep me medicated. Since my health issues greatly interfere with my work day, I’m contemplating applying for disability retirement. I’m currently at about 19 years of service and will likely begin the process next year (doctor wants to try a few things before I go all in on disability retirement.) My question is about my TSP. I have a brokerage account with fidelity as well as my TSP. About 60% of my nest egg is in the fidelity account and the rest in my TSP. I wonder if in retirement, it’s better to leave my TSP as is and pull from it as needed, or roll it into my fidelity account. Of course the guy at fidelity says it’s better to move it to them as I’ll have more control over it but he concedes that leaving it alone will be a lower cost. Anyone have any insight on this? I didn’t expect to have to think about this stuff for at least another decade but here we are. If it matters, I’m retired military and have a pension. Between that and the pension I would receive from federal retirement, all of my bills will be easily covered. The only time I would need to pull money from my nest egg would be for large purchases such as if I need a new roof or new A/C or a new car or something. Other than that, I doubt I’ll touch the nest egg much.",

For example, some employers allow after tax contributions up to $70k per year, which is combined including employer matches and employee contributions. It doesn't appear that aftertax contributions above $23,500 and below $70,000 (combined) are allowed in the TSP. Can someone confirm this?",

      "content_preview": "Currently 7 years into my fed career at age 37 with approx 30 working years left before full social security retirement age (or eligible for earlier federal retirement a few years earlier) $175k all in “C” traditional TSP $60k Roth IRA $10k HDHP/HSA Currently maxing out trad TSP, Roth IRA, and HSA annually. At GS 14 earning approx $166,000. Current federal tax bracket is 24% and living in an income taxed state. Assuming I stay in this position forever until I retire, my FERS + social security at 70% replacement of my wages would be about $115,000 a year. An annual retirement income between FERS and Social security at $115,000 would put me in the 24% tax bracket already? So any withdrawals from my TSP would be taxed at 24% upto $192k, at which point it will be 32%? At max TSP contributions annually, it should easily be over $1 (or 2+ million) at retirement? At a base 24% tax bracket, some TSP withdrawals and future required minimum distributions, would likely be in the 32% tax bracket. This means I should be switching my monthly contributions to Roth TSP asap? Worth trying to pay the taxes on the Roth contributions now? Best case scenario is to keep my annual retirement income in the 24% tax bracket? Other consideration to continue contributing in traditional TSP is in case my future spouse doesn’t earn as much then I can withdraw more from traditional while staying in the 24% bracket or below? Am I missing any other investment vehicles? I have 403b funds from a previous employer that I haven’t rolled over into TSP because they offer other types of mutual funds. Better to diversify? I have a personal stock account but long term capital gains is 15% up to $533k so selling stocks this shouldn’t make too much of a difference? Would appreciate any thoughts or insight yall might have 🙏🏽 Update: thanks for all the insightful replies! Sounds like the best case scenario is trying to max retirement income within the 24% bracket ceilings and contributing the rest in Roth to avoid 1) the higher 32% tax bracket, 2) RMDs, and 3) taxes for beneficiaries. I’ll probably leave the balance I have in traditional so far but consider conversions (within the 24% tax bracket) to Roth (available starting January 2026) when the traditional balance grows too large. Second update: based on my napkin math with current income and tax brackets, if my pension and social security puts me at $115k, I don’t want my traditional TSP required minimum distributions to go over $192k into the 32% tax bracket. If you’re born after 1960, the RMD age is 75 and the distribution periods is 24.6. If my Traditional TSP approaches $2million, divided by the 24.6 distribution periods equals $81k that must be withdrawn. By my calculations pension, social security and RMDs on a $2m TSP  would be close to the 32% tax bucket. I’m planning to convert my traditional TSP into Roth slowly over the years to stay below $2m",

Met with a financial planner to see if I was in good shape to retire (I thought I was but wanted a second opinion). Bottom line is that with my pension, FERS supplement, and TSP I’m in great shape. Here’s my question. Do I roll my TSP into an IRA with Fidelity or someone else and have them manage it? I kinda feel like I lucked out with my TSP by simply staying in the market for 35 yrs. I like the idea of having the money managed by professionals when I retire BUT the fee seems kinda crazy. They’d charge 1.1% which would be a lot each year. Some friends have retired in recent years and they rolled their money into Fidelity and have it managed. They say the fee is worth it and they’ve done very well. Others I know simply keep their money in the TSP and self manage. I know there may be strong opinions one way or another but looking for opinions, perspectives, pros/cons… TIA",

Is it just because the I Fund is extremely volatile, to the point where even a 1%-5% contribution isn't considered worth it? Or am I missing something?",

Details I will retire in December at age 60 and begin receiving a monthly pension (100% survivor    benefit) of $4500 /month in Feb of 26 . FERS pension of about $600 /month (I only served in the federal service 14 years – from 1990 – 2004) in Jan 2028 Social Security of about $1300 /month if I take it at 62.( Jan 26 ) My wants to continue her part time job she loves so...  I have a gap of about $2500 /month to fill for 2 years. Assets I have a traditional TSP with a $800K balance. My Roth  IRA - $300K My wife’s Roth - $250K Other investments ( brokerage account – collection of etfs) about $800K No debt of any type – paid for house and all that.... Question How should I fill the gap? Annuity rates are relatively high for the TSP right now.  I could take part of it an annuitize it to generate a guaranteed income to fill the gap.  That would lock in the relatively high rate but would lock me in after a time I wouldn’t really need as other stream start to flow two year later. I could just pull out $2K per month for two years and see how it goes... What are your thoughts? Ideas, opinions?",

Someone gave me that advice to start maxing out my TSP contributions when I moved from an 11 to 12 because my take home pay would effectively remain the same. I did that, and increased my TSP contributions every time the IRS changed the maximum contribution. I’m 45 now and I have $1.09M in my TSP. If I could go back in time, a few things I would have done differently would be to (1) invest exclusively in the more aggressive funds (probably what I do now—80% C and 20% S) instead of lifecycle funds, (2) I would have changed to the Roth option as soon as it became available, and (3) I would have taken a retirement class when I first started working for the Government (I think it’s good to take one out of the gate, mid-career and end of career). I’m hoping to not have to rely on my TSP in retirement, so I’m willing to be a little more aggressive as a result. My home will be paid for before I’m 55 and I hope to retire at 62. My parents live paycheck to paycheck and never really had investments of any kind, so I very much appreciate the advice I received as a newer federal employee. It’s made a big difference for the financial outlook of my family.",
