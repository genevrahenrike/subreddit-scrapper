I've implemented it at various customer facing operations and it has tremendously improved our communication and operational efficiency. We use workflows, huddles, lists, canvases pretty much everything that is available. We are sending over 150,000 messages a month and integrate a whole bunch of partners and vendors using guest accounts and slack connect. I'm really disappointed in how they are operating. The idea that 30% of their work is being done by AI. That they are automatically turning AI features on unless you know better and turn it off. Pushing everything to self service. I had this perception that I found this amazing tool but it is quickly getting crapified. It's entropy... I spend about $60k a year on it but I am seeking alternatives. I also have an influence on a whole lot of organizations and how they do business. I don't want to do it because it will be disruptive but it slack is going to continue to shove it's ai trash on my face I'm going to find an alternative.",

I find myself constantly switching between channels, trying to figure out what needs my attention versus what's just noise. There's this constant anxiety of \"did I miss something important?\" whenever I step away for a few hours. I'm spending way too much time just sorting through everything to find what matters. I'm wondering if this resonates with anyone else here. Do you experience this kind of Slack overwhelm in your workplace? How do you currently manage the information overload? Have you found any strategies, tools, or workflows that actually help cut through the chaos?",

You type a few words, it shows grey suggestions, you tap one or hit space, and boom—complete message. It’s insanely handy. Am I completely off-base? Anyone else think Slack should do this? Or better—did someone already try building this? PS: I got very very curious and ended up building the laziest, glitchiest prototype (it's an app that runs only on my laptop—for now).

When I’m on my phone, I like to check my job slack on my own terms, and I don’t want to constantly be getting pinged on my phone with all my slack notifications. But it doesn’t seem like I can turn on/off mobile notifications for one workplace without doing the same for the other. Seems like it’s all or nothing, but can anyone confirm? If there is a way to do this for one workspace and not the other, can you walk me through how to set that up?",

We're convinced that the solution is not yet an other tool, or some AI summaries no one reads. We think people don't want to leave Slack. They just want a workflow that actually works inside Slack. This is why we built George . George is a bot that lives in Slack knows about the deadlines, who's on what, gives you visibility inside Slack and nudges things fwd. We see it as a team hygiene tool, that works on a per-channel basis, rather than a personal assistant that reads all your Slack. It's early. And honestly, we're not sure if people care enough to want this problem solved. That's why i'm here. Looking for some honest feedback !",

      "content_preview": "Is there a easy way to configure slack in browser to hide the sidebar? I have FHD Portrait mode monitors and sidebar is taking up an annoying amount of space. I read a comment somewhere that said to try Ctrl+Shift+D but that is keyed to bookmark and you can't modify that without extensions which I will not be using or registry hacks which require admin. I can manually hide the sidebar using Ctrl + Shift + C and deleting elements one by one but I haven't figured out how to make the main contents fill up the space yet. If I knew that I could probably write a javascript snippet and just paste that into the console which would be acceptable. .. something to do with grid-template-columns, so it might be as simple as using a CSS override, time to learn a feature i shouldn't have skipped learning in CSS. Well, there's definitely a javascript involved somewhere as it sets this when you have a thread open .p-ia4_client .p-client_workspace__tabpanel {\n    grid-template-columns: 180px 524px 302px;     \ngrid-template-areas: 'p-view_contents--sidebar p-view_contents--primary p-view_contents--secondary'; but if you close the thread: .p-ia4_client .p-client_workspace__tabpanel {\n   grid-template-columns: 180px auto;     \ngrid-template-areas: 'p-view_contents--sidebar p-view_contents--primary';\n} That complicates a possible solution. Here's waht we know: Slack seems to have two states: Thread open, thread closed. The first column is the sidebar. We want this to be hidden completely. The second column is the primary view. The third column is the thread view. We only want to see second and third column. A solution needs to handle this somehow.. idk how.",

Half the day is just reacting and when meetings start piling on top of that, it feels impossible to carve out any real focus time. I get now why people say context switching is the silent killer of productivity. Its not just me either. my team is stuck in the same loop, always online, always answering but struggling to find energy for actual deep work.

I use Slack canvas in a shared channel to keep my clients up to date, and they love it, but I'm already getting tired of copy-pasting the knowledge back and forth between Slack and Monday. I built a prototype of a little bot to keep them in sync this weekend, but before I sink any more valuable time into it, I want to ask: Is there an off-the-shelf solution I could use instead? Ideally, I'd also like it to link to Notion and Google Docs. Any comments would be super helpful, thanks!",

I lose latency between signal → decision → follow-through. Half my day is “did I miss something critical?” What has actually worked for you to centralize context without introducing yet another inbox? Examples I’d love to copy: opinionated Slack conventions (e.g., #project-x-decisions with required message format) Linear issue templates/automations that hoover up Slack/Figma links Zapier/Make routes that turn specific Slack reactions into Linear updates Weekly “state of decision log” ritual that isn’t busywork Happy to share back anything that sticks.

      "content_preview": "Hey all - I've spent my spare time the last couple months building Emoji Studio : the best (and maybe only?) Slack emoji management platform. It's completely free, open source , runs entirely in your browser, and requires no Slack app to install or configure. Think of it like an admin dashboard for custom Slack emojis. The Chrome Extension picks up the necessary Slack workspace creds (scoped token, cookie, workspace info) and the application runs a series of queries against the Slack API to do things like see recent emojis, view leaderboards, understand creation patterns, and bulk download your or your workspace's emojis for later. Emoji Studio has no server storing any information - everything is done via the same exact Slack requests your browser or Slack app already make. But there's more... With the Chrome extension installed, you can add any emoji on Slackmojis.com without downloading and re-uploading to Slack No more downloading + uploading from Slackmojis! With the Chrome extension installed, right click on any image or GIF while browsing and turn it into a Slack emoji. What a time to be alive. https://preview.redd.it/introducing-emoji-studio-a-platform-to-manage-and-create-v0-l36kn3v5nslf1.png You can select _any_ video or GIF and the app will convert it down to Slack's specific custom GIF specifications. For me, this was without question the most frustrating part of making Slack emojis. Now you don't have to think about it. It's done entirely in your browser, and you can upload to your Slack in one click. I'm super proud of this one! https://preview.redd.it/introducing-emoji-studio-a-platform-to-manage-and-create-v0-ypszdf3mnslf1.png Edit your already-uploaded emojis. Want to rename one? Add an alias? Edit the contents of the emoji? There's an interface here to do it. https://preview.redd.it/introducing-emoji-studio-a-platform-to-manage-and-create-v0-zuaui8wwmslf1.png If you've read this far, I'm amazed. You're probably wondering how I plan to make money off this, and the honest truth is...I'm not. This project is a way for me to explore and build some of the stupid ideas I've had, all while building something people actually want to use. What's next: Emoji Studio is going iOS-native, starting with iOS 26. You can sign up to help test it by joining the TestFlight . There are quite a few rough edges, but I've made a lot of progress in a short amount of time. Hope you and your team get a kick out of this. I'm having a lot of fun building this, and would love to hear your thoughts!",

I find that merely attaching files into my messages is not very convincing - rarely will anyone download and open them. I'd like to have snippets of file contents within my messages. Is there a way to do this?",
