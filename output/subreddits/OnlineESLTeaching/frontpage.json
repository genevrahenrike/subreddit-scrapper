I've bachelor degree in English and over 10 years of experience in public school. Does it matter? Yes and no.. Most of the jobs needed certificates to even pass the application stage. So, I got a 120 hrs TEFL certificate from Teacher Record. I feel very insecure now. Can I get a teaching job by relying on this degree and TEFL certificate? Is it reliable? I don't have money and energy to get one from Cambridge as I'm typically a refugee right now as our country was in civil war.",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, Sorry for the rant-style post, but I just need to get this off my chest. I recently started teaching at Engoo & NativeCamp as a backup to my main job. The first few days were great; all 5-star reviews. Then the “special request” students started rolling in. One student booked a free conversation lesson but wanted to skip introductions and “boring topics” like hobbies, work, and travel. So what exactly do they want to talk about? Go line by line through Shakespeare's sonnets and discuss the motifs? They cannot even use basic articles correctly, so how am I supposed to work with that? Fine, I will cave and try to make the lesson work by asking if they have a topic prepared so I can focus on what they are struggling with. Guess what? Nothing. So now I am stuck trying to make a new student comfortable: No introductions No “boring” topics No idea what they want to discuss After a short and awkward chat, I get a bad review. Like, bruh. Then there was the 3-star student who spent most of the lesson on her phone, barely answering questions. Her profile said she wanted to have introductions, so we did. I asked if she could follow my normal speaking speed; she insisted yes, though it was obvious she could not. When it became clear she was not following, I slowed down to help, only for her to later complain that the introduction was “too long” and the lesson was “too slow.” Like the frustrating part is that I get more 5-star reviews with less effort from students who actually engage; students who, mind you, do not need a reluctant jester with a BA in English to be the next Noam Chomsky or Harold Bloom for them. But there are select few that just seem like the carbon copy of the latest insufferable student I taught, always giving 4 stars or low ratings no matter what I do. So my question was: How do you avoid these types of students on Engoo or NativeCamp? I suppose blocking is not possible How would I appeal a bad review if I genuinely believe that I did well with what I had that lesson What is the best way to handle them without wasting energy? Thanks for reading.",

I do not have a specific place in mind, but I have heard good things about teaching in Poland, Spain, and Czechia. However, I am not set on anything. However, before all of this, I know I need to complete a program such as TESOL or TEFL. I am currently in my last semester of university and am looking at an April 2026 graduation with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and a certificate in international engagement from a Canadian university. Anyways, I am just wondering how to get started or if there are any recommended online certifications that actually teach you how to teach English to others. Any tips are helpful!! Thanks!",

During the lesson she would not go on camera and her English was extremely good... I'm not sure if these details are relevant or not. A few weeks have passed and she has now contacted me asking for a HR letter and a reference letter so she can get onto a scholarship... She messaged me over 30 times in one day and seems pretty desperate.... Should I send her a reference for the one lesson I taught? Is it safe? I'm not sure what to do and I wouldn't want her to miss out on education because I didn't help... But then again I only taught her once for 30 minutes.....

I tried to raise my concern multiple times but nothing happens. Very disappointing.",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys I just want to vent about the unbelievable penalties from some of these companies and how easy it is to get booted. I'm starting to wonder if Novakid is deliberately reducing my account health by conjuring up penalties and interfering with my tech reliability. Just a week ago, I was penalized for a class that was marked as \"teacher absent,\" even though I was present, and reached out to inform them that I couldn't enter the class as there was no \"start the class\" option. The platform kept displaying \"something went wrong,\" and I was later completely locked out. Then today, I was penalized again for a class where I was inside the classroom, waiting for the student who never even showed up. I waited the full 25 minutes, but they still marked it as \"teacher absent\" and deducted my payment. To make matters worse, they have now limited my future bookings. It’s becoming a pattern, and it’s incredibly frustrating.  I read somewhere that their speed test isn't accurate too. It could pick up a low ping, high up/down speeds and still say your internet connection is poor... and you're damned if you let them know you ran speedtests externally with trusted sources. They say OOKLA and 5 other speed tests on the internet that clearly show a good connection must be the ones that are inaccurate because theirs is more accurate. And not to mention I now make way less than what was discussed in the contract. $3.60 and not even $4.",

      "content_preview": "For the past 4 years now, I have been working as a reading teacher in a Korean institution in the morning. The only nice thing about it, is that it is consistent and they teach throughout the year. However, I am getting tired of being at the institution and I really don't see much benefit in continuing there. I do have a full-time teaching job online, however the other institution that I work at is seasonal. They only teach throughout the school year. So I am reaching out to everybody reading this to ask for some advice. What are some other online teaching jobs that are out there where I can work virtually? Just so everybody knows my highest level of education is an associate's degree, so I know that some of my options may be limited. So wherever I apply they can't require a 4 year degree. However if anybody has any recommendations please let me know and leave the link to apply in the comment section along with your experiences. If nothing else this will help serve as a gateway for other future readers who see this post. I have experience teaching both reading and ESL.",

For the longest time, I was focused on the Latin American market, and  I've recently exited it and am focusing my efforts on Asia and also foreigners that are living in the U.S and Canada. I quit the LatAm market specifically because I was getting frustrated with the lack of signifigant R.O.I. I would put out paid ads on Facebook and recieve messages only to find out that the majority couldn't afford/ didn't want to pay for my services. In some regions, there are \"teachers\" charging the equivalent of $1.50 USD per class. No wonder I ran into so much resistance! That being said, I'm curious as to whether any of you guys ever had any success over there. When I say success, I mean being able to charge good prices without too much pushback. Or did you too give up?",

In just the past several days, a few of my students have decided to leave the platform, and the main reason they gave was the cost. They told me they simply can’t afford to keep paying these prices, and that it’s easier for them to move to cheaper platforms. Some of them also mentioned that, on top of that, AI tools have become another affordable alternative. Even if it’s not quite the same as learning with a tutor, the low cost seems to make it worth it for them. I won’t lie, it’s a bit discouraging when you lose students you’ve built a connection with, but at the same time I can completely understand their reasons. It really feels like the platform’s pricing is the biggest issue, and alternatives (whether other companies or AI tools) are filling that gap. What about you all, have you been seeing the same thing, and what do you think about this whole situation?",

I currently teach face to face classes in China (private 1-1 tutoring) but am hoping to transition to online only. I have built up a good reputation, have a degree, my TEFL certificate, and 8 years of experience. I have some online students who pay around 65 USD /  50 GBP per hour. Obviously this is amazing and better than what I can get on online platforms. However, they have all come from face to face classes and I managed to persuade them to switch to online. I am planning to move back to the UK eventually so need to transition to 100% online to continue earning a living. I have a feeling most of my students won't want to switch to online though which is making me worry. Did anyone else have a similar situation before? Any tips on how I can make the transition and get more ONLINE students? Do I just need to accept my fate of joining a platform and earning a lower salary? Of course I will continue to market myself on IG, FB, and Red note (Chinese TikTok) but is there anything else I'm missing? Can anyone offer me some validation to make me feel like it's possible? haha - Much appreciated! Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I joined an ESL coach’s seminar to learn more about the industry. At first it seemed great—the coach shared tips, had connections, and even referred me to companies. I thought I got really lucky. But later I found out the reality: One company paid me ₱150/hour while their existing tutors were earning ₱180/hour. Another company offered me ₱160/hour, but other applicants got ₱200/hour for the exact same role. That’s when I started feeling scammed. Instead of helping, it feels like the ESL coach lowballed us, then goes online bragging about “helping tutors” just to boost the seminar’s image. Honestly, I was left sad and frustrated. Now I’m stuck figuring out how to leave. Neither company gave me a contract, so I could just quit—but I’d rather resign properly. Since the ESL coach is also a hiring manager with a lot of industry contacts, I don’t want this to backfire on my future applications. So I’d love to hear advice: how do you guys resign from ESL companies amicably, especially in situations like this?",

I used to be a teacher a few years back on itutorgroup and Engoo and left due to getting a hospitality job that paid better, but since the beginning of the year I’ve become a contracted teaching assistant. Of course UK summer hit and no work means no pay (and no pay when not in a school anyway with this kind of work) and I’ve chosen to go back as I enjoyed online English teaching. Looked around and Engoo wasn’t gonna reactivate my account anytime soon as they “have enough tutors” and saw that Lingostar was advertising and I thought I’d go there. Since finally getting everything sorted a couple weeks ago I have yet to actually teach a lesson. I’ve had trail lessons booked but then happily cancelled the day of or the day before so that’s me just sat around on my laptop waiting and waiting. I’m probably a big idiot joining this company and should have looked a bit closer on what’s it like but seriously, should I just cut my losses here and try and find something else? Even with the terrible pay I actually enjoyed Engoo due to the lesson stylings and free chat style (which meant talking to people on a daily basis) other then that where else is hiring which isn’t gonna be a big old waste of time?",

I'm also interested in teachers who share these following interests: painting, right wing politic, birds, voice acting, gardening, having been or currently live in Japan, writing fiction and LDR. Please help me burn my coupons. I really have zero motivation to attend the rest of my classes and repeat the same GL topics again and again for 1 year. Note: I have been at the advance level since the beginning. Yapping on Discord with people from all over the world is way more satisfying and fun for me now. I swear if it's not because of some hard working people who really need the job to teach at EF I'm so gonna leave 1 star review everywhere. But there are teachers who do the graveyard shift for just $2/45 minutes... and yeah the system algorithm favors the teachers from this country, like 99% of my GL teachers are from there, same for the available PL teachers that we can choose from. Please comment below if you like to be my PL teacher. Thanks!",

Can someone here working at Rarejob explain to me the agreement/contract. Thank you.",
