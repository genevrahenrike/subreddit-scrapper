Punk responded to the news by saying \"tremendous.\" To 95 percent of people, this meant absolutely nothing, but if you have followed Punk for a while, you'll know this was a tribute to his first mentor in wrestling - Raven! Raven was CM Punk's leader in a TNA stable Gathering, then a massive rival in ROH when they had their blood feud. Raven always described Punk as similar to him - smart, loud, abrasive, a know-it-all, which is why he liked him and took him under his wing. Consequently, Punk took Raven's advice to be a smartass in a calculated way, and blossomed into an all-time great, which Raven always knew he could be. Now, the tremendous line. This word was infamously Raven's catchphrase in real life, if you happen to watch any of his oooooold RF shoot interviews you'll hear it a lot. Here is a video of Punk talking about his experiences with Scotty, with the bonus \"tremendous\" impersonation at the end. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoCWWiQkkM Tremendous!",

      "content_preview": "Positives: - Jinder carried himself well as the champion. Big dude, intimidating face (although his haircut was stupid as fuck, he looked great with short hair), cool gear, well spoken. He looked like someone who should be a top guy, no doubt. - the presentation of the character was also great. Sher is an all-time entrance music, the entrance itself with the carpet following Jinder was great, and little additions to the act like the Indian celebrations and a massive Punjabi carpet in the ring when Jinder spoke were neat details that enhanced the character. You can never say WWE didn't try. Also, Jinder bowing to the title = gold. Very cool, a respectful heel. - Singh Brothers were awesome in their role. Great facial expressions, quality character work, amazing bumpers, they really got into the henchmen roles and executed them flawlessly. Props to The Boys! - most of Jinder's segments and matches from this time pulled massive numbers on YouTube. - Jinder being treated seriously by the commentators, who didn't try to bury him or call him unworthy or whatever. Moreover, Jinder was presented as the hero to the Indian people. Sometimes, WWE does these stupid swerves where a foreigner despises his own country/people (like they did Muhammad Hassan), but thankfully they didn't do that here. Negatives: - \"YOU PEOPLE!\" The staple of Vince McMahon booking - anti American gimmick, even when there's no need for it. What's even worse is that Jinder didn't even get that much heat out of his promos. Jinder also talked for way too long during all of his promos (another Vince-ism), in this super calm voice, which I thought didn't fit Jinder. Yelling and shorter promos would have probably did him more good. - there was literally no build up to Jinder's rise. One week, he wins a Contender's Match, and for some reason (they're Indian, duh), Singh Brothers are with him and it was never explained why. No midcard feuds to build Jinder up, no promos, nothing. From a jobber who never won a single FEUD in almost 4 years, to WWE Champion in less than 2 months of build. And WWE wonders why people didn't like this... - as good as Singh Bros were, I can't help but think they would have fit someone like The Miz far better. They're two handsome, undersized guys in flashy shirts who took comedic bumps, they looked laughable being henchmen for someone like Jinder who is a monster of a man. - that said, Jinder only won 1 match clean (vs Tye Dillinger). Every other victory happened because of Singh Brothers. \"Heels cheat, they ain't supposed to win clean\" - while true, there are 2 problems with that. Number 1, Jinder was a jobber his entire career, so cheating to win did nothing but damage his virtually non-existent credibility even more. Number 2, this guy is like legit 6'4, 250 pounds with an intimidating face - he LOOKS like he can beat almost anyone up without help, and yet WWE booked him as if he were a 5'10, 190 pound chicken-shit cowardly heel. - the entire build to the Shinsuke feud. Just disgusting. - The Great fucking Khali. When Jinder debuted, he was in kayfabe Khali's brother in law, who married Khali's sister to keep her out of poverty. Makes you think what the fuck did Khali do to his money to keep his family in poverty despite being a former World Champion in WWE, but whatever. Alas, Khali got sick of Jinder's shit, beat him a few times, and that was it. Now, 6 years later, Jinder is calling Khali his HERO (??), their prior relationship is never mentioned, Khali literally punks JInder out at Battleground by comically taking the WWE Title and raising it himself lmao, and then he never appears again.

Correct answer - both. In total, the man has had two titles: he was a lord and a prince. He was big then giant, he was sweet and he was bald. He rushed, like a train on the road. Finally, his shoot name is Jason Bernard Albert, known by friends as Buford. Beautiful.",

      "content_preview": "Just finished watching Clash in Paris First things first – the crowd was 🔥. Reigns vs Reed was solid. Not a great match, but it did its job in making Reed look like a legit tough guy. Reigns looked good too. Feels like he might be headed towards Breakker after that post-match stuff, but honestly, I’d rather see him go after Rollins and finally get that big win. The main event delivered, but yeah… not quite on the level of the WrestleMania triple threat. Match of the night for me was easily Cena vs Paul. Logan is such a freak athlete, and Cena (the GOAT) gave it everything. The tributes to Cesaro, Ziggler, Corbin, and Styles were a really cool touch. Absolute banger. 🔥🔥",
