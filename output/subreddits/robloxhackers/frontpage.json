      "content_preview": "There have been a great amount of Applications or theories which were demt to be uncooperative to our own believes and were lead to the truth of such Application. I do not want to discuss, nor hate, but when it comes to Applications which do not fulfil their said proprietary, then I tend to loose my focus on my objective, which is to function as a Human being which is capable of thought and wonder. There have been countless connections made to over 20 individuals whom might be connected to malicious actors with or without realizing it. There is a big tent of People who have been found or was connected to a malicious act. These People have sub-groups which deliberately seeks for attention while the richer side of the sub-group snatches Objects or Instances that you hold, such as money or your Personal Computer. I realize that if I do not say the individuals names, they might be able to wander of without any punishment. I won't in any circumstance tell if any of these people are directly connected to said malicious actors or via a connection which is connected to said group. I do not wish to be hated upon, but this has to be done. And hopefully started to be discussed at around 15:30, the reason being that I do not wish to take my own personal schedule time to talk nor be present at hours below it. Of course you can contact me currently via Discord (discord.gg/Mxhst6f3TW) at these hours, but I will of course have to go to sleep too, like a normal human being. The reason that I am saying these names is, to hopefully get attention and seek the truth with the said user. If this user is uncooperative, I will deem them as unstable and unusable as a subject further one and list them as a malicious act. Let's begin with an malicious actor which was confirmed to be distributing content which will gain access to your Objects and Instances. gotsolara,com (Do not go to this website, as it may grab your IP which could lead to many things happening.) This fake Solara's main Instance would be a fake MatrixHub (matrixhub,lol [Again, please do not visit this website, as it may grab your data. And in generally it may do other malicious stuff like in the other website.]) This fake MatrixHub and fake Solara are connected to multiple other Companies which with realization or without are working with them in direct or not. One of the owners of fake MatrixHub is directly responsible for the fake Solara too. His discord username is 4165, he is in France. (Without spilling his data much, I can confidently say a line between Lyon, France and Monaco-Ville, France can be put.) I am not going to say much about the other owner of fake MatrixHub, since I am unsure if he actually knows whats happening, and I didn't do much investigation on him, but what I can confidently say is, that 4165 had made a fake Solara once, a year ago. A data I retrieved was his friends list, which I am not going to fully say, but only a singular person. lululepu.off I am also not going to fully say this persons whole friends list, due to privacy even if they are confirmed to be a ratter. Friends of him: 74x1 (144) syphc (SyphicGX) If you were in the \"Uncover it\" discord server, you might be familiar with both of those names, one being one of the Developers of \"Uncover it\", and the other a known person, but sadly due to this friendship between 74x1 and lulu, I have to list \"Uncover it\" as an malicious connection operation base, because I am unsure about which malicious acts are being performed there. This data about this fake Solara/MatrixHub was only possible due to me having background information about the owner, which had an early attempt of running another fake Solara which was firstly called Scorpix. The first part of the data was obtained on 09/07/2024 21:47 (Berlin Time) And I only uncovered that this french fake Solara owner was exactly the one that I managed to drift into abyss a year ago which was also a news that I posted on robloxhackers.lol/news (That is no longer accessible. ) As we know, solara does not own MatrixHub, so even without images, this is possible to identify as a malicious Product and we can add everyone who was in contact with it in any way. Now we proceed to a lower level of suspicion. To 4 servers directly being connected to eachother. Cobalt - Lucid - CRYON Executor - Team c00lkidd [ REBORN ] The problem with these 4 servers is, that because of Cobalt, the rest are also a connection. And since CRYON Executor has been nuked by their own owner, the suspicion arouses. Now the main culprit: Cobalt. From lying to stealing content from other products to implement in their own. One major information we know about Vynn, the owner of Cobalt, is that he is a turk and that is he Muslim. We mainly have the problem about stealing content and not being able to code: https://preview.redd.it/public-execution-of-ratters-and-scammers-v0-0zfgxey55nmf1.png https://preview.redd.it/public-execution-of-ratters-and-scammers-v0-3umojbnt5nmf1.png As said in prior Reddit Post with visual evidence, he is unable to code or work on code, such as Cobalt which has been a dire need of an update. He himself removed the Key System after I specifically said that having an Key System is not keyless, which he tried to deny. Now randomly after my call out on him and the product, Nullbit, currently know as Lucid, had undergone a name change. I am unsure if that is related, but sadly this time I cannot leave this third party person alone, because they are also connected to partners of Cobalt by partnering themselves. Since it seems all of these Applications have a strong connection, the wise move was to check their Partnerships. Connected Applications to Team c00lkidd [ REBORN ] are Purium, Synthrix Dev, Nytrix, Luna (ServerSide), Skid Leaks, CloudUI and NUGLOX. These are only connections to one of a few known connected malicious/suspicious Applications. One example of huge Partnership problems is Mono V2. It was one of the few Applications that partnered with a known malicious Application called: oxycontin. Due to this, I was always in their server to observe from time to time. The general problem is, that the owner lies. (This conversation began: 7:06PM, ended: 8:05PM, that is why he was angry.) This image was taken right around 8:18PM that day: https://preview.redd.it/public-execution-of-ratters-and-scammers-v0-x1zpmjfs9nmf1.png It shows that he was not playing Roblox, because he was able to finish a Partnership. Either that or he closed his game 13 minutes later to Partner. This is also the same person who has partnered with Lucid which is made by the co-owner of Cobalt. And Mono being partnered with confirmed malicious actors is a high flag for it's Partnerships. Even a known Malicious actor known as ValeDreamer is to date still in his server with his \"valedreamer\" account, if that is actually him of course. And people like gigzas even had discord servers with known people in them. Owner of Mono also had the same idea too, this sever would be the second server of gigzas: https://preview.redd.it/public-execution-of-ratters-and-scammers-v0-qysnfk62bnmf1.png https://preview.redd.it/public-execution-of-ratters-and-scammers-v0-xh28t0pcbnmf1.png This memo clearly was not sustained, as ValeDreamer was able to apply for their \"executor\" to be advertised in this small known server. Due to this, gigzas has been found as a connection to ValeDreamer himself directly. Other connections we have are irrelevant, but they are connected to other malicious users who were in contact with ValeDreamer. Such as Clarity. The problem is, that v3rm staff did not care about false information being given out in their platform, which I have over 2 hours of material. Making me sadly add them to the list of connected users with ValeDreamer, because Clarity had worked with ValeDreamer and that they were in contact with Clarity at the moment and defended him and his friends. At one point into the conversation, Berkaith, Acevincente, nuga06411, bancitys and vyr started to trade memes in an serious matter. https://preview.redd.it/public-execution-of-ratters-and-scammers-v0-3mqp4w5henmf1.png (He kept ragebaiting me, even after I showed my side of the story.) To explain this part of the Conversation and itself, I would have to do a huge Expose of Berkaith and the v3rm staff itself in a entirely different post, since my direction with this current post is to show awareness of corrupt and malicious people with or without power in high places. That story would also cover why Ronix got nuked, but I can make a small version of it here. Ronix got nuked by people who were connected to ValeDreamer. Aris (Owner of V3rm), is lucky that I am not suing him, his workers and the website for also allowing graphical content and people's faces being shown without their consent. In Short the Connections we currently have: - Valedreamer -> Gigzas -> Mono Owner -> v3rm Staff & Owner -> Cobalt -> Lucid -> CRYON Executor -> Team c00lkidd [REBORN] Team c00lkidd [REBORN]: Purium Synthrix Dev Nytrix Luna (ServerSide) Skid Leaks CloudUI NUGLOX - Fake MatrixHub/Solara -> Uncover it Most of these servers lie their customers, and are able to convince them to stay in their corrupt party, but not me. I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I take vengeance on them. They fear me, because I know their Tunnel of Malicious Actors. And they will know my announcement, even if it is in my Discord Server (discord.gg/Mxhst6f3TW). These bad & malicious actors need to be cleansed of evil, and I shall do it. Even if it takes me hours to gather confirmed connections and unconfirmed connections, because I already know, there are over 100 Unique Discord Servers that have a connection to these malicious actors. Like I said, approximately at 15:30 will be a good time to come Online, so I can check out your reviews. I am sorry that I didn't show more locations to explore, since some stuff are either due to privacy, or would need an separate Post to continue. Do ask me questions, 15:30 will be the time of me coming Online. Be safe, be good, I always watch!",

Since the latest update of Roblox, there were issues (according to the discord). There are a few people talking, but trolling as well. For me, as a customer and a new user, it's confusing if it now actually works. They mention secure boot needs to be disabled, was this always like that? If not, why the sudden change? And where to get proper support from it, since I activated my key, but unable to use it. Kind regards!",
