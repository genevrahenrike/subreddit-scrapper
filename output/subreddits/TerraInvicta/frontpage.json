It's 2029, I'm controlling China (with Taiwan) and Central Asian union (Kazakhstan on steroids). I have good mining spots on Mars, moon and all 4 sites on Ceres. 5 stations in LEO with different labs and nanofactories and no fleet yet. In comparison to other factions I have by far the best space resource income.  Water: +343, Volatiles: +182, Metals: +215, Noble Metals: +27, Fissiles: +15 I'm behind on science with around 1.4K, while protectorate has 2.3K, also running short on cash. Am I behind?

      "content_preview": "I've got like 500 hours and I've finished two campaigns, one as the Resistance and one as the Academy. Spending 250 hours on one campaign is... kinda a lot. So for a new challenge, I decided to make the game as intense as I could. Accelerated campaign, and only two factions - The Resistance (me) and the Servants. This made the game significantly more difficult. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking out a challenge. TL;DR: The AI is fully capable of wrecking your shit if it isn't busy fighting itself: Without meaningful competition, the AI will effectively control nations and position itself for success in space and on the surface. If it's not busy starting meaningless fights against other factions, the AI can create effective, combined-arms space fleets. If you have an effective opponent, you have a significantly smaller margin of error when choosing research. Keeping below the hate threshold is a false mate. With nobody else to impede the Aliens or the Servants, both will dominate the space game. You will have to fight a ground war, and if you don't prepare for it, you'll lose. Details below! The political game has much higher consequences. The earliest phases of the game are much easier. With only 6 councilors on the map, you'll almost never need to directly compete with the Servants for control of any nation. This meant I could nearly completely unify the EU by 2026 without needing to kick the Servants out of some random holdout. I could also waltz my way into controlling the US and Kazakhstan without any serious problems, setting me up perfectly for a boost-heavy early game. There were so many more countries available than either me or the Servants could control, so it was always easier to control an empty nation than it was to directly compete with them. However, this advantage cut both ways. The Servants found nothing standing in the way between them and uncontested control of India, Russia, Indonesia, and South Korea. Now, I had briefly controlled Russia so I could disarm their nukes, but gave it up so I could hop into the US. Without the AI fighting other factions, the Servants were just as strong as I was. The space game is much more difficult. I planned on playing the space game in the way that had worked in both of my previous games - go light on a space navy and snatch up the best hab spots on the metal-rich asteroids and Mercury. LEO was undefendable, but not really necessary so long as I had a few token railgun ships to bombard an assault carrier that came through. This was the wrong move. Without the Servants starting pointless space pissing matches with Humanity First, they managed to build a competent LEO interdiction fleet. As soon as they found themselves able, I was forced into the humiliating position of losing all my LEO research stations and mid-orbit shipyards. Fully cleaned out. Even worse, I couldn’t outpace their own production. I had to build up a fleet at Mercury and Venus and ship it back home to have any chance of wining a space fight. I also found out that I had made a strategic miscalculation in my ship design. I focused on the 7-faction meta of missile escorts and monitors, and had spent a lot of research going down the tree to get shaped-charge nuclear missiles. But since I had no local drydocks and only shitty interplanetary drives, I could only bring small forces to bear against the Servants or any aliens. And small missile fleets don’t win! I got stack wiped in basically every fight. Since my shipbuilding capabilities were so disrupted, keeping hulls alive was far more important than winning fights. The usual strategy of trading ship for ship and charging directly in with high thrust drives only drained my limited resources. I should have focused on consolidating control of orbits and defending a limited supply of resources rather than claiming the cream of the crop while the AI was focused on pissing each other off. Your research choices need to be much more focused. I quickly figured out I needed to win most research races so I could pick the techs I wanted. Taking even one off meant being behind in the race for better weapons tech for 6 months while the Servants focused on Great Nations or Independence Movements. I made what I considered the optimal choice of rushing shaped charge nuclear missiles, but as discussed above, this was unsustainable. 25,000 research on a tech you’ll never end up using is a lot of missed opportunity! I also made what I consider a tactically correct but strategically invalid choice of delaying fusion research as long as possible and focusing on gas fission drives. I figured Firefly Lanterns would be good enough until I had established control of the Jovian system, but this meant I had no real way to make it back to Earth with ships that were any good in a fight (they were full of propellant instead of armor!). I needed the meantime to catch up on better weapons and armor tech to get competent point defense. These compounding errors meant I couldn’t win nearly any fight against the aliens to accumulate Exotics and thus couldn’t effectively utilize T3 coils or phasers, which are nearly essential for long-term. Without other factions creating problems for the Servants, you have to be even more judicious in navigating the tech tree. Managing alien hate is a tightrope, and presents a tough choice. If you're playing as the Resistance, you usually have four acceptable targets - the Initiative, Project Exodus, the Academy, and Humanity First. If you steal their countries, blow up a hab or two, or steal some research, you can probably patch it up with a few middling orgs and some backdated research. Until you're sure you can win, the Servants are essentially sacrosanct. But you have no such luck in a two faction game. Everything you want that another faction has will cost you space assets. Moreover, since the Servants have no other competition, keeping the hate meter down will ensure the Servants have an appreciable source of assets. With no other goons to do your dirty work, your inaction is directly linked the to the growth of the strength of your opponents. In a two faction game, a go loud early strategy might be necessary. Ground wars actually matter Most of the ground wars I was involved with were late-game unification roflstomps, or the AI fucking around and invading Somalia for fun 10 times. In my last game, the Servants were so hamstrung that the Alien Administration never formed and no assault carriers ever landed. So when the Alien Administration did form and two assault carriers landed, I was kind of fucked. The AA formed out of Ethiopia, and soon Russia, Greater India, Iran, United North Korea, nuclear Canada, and a blobbed up Southeast Asian Alliance were all in the same federation and looking to join up. Faced with the possibility of fighting a difficult war now or an impossible war later, I actually started WW3 on purpose. The US, the EU, and China versus essentially the rest of the world. My first nukes I used on alien armies. Tragically, this had limited effectiveness – only one army dead for each barrage. I used six to get the aliens off the planet and regain freedom of the seas. Next, I was seriously outnumbered, facing about 36 armies with around 18 of my own. I had a marginal tech advantage, but that wasn’t going to last, nor would it allow me to win a fight on foreign soil. It was so tempting to push the “launch” button and delete that stack of 5 armies in Rostov, or that troop formation in Central Asia. And I did it. Over and over again. By the time I’d whittled down my opponents, I’d fired 15 nuclear barrages. This TANKED my public opinion, opening me up to crackdown-purge combos in even my largest countries – I had to actually play defense with public opinion! 10s of millions dead, 280 attrocities. At least climate change wasn’t going to be a problem for the next decade with 1.8C of cooling. I sent every army with a navy into Ethiopia to end the Alien Administration, but my lack of attention to Xenoflora defoliants meant I had to slap down two megafauna in the process. All the while, I had to deal with orbital bombardment from Alien fleets, since I’d been kicked out of LEO and had no realistic way to contest it for at least a couple years as I built a rescue navy. In short, when the AI doesn't fight itself, it's a formidable opponent. The standard turtling strategy is ineffective when faced with a strong opponent - it will only make your problems worse. I found myself quickly running out of advantages to press, until the only I winning hand I had to play was a significant lead in nuclear weapons.",

      "content_preview": "I've only completed one playthrough, which didn't require a total war since I was playing servants (I know I'm a traitor to humanity). It's early 30s as the Academy, I've recently killed a hydra and got punched back immediately, while having alien threat at 2/5. As far as I know you MC usage dictates threat floor which it can't get below, and any aggression adds more threat that will slowly burn down back to the floor with time or as aliens destory your stuff. But I thought they would only attack if the threat is full. Correct me if I'm missing something here. The main question is: how do you approach the total war? Do you build up vertically as much as possible without crossing the MC cap and then go all in on building the fleet and even stronger economy? If you're just crossing that threshold, how actively do they start attacking you? Should I try to increase my MC cap before the total war? Anything else I should think of?",

      "content_preview": "After about 300 total hours of gameplay, I finally won my first game of TI as Project Exodus. I found the last two years of gameplay quite boring (just sitting there with a huge doomstack on the station while the Bifrost built), but I slogged through it for a few hours and pressed the win button last night - in 2047. I'm probably not going to play another until the next big patch, but I have a few questions in the sort of... intermediate level space. I'm not sure if I'm still a beginner, but I sure still don't feel like I know what's happening: I previously had a Resistance game which got close to winning but I ended up abandoning because, despite having a huge fleet on their Kuiper Belt base, the game was forcing me to play whack-a-mole and kill every single alien fleet that was all around the solar system. Is there a better way to manage that in future? What's the best way of dealing with all the little asteroid bases? Drives and ship construction. I only really felt like I was able to actually go on the offensive in 2040 or so when I got the Helion Plasmajet Lantern, and even then it felt so slow to actually head out to even Jupiter and Saturn - like a year plus. What sort of DV and cruise accelerations should I be aiming for in my offensive ship designs? (Combat wise I'm pretty happy with my designs: my combination of coil and laser ships were doing great.) Research. I'm pretty sure I didn't have enough of it, especially in the mid-game. How do you generate the kind of research numbers I've seen in posts here? By the end of the game I was at about 8k/month after building a bunch of research stations in orbit fairly late (2035), before that I was mostly just dependent on my countries. Money. I constantly felt like I was running a massive deficit (from all the space MC modules, mostly), despite how many nanofactories I was running. I even built some of the space resorts (and upgraded versions) later on. Am I missing a trick? By the end of the game, I had given up caring about the Earth and just had all my counsellors on auto action. There were probably gains to be made _on_ Earth, but I just felt like everything meaningful I could achieve was just through waiting for my (year-long!) fleet trips to arrive, and I was just mindlessly clicking \"Complete Assignments\" and whizzing by on 5 speed. Am I missing anything? What should I be doing on the smaller scale, whether on Earth or in the bulk of the gameplay time between fleet actions?",

This is the first game I've gotten to the point where I've thought \"Yep, I'm ready to actually fight the ayylmaos\" so I'm wondering how realistic any part of this strat is around 2031-2032, even with having the full might of the US and China driving research dominance for the better part of my game.",

      "content_preview": "Taking control of LEO is a critical first step, and should be achieved as quickly as possible.  Once you have a basic space economy up and can build ships you should do so immediately.  Control of Low Earth Orbit is the most contested but also most critical thing, and the Aliens understand this and will spend enormous resources trying to take it away from you so they can set up monitoring missions for abductions, which is their most critical resource. Alien victory is almost entirely dependent on abductions.  The more abductions they can do, the more facilities they can build, and the more countries they can take over. Now early on your options are quite limited, your lasers stink, and the aliens can fly circles around your early game kinetic weapons, but you DO have access to a weapon with speed and power, that can chase down alien ships and destroy them.  Torpedoes. The technologies you need to build Artemis torpedoes are not many and it's what you need to take the fight to the aliens.  Build a whole bunch of escorts with 2 artemis torpedo launchers and two magazines.  The initial alien surveillance missions will be lightly armed and with a half dozen of these escorts you will be able to destroy these ships and prevent them from carrying out their mission, which is abductions. While you build up your space economy, your next step is to achieve LEO dominance, because one you start blowing up the alien surveillance missions they will start sending fleets after you, and you need to destroy those fleets.  These fleets will be armed with alien torpedoes, which will blow up your little escorts, so now you need to upgrade.  To Monitors. Your torpedo monitors will be the backbone of your fleet for many years.  Build lots and lots and lots of them, like 30 of them, in Low Earth Orbit.  Pack them with 3 Artemis torpedoes (upgrade to Cerberus nuclear torpedoes as soon as you can) and one PD laser (to shoot down the alien torpedoes). and everything else magazines.  You need to overwhelm the aliens with wave after wave after wave of torpedoes.  At this stage the aliens will send fleet after fleet after fleet after fleet against you, but this is good, because they have not been able to assemble a large fleet, and you can destroy them one at a time with your giant floating missile fleet.  At this point you need to upgrade to battleships, 5 Cerberus torpedo launchers, 1pd laser, a green laser cannon on the nose, and all the other slots magazines.  With these battleships if you build another 30 of these LEO is yours, the aliens will stop sending fleets because they are now scared of you, and from this point on you will have to come to them.",

Also strategies change and priorities shift, and eventually you just sort of have to leave some ships behind, either relegated to orbital defense in some backwater or, if not even worth that, scuttled ignominiously. Of course it should have to be the same hull type, you shouldn't be able to refit a monitor into a battleship, but a battleship should be able to be refit into any other kind of battleship, given enough time and resources.",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone. I have made it further into a campaign than I ever have before. I am playing on Normal on a Long Campaign. I'm pretty much dominating the human factions in terms of tech, control of earth (i have both the PAC and United North America with more armies than everyone), and have considerably more fleets and habs than them. My MC was starting to get pretty hefty, like around ~250 or so, but I needed a lot more resources to start producing fleets to push back against aliens. Last time I did research on what to do next and also made a post I saw a lot of recommendations to send a bunch of colony ships to the Kuiper Belt once you get good enough drives. So when I got the Triton Nova I made 5 colony ships and sent them to a couple of different Kuiper Belt objects. I honestly didn't even think that would be enough to work so I made another set of 12 and sent them out while they were getting established. However, only 1 actually got intercepted in time, while the rest managed to survey, colonize, and build battlestations before any real big threats could show up. So now I got a ton of Kuiper belt bases, and I have 12 more on the way. I'm currently at 336 MC, and am already well over the mine cap. It's gonna get a lot worse once these other colony ships arrive, even assuming a couple of them get intercepted. So, total war soon seems to be inevitable. My high (???, its 9k/month) tech output has me with Mk3 Coilguns, hybrid/exotic armor, and im researching deuterium-helium-3 fusion right now. However, there is also an assault carrier on the way. If my understanding is correct Total War can't start until 2042 on my settings, but we are getting there soon. How should I best prepare? A lot of my mining comes from stuff around the asteroid belt so I am worried I wouldn't be able to defend it, but maybe I could defend the Kuiper belt objects? I also have a good deal of stuff on Mars? I'm not sure how to proceed through this dangerous ground I am approaching.",

      "content_preview": "Assaulting xenoform, defending interests,,maintaining the popular support up etc... I'd like to throw in a half or less baked idea: director (or whatever we should call them) positions. somewhat similar to advisers, but acting across the whole organisation, not in particular countries. The general idea is this: -Director positions are getting unlocked via research (director of science, culture, xeno defense, economy, intelligence etc, about 6-7 types.) -You could assign some of you councilors to these positions, you would still need some agents to do focused stuff, while the directors would be more effective on a general way-(for example increase public opinion in all your countries-not as much as a single councilor action would in one nation, but overall more effectively than doing it one by one). Or constantly defending our interests for a constant influence cost (depending on our assets' \"size\") -assigning a director would take some time, or in the first few turns it would have decreased efficiency (like 50%-75%-100%), so we are encouraged to keep them in position for a while. -In the end we might need more than 6 active councilors, org cost/numbers should be rebalanced accordingly. And while I'm at it: contacting other factions shouldn't be that difficult.. Tie it to a project if you must but from midgame at least let us talk to the others without first trying to identify their agents. In one game I really wanted to gift some stuff to exodus and I thought they already left earth as they were nowhere to be found.",

It's quite the prize. In fact, it is the current lynchpin in the Servant's game. The Initiative owns almost all of Europe (with my help). I own Asia, N. America, and Russia (I have around 820 CP - more than enough as Exodus). HF has made quite the run into Africa. So I thought, \"Let's help a sister out!\" I'm friends with the Academy, and my Earth game is on auto-pilot. So I research the tech so India can take over Pakistan. I even go so far as to take all the CP and the abandon the nation. The Academy is sitting at something like 200 of 500 CP. They have the power to take the country. Instead, they just seem to run Advise missions over and over again. Why?!?! It seems as if the AI likes to maintain parity between the AI factions. Even when you try to join forces to gang up on another AI faction there seems to be a limit to which any given AI will participate. This is never really an issue for game play, but it does lead to a bunch of conflicts where your \"ally\" leaves you hanging. I do say \"Never trust the AI.\" And I realize the goal of the AI is to let you win. I just wonder why the AI is SOOOO dumb. Update/Edit: So it's '33, and The Academy has folded. They dropped to 18 CP. Most of their countries are gone. They have hardly any Orgs. Their counselors are just doing Public Campaigns in the most random places. What's surprising is that they were doing really well. I helped them build a pretty robust space economy, but that's gone. They were the most successful AI, and then it's like they just gave up. I watched as the Servants/Aliens just took them apart and they did nothing to defend themselves.",

      "content_preview": "Disclaimer: I am not a developer, I am not good at balancing, any numbers should be considered wild speculation so feel free to give your own opinion and ideas, these would all be OPTIONAL in the custom start menu Hydra Escalation Once Humans push the Aliens out of the inner Asteroids and or Jupiter the hydra would change their method of attack, Humanity is running wild and is not able to be domesticated for the time being, to continue the number of humans must be reduced dramatically but how? *Spoilers* Hydra due to their history they will not use bioweapons or chemical weapons *Spoilers* Asteroid Drop, the aliens will deorbit asteroids from the inner and outer belts and slam the into Mars and Earth (or any world with a population over 50k humans, these can be stopped but not destroyed by if you get control of the space around the asteroid and having enough ships with a special \"Towing\" module or having enough boost to send enough tugs to stop it and establish a new orbit, this is not instant and takes months but the asteroid takes years or even a decade to reach its target, side note it does not need to actually get to the target to cause damage, if it gets close enough it may cause an orbital dust cloud that can limit solar generators to 1% efficiency or cause Earth to enter an Ice age, even without hitting it will lead to loss of life and possible economic abyss Orbital Bombardment Against Cities, aliens begin orbital bombardment of population centers to quickly reduce population, the longer the bombardment goes on the more population will be removed, if completed the population in a region will be reduced by 65%, this also cases severe damage to the economy and causes global unrest by 2 for 1 year and causes the population to turn against pro alien factions or any faction not at war with them, this will destroy regional defense complexes first Orbital Saturation Bombardment, aliens begin carpeting a region in plasma in an attempt to expunge all life from that region, requires the ships doing the bombardment to have special plasma bombardment weapon and bombardment modules, the speed of this can be increased by the number of ships doing the bombardment, if completed 99% of the population of this region is killed, full economic removal, global unrest is increased by 3 for a year this will destroy regional defense complexes first Tsunami strike, firing high yield weapons into the oceans creates a tall fast moving wall of water that causes damage to coastal regions of that ocean reducing population and damages economy, environment, and infrastructure,  requires 3 slot nose weapons Titan Foundry, aliens will make Titan Foundries that can only produce titans but produces 4 at a time and produces them 50% faster than a tier 3 shipyard, the aliens will start building these by 2045 or 2050, only 1 per planet and its moons, these are not cheap for the aliens to build and destroying one will yield 1000 exotic materials, Titans built from these will have the largest and highest tier weapons available to the aliens including the Heavy Plasma Siege Cannon as this is the only facility type in the Sol System capable of building them Dreadnought Drive Yard, aliens will make Dreadnought drive yards that only produce dreadnoughts but produce 6 at a time and produce in 50% the time as a tier 3 shipyard, only 1 per planet and all its moons, these are not cheap for the aliens to build and will yield 1000 exotic materials, Dreadnoughts built from these will have the largest and highest tier weapons available to the aliens including the Plasma Siege Cannon as this is the only facility type in the Sol System capable of building them Overlapping Defenses, the Aliens gain access to a new type of defense station that can fire extreme range Plasma Cannons at anything in or near its orbit, these can only be built in orbit of the Aliens Wormhole Base, these defense stations each will fire on the world map every 3 hours, the plasma projectile does 150 damage but can be dodged by smaller ships at long range, these stations also have 6 tier 3 defense arrays and the extreme range Plasma Cannon cannot fire at targets under 20000km on the battle map, this station makes setting up in orbit of the aliens home base impossible until the stations are destroyed, attempting to storm any base they orbit will result in the station volley firing into the invading fleet Human Response to Escalation *Spoilers* Humanity First, Viral Bombings, Humanity First is able to deploy their viral weapon in bombardments for a chance to take Hydra Colonies and Star bases intact, they cant directly use the base but it gives very high bonuses to Xeno Research and gets a much greater amount of resources from deconstructing them chance to gain a local resource stock pile on taking it, has a chance to give accurate  intelligence on Hydra Operations for 6 months revealing their councilors, also gives a significant bonus to success chance for Assassination missions as well as increasing the critical success chance from 85%-100% Nuclear Proliferation and Defense, the regional defense complexes are not enough to prevent entire regions from being wiped out, 10 spending nuclear barrages will maximize the chances of getting through enemy point defense with the aid of regional defense complexes, not guaranteed and requires technology after Advanced Missile Warfare Doctrine \"Nuclear Weapon Modernization Programs\" and \"Nuclear Orbital Defense Doctrine\" Under Sea Settlements/Orbital Bombardment Shelters, coastal nations/regions can build shelters under the sea to reduce damage from orbital bombardment, it does not remove all damage from bombardments but also provides some degree of population protection from fires, Tsunamis, Storms, Nuclear Bombardment, Orbital Bombardment of Cities and Orbital Saturation Bombardment Planetary Defense Submarines, Mobile Regional Defense Complexes that can assist in attacks on coastal regions, costs 4 economics points when completed and in its submarine pin and costs 5 when actually deployed, a nation can support up to 5, these when deployed off the coast of a region will act as a regional defense complex and or can bombard armies in that coastal region, if targeted the submarine will dive and take significantly reduced damage, if deployed off the coast of a region that an alien landing in it will cancel the landing or cause damage to the landing ships Army Mobile Anti-Orbital Defense Units, Armies that are at Fusion Age come equipped with Anti-Orbital Weapons, armies will now fire back at ships bombarding the region that they are in, limits damage to the region but 25% as effective as a regional defense complex, requires end game technology Orbital Shaped Nuclear Remotely Targeted Mines, Deploys Mines that orbit the Earth that have simple thrusters and a receiver in them and solar panels, the mines can be commanded by Mission Control Centers under control by factions hostile to the aliens (most likely Humanity First) to pivot and fire their shaped nuclear lance into an alien ship, requires every shaped nuclear technology, can set as national priority and requires MC to put into orbit as well as use, creates significant amounts of debris in orbit, they appear to be normal satellites Orbital Remotely Triggered Missile Containers, large storage containers in orbit that appear to be waiting like many other containers for tugs/mass drivers to send them to their destination, the container carries 20 missiles that are launched all at the same time at 1 target, they are dropped via a ship module that requires cruiser class ships or higher, the containers do not have any sensors themselves (at least not until they are ordered to fire) aside from a receiver so they require a ship or fleet to be a spotter for them to tell them when to deploy and in which direction, can be placed in the path of incoming fleets to weaken them before engagement, note there are no game mechanics in place to change velocity or vector of a fleet once it sets out Mass Driver Relay Network, a delivery method for supplies and materials around the Sol System, increases the distance that materials can be sent from Earth as well as dramatically decreasing the time it takes to get there (assuming it is in range of the network), can also help to accelerate ships (no not as fast it must be gentle acceleration but it does increase speed without spending as much DV as it normally would), must be built at a tier 3 shipyard and towed into position, includes 1 5km long mass driver and a catching target device for recovery, constant resupplies of propellent help keep it in position, actual effect, decreases build times of structures by up to 80% (not including crew), ship build times decreased by 25%, structure rebuilding times decreased by 90%, ignores solar flares  monthly operating costs $2k, 150 water, 25 volatiles, 10 base metals, 5 rare metals  15 fissile materials, 10 MC building costs of 10k base metals, 4k rare metals, 25k water, 2.5k fissile materials, 250 exotic materials, if you are an Humanity First then it can be used offensively to launch Viral Warheads at alien colonies, if you are Project Exodus constructing and connecting a network of these to Pluto can help with your victory condition, overly expensive Logistics Structure Feel Free to add your own ideas and balance changes to these ideas, I am slow and may not respond right away",

      "content_preview": "Pretty new player to Terra Invicta, but loving the game. I read a bunch of stuff on this subreddit and on the wiki, and I think I am finally getting the hang of at least the early game. So far, as the Resistance in 2032, I fully control India and China and some tiny others like Singapore, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan. Many bases on Mars, all of Ceres, and a few orbitals over Earth and Mars. Space economy is solid, and I'm the predominant faction on Earth. Decent amount of Control Points buffer, which i am using to take Indonesia at the moment. Decent amount of MC buffer, which I am using to build a fleet. I have already shot down the Ayys for the story mission. I've got droves of cash, influence, boost, and resources. Ops is always a bit tight but eh, it's enough, given I have a 25 adm, 25 cmd, 20 esp and 19 inv superman of an operative. Two other 25 per councillors also. The issue is, all the ships I build keep getting blasted by the Ayys? I don't know if my tech is really far behind where it should be or what - I have artemis torpedoes, and green lasers,. Quantum batteries, cermet nerva and dumbo drives. But my fleets don't stand a chance against the Ayys. And neither do any of my bases, even with layered arrays. And every time a hydra shows up in India or China, I kill them, and the Ayys inevitably come and obliterate a base which I then have to rebuild So.... What do I do to git gud?",

I managed to unify Norway and Poland just a few months ago - but Lithuania already had a weird delay of nearly two years before I finally could, and now neither Britain nor New Guinea over around Australia will let me at all despite meeting every supposed condition. They've just disappeared as available candidates. Did my campaign bug out in some way? Or is there some other hidden condition where you can lose the ability even if you meet all the regular requirements?

      "content_preview": "So I just got back into the game after leaving it in April because I was having a bad time and playing poorly, and now I've watched Perun's latest Exodus playthrough and are somewhat more knowledgeable as to the mechanics, I went in with a Resistance run(light solar system, veteran) and have, by now as of early 2029, 3k research, most of the non-upgraded EU minus the Balkans and Scandinavia, and the full East African Union. I also have lots of habs on Mars and Mercury leaving me with about +300 monthly for water and volatiles, +1k metals, and +50 nobles and fissiles with a decent stockpile for all of them. My plan is to tech up so that by 2033ish or maybe a bit later by the time the AC arrives I can stack like 5+ battlecruisers with coils and green arcs and get them all off the slips at the same time, roughly when the AC comes so that I can immediately go to war with them without taking retribution. I'm doing wayyyy better than I used to, I'd get like 3k research on normal by 2040 while constantly losing habs left and right. The problem is, I forgot to periodically cull Servant and Protectorate councillors and now the Protectorate has the US and has fixed it, while the Servants are in the process of fixing China. Oops. Should I start making preparations for Phoenix or are there things I can still do?",

      "content_preview": "Basically in the earth section of the game, whoever controls the countries with the highest boost get to snowball into space, grabbing all the resource rich sites. The issue here is there are only a handful of countries with decent boost (Kazakhstan, USA, etc.) and the player almost always go for one, or even both of them, which lead to the unfortunate snowball effect into space, and the AI factions who got left behind on earth only get to mine the leftovers, causing them to be incapable to do anything useful against the alien for the rest of the game. What are your thoughts on this? Is there a way they can balance this? One solution is to redistribute the boost a bit more evenly across the countries, but that wouldn't reflect the real life counterpart.",

The % bonuses only mean that i get to these points sooner? At this time it seems that space resources are plenty.. misssion control what limits my fleet.. but again that can be fixed with money and resources can be turned into money..so actually I probably should just mass product ships and try my strength (I am cautious starting a real war yet as my ships power is not that great.. ) No spoiler please, thx,",

      "content_preview": "So, Escalations are optional challenge or features that you on or leave off from the custom game menu, I am slow and may not respond right away, this section will mostly be for the aliens Bombardments/Orbital Actions from the Aliens Destruction of Earth Orbit Artificial Satellites, Alien ships will begin destroying all manmade satellites in Earth orbit, this takes about 6 months (total) and should the ship/fleet doing it be engaged or run it will be stopped but can be resumed (assuming adequate ammunition), This would decrease Earth's global economy by up to 80%, Armies have a 60% malus to combat power and take longer to start acting or orders, Global Research is nearly impossible so research moves at 10% normal speed, putting anything in orbit or anywhere would cost significantly more boost and mission control is worth 25% its normal amount, Political and resource wars would be constant, global defense would be incoherent at best and nearly impossible at worst, placing anything in orbit would see it added debris fields, this would be the easiest to do for the aliens but would likely have the most weight for an invasion and keeping humanity ineffective, this type of bombardment/orbital action can be done at any time and has no requirements or special triggers Targeting of Population Centers, humanity has proven too numerous to tame/domesticate and must have its numbers reduced to become manageable, aliens deliberately begin orbital bombardment of cities to decrease and scatter populations, takes 2 weeks to finish and the longer it goes on the more population is lost, will kill up to 75% of the population of a region, causes severe damage to economy  in that region, if any special features exist (Core Economic Region, resource region, exc) they are removed on completion, causes global economic damage, global unrest +2 per month for a year but can be mitigated by regional defense complexes, this type of bombardment becomes available if the alien administration is destroyed or if the invasion otherwise fails Saturation Bombardment, humanity has proven to give effective resistance both on the ground and in space so removing the ability to support fleets in armies must be reduced as well as the population that is clearly overwhelming, aliens will deliberately expunge all life from an entire region leaving nothing but ashes, dust, and screams on the wind, a region will be saturated with titanic spinal laser weapons and plasma bombs leaving nothing in the region, population in this region will be completely removed, all features are removed, adjacent regions will suffer horrifically powerful tornadoes from the temperature difference between the regions, causes severe damage to global economy, global unrest increases by +4 per month for a year and can be halved by regional defense complexes, this bombardment type requires titanic laser cannons and a special plasma bomb magazine, this type of bombardment is only available if the aliens have been pushed out of Jupiter and has titans/lancers with the required weaponry in any bombardment Earth orbit Tsunami Strike, the aliens attempt to cause damage to coastal regions by firing into the ocean/sea to create a Tsunami to ravage attached coastal regions, requires a Heavy Mag Cannon or Spinal Mag Cannon with at least 1 ammunition left, an easy to preform type of bombardment that would be difficult to defend against, causes population and economic damage to the affected coastal regions, this bombardment becomes available should an invasion force arrive in Earth orbit Alien Structure Escalation ideas Titan Foundry, a massive space craft production faculty that only produces advanced heavy titans but the titans are produced 4 at a time, produced in 50% less time than a tier 3 shipyard, Titans produced at this facility are going to be built with 4 slot gamma-ray laser battery and a pair of pd or 4 slot Mag battery and pair of pd, its spinal mount will be 1 of 3 unique weapons the Advanced Heavy Plasma Siege cannon (120 plasma damage, 15000km range, 1 round per minute, 300 shots), Hybrid Laser Plasma Artillery Weapon (50 damage with full 50 to armor, 1250 km range, 4 shots per minute, 1000 shots), or a Heavy Siege Mag Weapon, only 1 per planet and all its moons, these are not cheap and destroying one will yield up to 1k exotic materials as well as other resources, these take 5 years to build Dreadnought Drive Yard, a massive space craft production facility that only produces advanced heavy dreadnoughts that are produced 6 at a time, production time is 50% less time than a tier 3 shipyard, Dreadnoughts produced at this facility will have unique hull mount weapons and smaller versions of the unique heavy titan spinal mount weapons, hull slots increased to have 10 slots and an additional 2 slots for dedicated pd, hull weapons, Plasma Torpedo Silos, a 6 slot plasma weapon that has a 1000KM range and does 100 plasma damage with 6 rounds a minute,  Super Heavy Mag Battery, 6 slot mag weapon that does massive damage and very high velocity, range of 1250KM, and the Super Heavy Gamma-Ray Battery a deadly 6 slot Laser Weapon with 1250KM range and armor effectiveness of 1% at 1000km, only 1 of these facilities per planet and all its moons, these take 5 years to build and if destroyed yield 800 exotic materials as well other resources Upgraded Alien Defenses, if the aliens are pushed off Neptune they can build special defense stations over their home base, that can fire plasma missiles at anything in orbit, this prevents bombardment and storming the bases on the planetoid below until they are destroyed Human Structure Mass Driver Relay, a toggle for those that want increased complexity in the logistics network, you must manually build, manually tow into position, pay upkeep on and even defend them from attack, can be built at any shipyard, contains a 5-mile-long mass driver, a catching device for packets, crew quarters, crew, and generators, having more than you need will decrease time required to get materials to locations, requires cruiser class vessels with enough thrust and enough dV to get it into position, the Mass Driver Relay has no offensive weapons but does have a few PD weapons, the mass driver may not be used as a weapon Alien and Servant upgrade ideas Bastion Fortress, the alien facilities are replaced with bastion fortresses, these build alien battle formation, do additional damage to any army attacking the region while also preventing the region from falling until it is destroyed, functions as a spawn point for Hydra Councilors, must be assaulted 3 times to be destroyed (by army or councilors), can fire at ships preforming orbital bombardments at the region or its self and will shoot down nuclear missiles fired at it or the region, it does not cost more for the servants to build it Servants Salamander Bodyguards, on contacting the aliens the Servants can get a repeating 3-star org of Salamander Bodyguards that give +3 investigation, espionage and administration, and +4 security, this can only be picked up by the Servants and cannot be traded, sold, stolen, or destroyed So this was an update on the previous suggested Escalation ideas, feel free to give your thoughts and ideas",

      "content_preview": "The AI factions are critizied for their incompetence and they are usually defeated for good in the early game. As bored as I am, I wonder: would the game actually be better with stronger AI gameplay? First: Earth phase In my experience, I had to fight for the superpowers, but eventually I got all of them and keeping them was not so difficult. Imagine an AI that is focused, if they decide they want the US or Russia they put all their resources into the task. They would detain or kill your councilors, run 4 public champaign and 2 crack down missions until they accomplish their goal.. they would micro their orgs to max efficiency, they might have high bonuses on higher difficulties.. and ofc not just one AI but all of them would attack untill they have secured a considerable power for themselves. would this be fun or just cause frustration? I think the country take over and hold mechanisms needed to be  changed somehow, but overall it would be great to see established territories for each factions, that could last. Second: overall success on Earth and space could ultimately measured by the strength of your fleet. If the AI was capable it would raise strong fleets eventually constantly threaten you and maybe even the aliens too. You may have to grab the victory as resistance from the HF while hand in hand destroying the aliens' bases. With human factions building capable fleets everywhere defending your assets would be very difficult. a more meaningful defense system should be in place against quick raids and assaults. Right now it's not that difficult to cripple the AI in space-by destroying their bases constantly, but usually it's not necessary because it is crippled without it. Without defendable, clustered and defined terrirories I don't think a space war/conquest would be very fun against the AI. So what do you think? Is actually the current state of the AI factions better for the game? That they only serve as a small obstacle, and the real and only enemy is the scripted alien faction. Or could the game work if they were really competent and used similar strategies as the player do? (Obviously, this is not meant to be a suggestion or request, only discussion)",
