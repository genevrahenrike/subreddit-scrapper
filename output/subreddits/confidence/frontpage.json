First a senior asked me to do a task first I refused but he forced me so i go on stage he said i have to fill 3 balloons in 15 sec i refused and came back. The room is filled and myself is draining heavily. Second they started taking introductions with everyone. I speak mostly in lower tone and i heavily lacked confidence since my childhood. My voice shakes and words jumbled infront of others. I just ran away from the room snd from the uni too. Damnn how am i supposed to survive with such confidence in next 4 years. Damnnn",

      "content_preview": "I used to wonder why people seemed to avoid me at social events. Conversations would die when I joined them. People would give me polite smiles and find excuses to walk away. I'd leave parties feeling invisible and confused. Turns out, I had developed 5 toxic social habits that were pushing people away without me even realizing it. I thought I was being friendly, confident, or interesting. I didn't know I was being annoying. So here's the 5 habits that can make people dislike you and how to overcome it: Habit 1 - Making Everything About You Someone mentions their vacation and you immediately jump in with \"Oh that reminds me of when I went to...\" Someone shares a problem and you respond with \"That's nothing, let me tell you about MY situation...\" I was a conversation interrupter. Every story became a launching pad for my own stories. Every problem became an opportunity to one-up someone. Instead of doing this ask follow-up questions instead. \"How did that make you feel?\" \"What was the best part?\" Let them finish their story before sharing yours. Habit 2 - Being a Phone Zombie Nothing says \"you're not important\" like checking your phone while someone's talking to you. I thought I was being subtle. Quick glances at notifications, responding to \"urgent\" texts, scrolling while pretending to listen. People notice every single time. And they take it personally. Phone face down or in your pocket. If you're expecting something urgent, tell people upfront. Otherwise, be present. It's uncomfortable talking to someone in their phone always. Habit 3 - Complaining Constantly \"Traffic was horrible.\" \"My boss is an idiot.\" \"This weather sucks.\" \"I'm so tired.\" I was dumping negativity on everyone around me. I thought I was just sharing my day. Really, I was emotionally draining people. For every complaint, share something positive. Or better yet, complain less and ask about their day more. As a bonus compliment people. It'll make their day and they'll remember it. Habit 4 - Interrupting and Finishing People's Sentences I thought I was being helpful by finishing people's thoughts. I thought I was showing I understood by jumping in before they finished. Actually, I was being disrespectful as hell. When you interrupt, you're saying \"what I have to say is more important than what you're saying.\" Count to three after someone stops talking before you respond. Let silence happen. People often have more to say. Plus if you don't interrupt it means you value what the other person is saying. Habit 5 - Being a Know-It-All \"Actually, that's not quite right...\" \"Well, technically...\" \"I read an article that said...\" I couldn't let anything slide. Every conversation became a fact-checking session. Every opinion became a debate I had to win. Nobody likes being corrected in casual conversation. Save the Wikipedia facts for trivia night. Ask yourself \"Does this really matter?\" before correcting someone. Choose connection over being right. If it doesn't just don't say anything. Just let things happen normally. No need to be the I know it all guy. People don't care how smart you are or how interesting your stories are. They care about how you make them feel. As a side note make people feel heard, not lectured. Make them feel important, not interrupted. Make them feel positive, not drained. Your job in social situations isn't to impress people. It's to make them comfortable and valued. The people who are magnetic aren't the ones with the best stories. They're the ones who make others feel like they have the best stories. Best of luck",

      "content_preview": "I see so many posts from men who want more confidence to approach women and who fear rejection. I suppose this is just how we're influenced to think about it. No doubt that not every woman will be interested in you, but that's not the problem. The problem is that you think being accepted by the right woman will save your life. The problem is that you're so focused on your own insecurities that you're failing to read the room. The problem is that you're so focused on success that you're not having any damn fun with it. Finding the right woman will change your life (not save it). Learning to read the room will tell you when an approach is not welcome, and recognizing that will reduce your rejection rate. And knowing all this will take some of the pressure off so you can have fun with it. But you won't do any of it. Your problem is too much a part of your identity. Getting over it would mean giving up your fantasy of salvation when your perfect approach earns you the perfect woman. And it seems that by confidence, you mean a feeling that you're good enough that she won't reject you. You don't need to be good enough. You need to give her the opportunity to decide if she's interested. You need to actually be an interesting person. You can't fake it. If you're trying to convince yourself that you are, you're not. That's ok, but being interesting isn't a performance. It's a consequence of life experience, and life experience beyond fantasizing about the perfect approach. That's not interesting at all. Just give it up. Give up the fantasy, the desire, the need to approach. That will make you more interesting right away, more than anything else you could do. And if you can't give it up, then at least give up the seriousness about it. Try to fail. Put on the performance that you fear you're making anyway. Try to make your voice squeak a little more. Try to avoid eye contact, try to mumble, and open with the stupidest dad joke you can memorize. Do something different than this tired mental routine that isn't working. If you really want confidence, go out there and get rejected so many times that you're not afraid of it anymore. It doesn't hurt unless her boyfriend  is around the corner and he has an anger problem. That's why you need to read the room, but if you're trying to get rejected anyway, that's less of a concern.",

      "content_preview": "Over the past 2 months, I’ve begun going out to bars alone to meet people. My main reason for doing this is that I’m about to move across the country and will only know 3 people when I get there. For context. I’m a 24 year old guy who’s always struggled with confidence. I’ve had so many people over the years tell me I was attractive, funny, good to talk to, etc. but I feel like I haven’t really been able to accept that and actually feel that way about myself until these last 4-5 months. Therapy has certainly helped, but I think just really putting myself out there has been the primary reason for my newfound confidence. Going to a bar alone forces you to socialize with strangers, otherwise you just have to sit there and drink alone and personally I hate doing that. I’ve met a lot of great people and honestly there have been nights where I’ll prefer going out alone rather than with friends just because I can go and do whatever I want and talk to whoever I want. It’s a very liberating experience. I’ve done it about 5 or 6 times now, and plan on trying it when I move. People are usually receptive to meeting new people at bars, and you can learn a lot about someone just by listening to them talk about whatever they want. Best practice is to ask if you can sit with them, if they say no don’t get offended just say “no worries at all” and find another group. It’s just a really good way of practicing social and conversational skills in my opinion. I know this isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. It has it’s safety risks and not everyone drinks, but it’s personally helped me a ton",

I have dreamt of exploring the world since I was a kid and the thought of losing that dream is absolutely crushing my spirit. I can’t imagine leaving my girlfriend and friends in a world where I couldn’t thank them for being the amazing figures they are. I want to spoil them and give them experiences to remember me for a lifetime. I hate seeing my parents and family suffer and grieve me before I am even gone. I have such a fire to live and I am not going to give up and leave those who care for me behind. I am going to see this word and conquer my fears and face this life head on. Though I may have been dealt a bad hand, I believe my luck hasn’t ran out yet and I’m thankful and praying for a better day each day. I am making an Instagram and TikTok account to follow my journey in living my best life, all the way till the end. If anyone wants to help me along the way or follow along, my account is @rsaxdaily.

But I learned something that completely flipped my perspective. Real confidence is actually quiet. It's that friend who stays incredibly calm during a crisis while everyone else is losing their minds. They don't need to prove anything to anyone because they know their own worth. I've noticed this pattern everywhere now. The most genuinely confident people I know rarely feel the need to announce how great they are. They just show up consistently, handle their business, and keep moving forward even when things get messy. When chaos hits and everyone starts panicking, these are the people others naturally turn to. Not because they're shouting instructions, but because their steady presence makes everyone feel safer. That's the kind of confidence I want to build in myself. The kind that doesn't need validation or applause.",

I bounce around a lot at shows and passed by her a few times by chance. But I was always way to scared to approach her and her friends. And ended up leaving feeling extremely dejected. Its hard not to feel like its the only chance you'll get, and I was extremely upset with myself last night for not giving myself a chance and stepping up.

      "content_preview": "This goes for guys too, but as a woman I guess I’m mostly speaking to other women. I haven’t always felt pretty, be it my weight, or my teeth, or my hair, or whatever. But there’s times where I’ve felt really pretty. I hardly go out lately, but the times that I do - I feel really pretty. My face looks nice and I look like I’m kind, and my cheeks look rosy. I like how my collarbone looks. There’s still things I’d like to change and that I currently feel insecure about, but I’m trying to remind myself that those flaws or insecurities don’t mean I’m not pretty, because I am. Also, another woman’s beauty isn’t your lack. Comparing myself to others is something new to me in the last few years and I’ve realized it’s done a number on my self esteem. But, so what if she’s pretty or may even prettier? So what if he’d date her but not me? My life doesn’t revolve around them, it revolves around myself and the people that I love and love me back. And the same goes for you.",

People complement their clothes even when they are wearing average clothing. They get free things and pushed to the front of lines. I never really believed in pretty privilege until I started to go out with them. They can be cringe and people think they are cool. They can be late and forget things and make mistakes and they are not only forgiven but applauded for being “so relatable” and “so real”. Meanwhile, there is no pardon for me. I have always thought I was pretty. But now that I see how people treat me in comparison, I realize that perhaps I am not. I used to think that my friends were delusional because they say that the world is the great place and the “men are not that bad” and strangers smile at them. I realize that that IS their truth. People have always been indifferent to me. We are in two different worlds. I didn’t realize how much it affected me. It makes me sad because I used to I wish the world was easier the answer to my problems was being pretty and I didn’t even realize. In some ways I’m thankful I’m not that attractive because it acts like a filter for authentic and wholesome people with good intentions. (This is truly a first world problem and I feel grateful that I am healthy and free.) But sometimes I would I could switch with them for a day. I would really like for a stranger to smile at me. Edit: I just want to say that I am confident and positive in who I am. I have nothing against anyone but I’m just observing some objective truths and have been awakened to the stark contrast of our realities.",

Even now, the idea of not being loved scares me. I try distracting myself with random chat apps, but it only makes me feel worse. I have a job, but nothing in my life feels meaningful — not my job, not even how I see myself.

I've been studying how the specific words and frames we use to describe our problems can sometimes keep us trapped in a loop of low confidence. I'm learning about a questioning technique that is designed to help people see their own \"stuck\" situations from a more resourceful and powerful angle. I've learned the theory, and now I need to practice. This is where I'm hoping some of you might be open to helping. I'm looking for a few volunteers to share a specific confidence-related challenge or a limiting belief you're struggling with. It could be anything from a fear of public speaking, to feeling like an imposter at work, to anxiety in social situations. In return for your help, I will do my best to ask you one or two follow-up questions designed to help you see your situation in a new light. Just to be clear: I am not a therapist, and this is not professional advice . This is a practice session for me to become a better listener and question-asker. My only goal is to respectfully offer you a new perspective on your own challenge. If you're feeling stuck and are open to looking at your situation differently, I would be grateful for the chance to practice with you. Please share your challenge in the comments below. Thank you for helping me learn! 🙏",

That perspective is what keeps hope alive. Keep going. Fail forward. Stay positive. Stay persistent. Stay consistent. Be hopeful. Have faith. Trust God.

Two of my best friends are in great relationships, with both of them having anniversaries in November, the fifth for one and the fourth for the other. There's quite literally nothing in life I want more than to one day have a loving family. Those two couples are the most perfect couples I can think of, it's actually unbelievable how compatible they are, and they are probably going to build that together. To be completely clear, I don't secretly hate my friends, I don't resent them, feel angry with envy or anything like that, I love them both very much and I love their girlfriends like my sisters, they are both incredible humans and are really good for them. It's just hard sometimes to listen about how great they have it, about the double dates they go to, or to be a third or fifth wheel. Again, I love them, I love hanging out with them, even as couples, but I can't help but feel like an extra sometimes. Another thing that hurts is when I have something nice happen, or I need to vent about something, those two are the first people I think of and am going to call. I know I'm not the first person they think of. Their girlfriends are. That makes complete sense to me and I'm not mad about that, but I feel sad that there's no one I'm number 1 to. I just feel heavy in my stomach when I see them progress so far and I seem to go nowhere and they were just stroked by luck so much, to be in the right time, at the right place, to find their perfect matches, and I can't get a second date. I feel like time's slipping away and I see them, the two people closest to me, living out my biggest wish and hear about it so much because they are so happy, and while I'm happy for them when I hear them speak, I get home alone yet again and can't get my mind off of it.",

I literally can’t tell when somebody just wants to help me anymore, and yeah, that’s gotta be a terrifying thing to sit with. Just know that if nothing else, intentions matter more than life itself to me. If you do not feel like you need to go get help professionally, try to think about one person that you would do that for. Just know that they would be proud of you. If nothing else. You don’t have to be liked to know that you’ve been loved for your personality. If that is too much for somebody to handle, let them walk away. There is no point in trying to reach out to people that clearly have nothing better to do in their life than be friendly. Because yeah man people need to know that they are loved. It’s very important. Just because you care about somebody does not give you any right to be able to reach out and pester somebody and my mom taught me the complete opposite. Just because my mom has whored herself for her own life does not mean that you need to do that for yourself either. Let them walk away",

      "content_preview": "Yesterday I was at a friend’s birthday dinner, and after the meal a few of us decided to keep celebrating at a bar that was playing house music. While I was at the bar, I noticed this gorgeous girl hanging out with her friend near the counter. I hesitated at first, waiting for the “perfect” opportunity. Then suddenly she disappeared, and I thought she had left I was honestly kicking myself for not making a move. But turns out she had just gone to the bathroom, and the second she came back, I went over and started a conversation. We grabbed some drinks, chatted with her and her friend, and before long her friend went home. My group had also moved on, so it ended up just me and her. We stayed talking until closing time around 3 a.m. and the conversation just clicked. We had so much in common it almost felt easy. At the end of the night, I walked her to a taxi, and right before she left, we kissed. She gave me her Instagram, and I’m definitely going to reach out to see her again. Here’s the thing: if this had happened two months ago, I wouldn’t have even tried. I used to have major social anxiety and no real confidence when it came to women. But I’ve been making changes gym, better habits, and I also read this ebook about building confidence that gave me a whole new mindset. Honestly, I can feel myself growing. Even if this doesn’t turn into anything serious, I’m proud. Because the old me would’ve just watched her from across the room. The fact that I went for it and ended up kissing her is a big personal milestone. Step by step, I’m becoming more confident.",

      "content_preview": "I, 22 YO, am disabled, it's hard to be friends with me for many reasons. Count my disabilities as a few already, because IDK, people don't wanna be friends with a disabled girl. I know it's pathetic, don't ask me I don't have the answer as to why that is. Anyway, I'm not writing this post as a pitty party' or for simpothy points because that's just again, pathetic. I'm writing this is a cold hard, shitty ass truth that has made me sad, but it's what it is. How do I make friends? I am deep into a lot of online stuff and I communicate a lot there, but you have to be careful online because people suck and they're not always honest and good. There is also community events to go to, but it is hard for me to get to those places although I'm sure I could find a way. This goes without saying that I'm probably over exaggerating a little bit, but it is undoubtedly true. The people who I have tried to be friends with I don't really like, but maybe I'll try again. I can only find other disabled people to be friends with though, which I don't exactly want either. I don't necessarily want to be friends with everyone because that's not possible but I just don't understand how to normally make friends just like everyone else. It makes me sad. I have a great and loving family, and friends somewhere, but again, they're either far away as to where I can't get to them or it would take me hours, or online which isn't always the safest option. I'm just not sure how to do this, maybe I could go to some community events, and I've been trying to organize some of my life coach and my family, but this is taking freaking forever. I have been back in my hometown for three goddamn months, and I have Not many friends. I know that bumming around and sitting in the house isn't going to do anything, but my family, understandably doesn't want me to go out on my own yet, which although it's annoying, it makes complete sense because there are a lot of weird asses in my town, and a lot of sketchy shit has been happening lately. I am trying to learn more independence so thankfully for that, I can try to hopefully do this in the near future. I just don't have any idea, and it is dragging me down. I wake up every morning thinking about it, and I cannot let it go or stop. The other worry I have is maintaining them, but I am afraid that this is such a long post, I will have to put a pause on this and make another one. What do you guys think am I being dramatic or is this a thing?",

Anyways, I want to try to talk to guys irl to gain more confidence,  but rejection scares me and im scared to look like a dumb ass at times. I know I have to get out there and do it, but like is overcoming this fear even necessary nowadays?  😅 I mean we can just swipe and strike up a convo through mesaging. Its hella sad and pathetic ngl. Societies going downhill broham! But anyways, do yall have any advice on like talking to guys in real life. I have the social confidence of a frog jumping out of water(if that even makes sense..

At the moment, I just feel at a loss with my confidence. When I go out, I feel like people always look at me weird. I’m self conscious about my weight and my eyes. I have a bold personality and often tell it as it is, so I’m not everyone’s cup of tea. I have a very strong exterior but soft interior. I find dating really difficult. I find things like rejection really difficult - for example, when getting ghosted, the conscious part of my brain says “it probably has nothing to do with you” whilst the subconscious part says “well maybe you were giving off desperate vibes a bit..” I’m just stuck in a bit of a life pickle where my self confidence is so low and I feel “desperate” when it comes to dating.. when really I think I have a lot to offer..

If you didn’t see it I almost let the chance slip because I was nervous, but when she came back from the bathroom, I finally took the plunge. We ended up talking for hours, had a few drinks, and kissed when I walked her to a cab. That was a huge win for me personally, especially since just months ago I was struggling with serious social anxiety and zero self-confidence. Fast forward to last night, and we had our first official date. We met for dinner at a nice little restaurant downtown, then went to a cocktail bar close by. The whole night was chill and fun we laughed a lot, shared stories about family, talked about music, and even future goals. The wild part? The more we talked, the more we discovered we had in common. Later, I walked her back to her place. I didn’t want to come off too strong, so I played it cool but outside her building, we kissed. And not just a quick one… we ended up making out for like 5 or 6 minutes, totally in the moment. I won’t lie, it felt amazing. But what I’m really proud of is how I felt the whole evening calm, self-assured, and present. That might sound ordinary to some, but for me, it’s a big milestone. I’ve been working hard going to the gym, building better habits, and reading this ebook on confidence that really helped me quit overthinking when I’m around women. A few months ago, this version of me didn’t exist. I’m not sure what’s next, but I’d really like to see her again maybe something more could come of it. Even if it doesn’t go the distance, I’m just proud of how far I’ve come. I’m not that guy anymore who used to sit alone in fear of saying hello.",

I can tell men are attracted to me and theoretically I am pretty. I don’t feel pretty but I know I’m attractive if that makes sense. People noticing me makes me feel even more anxious. I feel like they’re judging me and I get even more self conscious. I thought being pretty would automatically grant me confidence, I thought they were synonymous. How do I deal with this? How do I feel pretty? How do I have confidence? Apologies if this sounded conceited, I just wanted to explain this as direct as possible.",

I was in the shopping mall, minding my own business, when I saw a girl looking at sunglasses in a store. Something in me just said, “Go say hi.” So I did. We chatted for a few minutes about random stuff her favorite coffee spot in the mall, places she likes to travel. A month ago, I wouldn’t have dared, but lately I’ve been on a mission working on my mindset, fitness, and even reading this quick ebook on building confidence with women. It’s crazy how much difference it makes in how you carry yourself. Before leaving, I said we should connect, and she gave me her Instagram. Honestly wasn’t expecting it. Now I’m wondering… should I message her tomorrow for a drink, or play it cool and wait?",

      "content_preview": "This is a newer problem for me (21F), but it’s been weighing on me pretty heavily. My last ex (28M) boyfriend never found me attractive but stayed with me regardless. He on the other hand, was the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen (speaking purely objectively.) He was a bodybuilder and genuinely could’ve been an Abercrombie fitch model with his face. I dived hard into fitness also and improving my looks but no matter how much more physically attractive I got, it never felt like he was physically attracted to me. It got pretty bad where I developed an 3d, orthorexia, etc. I got some notoriety on TikTok for my looks but still it was never enough. Honestly, it destroyed me when he left me at my “best,” and ever since, I feel like I will never look good enough even if I tried my hardest and looked my absolute physically possible best. Fast forward, I recently met this amazing guy (26M) who is incredibly sweet and thinks I’m drop dead gorgeous but I can’t shake the feeling of being physically insecure off. It feels like self sabotaging because I’ll never truly feel comfortable in my skin— even as I’m “working on myself”— and I’m scared I’m going to lose this great guy because I’ll never feel confident again. How do you guys handle the idea of not being the most physically attractive person in your partners eyes? TL;DR I’m scared I will never feel confident in my skin in any relationship ever again",

I truly have beautiful friends and being around them at bars and social occasions years on end has made me see myself get passed up hundreds of times. The guys are going up to them, the girls in the bar are complimenting them, it never seems to be me. And they deserve every bit of it, I just wish I was included in it too. I had never realized how hard this was on me until I got my first boyfriend. Then the comparison really came in full force. It really made me look at people in everyday situations and online more and realize how much more beautiful there is out there. I saw a video recently of someone saying “there is always going to be someone with bigger boobs than you, or better hair, or a prettier face, that is just a matter of fact.” And it kind of helped me phrase what has kept me in insecurity for so long. How do I feel self confident or pretty or special when there is always going to be someone with better features or prettier than me? I’ve fallen worse in worse into insecurity and it has become debilitating. I have started therapy as well but it isn’t helping much. So I was just hoping to reach out to someone to see if anyone has ever had the same thought process.",
