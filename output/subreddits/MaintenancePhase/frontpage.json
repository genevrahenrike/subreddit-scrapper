      "content_preview": "I’ve been feeling very conflicted about my diet and life choices. I’m a big time foodie. I love food. I love cooking new recipes and especially baking. Food channels have been my obsession on YouTube. I like learning about new recipes and cooking techniques. But knowing how animals are exploited in big farming industries, environmental impacts, and feeling like a hypocrite because I love animals, I feel a storm of emotions. And not to mention learning about food science, like how chemicals react with each other and benefits and consequences has left me stressed and burnt out a bit. I saw on Cooking for Peanuts, a vegan blog and channel, things like “bananas cancel out the antioxidants in blueberries so stop putting bananas and blueberries in smoothies together!” Or what I should eat to get better skin, potentially live longer, and prevent disease. She’s a whole foods vegan dietitian. I also have a vegan friend who I’m staying with. She’s also in medicine and is passionate about veganism to reduce environmental impacts and improve health. She’s said that meat rots in your stomach and that too much protein will kill you. I said that I wanted to talk to a doctor/health professional at the gym to discuss a diet plan for me but she said to not do that because “doctors are sponsored by McDonalds.” The former makes zero sense since we wouldn’t be alive if meat rotted inside us. But I skimmed google about protein being bad for you in excess. There were results saying that it can cause kidney stones and that red meat is bad for you in large amounts. I’ve been a little frustrated with veganism now even though I appreciate the intent to reduce harm to the environment and animals. But food has a lot of cultural significance and traditions attached to it. And the idea that plant based meals are better because they’re healthier than another culture’s just feels wrong. I was a little annoyed with the Forks Over Knives episode (the criticisms of the documentary are valid) when Aubrey and Michael acknowledged the harm by the agriculture industry but were like, “but do what you want.” It made me feel weird. Acknowledging harm but saying to eat what you want so nonchalantly left me feeling confused as to what I should do.",

I was younger and silly then but I already changed my mind on this show years ago. I remember Bob And Jillian being awful to contentants but I almost thought it was for the show but geez it's painful listening to Bob on the Netflix documentary. He's a little devil, he is so full of himself and clearly has no remorse for what he did, he would clearly do it all over again and holds the same beliefs he did while on this show. I haven't followed what he does now, but whatever it is I wouldn't be shocked if it's another diet/thin/fat shaming business. This man is a piece of work.",

(I was also miffed from wanting more Aubrey in the documentary than we got, since she is the only reason I watched it.) Is there a Maintenance Phase episode on myths around overweight pregnancies? I was a doula's assistant for a few years and all of our overweight clients had beautiful, healthy babies with little complications in labor. As someone who was too skinny during my pregnancy, I was on health watch almost every week--being told to put on more weight, being told I needed to supplement more than other women because I was vomiting every nutrient out of my body, being told I needed to bring down my blood pressure--yet, I was praised by everyone (non-medical) around me for being \"fit\" in my pregnancy. I was always sure to correct them that I am having a really hard time keeping food down and felt like I was going to collapse at any moment--then my kid came premature! Being skinny does not equate to a healthy pregnancy!! I can't believe they just brushed over that in the documentary.",

Correcting this mistake is important to better prepare folks to identify alt-right pipelines That mistake was a brief aside, saying that some of the \"granola nazi\" beliefs are, at base, \"left wing.\" While these beliefs can be held by leftists and other political identities, \"clean\" eating and a return to the land has always been a part of Nazi ideology. Here are some easy (and non-paywalled) reads to start learning about this history -- \" Bio-Nazis Go Green In Germany \" - an article on the modern movement, contextualized in German Nazi history \"Tracing the Link Between Natural Food and the Nazis\", from the ABC \" Eating Organic in Nazi Germany \" - podcast led by a historian, from Wash U EDIT to repeat myself extremely plainly, because more than one person seems to be commenting and arguing that this kind of belief is left-wing -- a belief that the og nazis held, adhered to, and actively propagandized, is not a \"left-wing belief.\" These beliefs don't automatically make someone a nazi, but they operate as a genuine, historically and philosophically accurate part of that ideology. People can love organic food because they're alt-right fascists, not in spite of it folks. I dont know how much more plainly I can put this. EDIT #2: Honestly, maybe it's on me for assuming that listeners of this podcast would have basic reading comprehension skills.",

Did your doctor listen to you? Did you get someone new to listen to the podcast? Were you able to have a good conversation with a friend or acquaintance about fatphobia? Did you make some good progress in therapy? Feel free to share your feel-good stories to mark a strong start to the new week :). Feel free to also share news you've found on the internet that feels like a victory against fatphobia! Maybe your state just made discrimination against fat people illegal, or there's a fat activist activity going on in your area (e.g. Fat Beach Day in NY).

      "content_preview": "As the title says! And I could quote the script from memory - Jillian’s voice still lives in my head rent free any time I stretch!! TW: teen diet/exercise talk, brief mention abuse and mental health Tldr: I used Jillian’s workouts from age 14 onwards, and also her self help pdf/journal helped me when no one else would - she has both negatively and positively influenced my mental health and informed the way I approached health in general. I want a deep dive from Aubrey on Jillian’s career, and I have a lot to unpack in therapy. I have been listening to MP for almost a year now and along with the new perspectives ive taken, the Fit for TV doc inspired further reflection on my diet filled life. I was 14 years old. Quite an active kid anyway due to family lifestyle, but my body was growing fatter than my classmates and I began to get teased. My mum had bought herself the dvd “Jillian Michaels 30day shred” a 20 min intense home workout meant to be done everyday and advertised 5lb a week drop. Mum encouraged me to try the video. I think maybe I had encountered the Special K diet prioir, but this was my first structured workout experience. It was hard, but once my body got fit enough to keep up I sometimes enjoyed it. But the fact it had to be done everyday definitely affected the way I listen (or don’t) to my body and possibly ignited the exercise obsession I’ve had for many many years. I used this dvd workout on and off for so many years, well into my early 20s so I pretty much know it off by heart - I still use the warm up exercises when I wake up (just to wake up my body) I’m not surprised by her MAHA involvement but it’s so weird to see her in these scandals when she has been a consistent presence in my exercise journey. Certainly reflecting on this and my 14-23yr old self and how I was encouraged to treat my body! Interestingly though, when I was 16/17 I (unsurprisingly) had a reallllly tough time with mental health and depression - and I grew up with parents that knew F all about that and ignored me. Eventually realising no help was coming, that I would have to dig myself out this “hole” of depression (yes I know..😩 ) I found Jillian Michaels had a free self help journal thing for mental health - 🤯 not to do with physical health but a confidence coaching type thing. I printed it out and got to work. With the help of this I started taking better care of myself, like going to bed earlier, drinking more water and boundarying my me time. After doing these things for a while I was confident enough to leave my a**sive boyfriend. Yes I know lol, it was Jillian Michaels who taught me the first things I learnt about self care and mental health - wild!! It’s interesting to look back at how that might have influenced my approach to health in general…..(side note: up until a few years ago I was a crunchy yoga girl and scared of big pharma 😱😱 up until I realised most people in those circles were far right anti trans rascist fuck faces - which made me rethink it all.) Jillian also came out with a Yoga inspired workout and it’s so weird as she butchers yoga completely haha but she also has a calmer “nice” demeanour throughout the video. So yeah it’d be cool for a deep dive on Jillian’s career from Aubrey and Michaels perspective tbh. I’ve got to the end of this post with plenty of material for my next therapy session lol- Jillian Michaels significantly influenced my outlook on health and was “there” for me when no one else was o m g 😂🤯🫨🫣 so much to unpack lol Anyone else? 😂",

      "content_preview": "https://virgietovar.substack.com/podcast Only 2 eps released up to this point, Ep1 was an intro, Ep2 was about the risks of the appetite-suppressive effects of GLP-1 inhibitors for people with eating disorders. So far I've found the core points thoughtful, even if the style is sometimes a little sensationalist for my taste. One of the points she makes in the intro episode is how it seems like the marketers of these drugs have deliberated targeted and tried to coopt fat-positive influencers and the language associated with them. I'd like to see how she elaborates on that in future episodes, but I find that compelling. So much of the discourse of \"Is Body Positivity Dead?\" has acted like the decline of body positivity and fat lib has been a passive effect of the arrival of Ozempic and similar drugs. The notion that it might also be the effect of a targeted campaign to neutralize influencers whose message would decrease demand for these drugs is all the more troubling!",

      "content_preview": "idk about yall but this doc was super disappointing. I was initally intrigued bc i saw audrey was in the show and im familiar with her takes about it from maintenance phase and her more recent book. i was interested to know more. i watched all three episodes. the first two were interesting and informative, and the abuse that the contestants faced was awful. however, the show completely fails to criticize the construction of the (not allowed to type this word) \"epidemic\", and perpetuates panic by basically advertising ozempic and those statistics at the end: \"in 2004, when the biggest loser premiered, 32% of american adults were  (not allowed to type this word). by 2025, that number had climbed to 45%\". this is just the same old story over and over again. It was honestly really sad to hear Joelle agree with the theory of the show was \"phenomenal\",,, and that if they \"tweaked\" the theory it could help millions of people.... basically she also still thinks that being fat is bad and thinness is something we should all strive for. and Danny. saying that him and his wife \"need a change\" and that they arent getting any younger, implying that he still wants to lose weight. its just fucking sad that they still agree with the shows ideology at the end, even tho it literally harmed them and the ideas of the show just made people feel so much shame about their bodies. I really wish the show had given the conclusion time to aubrey and the main doctor guy, they actually had smart things to say. and aubrey is sooo good at explaining complex things to a large audience. aubrey is the thinker who introduced me to radical fat politics and ive consequently read so much on this topic from a critical perspective of the dominant narrative and its been so life changing and eye opening. this documentary was a missed opportunity to send a more radical message about accepting fat people, but again it is netflix so im not surprised that im disappointed.",

I recovered from an ED a while ago and it was a hard watch even for me so I thought I might as well help some others out Overall, I think she handled the interview really well and the way she discussed it was very accessible. Below is what she discussed that stuck with me. Please feel free to comment if there was something you think I missed. Regarding what the show was trying to capture: “Nothing in your life will be celebrated as much as being thin” Regarding a challenge in the show: “The goal is for you to make assumptions about the contestants character” “The goal is to make a good television show. The more of a spectacle, the better” “Being seen as a person and not just a body is much rarer than it should be for fat people” EDIT: Aubrey was only in the doc for about 3 short snippets so it’s not like you’re missing out if you do decide to skip this one :)",

The top scorers would be pushed hard with lots of sports and the low tier did dance and gentle gym. If you haven’t heard of the bleep test, you just run from one line to another within an allotted time denoted by a bleep. The levels increase, the time gets shorter, eventually the “less fit” people drop out when they don’t cross the line before the bleep. It sucks.",

This a*hole barely looked at her bloods, dismissed her oral medical history, looked at her body and told her she is being referred to the weight clinic because she's clearly \"eating herself into becoming a man\".

We work together and were making our usual Friday night plans (go lift, then get beer and pizza) when another coworker butted in to say “🙄 doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose?” I don’t engage with diet culture talk at work, so I tapped out of the convo right away. But he responded “Yes, if the whole purpose is to be restrictive and sad. People exercice more when you make it a fun time, find the joy in it”. The other coworker doesn’t let up. Talks about their pre-workout shake whatever whatever. But regardless, I am shocked that my gym buddy has soaked up my joyful movement propaganda. Makes me so happy man.",

She said it’s not something they discuss in school or what she sees on the television. So where the hell did she learn diet culture at 8 frigging years old???

The primary care doctor suggested it after this year’s annual wellness exam. She’s always been a bigger child and the doctor noted yesterday that she is about the same size as an average 10 year old. Fortunately, in her classroom, most of the girls are about her height. They mostly do not weigh as much. I’m a pretty conscious aware mom and also I have my own bias, like all of us raised in this fat phobic society, so I’m on a fast track to learn and put into practice loving ways of being with all bodies. What should I do or say headed into this appointment? It’s virtual and our child won’t be attending it. We have one book, Bodies Are Cool, which we could probably read more regularly. And I could get more from the library. It may sound weird, but I also have been seeking out other kiddos who are similarly sized for play dates.",

Doctors called me ugly (\"a woman can't look worse than this\"), lazy (\"you must not be moving much\"), gluttonous (\"i can see that you love to eat\"). And I have an urgent appointment coming soon. So I made a post in a fat positive (or so I thought) space, bc I don't have fat friends who would understand my fears and support me. Unexpectedly, ppl downvoted my post and comments and accused me of warping the doctors' words. Bc \"doctors would get fired if they treated patients like this\". And \"this never happened to me, so I don't believe you\" (???). I mentioned mental health problems and ppl said they were the reason I made up those insults. My experience is, fat patients get verbally abused by doctors all the time and the doctors rarely face consequences. It's surreal and disappointing when fellow fat people gaslight me about this.

Did you make some good progress in therapy? Feel free to share your feel-good stories to mark a strong start to the new week :). Feel free to also share news you've found on the internet that feels like a victory against fatphobia! Maybe your state just made discrimination against fat people illegal, or there's a fat activist activity going on in your area (e.g. Fat Beach Day in NY).

I'm sure the fries will taste good (I've had duck fat fries before and they are amazing), but the whole post and justification just makes me sad. They also noted that it \"may\" affect their vegetarian and vegan customers. Like, may? Excuse me? Why even keep veggie burgers on your menu if vegetarians can't eat any of your fries or onion rings?! Has anyone else had a beloved business jump on a MAHA bandwagon? If so, did you keep going? I don't go digging around for the beliefs and values of my local business owners (I often wonder how many local businesses I'd still want to support if I did) but when something like this is presented to me, it sort of makes me not want to go, even if the burgers are the best around. Any thoughts on how to balance the benefits of supporting local businesses with the ick of supporting owners on the same page as RFK?",

      "content_preview": "I’m a mom (in a bigger body) of a 9 year old boy in a bigger body. My son was of average weight until kindergarten, when he started gaining weight. His annual exam after kindergarten his pediatrician blamed me for his weight gain, citing the fact that I let him eat school lunch and drink whole milk. Inspired by Aubrey and Virginia Sole-Smith, I later wrote a letter to the doctor asking her not to talk about his weight in front of him. To my great relief, the doctor has been much better. This year she asked my kid about his movement and sleep habits, along with his favorite fruits and veg. Even though he is still in a bigger body, she praised him for his health-promoting habits and told him to keep it up. I was so worried she was going to suggest a diet. Phew! Just a note to all the parents of kids in bigger bodies—there is so much you can do to help them thrive. Celebrate health-promoting habits and make them fun, family-shared values. Always tell your kid their bodies are perfect the way they are. And most importantly, talk kindly about yourself and your body. Kids are listening!",

Thanks to u/martysgroovylady , we've decided to make a weekly thread specifically so that folks can share and discuss their wins and victories that they've had regarding fatphobia this past week. Did your doctor listen to you? Did you get someone new to listen to the podcast? Were you able to have a good conversation with a friend or acquaintance about fatphobia? Did you make some good progress in therapy? Feel free to share your feel-good stories to mark a strong start to the new week :). Feel free to also share news you've found on the internet that feels like a victory against fatphobia! Maybe your state just made discrimination against fat people illegal, or there's a fat activist activity going on in your area (e.g. Fat Beach Day in NY). Please remember: Do not vote or comment in cross-posted linked threads, keep the discussion here. Thanks all! Have a wonderful week.",
