      "content_preview": "Location: ArizonaApologies if this is the wrong flair.  I have temporary custody of my 13 year old niece. School started in July where we are and almost immediately upon starting my niece has had an issue with another girl bullying her.I’ve complained many many many times, I’ve met with the principal/counselor, I’ve sent emails, basically everything short of contacting the police because I figured it’d be for nothing if I don’t have anything but my nieces word against the girl’s. The school kept telling me they’ll look into it. I’ve tried getting a meeting set up with the girls parents a few times through the school but no luck.Thursday my niece came to me crying and showed me her ipad with a bunch of screenshots of nasty messages. She said she joined a friend on a game and there were a couple other kids from the school, including the girl bullying her. We rejoined the game to see if the girl was still there and she was. When we joined the bully turned her voice chat on and was saying horrible things to/about my niece. I took my phone out and recorded her for a bit and then turned my nieces voice chat on. All I said was that I’m (niece’s name) uncle, I know she’s been harassing my niece for weeks, that I had recorded proof and screenshots and to stop or I’ll report it to the police. She said “Ok” and left the game.The next day (yesterday) my niece stayed home from school and later I got a call from the school saying that the girls parents “expressed concerns about an interaction” between me and the girl want to set up a meeting. I agreed but asked for everything in writingShould I bring legal counsel to the meeting? Should I file a report before the meeting?THE COMMENT REPLY BUTTON IS MISSING ON NY APP, I’m just now seeing all of the new comments and want to say thank you to everyone who is helping me!!",

      "content_preview": "location: MAMy local school system uses a payment system for school lunches which is managed by a company called \"MySChooBucks\" (a division of Heartland Payments Systems). As parents, we don't have a choice to opt out and use cash: if my child wants to purchase food in the school cafeteria, she has to use this system.On July 14, 2025, I received an email that my child's account had a balance of NEGATIVE $8.50. (For the record, my child was an 8th grader.) This didn't make sense because my child brought her lunch every day to school. I know this, because I was the one who made those lunches.So I checked the purchase history. There were no purchases listed, but the purchase history only goes back 3 months. In my town, school ends in late June, which means she didn't purchase anything in the last 2 months prior to school getting out.Next, I posted to the town Facebook page (yes, I live in a small town) to ask if anyone else got a strange balance notice. To my surprise, multiple other parents received similar notices. One parent mentioned she got the notice even though her student didn't attend public school that year.Then I called up MySchollBucks support. The operator confirmed to me that I had a \"low balance\" notification setting at $10, which means when the balance drops below $10, I automatically receive an email. Since I had not received an email while school was still in session, it's a provable fact that the balance was greater than $10 when the school year ended.The result of the call was that the operator denied the money was taken out of my account and instead insisted that my child must have made purchases in the cafeteria. This is the exact samw response that other parents got when they reached out to MySchoolBucks support.For the record, the money was stolen from my child's account at the same time that Heartland Payment Systems agreed to pay $18.5 million to resolve a class action lawsuit (https://www.msbfeesettlement.com/). I'm tempted to start a new class action lawsuit, but I'm not sure who to contact or if this is even the next appropriate step.What should I do next?Edit:I forgot to mention that the reason a child had money in her account is because in 7th grade she used to eat in the cafeteria. In eighth grade, Massachusetts started handing out free lunches and the food became inedible.Edit 2:There are a lot of \"well maybe it was a mistake\" comments, but none of them are relevant. The balance did not decrease over time. At the end of the school year, there was more than $10 in the account (as otherwise I would have gotten a low balance notification by the last day of school). Instead, the account was suddenly emptied out overnight during the summer. This cannot be a mistake, a fat-finger issue, bad spreadsheet, incorrect data, stealing pin number, entering wrong student, etc. If that was the case, I would have gotten a low balance notification in June at the latest, and not the middle of July.",

For damages happening afterwards?What is the correct interpretation of that word? I am outside the 30 day period from my inspection and a landlord is trying to pocket my deposit.

It was a very fancy restaurant and we ordered tons of drinks and appetizers with our main meals. As you could image the date didn’t go that well but he was insistent on ordering these things I thought he was okay with paying for it all considering he asked me out. As soon as he realized this date wasn’t gonna turn into anything serious, he basically switched up on me tried to force me to pay at the table. I refused at first but he was causing a scene so I just said I’ll text him later to talk about it. He ended up paying for it all but is now harassing me to Venmo him asap or he’ll take me to court. I’m on the verge of blocking him.Does he have a case? I honestly don’t think I am in the wrong. I’m only 21 so I don’t know the law well. I didn’t choose the restaurant but date are normally implied that the man will pay. Do I need to pay him or can I just block him and move on?——— Update: I blocked him. Thanks everyone! 😉",

      "content_preview": "Location: Dalton, GaExactly one week ago today on the 28th of July, I made a phone call to OSHA regarding my boss. The claim I made was valid, per the OSHA investigator I had on the line and my boss got a phone call from OSHA that same day. My boss was on vacation that day and when he got back this weekend, he fired me yesterday on Sunday, making very vague claims about tasks I hadn't completed. I had in fact completed all of them because he gave me a very specific list. I even asked him for clarification about the tasks I hadn't completed and he read the message and didn't respond. I just want to know what I should do now? Thank you!EDIT- I just got off the phone with a regional whistle-blower complaint investigator and he determined that he isn't making the complaint due to the fact that I had made a few mistakes in my first 90 days of employment that my boss did quote me as some reasons as to why he did let me go (He did send me an updated text a few hours ago detailing specific reasons as to why he fired me, he was wrong about multiple ones but right about some and the \"right about some\" is where the issue is). So going that route is null and void. Look, at the end of the day I just want my previous boss held accountable for 2 (have been investigated and confirmed) or 3 (the third is under investigation right now) individual OSHA violations which I already have individual case numbers for. I am going to take accountability for the mistakes I made and why he fired me. However, he still took advantage of me and other employees in the past, I want him held accountable for that.",

At one point I asked if they were correct and they said “we double checked”. Five days later, they called saying they accidentally gave an extra $7500 discount and want me to re-sign with updated numbers. I told them I have no legal obligation to do so.  The contract clearly lists the amount as “discounts” with no line item specifically for rebate/gov incentive, etc.So, they stopped payment of my trade-in vehicle (which now puts me as past due on that loan).

      "content_preview": "Location: Michigan, USAI know I'm an idiot for not having her sign a contract, I was way too relaxed about the situation.I'm a licensed builder in MI, and I'm just starting my own business. A large hail storm came through the area and did damage to our entire town. My mother in-law made an insurance claim for her roof, siding, garage door, and some windows. I wasn't worried about getting paid for the work because I knew the insurance company approved the claim. She wasn't coming out of pocket for the money, so I took the roof job to get it done for her. She has not hired out the siding or garage door work yet.The roof job is done and I'm personally out of pocket about $13,800 (most of which is on my credit cards). I completed the job on july 6th, and its now into September. She comes up with excuses and gives the runaround everytime I talk to her about payement. I dont think im going to get paid and I don't know if I have any legal recourse available. I do have some text conversations saved, and I have receipts for the materials and dumpster fees. I paid cash for my laborers. I don't want to ruin a family relationship, but I don't foot the bill for a new roof. Please help, lol. Thanks for any advice.",

      "content_preview": "Location: FloridaThis is a multi- level issue and while I think it’s mostly real estate, it’s definitely also a divorce issue bc I’d like to know the likelihood of success in the divorce and which kind of atty to speak to first.Issue #1: I found out that my husband sold our jointly-owned home to an LLC that he owns. Upon viewing the sale, it is signed with docusign and notarized online by someone who certified that he did this on a video call with both of us and saw our drivers licenses. This never happened. He then got a new balloon mortgage with a company that is not a financial institution and signed an extremely predatory contract. It says things like if he ever gets sued (even for divorce) they can foreclose and own everything inside the house. He left me for another woman 5 years ago and doesn’t even live here, although he comes in and out as he pleases and still controls every aspect of my life. Our daughter just went to college and so I am no longer of use to him; I got the notice of foreclosure literally driving back from dropping her off. When he got the new mortgage he took out an add’l $150k and spent it all on himself.I’m not sure if this structured debt leveraging isn’t fraudulent because he’s been sued several times and it didn’t trigger foreclosure, it said it was due in full earlier this year but that didn’t happen and even that didn’t trigger foreclosure. He didn’t pay the property taxes in ‘24 or ‘25 and that didn’t trigger it. But suddenly as our daughter is leaving apparently he missed a month of payment and they’re foreclosing.Am I correct in assuming that when I hire a divorce atty we will press charges against him and it’ll halt the foreclosure, and I’ll get to keep my house without paying back the loan he took out? And that he will likely go to jail for not only the forgery and fraud on my end, but that of the illegal loan he took out?Issue #2: When he left me for another woman, he secretly bought the house they planned to buy together without her. He put it in a trust for our daughter. Through manipulation and abuse he convinced her it was just biz and that he’d add her. She said okay but she wouldn’t pay anything until then. He wasn’t willing to give up control of their home and instead hasn’t paid the mortgage in 4 years bc he can’t afford it alone. That house has been in foreclosure and he won’t sign a quit claim (??) or whatever and let her pay it off and save her home. When I file for divorce will I be able to claim that their house is marital property (since he has never stopped coming to my home and treating it as his own, controlling my life etc) and have the trust dissolved? Will it help to include the info that he defrauded his & his partner’s joint company to help purchase it? Unfortunately she can’t obtain records bc he didn’t have any, but he has admitted it to me.Issue #3: In case you can’t tell, he is extremely violently abusive in all ways except physically. He has never given me access to our money, and has opened several accounts and companies in my name without my knowledge. I can’t even access my  own credit report. He likes to keep women holed up and oppressed as accessories who only come to life when he walks in the room. Sometimes his current partner and I go hungry or without essentials because it isn’t convenient for him. She has obtained records of all the companies he’s had over the years so that his actual income can be analyzed, but it’s definitely in the millions. She’s also willing to testify to anything I need her to regarding his hoarding of all of our money and the neglect I’ve been subject to. Based on this would I be likely to receive both houses in my divorce?Please help two scared women who are about to be left homeless and penniless know where to begin to make our escape from an absolute monster. I’m very limited in what I can do for paid consults. TIA!",

      "content_preview": "Location: UKHi, I’m not entirely sure what to do so I’m hoping to get some advice In February of this year, I went for an emergency appointment at a dentist and told them I wanted my tooth out as part of it had cracked and it was very painful. I heard bad stories about root canals so I just wanted it gone and the pain to be over They proceeded to continue with this and injected the anaesthetic to proceed. The whole ordeal was very upsetting, they tried for so long and it took so long to even budge (they gave more anaesthetic after I said it was so painful and I could feel it) Eventually they said do I want to continue, I asked if it had moved and they said yes it’s now slightly raised, I was terrified of now stopping as this didn’t seem an option? The tooth was slightly pulled and once the anaesthetic wears off I’d be in even more pain! They carried on, I was crying and holding onto the chair and eventually they got it out. They told me sometimes fragments can remain (they were digging around for a while but the pain was insane), and they left it there. I felt so traumatised from this, I paid the £200* fee and left Months later it healed over but every now and then would throb, I finally was in so much pain this week, I went to a&e for painkillers and had an emergency dentist appointment. They did an x-ray and were shocked to see the entire root was still there and it’s infected. I had no idea that when they said “fragments” it meant the whole root After they said fragments, I researched they at times they can push themselves out so I thought maybe the pain was that occurring I now have been referred and need to go under general anaesthetic to remove the root, I’m taking antibiotics for the infection as it’s swollen and very painful The whole thing is so upsetting and angering, I’m shaken up when I visit the dentist now and have severe anxiety about the upcoming procedure and they’ve been paid to not do what I went in for and months down the line I’m worse offI wanted to know what people think I should do? Should I complain, sue? Or is it something I should have got looked into sooner when they mentioned fragments? Any advise or helpful words is appreciated",

      "content_preview": "So I was in labor for five days, was taken off a medication while progressing the last night. The next morning my doctor from three days ago came in and was visibly p/o and said I should’ve had a c-section when they found out my daughter was injecting meconium or when her heart beat was dropping he day before. Well I gave birth, was extremely traumatic, my mom works in a hospital and said towards the end the nurses and doctors started to panic and talk amongst themselves but wouldn’t tell us what was happening. My mom swears my daughter didn’t cry or breathe until 2:54 minutes after she came out. We have videos of doctors talking in the background and of her looking lifeless when she came out. My baby also had bruising and swelling all over her, specifically on her chest (where you would do cpr) and fingerprint bruises all over her sides and ribs. Was hooked up to oxygen all sorts of stuff.Two days later at the hospital a new dr. Came in and was looking at my chart and said “oh they had to do resuscitative measures” which they never told us before. They also told me my baby was rh+ meaning out blood types didn’t mix and they were going to send her out to a specialist for a blood transfusion we signed paper to send her off and last minute they decided not to and wouldn’t give us a reason other than “her test was better”. After finally leaving the hospital after over a week I had to return to the hospital bc I had a head ache. Turns out it postpartum preeclampsia, so I’m admitted with 210 blood pressure at risk of a stroke or seizure.A week later I’m at my post-op and my doctor tells me there’s absolutely nothing in my chart about my experiences there. Literally all it says is “Easy delivery with jaundice”. I honestly feel like the hospital is trying to cover for the many mistakes they made during my labor. I’ve requested other documents and they’ve given me nothing. Any advice will be helpful, I would kinda like to file for malpractice due to the swelling and bruising they won’t admit to, horrible pain and trauma I had to endure. Location: Georgia, USA",

      "content_preview": "Thanks for everyone who gave advice on the original post. After speaking with my son (15m) he was definitely embarrassed about the situation. I wanted to make sure he had the autonomy to decide whether he wanted to pursue this or not. The detective and I spoke in the morning yesterday and he said it was entirely up to us if we wanted to proceed, and that if he wasn’t comfortable talking about it, he would just close the case. My son decided he wanted to try to help catch the scammer in the hopes that it wouldn’t happen to someone else. Without going into too much detail, the messages were just heartbreaking for me to hear. The scammer preyed on my son, who is a typical 15 y/o with a lot of insecurities. The scammer terrified him, was giving him a countdown to buy the gift cards. I’m very proud of my son for reporting this. Under no circumstances was he ever going to face any legal action, they only ever saw him as a victim. I also found out this is the TENTH case of this in my small town alone. I implore all parents to talk to their children about sextortion. It is happening all over and there is nothing for them to be ashamed about. Adult predators know what to say and do to trap these children. The detective did say that it’s almost always impossible to prosecute these cases, but he will never stop trying. So, thanks again for all the legal advice, I was glad we had an attorney to protect our sons best interests. He is being supported by his counselor at school as he did not want anyone additional to know what happened.",

As the baby got older i noticed that it didn’t look like my other kids again i chalked it up to it looking like my wife.I caught her cheating and we got back together for a couple months and then got kicked out of the house again. This time i had a strong feeling that the baby isn’t mine, the baby has no features that its siblings have. I got an at home test and the probability of paternity was 0%. My question is, has it been too long to remove my name from the birth certificate and have no responsibility for this child? Is there anything i can do since i didn’t know it wasn’t my child and i was lied to? She had told me that there was no way the child couldn’t be anyone else’s I’m pretty sure so that i wouldn’t get a paternity test. Please help. Location: California",

Specially in very busy cities like Rome or Paris, making the effort to be up before dawn and walking around will help you experience a very different vibe of the city, not to mention amazing pictures you can take without the crowds and with nice, golden hour lighting. In a lot of Europe, it doesn’t get light so early, so it might not even be too much of a sacrifice to do.Stupid and Cheerful. I think I read it here sometime ago, but I’ve tested and it’s true. Cheerful always works better than aggressive when having to deal with an inconvenience, and playing a bit dumb turist might get you out of some light trouble.While a lot of people know that it’s a smart idea to always check out a hotel’s or appartments official site instead of booking on a travel platform, a lot of people don’t know there is a free tool you can use that helps you find the right place and even compares the price for you. It’s called Directo extension and it’s free to use.What are yours?",

      "content_preview": "Location: ColoradoI work in a high-end nursing home and am really struggling with what I can only describe as a moral crisis. One of my female patients on the skilled nursing unit (most intense level of care) has advanced dementia and is borderline non-verbal. Her husband, who lives in assisted living (much less intense) has been raping her. We can hear her screams, see the bruises from where he holds her down, and have to clean her up after he leaves her naked and in the dark. The facility has involved social workers, nursing staff, and the CEO to no avail. Her own children don't give a damn and just want their parents to have \"alone time.\" Adult Protective Services have esentially washed their hands of the matter on the grounds that while she can't consent, she also isn't not consenting (again, even forming sentences is hard for her). I am at the end of my rope here. It makes me physically sick when I think about it. What the hell can we do?Edit: I included the fact that this is a high-end facility because I'm not unconvinced the fact that this guy is a millionaire isn't a factor here. Also, you better believe I am interrupting that shizz every chance I can, but I only work a few days a week.",

      "content_preview": "Location: New Bedford, Massachusets. My grandmother's brother died in 2018. My grandmother is on the other side of the country, but his children all live in Massachusets. After his passing, his daughter, who was his caregiver, needed financial help with cremation costs. My grandmother sent her $500 towards the cost of the cremation, which was $1700. After a couple weeks, my grandmother hadn't heard much and asked if they had received his ashes yet. One of his daughters said that her sister, who my grandmother had sent the money to, had not paid the funeral home and had not received the ashes. My grandmother was upset and called her. She claimed that she was making payments towards the cost. My grandmother decided to call the funeral home and find out for herself if this was true or not. The funeral home confirmed that no payments had been made. This upset my grandmother and she argued with his daughter about it. They stopped speaking, but my grandmother has kept in touch with one of his daughters, and she has confirmed that his ashes were never picked up and are still at the funeral home. My grandmother wants his ashes, but the funeral home says they cannot release his ashes to anyone but the daughter who was his caregiver, because everything is in her name. They apparently took her to court, but were still never paid. Not even his other children are allowed to pick him up, apparently. Is this really the law? Is there nothing my grandmother can do? Please help me figure out what steps we need to take to get his ashes home.",

      "content_preview": "Location: Chandigarh, IndiaHello everyone, I am a 19-year-old student and freelance designer from Chandigarh, and I'm hoping to get some guidance on a deeply frustrating situation with Fiverr. They cancelled a $500 order and their final justification for doing so is a demonstrable lie. The entire process has been incredibly stressful, and after weeks of fighting, I feel completely stonewalled.Summary of Facts: I was working on a project. The buyer requested a cancellation, which I declined as work was proceeding correctly. (You are allowed to do so, and the buyer cannot cancel one sidedly. It's in the TOS. As long as you're delivering what you promised, you should be fine, according to the rules).The next morning, I discovered Fiverr's Customer Support (CS) had unilaterally cancelled the order overnight, without contacting me, asking for my side of the story, or requesting any of my evidence. Customer support is supposed to verify the buyer's claims and cancel only if they're true, but this agent never cared to even look.Only after the cancellation was forced on me, I opened a support ticket and provided a mountain of evidence (dated renders, detailed screenshots) proving my work was fully compliant with all of the buyer's requirements.For weeks, I was given the runaround. I was passed between multiple CS agents who would ignore my proof and close my tickets without resolution, forcing me to create follow-ups and start the exhausting process all over again. All I got was \"we've reviewed\" and \"we've looked\" but never any fact based talk. No TOS violation, no policies violated either. They had nothing against me.It's also crucial to note that their reasoning was never consistent. Throughout the weeks of back-and-forth, their justification for the cancellation kept changing. At first, it was vague statements about the \"buyer's vision.\" Then, it was the illogical loop of blaming me for a \"non-delivery\" that their own cancellation caused. It was only after I refuted these flimsy excuses that they finally invented the specific, provable lie about \"empty deliveries\" in their final communication.Fiverr's final, official reason for upholding the cancellation was a blatant fabrication. They claimed in writing that I had made \"multiple empty deliveries.\"I have a screenshot of their own platform that explicitly shows no deliveries being made because their initial cancellation made it impossible to deliver. This directly proves their justification is a lie.When I confronted a supervisor with this proof of their lie, he refused to address it and permanently closed my final ticket, ending all communication from their side. It happened before as well, just shutting the ticket in my face without valid reason. That's why I have so many follow up tickets. It's done to make the person just give up and accept it. It's straight to harassment. You feel like you're BEGGING for even talking to CS.Screenshot of the final ticket being closed. I understand my words might look harsh but it was after almost 3 weeks of back and forth with these senseless replies. Never ONCE addressing everything I mention. From concrete proof to their own TOS showing their actions were invalid.The Personal Impact: Beyond the significant financial loss for a student, the process itself has felt like deliberate harassment. Dealing with weeks of nonsensical, braindead replies, having tickets shut in my face, and ultimately being lied to by a platform I paid a 20% commission to for security has been incredibly demoralizing. It feels like they knew they made a mistake in the beginning and chose to cover it up, believing a student in India couldn't or wouldn't fight back. It has been a truly draining and disillusioning experience.I feel powerless, but I have the law on my side. They're violating their own TOS listed on the 'legal' section of their website. I'd be happy to provide the exact clauses if needed.As an Indian, what options do I have to proceed with this?The core of their final decision is a provable lie. How much does this strengthen my case?Also please feel free to share any additional knowledge you can. Always happy to listen.I really need help understanding my recourse here. Thank you so much for any advice you can offer",

My job is to sit in my car one hour to watch the employee entrance, then do a foot patrol around the perimeter the next hour. This is an unarmed position, and the company I work for makes it clear we are not to have any weapons on us on site.Being a 5’3” woman, for obvious reasons, I keep some pepper spray in my car. This is also not allowed per my company’s policy, but after dealing with the things I’ve dealt with, my personal safety matters more to me than that. I’ve never taken it out of my car or used it to intimidate anyone, and until a week ago, it was never an issue.Last week, I left my car to do one of my usual patrols and forgot to lock my car. It takes me about 25-30 minutes to walk the perimeter and check the gates and doors. When I got back to my car, our on-site police officer was waiting for me by my car and told me he seized the pepper spray I kept in my center console. He lectured me about how I should know better than to have a weapon on site, and he would be contacting my manager to report it.I told him he didn’t have permission to enter or search my car, and he told me he didn’t need a warrant or permission when I am on company property. My manager told me having the pepper spray on site is a fireable offense, and I more than likely will lose my job after her and HR has a meeting about it. What should I do?",

Overall, scummy all around— we didn’t think it was worth fighting.The room my mother is renting is fully furnished, just because that was required for hosting exchange students.This is the first time my mother has dealt with tenants that just seem to be irresponsible and messy.. They constantly do not clean up after themselves, they leave the bathroom a complete mess, and there’s a severe odor permeating from their room into the hallway. It had gotten so bad at one point I could smell it strongly from my room.The bedroom they rent has a window facing the backyard— while my mother did not step inside their room, as she doesn’t want to be intrusive on their personal space— she did get a glimpse inside from the window and noticed one of the mattresses was completely DESTROYED.I’m not sure what even happened, but it seems like there was a huge spill and they attempted to just pour copious amounts of baking soda piles to save it. Like there’s genuinely baking soda mounds covering the entire mattress. From the gigantic stain and the powder, my mother assumes the mattress is good as destroyed at this point. The weirder thing is, there were waterproof covers on these mattresses, and it seems like they purposely removed them too.I told my mom she should consider sending a 30-day notice as we have given them multiple warnings about cleanliness in shared spaces. Their bedroom isn’t a shared space, so this wouldn’t directly apply. They’re on a month to month lease, so I assume my mom would be able to do this. However, she has a fear that they may get defensive if we give them a notice, as they have been somewhat hostile about communicating in general. We’re kind of on the fence on what to do…",

      "content_preview": "Location: Washington state.A little backstory: I bought my house in 2018. It sits on a corner lot, and there’s an alley way running along the right side of my property. My house faces south, so the alley way is not behind my house like in most cases. I technically don’t have a back yard - just a front yard and two side yards. I’m not sure if that’s important.The street to the right of me, the houses all face east, so the alley way is behind all of their lots. I have a neighbor in one of those houses, we’ll call him Eric.Outside of my fence along the alley way there is about a 5 ft strip of land. I’m not sure if it’s my property or the city’s property. Either way, it’s definitely not Eric’s property. I know sometimes there are little easements that are technically city property, but the homeowner closest to it has to maintain it. That would be me in this case. Regardless, once again, it’s 100% NOT Eric’s property.When I first bought the house, I started to notice that someone had been over there clearing the area, but I worked away from home a lot and would never see who was doing it. This strip of land had a row of blackberry bushes which I kind of liked. It was never unruly or overgrown, the alleyway road itself was always clear. But I would come home and find piles of brush/yard debris waiting for me to clean up. I know some people would say “just be grateful someone is doing the work for you” but I was never comfortable with it. (Probably because I lived alone and I am a 4’11 female. I was 27 when I bought the house, and I am 34 now. Eric is in his 60s, about 6’2) Plus, I can handle my own yard work and I enjoy doing it.Long story short, another neighbor told me that they saw Eric over by my house doing work and that’s how I found out it was him. I work from home now, so I am able to actually see when he comes over and catch him in the act. Every time he is up against my fence working, I tell him to stop. He gets argumentative, but usually walks away. All in all it’s probably been about 10 separate times I have asked him to leave.There was one instance where I caught him not even working but just straight up creeping, with his face and hands pressed up against my fence peering through the slats, looking into my yard. I confronted him, and he said “I just wanted to see what the dogs were barking about, but I see you’re getting a new washer and dryer, that’s great!” (I was getting a new washer and dryer delivered).There was another time last summer where my next door neighbor (single female who also lives alone) caught him doing the same thing to her. She was watering her plants and since his face was pressed up against her fence, she accidentally got him wet, and out of no where she heard some very surprised sounds.That brings me to today. I had a little tree growing on that strip of land, it was about 15 feet tall. I didn’t plant it, but I loved that it was there and I was having a lot of fun watching it grow. I even trimmed some of the branches to make sure it didn’t overhang into the alleyway. Well Eric and his wife were out there this morning cutting it down. I confronted them, told them to stop multiple times, and they refused. They told me to call the police if I had an issue, so I did.Eric was conveniently gone when the police arrived. But they determined that the tree was mine and that they had no reason to cut it down. His wife tried to argue that since they run the neighborhood association that they can do yard work wherever they like. I told the cop no, that’s not how that works. There is no HOA here. A neighborhood association just has meetings for community events and it’s all volunteer-based, and I am not a part of any association.I took video of me confronting them, and another video of Eric alone finishing off the poor tree. Both videos were given to police. The police urged me to file an anti harassment order against them, so I did. Since our houses are so close to each other’s, I requested that they stay 20 feet away from my property at all times. I think his house is roughly 40-50 feet from mine.Since I didn’t purchase the tree I didn’t want to go through small claims. I really just want them to stay away from my fence line. They don’t even live on the same side of the street as me, they have NO reason to be over by my house, especially after being repeatedly told to stop coming over here. For what it’s worth, I know they never did this with the previous family who lived in my house. I don’t know if they see a tiny female and think “oh she can’t do anything to stop us” or what, but it’s driving me mad.My question is, do you think I actually have a case here? I filed an anti harassment order on both of them, and submitted my video evidence. I bought another security camera to keep tabs on the alleyway/my fence line, but it’s going to be a while before I can hook it up. I just don’t understand why he insists on being right up against my fence all the time but I need it to stop. He claims it’s public property, but like I said even if that’s the case it’s my job to maintain it, not his.",

      "content_preview": "My ex girlfriend took our dog and won't let me see him. When we originally got him we both went 50/50 cash and there's no adoption paperwork.But since then, I have (or had until she took him) been his primary provider. His medical records and insurance are in my name. His medical expenses have been paid for in majority by me. His insurance was paid for entirely by me. My phone number is on his tags.His necessities like his kennel, leash, harness, dental/hygiene equipment, toys, treats, training equipment, puppy proofing supplies, have all been paid for by me and I have receipts for all of it.I also have receipts for hundreds of dollars of food that I've purchased for him which I know would total up to much more than she has spent on him.Regarding things that I /don't/ have hard evidence for - I named him, trained him, and bonded with him more than anybody in the household that we were living in before we separated.So the question is, I'm planning to file a replevin to get him back but how strong are my chances? I miss him so much and I can't live without him. I love him more than anything I've ever loved and I can't just give up on him without trying to win him back.Location: Oregon.",

      "content_preview": "My car was stolen in March 2025. I filed a police report right away. A while later, the car was found more than 600 miles away from me. I live in SF and the car was found in San Diego. The tow yard that picked it up never notified me no call, no letter, nothing. I only found out because the police called me.When I contacted the tow yard, I asked if they could send me photos before I decided whether to pick it up, since the car is only worth about $3k. They were rude and flat-out told me they weren’t going to send me anything, and that if I wanted to see the car, I had to go there in person. Even the police officer who called me tried to get them to send photos they said they would, but they never did.Now the tow yard is suing me in small claims court for $12,000 in towing and storage fees. The car itself is worth maybe $3k at best. It feels completely unreasonable and abusive.Has anyone been through this before? Since the tow yard never gave me proper notice, do I have a legal defense? What steps can I take to avoid paying the full $12k? Should I fight this myself in small claims, or do I need to bring in a lawyer? Location: Bay area.Edit: I only had liability insurance since it’s a salvage car and just a beater I barely used. It’s a 2012 Honda Civic, nothing fancy or luxury. Also, I was notified by the court someone actually came to my house and served me the papers.Thanks a lot for your help, fellas. I’m trying to read through all of your advice.",

I have already filed a probate case to get the letters of administration to take care of the house.  His brother was still POD on his banking accounts from years before we met, so its not part of the estate as it's a POD/beneficiary.  My spouse also has lockbox at the bank couldn't be a POD.  So the lockbox will be part of my probate/letters of administration.  While we didn't talk about the money in the checking or savings, I didn't expect my BIL to keep all the money (approx 125k), and I need to have a conversation with him about it.  While I was not planning on keeping the contents of the lockbox, as its mostly his family jewelry and gold, i feel like whatever of value should remain with me.  I feel like my BIL will say the money belongs to him as my spouse didn't not update the paperwork.  To which I would reply that my spouse never added him as a beneficiary.  I know we should have done more estate planning, but but really had started some basic planning.  But having an aneurysm at 50 was not the cards we saw coming in our life.  I have been closer to my in laws/nephews since his passing.  But I  feel like I risk alienating my nephews (my spouse's only niblings) from me.  Am I in the wrong for thinking it belongs to me?

For the past 4-5 years every time she brought up death and a will she always said to me and everyone else that I’ll get everything. She passed away September 1st and I’ve seen the will and she only left me 2 cars which I do not care about getting anything, I just wanted the house to stay in the family in case someone needed somewhere to turn to in times of need and it was my grandfather’s house. Me and her talked several times a week for the past 6-7 years and told each other everything since I moved out of state. She does have a history of pill abuse and has been on some several prescription drugs like gabapentin for many years and I’m afraid her mental state wasn’t right and haven’t been right for the past 4 years as she has constantly forgotten my birthday and asks the same questions multiple times in one phone call and never remembers things along with other things. I believe her to have the mental capacity of a middle schooler because of her speech and word choice for the past 4 years which she didn’t use to be like before then and has always stumbles and seemed to be drowsy every time we talked the past 4 years and worried that she was manipulated by these people and taken advantage of. Her partner who has taken care of her for the past 11 years was left out of the will even though he has been the one to pay her bills and cook and clean for her and everything literally everything. I’ve only heard about this neighbor from her maybe 3 times since I’ve moved away and she’s only known them for a year or two or less. Do I have any options?",

      "content_preview": "Location: ArizonaHello, I'm uncertain whether or not I'm posting in the correct forum and if I am in the wrong place, please direct me to the correct one.Last month, the manager of my complex came banging on my door before 9 a.m. giving me a verbal 24-hour notice to \"get rid of the cats\". That was all that was said before they stormed off and left the property. I was left very confused; what cats? After a couple of hours had passed, I was finally able to reach the manager on the phone to ask for more information. The notice was regarding a few of the stray cats that live and roam within the community. According to the manager, since she happened to pass by my patio and saw a couple of the cats resting there, she concluded that they are mine and it is my responsibility to remove them from the premises. Since then, about two weeks ago now, I have not heard a word from management.Now here's my problem with this; they are not my cats. I did not bring them to the community, I am not feeding them, and I've been working for MONTHS with several shelters/societies, rescues, and fosters trying to find aid for the various strays in the area. I've counted twenty! I'm also on multiple wait-lists for TNR services (my area is overwhelmed with strays and resources are spread impossibly thin). Absolutely no one is able and or willing to step in. I was informed that where I live, strays are considered free-roaming and they are pretty much to be left alone unless sick and a health threat. I compiled a letter to management explaining all of this in depth, with proof that I've been trying to help the community and the cats alike, and that to an extent, it is out of my hands. I cannot bring the cats in and foster them out because I've already been warned that I will be served a notice to vacate due to excess pets if I were to go that route. As stated earlier in this post, I have not heard a peep in response. I have been anxiously waiting for the conclusion to this problem.Onto the next issue, I was confronted today by a newer neighbor whom I had never met before this encounter. They came to my door very upset, informing me that they had been served a 10-day notice to vacate the unit following complaints about their dogs' excessive barking. They shared that earlier that morning, the manager of the property had come to their door, filming them and their dog barking, and berated them for disturbing the peace of the community. Their reasoning for being at my door to tell me all of this? According to my neighbor, management informed them that my roommates and I were the ones who filed the complaint/s. This is not remotely true. I have not filed a single complaint or reported any wrongdoing regarding any tenant in my two years of living in this complex. The neighbor also went on to tell me that other tenants have begun facing harassment and false claims regarding complaints from neighbors and have been served.I'm deeply concerned that an individual belonging to management allegedly lied and named my unit as the one who filed the report/complaint. I'm fortunate that the confrontation did not escalate and we were able to converse civilly. I feel this could have been a very bad situation all around and that my safety was potentially compromised. All of this on top of the issue regarding the stray cats (that are not mine!) has created a very uncomfortable living environment and mental duress. What can I do, if anything, to address this matter and protect myself, my roommates, and ensure we do not end up evicted? Any and all feedback/advice would be very appreciated.Thank you if you've read this far.",

      "content_preview": "Location: CaliforniaMy son (17) was caught shoplifting at a Target yesterday. From what he told me when he got home, he went in to the store to buy a new Xbox controller, but rather than pay for it he snuck it into his backpack in one of the aisles and tried to walk out. A security guard stopped him before he walked past the registers and told him to take the controller out of his backpack, then told him to never return to the store and let him go. He says they did not take his ID or photo or take him into the office.What could I be looking at here in terms of criminal charges? I know they let him go, but would this just be a warning or could they call the police on him later? I have read that Target has a pretty intensive forensic team that will let people get away with stealing until they hit a felony threshold, then call the police and hit them with charges. They have no identifying information on him, but he did drive to and from the store in my car which he was borrowing, so it’s possible they could use the parking lot cameras to follow him to the car and record the license plate, which would lead them back to me and of course my son.I’m punishing him pretty well for this one to make sure he doesn’t do something stupid like this again (goodbye Xbox, laptop, and car privileges to start), but I don’t want him to face any legal consequences. If that’s the way it goes down then I’ve told him he will comply with law enforcement fully, but I truly don’t want him to have a criminal record because of a dumb decision. Is this warning the end of the road or will there be possible consequences in the future, and what could they be?",

      "content_preview": "Location: Buda, TXMy dad lives in Texas with his girlfriend and is currently dying in hospice. This woman is truly horrible. It's not just a case of \"we don't like her\". She has done terrible things to all of us over the years. Most recently she had been forcing all measures to keep him alive at home (restraining him, forcing tube feeding, etc) because she A, wanted him to write a will with her as sole beneficiary, (he hasn't been able to because he's too ill to hold a pen) and B, wanted to keep getting paid to be his caretaker. These are not my assumptions, she told me these things. I remained neutral as much as possible because I am the only family member she will still talk to and I don't want us to have no information.Once she figured out that there would be no more money for him she resigned her medical POA and has very little interest in what's happening with his illness.She has never worked or contributed to the bills, but I know for a fact that she just emptied his savings account of 60K (she has financial POA) and yet she is making the family pay for his hospice care and funeral and claiming she has nothing.My dad owns a house. She is dying to get her hands on that house. By Texas law, from what I understand, she is NOT his common law wife as Texas has different requirements than just living together. She has for years been referring to him as her \"ex that she gets paid to take care of\". She is now trying to establish herself as his common law wife to everyone who is helping with his end of life affairs.She has been trying to figure out a way to get his house for YEARS. It's not in her name and they've never been married. None of us want the house nor really care about the money, we doubt it's much, but we don't want her to get either. My dad did a lot of financial planning but never made a will leaving the house to her like she wanted. He wasn't an idiot when it came to finances so we feel certain that he did this on purpose.We understand this will be a fight but we have a few questions.1, What happens after he dies when she is still in the house but her name isn't on it?2, Should we speak to a lawyer now or wait until he dies?3, The one thing we're not willing to do here is lose money. Even if we each end up $1 ahead that's fine, but we don't want to pour in thousands for an estate that might not really be worth much. Will there be a way for us to find out if this is worth doing before we spend a lot?We are in other states, he is in Texas.",

      "content_preview": "Location: North CarolinaHello again! I wanted to provide an update on my 17-year-old niece “Jenny,” who ran away with a 22-year-old man last month. I received a lot of helpful feedback from everyone here, and I’m very grateful for the advice.With the input I got, I decided not to escalate things without Jenny’s agreement. My priority was to avoid pushing her further away from me and closer to the man grooming her. However, some things were non-negotiable: therapy, a pregnancy test at a doctor’s office, birth control, and STD screening (she had developed a UTI, and I wanted to make sure it wasn’t related to something more serious). She agreed to all of these.Her phone and Wi-Fi access were restored when school started, with the condition that she share her location with me. I told her I couldn’t control who she spoke to, but if she continued dating this man, she would need to do so under certain rules — including that I meet him. If they couldn’t follow those rules, she could still talk to him, but not see him in person until she turned 18. She agreed; he did not.Jenny is now in regular therapy and has been prescribed medication for anxiety and depression. We are awaiting further screening for additional mental health concerns. She is not pregnant, and we are waiting on STD screening results. Her doctor and therapist have reinforced the importance of condoms for protection against STDs.This past weekend, she officially ended things with the 22-year-old. She admitted that he has been volatile and controlling, and that she feels scared and unsafe around him. He did not handle the breakup well — he has since sent her multiple lengthy, threatening texts. In at least one of these, he stated that he would “choke her out” the next time he saw her.He has also shown up at my home several times under the pretext of “returning her things.” He has been warned not to return. Jenny has blocked him on all platforms. She asked me this morning to assist her in seeking a restraining order. Tomorrow, we will be visiting a local women’s shelter to connect with resources for this process (everything was closed today for the holiday). Given his repeated contact, explicit threats, and criminal history of domestic violence, I am hopeful that the order will be granted.Her workplace has also been informed and has a safety plan in place in case he tries to approach her there.This has been very frightening, but I am relieved that Jenny was able to see his true colors before turning 18, while she still has more legal protections and family support.Thank you again to everyone who offered advice.",

I contacted the man to let him know I now owned the land and to not plant again because we don't know when we were going to build. He had also removed our stakes and flags that were put up when we had the land surveyed. We went back to the land this summer and see he has yet again planted. I am irritated because we were not compensated for the previous year and he proceeded to plant rough feed corn this year without consent. This corn is very rough after cutting and makes the terrain hard to walk through so I am beyond pissed. What can I do? He has not yet harvested this season, but I know he will when it is time.

      "content_preview": "Throw away for obvious reasons. I male 30 am being falsely accused of rape by my sister female 25. I am located in Oregon but my sister is in another state. There is a lot of context so bare with me.We grew up in a messed up home, my mom did drugs and my dad was always working. He also had a period of time when he drank a lot. We were mostly neglected but I didn't mind all the time because I mostly got left alone to do what I wanted. I never really liked my sister because she never got punished. She got all of the positive attention from my parents. She was never forced to do any chores just me. I always got all of the yelling and hitting from my parents. My sister never got hit and only occasionally got yelled at by my mom.I was accused of sexual assault by my sister and her friend when we were kids. Around age 10-12 both CPS and cops were involved. They separated us while they were investigating but the case was quickly dropped because their stories didn't match up. I later learned that the friend made up the story because she got caught with cigarettes and got my sister to go along with her. I was really traumatized by the whole thing because I saw how everyone treated me like a villain. And no my sister never even got talked to about how wrong it was that she lied about that.Now as an adult my sister is for lack of better words, a terrible person. She is traumatized in her own way. For example my mom started bringing her to parties in her preteen/teens. She lost her virginity in one of those parties to one of my moms friends. I don't really know what happened just that my parents got into a huge fight about it. They did eventually divorce but it was more about my mom cheating and doing drugs. The point being that we never really got along I mostly avoided her. I kind of hated her but I also felt sorry for her.At this point in my life I'm no contact with my younger sister because of so many reasons. I have some older siblings that my mom had with other men. I only talk to my older sister because she is a well adjusted adult. Talking to her recently she brought up how my younger sister cut contact with me. I thought that was weird because I was the one to cut contact with her. The finally straw was because she said some messed up stuff about my wife. My older sister sent me the screenshot of the conversation. My younger sister was saying how I raped her when we were kids and how she cut me off because she never forgave me.This is a complete lie. At first I thought she was talking about the old accusations from her and her friend. But this is a completely new story that she's saying happened. I also later found out that she told my dad something similar and she's outright claiming that I raped her. Now I'm really angry, frustrated and worried. Her and my older sister don't really get along. The fact that she told her such a serious lie so easily has me worried who else she said this to.I know my younger sister and she is also known for compulsively lying. My older sister knows this and even after telling her my side she was very neutral. I'm worried for the life I've built to get messed up by this lie. I'm a guy and I'm older than her. She is also a very messed up adult so I know most people would probably believe her. I'm just kind of freaking out about what to do and what not to do.My wife has suggested we talk to a lawyer and maybe file a defamation suit against her. I don't want to make things worse, when she is called out for a mistake or a lie she tends to double down. I just want her to leave me the f alone and I never want to see her or know anything about her even more than before. I'm here to see if anyone has any legal advice or just some advice would be appreciated.Location: Oregon CaliforniaEdit: For some context, all of this took place in California. Someone mentioned something about proving she's a liar and unstable. She has had numerous run-ins, with the law both cops and CPS as an adult. She has gotten into serious legal trouble, so there is that. I did delete some stuff because, in retrospect, I think I included too much personal info. I will most likely contact a lawyer and see if there's anything that we can do.",

      "content_preview": "Location: Ohio. They lived in the house since 1953. The owner, being 97, had a lot of accessibility needs. On the contract, they were staying 12 days beyond close at a daily rate, which they paid through closing costs, to give them ample time to set up her new home and safely move her from her previous. When I did my final walkthrough, they were still living in the home, and her daughter ensured me it'd be clean.  They ended up moving out a week early by leaving a key in a lockbox.The basement was floor to ceiling with old, moldy boxes and rotten junk. Food in the fridge and shampoo in the shower. Pictures were left on the walls. Broken furniture left behind like end tables or cracked glass patio tables which needed bulk removal. This is my first home.I have the number of the owner's daughter from the initial closing \"just in case they get any mail or packages\" to text her. I texted her requesting she either come back since they moved out early and finish cleaning the home to \"broom clean\", or compensate me for the labor to get it in line with the contract. She told me to pound sand, and she didn't owe us anything because it was kind of her to leave early. She hasn't responded to me since.Friends and I took snow shovels, rented a dumpster, hired cleaners for the essentials once it was completely empty (mopping, dusting, counters, mildew removal from the showers and fridge). It took about 30 hours. I ran these numbers among three separate local quotes for cleaning/junk removal and the ledger works out to about $2000.I want to take this to small claims court for my time, but I have concerns. The 97 year old's name is on the contract, not her daughter's. This was not the 97 year old's fault and I would feel awful going after her. Everything online says POA does not affect small claims court and I cannot realistically afford a lawyer for a $2000 case. Even if I wanted to take her daughter to small claims, I don't have anyone's address since she isn't replying to me. My realtor is beyond useless and is not replying to me - she was incredibly hard to reach even when buying a house.Can I even take the daughter to small claims since it's not her name on the contract? It was her responsibility to fulfill it as POA. Also, what do you do when the other party is not receptive to providing the needed information? Who else can I go through, such as maybe their realtor? This is my first house and I know I probably even worded something in here wrong through lack of experience and knowledge. This just isn't right!!",

      "content_preview": "Location: California and Washington I broke up with my BF (both in our 40’s, me single, him in the midst of a divorce) in March. We live in a small town so I’m surprised I haven’t run into him at all since then. I know he immediately had a new GF as she and I have a mutual friend.Last year, I brought him to an important event to me where he met several of my close friends. The event spans a weekend. He hated every minute of it, got drunk and very high on many substances, and threatened violence. Afterwards, he told me he would never go back, and if I wanted to go back he would be done with me.That weekend came around again, and we haven’t seen or spoken to each other since our breakup. On the first day, I ran into him. He was staying mere feet away from me and my friends. He then ran into us or made his presence known more than once a day the whole time. This event is huge, more people there than in our town.So my question: should I consider legal action for stalking? My friends and I were scared by his close presence given the prior year. I’m now scared that I haven’t “seen” him in town because he’s been behind me in the shadows. My friends think I should file a police report. I don’t want to ruffle feathers unnecessarily. Thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "Location: Marion County, INMy fiancé and I just moved out of an apartment whose management has given us hell for the last few months.Yesterday, I got hit with a $926 “final account” bill for damages I owe on top of my entire deposit, which they're retaining.For reference, we arrived to pick up the keys to this place last July and couldn't even move our stuff in because they hadn't cleaned it or repainted it, and the unit was missing a front door. I was pretty reasonable about this and only asked for abatement of rent for the few days we couldn't move in. When we got there a week or so later, it wasn't in much better condition.I’ve got photos of wall paint and spray paint on the carpet, torn carpet, a busted landlord special lock plate on the door, broken drywall around the bathtub, among other things dated around when we moved in.I believe I documented most of this stuff on the move-in check sheet, but we didn't expect to need to write down every cosmetic defect we saw. I also filmed a walkthrough before I left (originally to show where my property was missing from, I'm getting there) soI’m pretty confident most of these charges are bullshit.They want to charge me for drywall repair by the tub, the lock plate, a \"drywall hole\" (see next paragraph for why this is weird), and a bunch of carpet-related stuff. Specifically, they want $125 in carpet cleaning money even though the lease never required it and I shampooed it myself, and they're charging >$500 for carpet replacement and sealing. They also listed cabinet damage under a sink, which I never noticed or caused to my knowledge. I don’t have photos of that one from move-in, but I doubt they do either.Now, for the theft:In May, a bullet fired from (supposedly) the yard of the property went through a few walls in my unit, and I have a police report for that. The complex management didn't do anything tangible, just said there might be an increase in police monitoring on the grounds. The police didn't investigate much at all either, since the complex doesn't have cameras facing the part of the yard it came from. I told management about it right away, but had them hold off on drywall repair initially incase the police decided to look at it again.Pretty soon after, we decided to move for our safety,so I chose to put in a maintenance request after we were finished moving our essentials into a new apartment so we could stop living at the this one(I don't like having maintenance there when I'm not home but my pets are). They entered the unit, but instead of fixing anything, they threw out a big metal plant stand with a pretty expensive grow-light setup that I hadn’t moved yet. It took over a month of pestering them to investigate the obvious, but they finally admitted in writing that they threw it out, claiming it was an honest mistake and they thought I had abandoned it (still had two weeks on the lease).They first offered to ship me a $77 replacement, which I refused. Now they’d like to either ship me a replacement or credit $170 (the actual value of the item). Given the bill I received yesterday, I'm not responding to this right now.I already asked them to send me their proof of damages so I can compare the defects theyre claiming with my photos of the unit at move-in. They said they’d send everything within 48 hours, and it's been 24, so no harm no foul there.I got a phone appointment with a landlord/tenant attorney through a local legal aid service, but it's not for 8 days and I'm not sure if I have a case here or what to do in the meantime.Sorry for the long-winded post, but I wanted to give context because this is all very new to me. I'm a medical student on a very tight, fixed, student loan-funded living allowance and I can't really afford to pay bullshit damages or lawyer fees, so I'm looking for some clarity wherever I can find it.",

      "content_preview": "Location: NebraskaThe situation is pretty much what I put in the title, but I can add more context. My boyfriend (23M) was driving home late at night from work, and a dog bolted out into the road. He was sadly not able to stop in time, and clipped the back leg. The owners were having some sort of party and had accidentally left the door open, which allowed the dog to run out. He pulled over right away to check on the dog and talked to one of the owners, which she immediately acknowledged that it was not my boyfriend's fault because he couldn't have stopped fast and they should not have left the door open. He gave her his phone number for an update to see if the dog's leg was going to be okay. The owner took the dog to the emergency vet that night (which we know is super expensive) and sent him another text saying he should not feel bad and is not responsible for it, as well as letting him know that the dog seems fine because it was standing and they are just going to do some x-rays.That was a couple of days ago, but today she reached back out to telling us the dog was fine, and is now saying people were telling her to get our car insurance so she could file a claim to help pay for the hefty vet bills. We obviously feel terrible about what happened, but we can not afford to have our insurance rates raised from this. We have never gotten into an accident or any situation like this before. Are we obligated to give our policy information, especially if she acknowledged that it wasn't his fault? We could really use some advice on how to proceed.",

Got a financial advisor and he looked over the yearly statement and told us that she’s been listed as an avid tobacco user from the start of the policy which likely cost us more than double on the premium, accrued less cash value, and potentially prevented better coverage for a similar rate. This policy has been in effect for over 15 years so this isn’t just a simple mistake. The sales rep that sold the policy is trying every trick under the sun to try to keep the policy from being canceled. We’re canceling the policy as soon as humanly possible but wondering if it’s worth seeking a lawyer to get some sort of compensation. Thank you!",

I know a post of a similar topic was posted yesterday, but the comments are now turned off, and I have an urgent question.In the post of interest, OP was strongly urged not to sign “Mama Bear” documents presented by a parent before going off to college. I’m a rising college sophomore, and I signed the documents in question almost a year ago (one set for Virginia, my home state, and one set for Connecticut, where my college is). But, after reading that post, I wish I hadn’t signed those documents.I know signing them without doing research was dumb. I don’t know why I did it. Maybe it was because my mom presented them so matter-of-factly, I assumed it was something everyone did, like filling out the FAFSA. But, in hindsight, I do have parents who like to helicopter, and I am seeking to gradually decrease contact with them over the years (though they may not fully realize that part, it does anger them when I try to live more independently).Help?! I’m young and dumb. I shouldn’t have signed those documents. Is there a way to get out of them? Do I need a lawyer?",
