      "content_preview": "Hey, guys! This is my first post here and I wanted it to be over my college essay that I plan to submit soon that follows Technoblade's story. The prompt was to \"discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others,\" and I felt that this was fitting. Any suggestions or revising tips are welcomed, but mostly I hope you all enjoy reading this! July 2021 was around the time when the first diagnosis was given. It started with pain in the shoulder after a late night gaming session and ultimately led to the diagnosis of stage 4 sarcoma cancer. Nevertheless, the bravery and determination to continue to fight and live never once stopped. While others may have chosen to focus on recovery, or maybe even choose to just appreciate the time they had left, that didn‚Äôt happen in this case. This battle didn‚Äôt end because of surrender; instead, it ended in a tie.\n\nWhen the first announcement was given, many were upset to hear such devastating news. While some offered their support, many chose to offer their condolences instead, choosing to focus on the highly likely chance of defeat in such an extreme scenario. However, this story didn‚Äôt end by simply just laying down one‚Äôs weapons. The fight never died. Instead, charities were held, thousands were donated, and those who knew gave inspirational cheers and increased the confidence. Not a moment was wasted; every single one was spent presenting a strong, brave front, constantly fighting for a chance, no matter how small, continuing to spread awareness and inspiration for all those affected. Even when the fight stopped in June 2022, it did not end because of surrender or defeat. It ended in a tie because not only was so much good accomplished during such a small time frame, even going as far as to prepare a goodbye speech that continues to spark inspiration to this day, the cancer died as well that day.\n\nHowever, this story is not mine. Instead, all of the credit belongs to Alexander ‚ÄúTechnoblade,‚Äù a still famous youtuber. I was only 14 when I learned that my hero had passed. He once had meant so much because of his incredibly talented ability to make everything funny, and then he later became my inspiration behind everything I did in life. His final goodbye, a heart-tugging speech delivered by his father, wished all his fans to live ‚Äúlong and prosperous lives‚Äù after all they had given him over the course of his life. That message and his display of such strength during his time with cancer has inspired me to this day. While I may not ever achieve such famous achievements as he did, I continue to work hard to become the best version of myself because if he could do it, then so should I.\n\nIt has now been 3 years since my hero‚Äôs passing. Since then, thousands more have been donated in the name of research for cancer, many things have been dedicated to honoring his strength and accomplishments, and many fight to keep his legacy alive and remembered. Moreover, in my own life, many improvements have been made. I‚Äôve learned to work harder, to be happier, to appreciate my life more, and to make the most of every moment. This has brought me promotions in my extracurricular activities, more confidence in what I want to achieve in my life, and more pride in my already established accomplishments, no matter how small. I will never stop, never give up, never lose hope because my hero never did. His death, while very devastating and heartbreaking for me, granted me a new understanding of strength. Strength cannot be measured in one‚Äôs physical aspects, but instead in one‚Äôs mental aspects. I continue to grow, to improve, to accept, and to achieve my dreams for and because of Alexander, and I will never stop. I refuse to fight with any less strength than him, not until the very end, because he fought so hard to prove that.",
