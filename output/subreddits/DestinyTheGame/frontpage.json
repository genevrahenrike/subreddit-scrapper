Just undo this b.s The whole tier system is aggravating and doesn't encourage build crafting. Again why is weapon crafting gone? Why not add Armor Crafting also ? We get Tiered materials to build the armor set we want but nah  let's be honest most will get T3 and stop cause it ain't worth the annoyance. Have no reason to run dungeons or raids .

      "content_preview": "We'd like to announce the next major chapter in Destiny, Destiny Falling. With the successful launch of Destiny Rising, we feel it is only fitting we shift our focus back to the main franchise to give it some much needed TLC. Destiny Falling is about all the things that matter most to us: falling player counts, falling trust, falling short of expectations... you could say we are taking lessons from our Eliksni allies. We took for granted our players, we experienced our own Whirlwind (many good employees were lost along the way), and now we are fallen. Our CEO has abandoned us. We had to leave behind our expensive new headquarters and become lowly pirates, plundering your wallets.But Destiny Falling isn't just about us. It's about falling content, falling rewards, falling down the Caldera mines one last time for the hell of it. But we promise, our pricing won't change. We pride ourselves on delivering consistency. You expect to spend $80 annually and we strive to deliver.We here believe less is more, as shown by these graphs. These graphs explain why you are wrong and we are right. Caldera won't mine itself. We have given you enough of a break. Sony will not save you. NetEase will not save you. You belong to us now.This is the first step of many, the first knife, if you will. We have walked this path before, as have you. You will walk it again. And again. And again. Do not fight. The Witness tried to free you, it failed. This is what you wanted. This is what you want. We know what you want because we decide what you want.CALDERA_WILL_MAKE_ME_GOD",

      "content_preview": "-No one is running legacy raids or dungeons because the loot is mostly seen as worthless.-No one is running nightfalls because they were removed from the game.-No one is running campaign missions because they're either too hard/time-consuming/unrewarding and/or because matterspark is annoying.-No one is running seasonal content because we don't have any.-No one is running pvp because it's broken.-No one is running legend lost sectors because there's no reason to.-Very few people are running the new raid because the weapons aren't craftable, the drops don't increase your light level, and you can't get tier 5s.I have officially arrived at the point where I log in, say \"fuck the portal,\" and then just stare at my ship floating in orbit until I realize that there is so little to do that I don't even know what I'm doing here. As someone who I honestly thought would always be a die-hard fan of the game...............this feels crazy. It feels like there's nothing to do unless you're trying to play by yourself. If the experience during renegades is ANYTHING like this, I honestly don't think this game survives, which is a massive shame.I know that Bungie never takes it seriously when hardcore players say they're gonna leave, and I haven't quit playing it yet. But Black Ops 7 comes out later this year and as someone who LOVED BO3, I will honestly just move on to that, at least for a while, if this situation doesn't MASSIVELY improve.It's so telling that even though I MIGHT be content to just go run solo dungeons and fuck around with new builds in meaningless activities like old campaigns, the number one reason I'm not doing that is because I have a very large motivation to NOT play the game for the sole reason of driving their numbers down. Not wanting to play a game primarily for the purpose of punishing the developers is actually insane. How did we get to this absurd level of bad-will?",

Meaning we have no idea what the goal is. What's the vision that's being put together that'll be clearer with subsequent updates?I'm not getting into the specifics because you see around 15 new topics on a daily basis rehashing the same issues we've had since the start of the season. It isn't story, it's the longevity and replayability of this game.So please, run this up the flag pole.Sincerely, Destiny 2 Community.",

Yes, the grind is some of the worst it’s ever been.Play this game throughout the entire life cycle seen the highs and the lows like many of us haveI am 413 power currently in this season. I’m trying to get as many tier 5 armour, soloy for the potential to make builds at later seasons. So I never have to feel like I do now. if my power resets to 200 after December, I most likely will not be doing the power grind nor really caring about the game. I will do the bare minimum. if all I’m gonna be missing out on is the seasonal bonus then I think I’m OK with that. Oh well…Yes, we’re getting the update in September about fixing the power leveling. have to eventually see how that is. I do not want to grind 350 levels and spend hundreds of hours torturing myself like I’m doing now and so many of us are. It feels like I have played Destiny more this season than any other season and I do like playing the game, but I don’t like my playtime going up for my levelling grind to become significantly worse. Player retention should not be based on artificially slowing down a grind.I worry resetting the power back to 200 will make people feel that their grind was not valued, and also potentially could make people not wanna play in the future. If I were to start playing to edge of fate today fresh at level 10.  I don’t think I would. I think I would wait for the next season after the power reset in December.I love yall. Drink some water",

      "content_preview": "TL;DR - NetEase has shipped Destiny: Rising with a bunch of features that should be present in Destiny 2.Like many of you, I’ve put thousands of hours into Destiny. Since, rising came out, I’ve pretty much only played Rising as it is actually fun. Grinding the portal in Destiny 2… not fun. Here is a long list of things that have astonished me. How are these things in a mobile gacha game, and not Bungies game?—————————-New player experience - There are guides, tutorials, videos, trials, explanations, aCAMPAIGNall these great things to slowly introduce and explain stuff to a new player. I was not lost at all.Perk transparency - You can actually see full perk poolsin-gameand perks showEXACT NUMBERS. Like 15% extra damage for 10 seconds.HUD Clarity - Exact health and shield numbers. Exact numbers at the end of an activity about how much damage you did.MVP screen to show who contributed the most and carried along with giving that person some accolades.Shifting gates - This is just way better gambit. Holy smokes it’s so much better gambit.Sparrow racing league - I still can’t believe this is in the mobile game and not the real game. It’s super fun as expected. And you get good rewards.Realm of the 9 - This is a really awesome roguelike mode. Bungie toyed with Roguelike stuff, but alas… deleted it all from the game like the geniuses they are always deleting shit. Realm of the 9 in the mobile game has way more intriguing choices and effects that stack and are significant.NPC involvement - Bro we actually have NPC team members show up regularly, run around, and actually fight with us. It isn’t just a stupid voice line in our ears while we do everything completely alone. This is really awesome and why isn’t this a normal occurrence in a Destiny 2 campaign?Clan housing / Bases - Actual shared social spaces for clans to hang out.Ping system - Why don’t we have this yet in Destiny 2!!!!Fishing - There is legitimately a lot of depth to fishing and you can get good rewards by doing it. There is a skill tree. Different baits, reels with stats, location and fish variation, a more in depth catching mechanic. Fishing was asked to stick around when Bungie made a crappy version of it for 1 season… alas… DELETED.A card game - There is an entire deck building card game inside the game where you can again, earn good rewards.loading times - Extremely fast load times. Destiny 2 is assumed to be held back by decade+ old hardware like the PS4 and load times have always sucked. Maybe they should have made a D3 by now and cut those turds loose.GPS like navigation - I can usually teleport right near something I want to go do in a couple seconds, and then there is a trail of glowing dots like a GPS showing me the path to walk to get to the thing I’m tracking. It’s way better than the shit we got in Destiny 2.—————————-It’s just crazy to me that a mobile spin off gacha game made by a different company has more features, better quality of life, more transparency, and activity variety than the main game.There are so many things I want Bungie to just straight up steal and put in the main game.",

      "content_preview": "Most of us here have been with Bungie for years. We’ve poured thousands of hours into their worlds whether it is in Marathon, Halo, Destiny 1, or Destiny 2. For me, that’s well over 10,000 hours and I dont regret my time. We stuck around because Bungie used to deliver experiences that felt legendary, the kind you couldn’t get anywhere else.Lately though, it feels like that Bungie is slipping away. Decisions are driven by numbers instead of passion. TWIDs land tone deaf. Changes ignore what the community asks for, often times doing the exact OPPOSITE. Every time it happens, a little more hope fades and I feel like we are at a crossroads.None of us want to walk away, but more and more people are reaching the point of no return. All my friends have, and they all say the same thing. There is no innovation, no over delivery, just stagnation. They feel ripped off buying rehashed weapons and destinations or activities. We don’t just want Bungie to survive — we want it to feel legendary again. Put fun first. Listen to the players who are still here. Lead with creativity, not metrics.The Bungie that gave us Halo 3, The Taken King, Forsaken, and Witch Queen is still in there somewhere. But it’s buried under bureaucracy. New leadership was supposed to bring change, but things only feel worse.Have some faith in your players. We’ve believed in you for decades. All we want is to have fun again.– Dan, a concerned Guardian",

Keeping it constructive, the game would be better if:-Every playable activity advances power level-All Raids and Dungeons offered minimum Tier 4 rewards-World Bosses rained loot in Patrol Spaces on timer allowing meaningful advancement boosts-Onslaught drops currency to re-roll weapons and armor at same Tier level as equipped loot (think glass needles from D1)-Drop “soft” sunsetting, nobody wants to grind for its own sake-Make all campaigns selectable with scalable difficulty and matching rewards dating back to Red War even if players have to choose which campaigns are actively stored and ready to play to save file space spaceYou don’t respect your players time and you’re too insecure to believe that people might play the game more if they actually were rewarded.

      "content_preview": "Destiny 2 used to be a massive universe with large open worlds, fun replayable activities, and stories that you cared about. The destinations tab gave you a sense of scale to the universe we played in. Destiny 2 is a massive game, and we were able to appreciate it for that in the past. Now, we don’t even notice it.The main culprit, in my opinion, is the Portal. This is the single worst designed feature I have ever seen put into any game, and to be honest, I don’t know how it was ever approved. The “feature” single handedly invalidated probably 3/4ths of the game and gives no reason to do anything that’s not in the Portal. Bungie has intentionally given up on the Destinations tab in favor of a Netflix menu.Before, I would look forward to seeing what raids and dungeons and activities were featured so I knew what to play. There was always variety. One week I could farm Vespers Host or Vow of the Disciple. The next week I could be playing Duality or Salvations Edge. The content variety was great, and changing it up week to week was fun.Now? It’s the exact same content every single week. Nothing changes. There’s no rotation, not to mention no dungeons or raids in the Portal. All we have to do is activities that bungie has so graciously given us the permission to do. We went from doing any raids and dungeons we wanted to do, to now Solo Ops Caldera and K1. That is the game right now. 2 3 minute missions.Bungie has said they’re looking at Portal rewards, which is good, but it doesn’t solve the problem. The portal is inherently flawed. No matter how much you buff certain activities or playlist rewards, we will always find the path of least resistance and do whatever is most efficient. Previously, this wasn’t a problem. Now, it is.Bungie has, yet again, created a massive problem for themselves that they need to fix. They get themselves in these situations constantly. I’m tired of wanting to play Destiny and just not finding the drive to do it. I want to play my favorite game of all time but I’ve lost the motivation. This is the worst system I’ve ever seen, and I hope bungie reconsiders.EDIT Instead of a mindless rant, I guess I should provide actual feedback:Put Kepler on the destinations tab.Delete the Portal page, but keep the portal “system” (because tiered loot is good).Delete the custom challenge modifier system in favor of preset, predetermined activity challenge tiers (like expert, mythic, GM), with each challenge tiers increase granting higher tiered loot.Tie in the Portal into the Destinations page somehow. Highlight activities on the Destinations page that drop tiered loot. And over time, go back to older dungeons and raids and give them tiered loot.",

Now, it was a few weeks ago that I completed all The Final Shape missions, but I can't finish the final quest step because it requires me to play Excision, a now dead activity that REQUIRES twelve matchmade players. I've tried many times to try and matchamke into it, but the most players I have gotten up to is three or four, before everyone understandably gives up and I get a matchmaking error for waiting too long.It shocks me that they haven't made a solo version of the mission or something, this was apparently an issue that started appearing just weeks after the expansion released. I haven't tried doing it right after the weekly reset before, but that does not feel right that I have to go out of my way to complete a campaign I paid for and even then I don't think it would work.Anyway, all I can really do right now is wait for the new major update to come out and hope that there are more people wanting to play it then, because right now this issue is so stupid.Edit: I've noticed a lot of people offering to help me clear it, and thanks for all the offers, but it's not super important for me to do it right now, I just wanted to bring it to attention.

So I guess this is intentional, which makes no sense. This isn't a minor issue. Swords were just left out of a major overhaul. This is like if they couldn't generate Orbs of Power.I did some testing to see how bad they are at making ammo and found out they are worse than spamming your uncharged melee. Regular melees generated a special brick after 25 Minor kills. While Swords required 33 kills to make one. I think what's going on here is that uncharged melees have an Ammo Generation stat, just a low one, while Swords have the lowest amount possible in theirs.Swords are similar to Machine Guns in that they both excel at clearing Minors and Majors and have high total damage, while swords trade range for higher DPS. So I think they should have similar Ammo Generation stats.",

Class regen is still using tiers and only changes at multiples of 10.You can see it yourself. Have your class ability at any value ending in 0-4 and equip a +5 mod. Your class cooldown in the UI and in actual play doesn't change. You can be at say 59 but getting to 60 instead changes it dramatically.Now, every point does still matter for flat gain and regen effects so it still may matter for your particular build. I also do not expect this bug to last long.For those who like pictures here is a graph and table, once again made by Boiler.Graph:https://imgur.com/fFVO6hUTable:https://imgur.com/B6myXR9",

      "content_preview": "(TL;DR: The game’s vagueness towards drop rate chances is gambling and is burning me out.)And I don’t just mean the \"No more featured raids or dungeons\" EoF situation that doesn’t tell us whether everything or nothing is featured/farmable.I’m a returning player (from back during the Witch Queen Update). I’ve always played a lot, but a lot of casual stuff. I don’t really like to depend on/be kicked off teams because of \"meta\" gear. So I stick to solo (and matchmade) missions.I’ve seen a handful of exotics I would love to get my hands on but they’re locked behind dungeons and raids (namely The Navigator, Vex Mythoclast, Conditional Finality, and specifically Euphony). So I’ve decided to look into the meta and learn these dungeons and raids to go farm these… And that might have fully killed the fun I have in the game.See, now I’m in this position of \"I have these ideas for builds that require these weapons. But I’m burning out trying to farm them FIFTY TIMES over so I’ll go back to my usual fun Portal/NF missions…but my build is lacking the essential part of it…that I cannot get to drop…so I can’t enjoy my build to the fullest.\"Farming is perfectly understandable for the vitality of the game: as a looter shooter - it relies on players repeating missions to stay healthy. But come on! No pity system, no drop rate protection, no actual KNOWN odds, not even a \"Yes they are farmable/No they are not farmable\". Complete silence. Absolute silence. For all we know, the triumphs could increase the drop chance by 1% or by 0,0001%. The initial drop chance (I’ve seen the well educated estimations but still, nothing official) could also be 0,0001%… This much unknown on my odds of getting the weapon leans towards gambling moreso than playing. Let alone what I call the FOMO exotics like Barrow-Dyad which are straight up unobtainable right now for returning players like me.I play quite a bit of Warframe and Destiny is yet another example of why Warframe’s devs get to have a community of players that love them. They realize that grinding and farming is vital for the game. But they don’t make it a vicious game of unspoken/undisclosed information.I think I just wanted to vent a little because I might be burning out from the game - which is kind of hopeless in the sense that this is a problem at such extremes to what I see the community venting about right now that this \"feedback/plea\" might just go unnoticed by them. Oh well. I am not one to stay in weird \"toxic\" relationships with games so I’ll just move on now before feeling jaded from the game forever.",

      "content_preview": "I'm not saying this to be a debbie downer. I think most of the artifacts that we've recieved over the years have been fantastic. But I'm a solo player (which is a MAJOR theme right now) who likes to play dungeons, meaning the most challenging thing I'm usually up against is doing boss dps solo. This artifact REALLY sucks for this. We have a mod that buffs your damage when you're close to teammates, one that gives you radiant from precision solar weapon damage, and one that spews shrapnel when dealing damage while radiant. These are fine for team play (even though most teams are always radiant anyway during dps because there's usually a well). It just doesn't really move the needle for a solo player that isn't doing precision damage with solar weapons, which is really NOT a huge category.Machine guns aren't really viable for dps right now. Swords, heavy gls, and rockets don't do precision damage. That leaves linears and exotics. For solo play, I honestly feel like you're kind of pingeonholed into using one of six weapons to really get your money's worth out of this artifact for dps: lord of wolves, still hunt, whisper of the worm, sleeper simulant, cataclysmic, and briar's contempt. Maybe throw in finality's auger but I feel like the point of that weapon for dps is to plant the turret and then swap. Out of the original six listed, only whisper is \"featured.\" Basically ZERO \"new gear\" weapons are solar, precision-based dps weapons. Like......what????Compare this with past modifiers that have REALLY expanded your dps options:-ALL linears and fusions applying a 30% debuff and basically getting rewind rounds-ALL special and heavy gls applying a 15% debuff-15% flat outgoing damage for all solo play-Increasing ALL void damage against weakened targets-Grenade launchers basically getting kinetic tremors-ALL rockets doing bonus damage when you have armor charge-ALL swords doing bonus damage when you have armor charge-Supers dealing 30% more damage from elemental buffsAll of these have been MASSIVE for players trying to solo or solo flawless difficult content. It just feels bad getting zero boost to outgoing damage if you're using all swords, rockets, heavy gls, or any machine guns or linears that aren't solar. Way too restricted. To make matters worse, we are stuck with this artifact, with zero rows being added, until december. Basically five months. Huge L not adding some cool new mods for ash and iron. Let me know what you guys think, or if I'm out of line.",

Barely anybody's running it on the fireteam finder or the lfg discords either.Can something please be done to bump up the raid population? Yeah, it's the game's hardest content, but it's also some of the best. Struggling to even try because it's too difficult to find a group is the stupidest reason ever to not be able to play it.I've brought up these points before, but I'm putting them here too. There are multiple things that could be done to increase the raiding population and I feel like Bungie pretty much NEEDS to implement at least one:Rewards should contribute to the power climb. This one should be a no brainer, the fact that they don't already is part of what's made the current grind more monotonous than it should be.Rewards should be adapted to the new loot system (i.e. tiers and set bonuses). This'll take longer to implement, but it'd improve the content's longevity massively.Featured raids should be a thing again (regular farming and all challenges still available all the time, but featured raids would double the legendary drops and make the exotic farmable too). This would focus the population and make it easier to form teams for whatever raid was featured that week.Explorer mode for raids. At the bare minimum, literally just HUD changes to teach people the mechanics, and no revive token system. That alone would make learning the raids and teaching others so much easier.",

Since one of the original four triumphs is to complete the rewards track, it's somewhat timegated behind daily challenges, and having extra reroll chips to reroll challenges after you complete them can make it so you can start on the gilded triumphs a day or two earlier.",

      "content_preview": "From the TWIDIn the future, we’re interested in doing more to make each class’s identity more distinct, potentially through stronger passive effects for each class. However, this adds more complexity to an already complex game, and the player experience comes first.Well let me tell you what's complex, giving Hunters +3.4% faster strafe speeds (completely unnoticeable!), giving Titans 20% increased melee damage in PvE, but then also increased stagger against combatants, and then somehow giving Warlocks nothing.You're the ones making it complex!Nobody will complain about just giving each stat a flat benefit. Yeah, this sucked previously, because Hunters were stuck with Mobility (a completely worthless stat) and Titans had Resilience (the most powerful stat by a mile). You've moved onto this new system, and now armor stats are much more balanced. But somehow, your idea of giving the classes intrinsic benefits are...stillforcing mobility benefits onto Hunter (and calling that the buff! It's still unnoticeable as it was last year, it's the same damn stat), and you still can't think of what to give Warlocks?Giving each class a flat +20 not only helps reinforce class identity, but even for the times that a class doesn't want to build into it, having 20 points of flexibility to invest elsewhere is drastically more useful. If a Hunter wants to build into melee, they can do that, and not have to spend as much into class (because their identity involving the dodge means they get it back faster). And if a Warlock wants to fully build into grenades, they can do it better than the other classes,becausethey are specialized for the grenade stat.Because right now, you're still roping Hunters to a dead and imperceptive stat, you're unable to think of what Warlocks should get (and this is somehow a \"long term\" goal for you), and the Titan benefit is unlisted anywhere in the game.Why are we so worried about simple solutions to what you think are complex problems?Edit: Weapons to Hunter is fine too I don’t really care about the specifics. Make it +10, make it +20, make it Super, keep the current benefits with these too, it doesn’t matter. This just seems like such an easy and efficient solution to what Bungie is apparently calling a complex problem. You literally reworked the stat system. Your answer isright there.",
