        "content": "No piracy requests, links, or promotion of piracy allowed. Posts should ask for book suggestions so our members can give recommendations.  If you are not sure if it fits the guidelines, try adding \"Suggest me a book...\" at the beginning of the post.  If you can still ask your question in that way, it fits! Do not promote your writing here.  This will result in a permanent ban.  Also do not promote your blog, podcast, social media accounts, or any other form of advertisement.  If you have a personal connection or incentive to suggest it, it's promotional and not allowed. Posts must include text in the body to help you get more helpful book suggestions.   Please add additional context to your post. Trolling, insults, or excessive hostility don't contribute to the discussion around books.  Be civil.  There are plenty of other places to fight on Reddit.  Let's keep the focus on book suggestions here.  This includes joke responses. Any form of spam / blogspam is not allowed.  This includes links to book reviews, AI generated content,  bots, social media channels and any affiliate links. No posts asking if you should read a certain title or author.  You will be better served by checking out review sites like Goodreads to make a determination.  Instead, share what you have enjoyed in the past and allow the community to suggest you new titles and authors to expand your book world! When posting spoilers, please use spoiler tags.  Posts with spoilers will be removed. Posts submissions with links are not allow to help with the constant flood of spam. Posts must contain text only. Shortened URLs are removed by Reddit automatically to combat spam - post the full link in your comment to avoid an auto-removal. **Due to the high amount of YouTube spam we receive, these links are auto removed. Do not message individual moderators with questions or arguments around removals.  All communication should go through official mod mail. Harrassment via PM will lead to a permanent ban."

I'm okay with consensual sex in my fiction as long as it isn't the main point of the book.Other survival (but not prehistoric) books I've liked included The Hatchet, Island of the Blue Dolphins, I Am Still Alive, and My Side of the Mountain.  It doesn't have to be YA or solo survival though, those are just the ones I know.Thanks in advance!",

Please include a few words summarizing the premise of the book if the title and author don't make it obvious, without spoilers. Your assistance is most appreciated! 🤗I'll return the favor with one I recently finished and loved:Monopoly X: How Top Secret WWII Operations Used the Game to Help Allied POWs Escape, Conceal Spies, and Send Secret Codes by Philip E. Orbanes.It's about the little-known history of how Monopoly game boards were used during WWII to do exactly what the title suggests. It's got everything: spies, double agents, traitors, courageous women leading the resistance, an Army intelligence officer who went on to invent video games, murder, and heroism.Even if you think, \"Ew, history and war history are not for me!\" I promise you, you'd mistake this for a James Bond story. There's so much action, it's never dull, I was hooked on page 2. This shall sit on my bookcase dedicated to favorites. The author was an exec for Parker Brothers and his passion for Monopoly really shines through.",

I loved how fast paced especially All Systems Red was!For suggestions I’m looking for, I’m totally open to different genres. I love Fantasy, Sci-Fi and anything dystopian specifically though.Definitely anything fast paced would be amazing although most Novellas are like that.And they need to be Novellas (max 250 pages)Thank you so much in advance!",

So I’m looking for something that is not mentioned often in this subreddit.I like adventure/journey type stories, side plot romance between f and m that isn’t convoluted by misunderstandings (but not a huge romance fan), surprises in a story are nice, great writing and strong characterization. Slice of life is also something I gravitate towards but I’ve read a lot of those.Also really love information that is attention grabbing and love documentaries so I’m good with nonfiction and fiction.Genres I don’t like as much: romance and fantasy and nothing dark",

It's been a long time since I've enjoyed fantasy.What I liked - it wasn't cliche, there was pretty much no romance, the characters were extremely real and Howl was a very entertaining stupid little brat. The fantasy setting was gorgeous and absolutely perfect. It was really funny, relaxing and cozy, but also sometimes intense when it was needed. It had a definite plot and conflict but was also character focusedI tried Uprooted by Naomi Novik, it seemed promising at first, I loved the setting, but the characters were so shallow, and I HATE the \"gosh that bitchy asshole is so sexy\" trope. I don't like it! Annoying people are not hot! Do not fuck Annoying! It will not go well for anyone! I was recommended Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Fairies once, and it looks cute but it also has the annoying love interest trope. I can't deal with thatI already know becky chambers, tj klune, terry pratchett (and Tiffany Aching does help scratch this itch), unfortunately do not read neil gaiman",

Obviously subjective opinions will vary from rec to rec, but as long as YOU think it holds up the whole way, that's what matters most. Genre is genuinely unimportant, it can be absolutely anything, because I can find ways to enjoy reading anything. Can be classic, can be modern, can be any and everything in between.What I am NOT looking for:Dungeon Crawler Carl. No hate, it's just already on the TBR and I don't need to read more comments recommending it. I'll get there, but it's a mood I'll need to be in, so I'm not jumping to it just yet. I'm interested in anything else.I tend to lean towards specifically adult fiction, but I'm not opposed to YA as long as it otherwise fits the criteria.",

This might be a bit of a weird one, but I'm currently reading Columbine by Dave Cullen and I'm finding the whole book really attention-sucking for me, very hard to put down. I'm wondering if anyone has recs based on this book? Not necessarily looking for more true crime stuff, I'm actually not very interested in true crime at all, but I loved the voice this book was written with and liked how in depth and personal the research was. It painted such a vivid picture of events and it was rare that I finished a chapter not feeling emotionally gutted. I was also a big fan of Unmask Alice by Rick Emerson, another nonfiction book written with a really engaging voice and narrative flow.Apologies if this is super specific! I'm hoping there's more books in this niche than just the two I've read.",

You can really picture the places, and they give me a sense of nostalgia. That’s definitely priority number one.Here’s my issue. A lot of the recommendations based on these, that I’ve read, don’t do the antagonists justice like these books did. They make you hate the antagonists so much it’s unbearable. I love books where even the bad guys are still portrayed as human. The way they still underneath love their very hateable family or friends; And empathize with them against their own volition. That really draws me in, as I can relate.If you have any suggestions that do both, please please please help me 🫶",
