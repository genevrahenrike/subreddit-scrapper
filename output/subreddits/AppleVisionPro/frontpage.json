However, I notice that even when using the included cloth, there's still a bit of a haze that seems to be getting a bit more pronounced over time. Anyone have a best practice for super cleaning both the inside and outside of the unit? I'm less worried about aesthetics and more about making the viewing and cameras as clear as possible.",

For a first roadmap, I immediately saw the lack of AVP users in number and thought to build it cross platform from the ground up. As of now, I started building the concept but kept wondering if you think the idea has potential: comes at a time where AVP users lack the social side that comes with Quest due to being too few of us Aside of streaming platforms content, streaming your local files from a NAS, or else watching public content such as a rocket launch via a YouTube stream All of which, in either your VR room of choice or a scanned real room you offer the other users. Would you be interested? Do you have remarks for me? Anything will do.",

For those of you who have tried viewing them on the Vision Pro, does it really add something special, or does it feel more like a “nice demo” you rarely come back to? Is it genuinely impressive and worth making a habit of shooting in spatial mode, or is it more of a gimmick that you eventually stop using? Would love to hear your honest experiences!",

I’ve heard there might be a new one coming however so I’m not sure whether to cave and buy or wait until the end of the year incase there’s another.

Just to get it out of the way..comparing it to any Meta product is just not fair. This was superior to the quest 3 in terms of ease of use and picture quality. Anyone who argues this is nuts lol. I had a quest 3 and distinctly remember being like WTF is this in terms of clarity. While not perfect still, AVP is significantly better. Ergonomics on the AVP was frustrating. Felt like it was just so front heavy. Also, wearing that out is just plain dumb. Which is actually what I liked about it. As a media consumption device, I actually think it was kind of awesome. Movies seemed great to watch when I demo'd a few. Photos are also pretty cool and immersive. But...that's kind of where I fall flat. Outside of media consumption, I have no idea what use case this has right now. I think what IS worth nothing is how seemless the experience was. Tapping and hand gestures was A LOT easier and significantly more responsive than I expected. The mirroring and \"monitor\" sync would be great for at home work...but realistically adopting that would be difficult It will never be the case, but if this was closer to the $1.5K-$2K mark...I'd consider getting it. But for nearly $4K...there just is not much of a use case yet. Doesn't seem like there is a lot compatible with it either right now. Overall looking forward to what comes next and how they can make it slimmer. I thought the OS though was pretty impressive. I can see them sticking to this type of R&D. It was pretty intuitive.",

Recently I got paramount+ to watch Star Trek strange new worlds specifically on the Vision Pro, and it is the worst UX I’ve ever experienced. The amazon prime app on Vision Pro is just the iPad app but that’s magnitudes better than paramounts. This isn’t even a problem that is inherent to how the ui in the Vision Pro is, it’s just poorly designed from a basic standpoint. For one, the app does not surface shows you are currently watching or have currently watched. When you load the app it just displays most popular and some recommended shows, recommendations that don’t seem to be based on what you’ve watch by the way. If you want a show to be really accessed you can add them to your list. Ok that’s a fix, not great but now your show is 2 clicks away. The second problem is much more frustrating. So now you’ve started your show, the episode ends and the app doesn’t have an option to jump to the next episode. It just ends the show and kicks you back to the home menu. So you have to go to your list select your show, and because the app doesn’t surface your recently watched episode or even recommend the next chronological episode. You have to go into the menu go through seasons and find the episode you were on. Hopefully you remember the episode number or name, because now you have to read the summaries to figure out which one was the last episode you watched. First world problems, I know, but This is basic ui/ux that every streaming app in and outside of the Apple Vision Pro does. I am certain that this is not an issue on the iPad app or the web interface, because I’m sure I would have heard about it online by now. It feels like either paramount gave the development of the Vision Pro app to an intern with a stringent deadline or they intentionally made the ux antagonistic to the user. Why would they do either of those things? I don’t know, but one thing film studios seem to lack in great abundance is common sense and reasoning skills. I probably shouldn’t be surprised, this is the studio that burdened us with “Indiana jones and the dial of destiny” as well as the “tomorrow war”, after all. Anyways, that’s my irrelevant rant.",

On Vision Pro, I imagine it could be top-down or maybe even make use of bounded volume. I’d really love to play something like that, but if it doesn’t exist yet, I might even try making one myself.

      "content_preview": "There’s a lot of talk about the M5, but I think considering that the Vision Pro 1.0, released in the spring of ’24, had the M2 chip, there’s a good chance it could have the M4. Honestly, I’m not sure what practical differences these chips would make when using the Vision Pro. I’m a very light user. Although I use the Vision Pro for about ten hours a day, I mostly write, read, and occasionally watch YouTube or Netflix. You might wonder why I’d use a $3,500 heavy headset for such things. I have a severe muscular disease, and the Vision Pro’s eye-tracking is far more useful than a $4,000 eye tracker. Maybe it’s better to compare the M4 with the current M2 rather than the M5. While using the M2 Vision Pro, I’ve noticed two major issues regarding performance: occasional lag and the inability to play YouTube 8K videos. The AV1 codec is supported from the M3, right? I really wish the Vision Pro had the M3 instead of the M2. However, I’m not certain if the lag is due to the M2 chip. It might be the RAM instead. Does anyone even play games on the Vision Pro? I mean games downloaded from the App Store, not streaming games. For game streaming, a Wi-Fi upgrade would be more effective. And for tasks like video editing or coding, improved performance would be beneficial. Honestly, more than the performance difference, I’m curious about how much Apple would buy back the Vision Pro 1.0 for. I’m not interested in trade-ins per se, but I’m really curious if this product would even qualify for one. If it does, how much would it be worth? Considering my basic M1 iMac is valued at around $200, the Vision Pro’s value probably won’t be much higher. By the time the real Vision Pro 2 comes out—lighter and truly next-gen—the price will likely drop even more. As a light user, I still find the current Vision Pro really heavy… Yes, my main interest is the Vision Pro’s trade-in value.",

I know i can watch the trailers on the apple store but they are not immersive. I need o experience this without it costing me a few hundred quid. I don't care if it is full films or just samples, of real films. Not just \"made for Vision\" stuff. Any ideas?",

      "content_preview": "I just finished watching Avatar: The Way of Water on AVP and it was easily one of the most immersive viewing experiences I've had! From the opening scene, Vision Pro’s depth and surround effects pulled me into the world of Jake and Neytiri. The 3D presentation wasn’t just about popping visuals, it gave the film a true sense of space. Moments I had seen before in theaters felt new again. With environment occlusion turned on, my living room disappeared and it felt like I was sitting in a private cinema carved into the cliffs of Pandora. Watching at home this way felt better than going to a traditional theater. No waiting in line, no crowds. I ended up rewatching several scenes just to take in the color, detail, and layered sound design. It didn’t feel like watching a movie. It felt like entering another place. I have used other headsets like the Quest 3, which are great for gaming and casual VR content. But for watching films, especially those with rich environments like Avatar , the experience feels limited. Quest 3 still suffers from visible pixelation, inconsistent contrast in darker scenes, and a noticeable sense of wearing a device. Vision Pro feels more refined. Here are a few tips to make movie-watching on AVP more comfortable: • Third-party starp . It’s better for long sessions because it spreads the weight more evenly and reduces pressure on your face. • Headrest or neck support . If you like watching while lying down or relaxing on the couch, a good pillow can take the strain off your neck and help you stay comfortable longer. • AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Max . These pair perfectly with Vision Pro and support personalized spatial audio with head tracking, making the sound feel more immersive and realistic. • Charging dock if you want something premium (I use the PrismXR Carina D1) ：You just set the battery down and it starts charging. Been using it for a while and it’s super convenient, especially if you wear Vision Pro often. Hope you enjoyed watching with AVP! I heard Avatar 3 is coming out this December. I'm definitely excited for it.",
