I gave some lessons and there's just the usual issues: student is impatient, doesn't practice regularly, seems to understand principles but doesn't apply them during games. After a couple months of poor performance, student shared a game with me they played online. Seemed strong for their level but didn't think much of it. Later I reviewed the game privately and some others they played and it's very clear to me they started cheating in recent weeks. Chesscom doesn't seem to have detected it yet but it's very obvious to me. What do I do now? Parents aren't the types who would accept that their child cheated. Do I just ignore it and move on? Dump them as a student? I don't see a situation where I confront the student about it that leads to anything good. But it bugs me because I could see this type of kid growing up thinking it's ok to cheat to get results, generally being a bad person and getting rewarded for it. Update: student's Chesscom account is now closed for fair play violation before I could take any action. So it took them some time but they did catch it",

I'm an adult improver rated in the mid-low 1800s (national rating) and I will be playing my first serious classical tournament in a couple of months, after taking a little break from chess during paternity leave. I have not really studied any opening theory in the last 15 years, but decided to brush up a little on my openings to not get bad positions early, as I often tend to do so. My repertiore so far has been a somewhat positional e4 as White (Spanish against e5, Rossalimo/Moscow/Alapin against Sicilian, Tarrasch French, Advance Caro) and a very imporvised Nimzo/QGD against d4. I did recently purchase the Nimzo/Ragozin repertoire by Sielecki and Barrish, and that course is awesome. Really like both the positions and their teaching style. I am now looking to learn more about 1. e4 e5 from the Black perspective. I have mainly played Nc6, but have also dabbled a little bit in the Petrov. Are there any books/courses you would recommend? What are the advantages of Nc6 over Petrov and vice versa? Thank you in advance! P.S. Before some of you start typing - I am only interested in playing e5. I am definitely not interested in playing Caro Kann or Sicilian or French or any other defense to 1. e4",

I find so much joy when that happens.. and like that because of chess I learned an important life lesson: you don't go trying to help people, for even with the best intentions not every one wants help and some may get suspicious about you and think you want something from them, and even those who wants you to help them if you do it without them asking you they won't value your help.. what you should do is only help those who seek help",
