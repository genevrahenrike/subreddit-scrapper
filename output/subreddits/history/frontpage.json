      "content_preview": "So good morning or good afternoon.I had a pleasant chat with another south african who has some weird believes. According to him well the germans were our allies in the south african war of 1899-1902. Now this is something everyone always told me but I am beginning to doubt these claims.https://samilhistory.com/2023/11/22/un-packing-pakenham/Most of these claims come from early Boer writers or most infamously \"the boer war\" by Thomas Packenham. Many take it as an unquestionable fact of history but I always had a weird feeling about this idea, was it true?To get some things past because I know it will come up immediately. Yes in 1896 after the Jameson raid Kaiser Wilhelm II did send a telegram to Paul Kruger readingthis. Now yes granted, Wilhelm did suggest landing troops in Delgoa Bay and marching them to pretoria to take over the republics and also ordered his chief of staff Von Moltke to draft up plans to invade britain. this was shot down as lunacy.In my opinion yes one could argue that germany was symphethetic to the republics after the jameson raid, that much is very clear, but after that it it becomes muddy and not true at all. Normally the pro-boer historians like Packenham will stop after the telegram to proclaim the alliance, purposefully leaving out germanies actions after this, and using careful language to portray an idea.an argument normally used is germany sold them weapons, but germany didnt, Mauser and Krupp did. Some french cannons from Schneider was also purchased but the same argument is not used for them. if the german government subsidised them or the army was involved, one could make such an argument but there was no involvement or such form of support.that is not to mention the german involvement with the british army during the south african war, and what Kaiser Wilhelm said about the republics publicly during the war. (John C.G. Röhl: The Kaiser and England during the Boer War)so is there any good sources or reasons why that argument is made or any I missed? I want to dive deeperedit:I will add some quotes taken from Wilhelms own memoirs and compiled by John C.G. Röhl: The Kaiser and England during the Boer War.\"I was standing up for a nation that was wronged... I was certainly not aiming at offending you or your country... The tone of the English press is absolutely ignorant and offensive.\" written to his uncle prince edward of england.\"I cannot find words to express my indignation with the Boers and my admiration for the brave British soldiers!... I hope the victory will be a thorough one and that the lesson will be a sharp one; it is the only way to bring them to their senses. The Boers are a stubborn, wild, cruel, cunning set of savages with whom one cannot argue but must thrash... into unconditional surrender!\" Him writing to his mother after the outbreak of war\"It is a struggle between the Teuton and the Celt for the possession of the African Continent! The Boers are not Teutonic at all, they are a degenerate mob of whisky-drinking, Bible-mumbling hypocrites, a pack of traitors and rebels.\" This directly contradicts the public German perception of ethnic affinity.\" during the war\"The English must raise 200,000 men and place them in three armies... The first army... must advance along the western railway... The second army... must operate along the central railway... The third army... must advance from Durban... The three armies must then converge on Pretoria, like Napoleon's march on Moscow, and force the Boers into a decisive battle.\" Him writing \"recommendations to the english army“The whole affair proved the Boers were nothing but bandits. My position was correct from the start: crush them without mercy for the sake of civilization and for the security of our own colonial projects.” Writing to the english again when he thought the war ended.\"The English are not proceeding with the necessary severity. To win against such an opponent, you must be ruthless. They should not just occupy the towns but must systematically devastate the land, burn the farms, and put the women and children into concentration camps. That is the only way to break the morale of the guerrilla fighters.\" He criticized the british for not being extreme enough\"If England is defeated, she will make peace with the Boers and then together they will fall upon our colonies. A British-Boer alliance is my nightmare.\"“I advised them! I told them how to do it! My strategy is what worked! And now they offer me no thanks… They are ungrateful and incapable of recognizing genius.” He ranted to his chancelor, angered that the british did not give him \"credit\" for the tactics to end the war.But then to use him as a source is kind of dumb, as his chancellor noted: \"The Kaiser is like a balloon. If one does not hold fast to the string, one never knows where he will be off to.\"So yeah Im looking for different sources to back this up",

Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

      "content_preview": "Hi everybody,Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or time period, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder,r/historyalso has a recommended list of things to read, listen to or watchhere.",

Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or time period, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

CE. At the site, there were 76 cremation graves & 1 inhumation [grave 26]. The latter contained seemingly just one skeleton. But after recent DNA and radio-carbon analysis of the skeletal parts, no less than five different individuals were identified, with a dating range of at least 2500 years, from the late Neolithic period to the Gallo-Roman one.from Veselka et al., 2024p. 1576Post-mortem manipulation of human bodies, including the commingling of multiple individuals, is attested throughout the past. More rarely, the bones of different individuals are assembled to create a single ‘individual’ for burial. Rarer still are composite individuals with skeletal elements separated by hundreds or even thousands of years. Here, the authors report an isolated inhumation within a Gallo-Roman-period cremation cemetery at Pommerœul, Belgium. Assumed to be Roman, radiocarbon determinations show the burial is Late Neolithic—with a Roman-period cranium....p. 1577A recent radiocarbon dating programme confirms that the cremation deposits are of Roman date; unexpectedly, the inhumation yielded dates consistent with the Late Neolithic....p. 1584Grave 26 was the only inhumation excavated at Pommerœul and no other unburnt skeletal remains were retrieved from the site. The storage boxes are all clearly marked, and the cranium sampled (depicted in Figure 8 without the left os temporalis, which was removed for DNA and radiocarbon analyses) is markedly similar to the cranium observable in original excavation photographs....p. 1588Grave 26 at Pommerœul adds to our growing understanding of the variability of human burial practices and provides a unique point of connection between the Late Neolithic and Roman worlds. Whether the Neolithic bones were obtained from burials at Pommerœul or from more distant mortuary contexts, and whether the assembly of the bones occurred in the Late Neolithic or in the Roman period, the presence of the ‘individual’ was clearly intentional. The bones were selected, a fitting location chosen and the elements arranged carefully to mimic the correct anatomical order. The resulting burial implies great care and planning, as well as a good knowledge of human anatomy. The Gallo-Roman contribution of a cranium to the composite individual is certain but the motivation remains obscure; perhaps this community was inspired by superstition or felt the need to connect with an individual who had occupied the area before themselves.",
