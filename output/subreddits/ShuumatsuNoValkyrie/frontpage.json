      "content_preview": "The crushing sky ‚ÄòI-I can‚Äôt believe it ladies and gents, gods and goddesses, the mighty titan of the sky, Atlas, has lost his arm!‚Äô Hermes announces while the human crowd cheers loudly and the gods question their eyes. Atlas looks over his shoulder to look at the disembodied limb down on the floor behind him, his shoulder pouring out blood though the pain doesn‚Äôt seem to bother the titan. His head then swivels to face the king standing before him, his boulder rolling to move behind him. ‚ÄòNow then god who stands in my way, do you still believe this to be a ‚Äúsimple scramble‚Äù?‚Äô smugly asks Sisyphus, for the first time in this fight having to look down to meet the titan‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄòIf you desire to back out now, feel free because look around you, you yourself have created your own demise in this arena. So what do you say, will you continue to defy my defiance?‚Äô ‚ÄòA shame that the first time I suffer such a major injury is at the hand of another prisoner, but that is what the fates have decided and so I shall not complain,‚Äô sighs Atlas as he cracks his neck while keeping his watch on Sisyphus. ‚ÄòYour answer to your proposal is no. Like you, I am here to seek freedom from my prison, however, it has also been so long since I have met someone who could come close to equaling my strength, let alone be able to cause me such a wound. You have my interest human, and I want to see this out till the very end.‚Äô ‚ÄòDamn it, I was really hoping that would work,‚Äô Sisyphus mumbles under his breath. ‚ÄòSo you choose to defy, in some ways I find it poetic, though that doesn‚Äôt make your decision any nicer to hear. You speak of freedom? Well the only freedom you shall find here is the freedom given by death since you want to keep going.‚Äô ‚ÄòBring it then, let us see who shall take their freedom through death.‚Äô Sisyphus kicks the boulder to begin circling the arena as Atlas lunges forward, Sisyphus barely ducking out of the way and feeling the air rush by him from the force produced by Atlas‚Äô jab. The titan wanted to follow up with another jab, but with his missing arm he is unable to and chooses to try to catch the king with his elbow. The joint catches the top of Sisyphus‚Äô head, making the king wobble a bit behind the titan. Both eyes look to see the position of Sisyphus‚Äô boulder, it now only a few metres away from hitting them both as it rapidly approaches. Sisyphus leaps forward while Atlas jumps back, the boulder rolling directly between them to create the briefest moment of respite. Atlas spins around and swings his arm like a hammer, hoping to catch the prisoner king‚Äôs head but just finding thin air as Sisyphus ducks low to the ground. The king immediately pushes himself up and away, grunting as his body screams in agony for him to stop. At the same time, Atlas‚Äô leg tries to hook around as if aiming to snap Sisyphus‚Äô spine in half in one blow. However, to Sisyphus‚Äô luck, the kick narrowly misses his body as his boulder begins to circle back around to their position. Both fighters move back and raise their legs at the exact same time after spotting the advancing boulder. Sisyphus kicks out as Atlas stomps down, the earth beneath his foot shaking and jutting up to form a natural wall. The boulder slams into the stone wall and shards of rock are sent flying out, some sticking into the arena wall with how sharp they are. Alongside slowing down the boulder, the wall diverts the boulder's path to the side of Atlas, the titan now having a clear shot at the human. Atlas‚Äô fist shoots forward and a sonic boom erupts across the arena, his knuckles catching Sisyphus directly in the centre of his face. Sisyphus is sent flying to the opposite side of the arena, his boulder rolling down to slowly reach him. ‚ÄòAnd reaching the grand result of our first round of cat and mouse between the two fighters, Atlas has landed a firm punch at the scurrying human! But the question remains, can Atlas keep on winning these little games that Sisyphus has planned?‚Äô asks Hermes as he watches with great excitement. ‚ÄòThis kind of reminds me of how I‚Äôd have to escape Huitz‚Äôs wrath in a similar way when I pushed too far with my pranks,‚Äô Tezcatlipoca sighs in joy, remembering the chaos he caused. ‚ÄòGood times, good times. It was always worth it to get under their skin.‚Äô ‚ÄòDamn it, my nose is in pieces now,‚Äô complains Sisyphus as he struggles to rise to his feet, using his sleeve to wipe away the river of blood coming from his shattered nose. ‚ÄòWhy couldn‚Äôt he have accepted my proposal and surrendered.‚Äô ‚ÄòRemember Sisyphus, while he may be a god, he too fights for his own freedom if his words are to be believed. It would be unjust to blame him for rejecting an offer you would have rejected if the roles were reversed,‚Äô states Libra from behind the king. ‚ÄòUgh, you seriously are allergic to taking my side during stuff like this.‚Äô ‚ÄòI am the personification of justice, it goes against my nature to pick a side when there is no clear right or wrong side.‚Äô ‚ÄòI mean he is still fighting for the extinction- ah forget it, we won‚Äôt get anywhere in this discussion. I need to focus on too much right now anyways.‚Äô Sisyphus‚Äô boulder rolls over to his side, now even larger and presumably more dangerous for Atlas to face head on. ‚ÄòAre you ready to continue then human? Or did I knock too much sense out of you with that blow?‚Äô Atlas asks while slowly approaching Sisyphus. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got more than enough sense with me to defy you, don‚Äôt worry about me and worry about yourself,‚Äô snarkily responds Sisyphus, his words dripping with confidence despite his condition not fitting it at all. Atlas is about to speak, but Sisyphus interrupts him as he launches the boulder forward with some spin as if it were a bowling ball. The titan jumps to the side to dodge and leaps forward towards the king. In response, Sisyphus sprints forward to the surprise of everyone. He dives down as Atlas‚Äô fist goes flying over his head, his body crashing into the ground and his head immediately shooting up to spot his boulder. Sisyphus rolls out the way as Atlas turns around to find the grounded human but being surprised as the scratching sound of stone on stone becomes only a few metres away from him, the boulder now too close to dodge. It slams into the titan‚Äôs body and a loud crack echoes out before the boulder and god slam into the arena wall. ‚ÄòAnd in a surprising twist of fate, Sisyphus has returned the favour on Atlas and seems to have completely taken the advantage in this fight!‚Äô exclaims Hermes as the boulder rolls back to the human that has now scrambled away to make distance. ‚ÄòCome on Sisyphus, just keep this up and we have the lead,‚Äô says Jeanne, praying deep within her heart and soul for Sisyphus‚Äô victory. ‚ÄòAtlas, Atlas, has all the millenia trapped in marble made you rusty? I remember watching you fend of Zeus all by yourself and shaking off his lightning bolts, so how are you struggling to put down this human and being knocked about by his simple tricks,‚Äô mutters Nyx as she watches Atlas push himself out of the wall, the supreme goddess‚Äô head resting on her fist in disappointment. ‚ÄòThen there is the more important question‚Ä¶ if you desire your freedom so much, then why have you not brought down the full might of the sky upon this human?‚Äô ‚ÄòSo that‚Äôs why you added that spin there. I must admit, I am impressed at your tactical mind,‚Äô says Atlas while rolling his shoulder, pain surging through his body due to the handful of broken ribs in his chest. ‚ÄòI have met gods who pale in comparison.‚Äô ‚ÄòWell thank you for the compliment, but don‚Äôt expect it to make me go easier on you,‚Äô responds Sisyphus while hiding his concern that Atlas saw his plan. ‚ÄòI would hope not. I would hope that if I am to gain my freedom, I gain it by defeating an opponent giving me their all. Though I must apologise there for my hypocrisy. You have proven yourself to be more than capable and so I shall face you with my full strength.‚Äô Atlas‚Äô words send a shiver of fear down Sisyphus‚Äô spine, though the human wouldn‚Äôt visibly show it as he stares down the looming titan. ‚ÄòHa, have I finally put the fear of death into you? Let‚Äôs see if your full might can pull you out of this hole I‚Äôve backed you into.‚Äô Sisyphus starts the fighting again, launching his boulder directly at Atlas with an even quicker speed than before. In response, Atlas bursts to the right, the ground breaking beneath his feet as he pushes off. The boulder slams into the wall and Sisyphus sprints towards it as Atlas surges forward, his foot trailing behind him before it swings to catch the king in the stomach. A wave of blood gushes out of Sisyphus' mouth as soon as the titan‚Äôs shin makes contact to launch the human into the far opposite wall. Sisyphus drops to the ground and immediately tries to get up despite his vision spinning and a darkness creeping in from the corners of his view. He immediately drops to his knees and coughs up more and more blood. He was holding all of this back? I thought I had him cornered, but how am I meant to defy a god this strong‚Ä¶ Sisyphus‚Äô mind flashes the memories of Zeus and Thanatos torturing him into his view, the pain still fresh despite it having been so long, the enjoyment he felt from them radiating through his skin. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ go‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ let them win. Come on Sisyphus‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve suffered so much already‚Ä¶ just have to push on Despite the weariness of his body, mind, and soul, Sisyphus rises back to his feet despite his stance being heavily slouched. He coughs up more blood as the boulder rolls over to Sisyphus, it now being slightly larger than the standing titan. ‚ÄòSisyphus, I would recommend taking any offer to surrender now. Orion will make sure that you‚Äôre protected if-‚Äô ‚ÄòNo Libra, I can‚Äôt. Surrendering now would be the end to defiance and rebellion, and I would basically be letting those stuck up gods win after everything they‚Äôve done. Whether I win or lose, I have to see this through to the end. And like he said, he wouldn‚Äôt want to beat an opponent that holds back, not that he‚Äôs going to win though.‚Äô ‚ÄòVery well then, I shall continue to offer my services till the very end of this fight.‚Äô ‚ÄòCome on then Libra, let‚Äôs make one grand act of defiance.‚Äô Sisyphus wraps his arm as far around the boulder as he can and throws it forward like a baseball, the giant boulder scraping along the ground as it rolls at a rapid pace towards Atlas. The titan narrowly dodges Sisyphus‚Äô throw, the rough edge of the rock less than an inch away from his chest. It keeps on rolling and slams into the far wall again and jumps up into the air from the sheer force as Atlas launches himself at Sisyphus. The boulder lands in the bowl and begins to speed back towards the defenceless human, Atlas entering into its path and having the boulder slam into his back to push him into the wall. Sisyphus runs to retrieve his boulder to keep up the offensive, having to run past where Atlas is slumped into the wall. It is only a second, but in that second the match would return to the hand of Atlas. The titan pushes himself from the wall and immediately swings a punch at Sisyphus‚Äô head. Around the titan‚Äôs fist the air seems to tremble as if he has grabbed ahold of the sky like a sheet. Despite Sisyphus knowing he can take another blow from Atlas, the king‚Äôs instincts kick in and he raises an arm to block. Atlas‚Äô fist crashes into Sisyphus‚Äô arm and to Sisyphus it felt like the entire weight of the earth slammed into him. Œó ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªœçœÑŒµœÅŒ∑ Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒøœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩŒøœç Despite the force of the punch, Sisyphus is not sent flying far and lands on the opposite side of the arena without even meeting the wall like usual. The king drops to the ground while clutching at the arm that Sisyphus‚Äô first met, the bone of his forearm snapped in half and sticking out of his flesh. ‚ÄòThere it is.‚Äô ‚ÄòMy arm‚Ä¶ my arm!‚Äô cries out Sisyphus with a blood curdling scream of pain and shock. Meanwhile on the opposite side of the arena, Atlas stands slightly slumped over, his chest heaving but his head held up to look at the downed human. Drip. From the corners of his mouth trickles a stream of crimson blood.",
