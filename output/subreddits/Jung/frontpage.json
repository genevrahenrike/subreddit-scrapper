Meanwhile, he stayed in my room the whole time, just playing video games, like he never left. Before all that, we were dating and totally in love. But when I finally came back, he was really annoyed at me for vanishing. The weird part? He was suddenly in the Olympics... racing water horses (don‚Äôt ask). And somehow, he was still living in the same village as me. I was like, 'Wait, what? We‚Äôre literally in love ‚Äî why are you acting like this?' I even tried to get him to talk to a version of me I made up, like some imaginary version, just to explain or fix things ‚Äî but he wouldn‚Äôt say anything.

The Shadow in Jung‚Äôs model is all the stuff society (or the individual) represses, denies, and projects outward: fear, guilt, shame, contradictions. In the Gospels, Jesus becomes exactly that. He‚Äôs the one who absorbs projection: ‚Äúfriend of sinners,‚Äù accused of blasphemy, scapegoated, rejected, and ultimately crucified. In that sense, Jesus isn‚Äôt just a light figure, he‚Äôs the vessel for collective shadow. He takes on what no one else wants to hold. That‚Äôs the archetypal move: to embody what others repress, so it can be transformed. For me, reframing Jesus this way doesn‚Äôt strip him of holiness, it deepens it. Holiness isn‚Äôt about avoiding shadow, it‚Äôs about carrying it, integrating it, and transmuting it.",

We can be surrounded by people and still feel like we‚Äôre dying inside. Because the connection we‚Äôre starving for isn‚Äôt with them, it‚Äôs with us . When we lose touch with our Self, it leaves this emptiness, a hollow space. And we start thinking someone else is supposed to fill it. We then seek people to fill the void. Or turn to drugs or alcohol. Or work compulsively, trying to drown out our soul‚Äôs cries. But nothing and nobody can fill this hole. The hole is you -shaped. Until we face ourselves, sit with ourselves and know ourselves, we‚Äôll keep calling it loneliness. But what we‚Äôre really missing is us. The more I integrated, the more my loneliness faded. Now I genuinely enjoy solitude and my own company because honestly, I‚Äôm a delight to be around with.

What this process looks like is listening for a voice in my head, and then likening it to a mythological character. I then try to connect the traits of that voice to that of the corresponding mythological figure, then if, for example, this mythological character is in a story, such as the Mahabharata(which it has been as of late), I can try to search for the other characters of that story. There's been splitting, merging, death, rebirth battle and even sex between characters. Honestly the line it has gone through is pretty crazy, and if anyone is willing to discuss it in private, I would be willing. But some things that are interesting is that as of late the context of the story matters. For example I have found multiple sources of procrastination and lazy and addictive behavior. I call one of the sources of addictive behavior Yudisthira, because I also often feel I am lead by my good intentions into a cycle of bad behaviors, that can end up costing me all else(I also realised that he is without blame, or with only enough bad karma to see hell for just a second even at the end because a good intention is never at fault, so while I may dislike him as a character, as a fragment of the mind, I must learn to accept those failings still). Another source of sloth I noticed is simply sloth. A great inertia within the self, which I have dubbed Kumbakarna. As one may notice, Kumbakarna is out of time here, since he is from the Treta Yuga. He's far more powerful than anything else in this era, except Krishna. But even then, battling him cannot be easy. It wasn't even easy for Rama. So I imagine that it will take the joint efforts of the Pandavas and even the Kauravas to defeat him. As for what it will look like in action? I imagine even the spoiled ego(Duryodhana) must hammer away at his leg alongside brute strength(Bhima), I imagine even pride(Karna) must fire arrows into him alongside self-mastery(Arjuna). And so on and so forth. So it does take action too. But knowing the story makes it easier for me to understand these internal states and what I should feel in this process of self mastery. The traits I associate the characters with should also give some sense of what I expect an internal \"Kurukshetra war\" to look like. I also realise the other significance of the time period this takes place in is that it precedes the death of all Kurus and the arrival of the Kali-Yuga. Which is a time of sin and shallowness etc. But also a time when the smallest amount of earnesty or devotion is enough to redeem a soul. I have noticed that things never die forever in the mind, their essential desires live on, and their energy goes somewhere else. But I have been wondering if Moksha or Nirvana, or even the liberation of the light within oneself described by Gnostics is really an allegory for the dissolution of even the fundamental desire of these internal voices. Or a return to the whole. I emphasize the importance of this, because one of my goals in this is to heal the fractured mind that is often a product of childhood trauma. Another thing is that I have had dreams relating to the changing of states, relating to the making of food, and I think it all ties back to this process. They provide epiphanies that have really guided how I approached the process. I'm just wondering, is this something similar to what Jung described as internal alchemy? I just wonder if there's more I have yet to know about the process that could make it better. I know he advocated for tuning your process to yourself, and my therapist approves of this, at least. I have also noticed that the effects of this inner world genuinely change how I think, act and feel in my day-to-day life. I just wonder if I'm missing something that clud make it better. Edit: I would also like to add that process wise, I often write letters to internal aspects of myself. Seeking understanding. I often journal to break down and figure out what is the nature of the voice, and what is its fundamental desire. I wonder what I must think or feel. For example I use what has been described as \"metta\" meditation even on internal aspects of myself. Simply reciting to them \"may you find joy, may you be at peace, may you be free\". and when it comes to battles, I try to write what they feel. I think battle has been so important, not only because they must die, dissolve and be reintegrated, but also because battle brings out the very best in a warrior I feel. There have even been times when friends fought to the death in my mind, because it was only that way that they could tease out the best aspects of each other, and have them merged. I also thought of the imagery of Ragnarok. The universe is incinerated and falls into the ocean, and out of the ocean emerges the land and its new god Baldur.",

All this was happening on a flight. Later in a dream when the plane landed i met a girl whom i know just as a gf of my friend, never met her in person, but she told me she knows me well, even though I dont know her... She smiled at me and looked happy to see me, and I felt awkward at few moments with her. Is this a message I need to stop idolozing real world girl and integrate anima?

The full weight of the realization hasn't sunk in yet. An ego death would brush away much of the confusion, and replace it with emptiness, and crucially, clarity. A clarity yet to be realized, a future on a canvas yet to be filled. If the path to individuation is meant to be like this, then so be it. But I'll remember what has come before it, and I'll not forget it. Embrace poem, but embrace symbols before poem. Embracing symbols would be embracing the unconscious.",

Why does ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù feel strongest with those who are unavailable, toxic, or manipulative? Carl Jung believed that much of what we call love is actually projection ‚Äî our unconscious throwing hidden parts of ourselves onto another person. For men, this might appear as the anima (the inner feminine); for women, the animus (the inner masculine). When we meet someone who reflects these figures, the attraction feels magnetic ‚Äî but it‚Äôs often not love, it‚Äôs our shadow demanding recognition. Modern science echoes this. Neuroscience shows that obsessive attraction lights up the same brain pathways as addiction. Attachment theory explains why people repeat cycles of chasing distant or rejecting partners. What feels like destiny is often repetition compulsion ‚Äî our psyche trying to resolve old wounds. I recently explored this idea in a video that combines Jung‚Äôs psychology, neuroscience, and real-life stories: üëâ Why You Desire the Wrong People ‚Äî Carl Jung Explains I‚Äôd love to hear what others think: Do you believe attraction is mostly unconscious projection? Have you noticed patterns where you keep falling for the ‚Äúsame type‚Äù? Can awareness alone break the cycle, or does it take deeper work?",

I don't expect to part waters but i do look for meaningful synchronicity between my psyche and experiences. This is dangerous though because i have a habit of constructing narratives that always revolve around me even if those narratives try to seem selfless. Sometimes i have believed my life mission was to understand evil so i could heal this world and become whole. I do believe I am the universe. All life is the universe witnessing itself, but as of this moment I am only experiencing this vesel. Soemtimes I think my shadow then is everything that I dont identity as me. So by learning of what makes me uncomfortable or scared I am really re-familiarizing the parts of the universe that have become estranged to me. Ultimately i see the end of my life as becoming entirely one with everything, integrating all of relity into my being. I try to do this through art because art is transforming the external/ other/ materials of earth into something that resembles my inner mind. it feels it is never enough tho. I still feel the infinite gaps between me and everthing else and I can't stand it. I can paint a canvas with a chunk of the earh but i cant paint all of reality with itself. I know its all delusional and impossible. You cant just absord all of the void in your one lifetime. But it feels nessesary for me to try for soem reason. I know its serious main character syndrome vibes but i cant imagine doing anything else in my lifetime but that.",

The ritual is a profound reminder of the importance of embodied, experiential wisdom‚Äîsomething that feels increasingly absent in our hyper-intellectual, digitally-saturated culture. In the newsletter, I reflect on what it means to ‚Äúbecome‚Äù in both literal and metaphorical senses: the liminal space between who we were and who we are growing into, and how rituals‚Äîfasting, guidance from elders, intentional acts‚Äîanchor that transition. It‚Äôs not meant as a guide or how-to, but more as an invitation to consider: where have our modern rites gone, and what might we reclaim from older ways of knowing? If this resonates, you can read the full piece here: https://waterwaysproject.substack.com/p/rites-and-rituals I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts from anyone who has experienced a rite of passage, or who has thought about the interplay of intellect, experience, and transformation in your own life.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone. I've been going through some things in my life and realise I carry a lot of weight from unresolved issues. I came across Jung a few years ago with \"Man and His Symbols.\"...and realised I have a lot of work to do, but ignored it and went on with my life. A break up between that time and now has revealed much about my inner self that is terrifying, and difficult to face, but is necessary  to address. I would like to start the process, and confront my subconscious, but I don't know how to begin. I want \"true freedom\", at whatever cost. I want to be whole as an individual. I don't want to not feel confused, angry, resentful, but I want to able to understand why I feel this way, and live a more fulfilling life. I'm a visual artist, (painter) so I'm aware I have a very important tool at my disposal, but I'm writing this to request some direction from anyone with more experience in this process. Where do I begin? What actionable steps may I take to prepare, and go through with it? What resources may I look at? (Literature, video, audio etc.) What warnings, or counsel would be important to heed? Also, while I know I must carry the weight, it could be really good to have an accountability partner, someone I can talk to about my experience, and share anything I find. (Anyone up for it, and capable, DM!) Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I‚Äôve been thinking about life, music, games, and everything in between, and it just hit me ‚Äî there‚Äôs no script. None. You grow up imagining moments like movies, like games with a soundtrack timed perfectly to epic scenes, and then you realize: the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù way to experience life doesn‚Äôt exist. You can take your favorite game soundtrack, your favorite song, your favorite scene, and you can walk down a street in Thailand with it, you can hike alone with it, you can sit at home with it ‚Äî and it changes nothing. No one else knows what you feel. No one else even cares. It‚Äôs just yours. And that‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôve noticed it in everything I do. I lift weights because of old obsessions with video games like Duke Nukem, I obsess over guitar videos and TikToks to release emotions tied to crushes or memories, and I realize that even if I go viral, no one will see the depth of what I‚Äôm trying to express. They won‚Äôt see it like I do, and honestly, most people won‚Äôt care. All those little projects, passions, dreams ‚Äî they‚Äôre ephemeral, unnoticed, but to me, they matter deeply. And it‚Äôs scary because it makes you see how fragile and subjective life is. Even more mind-blowing is the freedom in it. Life doesn‚Äôt hand you a role. You could be dominant, submissive, nerdy, athletic, musical ‚Äî anything ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù version of yourself. You can be in China one day, in Vegas the next, your crush might forget you, and it won‚Äôt matter. There‚Äôs no cosmic script, no audience marking your highs and lows, and no soundtrack that makes you the main character. The main character is a construct we invent for ourselves. In reality, it‚Äôs all fluid, all fleeting, and all yours alone. What‚Äôs terrifying is that I‚Äôm 20, still a virgin, haven‚Äôt had a job, no girlfriend, no ‚Äúbig moments‚Äù society expects, and yet this awareness hits harder than anything. Most people never even realize the depth of these thoughts; they live in their patterns, maybe assuming there‚Äôs a script, a destiny, or a role. But when you see it ‚Äî truly see it ‚Äî the pressure flips. There‚Äôs nothing to chase but what you choose to chase for yourself. You‚Äôre free, but there‚Äôs no map, no guide, no guarantee that what you do will even matter outside your head. And yet, despite the fear, there‚Äôs something almost euphoric about it. Everything that ever inspired me ‚Äî music, video games, art, fantasy, stories, crushes, obsessions ‚Äî all of it exists in a private space that only I can experience fully. That‚Äôs where meaning comes from: inhabiting your own awareness fully, even when the world doesn‚Äôt validate it. It‚Äôs lonely, it‚Äôs wild, and it‚Äôs beautiful. No one else will truly understand it, but maybe that‚Äôs exactly what makes it real. I wonder how rare this kind of deep awareness really is. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs common ‚Äî maybe a scattered minority around the world ever reach this level of thought, the kind that blends music, games, obsession, and the constant awareness of life‚Äôs fluidity. Most people probably never experience it, or if they do, it‚Äôs later in life ‚Äî 40s, 50s maybe. For someone at 20, it feels almost unnatural, like a combination of isolation, life events, and the way my mind works. And the truth is, there‚Äôs nothing you can really do with it. You can‚Äôt fully share it with anyone, because they won‚Äôt understand, and posting it online or making videos won‚Äôt help much ‚Äî you‚Äôd just be another creator among millions, and even if you got attention, no one could see it like you do. It‚Äôs a lonely kind of clarity, but it‚Äôs also a profound, personal discovery ‚Äî one that only you can inhabit. Is that rare or is that just another stage of life for everyone?",

      "content_preview": "A few days ago, before sleep but while I was still awake, I saw a vision: a tall, aging man, around 65‚Äì75 years old, dressed like a hippie from the 70s‚Äì80s. I was born in 1979, which I find interesting. He had gray, wavy hair that fell below his ears to the middle of his neck, slightly messy. His posture and attitude were surprisingly like that of a teenager. His eyes were elongated ovals, shaped like those of a sad dog‚Ä¶ you know, when the oval is vertical, with the curve both above and below. Inside, his pupils and eyes were enormous and childlike, like a confused, puzzled, undeservedly hurt, and very sad infant or a puppy. There was a sense of astonishment, as if he were saying, ‚ÄúOh, why is this happening? Why do they treat me like this?‚Äù His eyes were wet and glistening, giving a super sweet but tragic expression. He seemed utterly surprised by how he was being treated: confused, puzzled, and his eyes were as if filled with tears, but no tears could flow out. Can you please help me analyze the meaning? I would love to hear from a Jungian perspective: what might my subconscious mind be trying to tell me through this vision? Thank you so much üôèüèªüôåüèª",

      "content_preview": "My earliest memories of experiencing the flow state date back to when I was about 8 years old. As a family, we used to attend a Baptist church every Sunday morning. I remember being mesmerized by the music, specifically the lower frequencies. I felt the vibrations so strongly in my body that at times it felt as if I were levitating. I remember asking my mother what that was, but since she knew nothing about musical instruments, I only learned what a bass was years later. These early experiences had a profound impact on me and instilled the desire to pursue music later in life. But a lot happened before I started studying music. These experiences were stored in the background of my mind, mainly due to a sense of isolation and depression. At the time, I found comfort in food and video games. I probably spent at least 6 hrs per day playing and constantly snacking, so I guess it's no surprise I used to pack an extra 25 kgs. The reason I bring this up is that Flow has a dark side. Now is a good time to explain that Flow is a modern term for what William James called religious experiences, Carl Jung called numinous experiences, and Abraham Maslow called peak experiences. Different names for the same phenomenon. Simply put, Jung explains that numinous experiences arise directly from the unconscious, rapturing the individual, who is always its victim rather than its creator. These experiences have a compulsive nature and cause a peculiar alteration in consciousness. The problem is that the unconscious is immoral, which means we can experience Flow with beautiful things like arts, music, and creative endeavors, or be held hostage by our addictions. That's why overcoming them requires such a deep understanding. Carl Jung explains that the psyche has a religious function, which means that whether you're conscious or not, everyone has a governing principle in their lives. In psychological terms, ‚Äúgod‚Äù is this organizing idea that shapes someone's fate. This ‚Äúgod‚Äù can, of course be tied to religion, but when someone lacks meaning it's usually because their ‚Äúgod‚Äù took the perverted form of an addiction such as workaholism and the greed for money, food, sex, substances, gambling, shopping‚Ä¶ or the video games that took a great chunk of my life. That's why overcoming an addiction involves finding a deeper sense of meaning and altering the governing principle of your life. Something the Puer Aeternus often struggle with. Here's how one can do that. How To Produce Your Own Drugs Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the godfather of Flow, discovered that the people who had high scores in overall well-being and life satisfaction were also the ones who experienced the most flow. But there's a caveat: we're not referring to passive forms of flow like drinking or eating, but active forms that require skill building like running, lifting weights, public speaking, programming, or creative endeavors. That's why, if you're subject to an addiction, the first step that must happen is to look for active forms of flow, as passive forms of flow are not only inferior in their quality, but as we've seen, frequently lead to addictions. What helped me the most when beating my compulsion for food was joining the gym and starting to experience Flow through intense physical exercise and learning to play drums. I experienced a deep psychological shift and finally started liking myself. I felt strong, built discipline, dropped 25kg, and learned that I could have objectives and achieve them. Playing drums also taught me about perseverance, but most importantly, developing a craft and being involved with music brought meaning to my life. But there's a deeper reason why Flow matters so much when dealing with an addiction. Essentially, experiencing Flow floods your system with feel-good chemicals, and you can basically produce your own ‚Äúdrugs‚Äù in endogenous form: Dopamine can be compared to cocaine and amphetamines. It gives intense energy, focus, excitement, motivation, and enhances pattern recognition in the brain. Norepinephrine can be compared to Adderall and stimulants. It improves alertness, reaction speed, and a heightened sense of awareness. Anandamide is called the bliss molecule, and it binds to the same receptors as THC. It reduces fear, produces calmness, and enhances creativity. Endorphins are natural opioids, much more potent than morphine. It creates feelings of euphoria and the blissful quality of Flow. Serotonin is compared to MDMA. This chemical is produced post-flow and gives you a sense of contentment and a deep satisfaction. Can you imagine producing all of this stack at will without the aid of any substances and any of the downsides? I know it sounds crazy, but it's all real. Moreover, you feel more capable, and you're not subject to cheap pleasures anymore, as this is all earned. You can change the self-defeating narratives, regain control, and experience a new version of yourself. The Need For Mastery The second great shift that must happen to find meaning is to use the skills you develop during Flow to be in the service of something greater than yourself. That's how you can experience purpose, but to do so, you must not only transcend narcissistic desires but also exercise your moral capacities. Here's what I mean: a lot of people continue to engage in self-destructing and morally questionable pursuits because they're good at it. This reminds me of Walter White from Breaking Bad. At the end of the show, he confesses to his wife Skyler, why he persisted and put everyone in danger, and he says, ‚ÄúI did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really‚Ä¶ I was alive.‚Äù The need for mastery is ingrained in our psyches, but our conscious mind must direct the process; otherwise, well‚Ä¶ we might apply our skills to become crime lords and produce blue meth. In summary, to overcome an addiction, we can start by pursuing active forms of Flow through developing a craft, intense physical activity, or creativity... You name it. Then, to find purpose, we must put our skills in the service of the greater good.
