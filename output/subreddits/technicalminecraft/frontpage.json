I always wanted to build a piston bolt, and this seems like the perfect opportunity. I've tried looking for piston bolt guides on youtube, but a lot of them are several years old. And the new ones I've found are bedrock only. I saw a bedrock design that was \"track-less\" and looked pretty sleek, do those exist on java? A few other criteria: I'm aware some of the faster piston bolts require aligning certain components of the bolt so that they don't hit the chunk borders. For the first piston bolt I build, I'd personally prefer NOT to mess with such mechanics, even if it means I'm not using the latest, next-gen bolt design. I'm also aware that a rudimentary bolt design puts you at about 20bps. I'd prefer if I could get at least 30bps. Lastly, I'm hoping for a two-way system to alleviate the build time. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks!",

Zombified piglins (ZP) just killed the iron Golem, and falling down didn't drop any XP. After a little research, I find out that a major change to ZP mechanic was made in 1.21.5. basically if a ZP is called out by other, but wasn't hit by you, it won't drop any ingots nor XP, if wasn't killed by player. This new change basically makes half of the ZP XP farms useless I ended up just making falling tube one block shorter so they don't die by Fall damage, and just kill them by hand. Isma x this from much more inefficient, and not AFK-able. And I've got a question. Taking into account this new change, can you still possibly make an AFK gold/XP farm on the current latest version of Minecraft Java edition? If you have any suggestions or designs for better XP or gold farms I would really appreciate your help.",

I have not really messed around with larger-scale farms until recently, and I need larger farms to not only supply materials for other large farms, but also builds and for other players in the server since I share my farm outputs with my friends on the Realm. Most of my farms already use at least a stack of Observers, so I don't really want to spend hours upsizing farms if I don't have to, so I started looking into chunk loaders so I can AFK my farms. So after looking into chunk loaders, I found out about Lazy chunks, but I cannot find a straightforward list of what can and cannot happen in a lazy chunk. I can assume that hopper systems work fine in lazy chunks as far as I know but what about other things? Do Iron Golem Farms still work?, Do farms that use bubble elevators work? Do auto crafter setups still work? Do  Villager Breeders still work? Do Villager auto crop farms still work? Do Piglin bartering farms still work?
