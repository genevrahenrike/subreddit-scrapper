Either way, I am excited for The Flip Off season 2. I found season 1 pretty entertaining, even the drama. But with this 2nd season I wonder if Christina is gonna let her new beaux join in. I would hope for her sake she doesn’t since clearly mixing business with pleasure hasn’t worked out for her in the past 😅anyway I think it’s pretty funny how Tarek and Christina started off doing a show together, split up and did their own shows, now back to doing one show.

I remember lazy sundays watching marathons of House Hunters and Property Virgins and just loving it all, trying to guess what theyd pick, etc. The years go by and we enjoy property brothers and what not. Then one day i start looking for behind the scenes info on these shows...........and find that they're all fake. The people on House Hunters have already bought and moved in to the house and are touring their own house and the homes of friends/family.  All of their \"wants\" are made up and all the \"arguments\" and \"disagreements\" are staged by the production staff, who feeds them lines.  Nothing authentic about it. Maybe its just nostalgia but I wish sometimes i could sit down and enjoy an episode of house hunters like i used to, before I knew what I know, when everything was innocent.  But ill never be able to.",

      "content_preview": "Is it just me or is Jake horrendous to watch? He's constantly putting Emily down and these jabs at her 'annoying habits' like using counter space and acting like she can't understand is painful. The \"I was surprised at how easily I was convinced\" line just underlies the weird dynamic of their relationship - no one was surprised that she would go with his choice. Annoying quotes \"the last time Emily and I agreed was 3 years ago\", \"no house will ever be the perfect house\", \"oh,  I know\" (in reference to her not being helpful), \"why didn't you eat anything before we left... just take something to go\", \"or we can learn to use the drawers\", etc. He's just giving insecure and found a girl that is willing to prop up his ego. She's gorgeous and patient and I hope he shows her the appreciation she deserves in the future. She'll most likely grow tired of the constant combative and superior nature.  I hope he learns to live and let live before that - they just 'bought' a house together. P.S. I understand that much of this show is staged but i truly believe that is his personality. Even if it isn't, it's a good case study on poor relationships of people in their early 20s.",

(Note, time stamp is from broadcast TV not streaming so includes commercial breaks).  The scene playing is an aerial view panning around the corner of a white brick building with a gentleman sitting on a balcony playing a guitar, then a group of people doing yoga and then another aerial view panning back of a small town downtown intersection. The lyrics are \"the sky is falling, when im lost at night there is a new day dawning\".  I did an internet lyric search and did not find anything. Thanks in advance… UPDATE: song is “Tide is Turning” by Julian Emery Another great song from this episode is “World in our hands” by Paddy Conn",

Reading through the Deadline article posted a few days ago about HGTV, and reading a Wikipedia page on Oprah Winfrey Network origins and struggles when it first debuted, plus the trend of viewers “cutting the cord,” it made me wonder: Why in the world did someone think that rebranding a new home Reno channel (Magnolia) was a good idea with so many viewers leaving traditional TV? There’s already soooooo many options to watch that type of content… free apps and paid channels have that type of content. Has Magnolia been “successful”at all? I tried to get into magnolia when it first debuted, and for a little while after. The content to me was just a little too… pretentious? Idk how to describe it. I found some things to be a bit boring and sleepy. There was stuff I liked. Most of what I saw was couple with 12 kids buys property that should be condemned, then they skip in a field of daisies with a sepia undertone, and immediately after came a rerun of beachfront bargain hunt from ten years ago. Where are all the new Magnolia shows? I’m just surprised that in the recent television landscape, when viewers are ditching TV, they decided to plow forward with an antiquated model, rerun programming, and some fixer upper shows. I liked fixer upper and their spin offs, but seems like Thats not enough of a viable intellectual property to carry an entire network.",
