As for why I don't call it \"mana\", the word feels a bit too videogame-y for my liking, and in my mind, has a distinct blue color association, while the magic in my [Eldara] project, for example, has personal colors. Furthermore, building on the videogame-y feeling I have for \"mana\", it feels too quantifyable, while I like to keep it vague, only comparable between two magic users or artifacts. This type of comparison sometimes leads to rock/paper/scissor-type scenarios where the different nature of magic across three magic users can make it appear as though each one of them is stronger than one while weaker than another.",

      "content_preview": "Hello, hello, and welcome to my post. Like the title says: What are some overlooked advantages or underutilized abilities that a Lich would or should normally have? And not just the big stuff, but the smaller abilities or qualities that a Lich would technically have in general by virtue of being a Lich. I’m working on my own fantasy series starring a calm, collected, civil, and calculating human Lich as the protagonist. But while I’m trying to flesh out the character, it got me thinking about what advantages that being a Lich would bring. The most obvious being that he’s immune to fatigue and doesn’t need to rest, eat, sleep, or get sick. But then I realized that means he can work day and night without suffering mental or physical exhaustion. And since his mind’s intelligence and knowledge is no longer restrained by the limits of his physical brain, he might have perfect memory and is capable of learning, processing, and storing information beyond a typical human’s capacity. Which would make a Lich like him able to truly learn and remember a library’s worth of knowledge. At least, that’s what I came up with so far. But what do you think? Please share your thoughts on this, and have a good day.",

To counter this martial artists can channel their limited Mana into specfic parts of their body which act sort of like critical hits that make attacks far more powerful and can pierce magic coating. More skilled fighters can control it consiously and use it consistently whilst less skilled only do it occasionlly on instinct",

This magic system has some rpg-style mechanics. They have spell slots based on the number of electrons their element usually has, for example. They cast spells rather than having powers. My issue is naming different aspects of the system. Most of the words I'm using have too many syllables, but shorter words don't give the sciencey vibe I'm looking for. What I have so far: Ions - spell slots (pretty good) Transmutations - spells (too long) Elementalists - untrained magic users (too long) Adepts - trained magic users (not bad) People will also be called by their element and title, i.e oxygen adept, gold elementalist. But it gets unwieldy with something like molybdenum elementalist. Lots of names are too long or difficult to pronounce. Suggestions welcome",

      "content_preview": "Biological Fundamentals of Magic · Nature of Magic: Magic is a flow of energy that courses through the bodies of living beings. It is produced in specialized organs from the nutrients in food and serves a vital support role, enhancing the speed of recovery in critical moments. · Transport System: Magical energy flows through the body via \"runinas\" (similar to veins) and is controlled by small organs called \"runirios\", scattered throughout the body. Each runirio controls three runinas. · Central Core (Caldeno): An organ located above the kidneys (usually two) whose function is to produce magic from nutrition and pump it to the rest of the system. · Standardization and Variation: The location of these organs is standard within a species, though diseases or malformations can alter their position. · Risks: · Runirrhagia: If a runina is damaged, magic is released into the body. Mild cases cause weakness and burning; severe cases cause internal burns or necrosis. · Magical Transfusion: Only possible between individuals with identical flows. Attempting a transfusion with a different flow is like a blood rejection, with fatal results. This causes Manepia, an illness that temporarily alters the flow, prevents spellcasting, and causes nausea. · Magical Depletion: Using all magic is fatal, weakening the person with symptoms similar to severe anemia. 2. Types of Magical Flows Magic is not the same in all beings. The flow type is determined genetically and by development in childhood. Primary Flows: · Fluid: Energy rapidly increases its speed to maximize spell range but reduces its potency at a distance and hinders accumulation techniques. Users are weak in close combat. · Concentrated: Energy accumulates in specific areas to substantially increase power but reduces maximum range. Ideal for body enhancement, close combat, and short-range support. · Aural: The flow is constant and generates natural small leaks that form a magical aura. It is the only flow that can naturally summon spirits and facilitates imbuing objects with magic. Less Common Flows: · Dense: A slower flow with thicker runinas, allowing for much more magic storage. Can only use slow magic, hindering quick reactions. · Physical: Magic is deposited in the muscles, making them stronger. Prevents the use of spells requiring large amounts of energy; specializes in physical enhancement and healing. Common in the Palkem race. · Erratic (Dispar): A dangerous malformation where runirios poorly control the flow. Energy accumulates violently and unevenly in body parts, potentially damaging runinas and tissues. Not necessarily hereditary, but increases the probability. 3. Hybrid Flows The result of the genetic union of two base flows. They occur when a child inherits a functional intermediate between their parents' flows. · Hybrids of Fluid Flow: · Propelled (Fluid + Concentrated): Intermediate power and range. Fast flow that concentrates on a point. · Gaseous (Fluid + Aural): Increases aura leaks, allowing invocations at greater distance and creating portals, but consumes 70% more energy. · Frozen (Fluid + Dense): Slow, abundant energy that gradually accelerates. Double the potency and greater range than Fluid, sacrificing speed. · Rapid (Fluid + Physical): Reduces range by 80% but uses magic to increase muscle speed and flexibility, allowing unique movements. · Hybrids of Physical Flow: · Rapid (Physical + Fluid): (Mentioned above). · Enhanced (Physical + Concentrated): Specialist in muscle enhancement. Superhuman strength and very short-range but powerful spells. · Personal (Physical + Aural): Reduces the aura but makes it easier to invoke spirit power for one's own body, with lower energy consumption. · Heavy (Physical + Dense): Magic inflates the muscles over time, creating colossi of impressive strength and regeneration, but they are slow, heavy, and their techniques are very delayed. The transformation is gradual from childhood. They require much more food and are often feared and socially isolated. · Hybrids of Concentrated Flow: · Propelled (Concentrated + Fluid): (Mentioned above). · Enhanced (Concentrated + Physical): (Mentioned above). · Load-Bearing (Concentrated + Dense): Accumulates energy massively and slowly. Spells are stronger, longer-lasting, and dissipate slowly. · Condensed (Concentrated + Aural): The aura increases at specific points of accumulation. Increases the area of effect of spells (useful for explosions) and facilitates multiple spirit invocations with less energy expenditure. · Hybrids of Dense Flow: · Frozen (Dense + Fluid): (Mentioned above). · Heavy (Dense + Physical): (Mentioned above). · Load-Bearing (Dense + Concentrated): (Mentioned above). · Storm (Dense + Aural): Generates a small but potent aura that grows uncontrollably during casting, allowing for the strongest invocations after a difficult transition period. · Hybrids of Aural Flow: · Gaseous (Aural + Fluid): (Mentioned above). · Personal (Aural + Physical): (Mentioned above). · Condensed (Aural + Concentrated): (Mentioned above). · Storm (Aural + Dense): (Mentioned above). Note: The Erratic (Dispar) flow, being a malformation, does not form hybrids. 4. Factors Affecting Magic · Age: The caldeno weakens with age, producing less magic that flows slower. The elderly need medical check-ups to avoid complications from accumulation. · Diet and Nutrition: A good diet is crucial. Predator meat and fungi are especially rich in magic. Famine severely limits magical potential. · Emotions and Mental State: · Panic/Rage: Increase power and consumption. · Depression: Reduces flow speed. · Chronic Stress: Reduces caldeno production. · \"Flow State\": Accelerates flow and its efficiency. · Euphoria: Increases production. · Environment (Ambient Magic): Areas with abundant life (jungles) have an intense magical flow. Sterile places (deserts) weaken it. Events like storms can enhance flows. · Magical Doping: Substances like Holida powder enhance the caldeno but stress the runinas, cause dependency, and are prohibite 5. Evolution and Origin · Biological Origin: In the earliest periods, beings obtained additional energy from the stars. Through evolution, magical organs specialized through accumulated mutations, forming the different flows. · Analogous Evolution: The caldeno is an analogous organ that evolved in different species: mammals (caldeno), fish (highly specialized swim bladders), plants (analogous in roots and leaves for photosynthesis), Fungi (absorb magic from corpses and soil). 6. Magic in Society · Labor Discrimination: Some contractors prefer certain flows for specific jobs (Physical for construction, Fluid for deliveries and precision). · Sports: There is no regulatory distinction, but there is a practical internal distinction (e.g., a Fluid flow athlete will be preferred over a Concentrated flow one in ranged spell sports). · Social Prejudice: There is some prejudice against unions between different flows due to the risk of producing Erratic flows. Some clans or nobles are obsessed with the purity of their flow. Carriers of rare flows like Aural are highly valued. Carriers of the Heavy flow are often feared and isolated. · Education: There are educational institutions, dojos, and training centers that teach the correct use of magic, its history, and the application of each flow. 7. Magical Medicine · Treatments: · Willow leaves to regenerate tissue damaged by magic. · Fish skin to heal burns. · Caldeno transplants (very complex and expensive operations). · Artificial runirios (expensive and risky operations, sometimes performed on babies with Erratic flow to regulate it). · Role of the Erratic Flow: Ironically, their ability to accumulate energy in a reduced point makes them useful for transfusions and tissue repair, though social distrust limits their medical practice. · Magical Atrophy: Can occur from lack of use (stagnates and weakens magic) or from overuse (chronic depletion). 8. Magical Techniques Supreme Techniques (Peak expression of each flow) · Fluid: God Piercer: Accelerates flow by 300% and releases a magic arrow that pierces any defense. Roar of a Thousand Waterfalls (Suicidal): Sacrifices all water, blood, and magic in the body to release an annihilating wave of power. · Concentrated: Fist of Devastation: Stagnates energy in the body to concentrate it in the fists; each punch is devastating. Sun's Prison (Suicidal): Concentrates all energy into a sphere that generates a massive explosion. · Aural: War Dance: Imbues 6 weapons that orbit the user, providing perfect attack and defense. Call to Cataclysm (Suicidal): Sacrifices all its energy to summon a spirit up to 8 times more powerful. · Physical: Celestial Regeneration: Spends enormous amounts of magic for ultra-fast tissue regeneration. Judgmental Fist (Sacrificial): Burns all lifetime magic and destroys the runinas to multiply strength, speed, and resistance tenfold for a few minutes, after which the user is left magicless. · Dense: Stalker's Spear: Forms a spear that attacks from the enemy's shadows. Timeless Condemnation (Sacrificial): Sacrifices all magic and half its life to create an area of eternal paralysis. · Erratic (Dispar): Finger of Destruction: Accumulates power in a finger for a devastating explosion on contact (the finger is destroyed). Supernova (Suicidal): Total annihilation via a giant explosion that completely destroys the user. Utility Techniques (Smaller scale) · Fluid: Hypersonic Dart (high-speed air current). · Concentrated: Piercing Point (concentrates energy on a finger to pierce steel). · Aural: Guided Bullet (imbues a bullet to control its trajectory). · Dense: Echosigil (50m² pulse that detects magical entities). · Physical: Sonic Impact (punch that nearly breaks the sound barrier). · Erratic (Dispar): Touch of Life (medical technique for precise and efficient healing). 9. Technology and Communication · Vehicles: Magic-powered, non-polluting but expensive and slow. · Prosthetics: Mimic runinas for easier magical control, but are expensive and require personalized surgery. · Encapsulated Magic: Like insulin for diabetics, for people with magical deficiency. · Communication: · Traveling Stone (Falling out of use): A summoner swaps places between a stone and a leaf with a message. · Magic Plates: New technology. Magically charged metal plates that receive messages. Distance and the plane of existence (physical/spiritual) affect arrival speed and require daily charging. 10. Dangers and Taboos · Ephirus: Exiled spirits that control corpses and are immortal. Feared for their \"Forced Transformation\" technique, which destroys the victim's soul and turns them into their slave. Aural flow users are especially susceptible to being attracted and used by them. · Necromancy: A heavily frowned upon taboo. Can bring empty souls, souls that don't want to be revived, or cause bodies to rot from within by bringing corruption into the real world. Used as a biological weapon. · Shard Weapons: Fragile weapons that damage the enemy's soul, causing irreparable damage even if the body is healed. · Fungal Wastes: Places full of corpses where decomposed magic impregnates the soil. A paradise for fungi and the conscious Fungord species, avoided due to their bad reputation. 11. Cycle of Magic · In Death: When a being dies, scavengers and fungi benefit from its magic. If the body is not decomposed, the magic impregnates the soil, supporting plant growth. · Ambient Magic: The universe is imbued with magic, a residue of creation. Stars generate magic, which is why plants can produce it through photosynthesis. 12. Magical Crime Investigation Forensic investigation is based on: · Magical burns on the victim. · Damage from specific spells. · Magical Marks: Each flow leaves a distinct trace in its spells: · Fluid: Wavy and smooth marks. · Concentrated: Rough and coarse marks. · Dense: Intense and very distinctive marks. · Aural: Leaves no marks. · Physical: Marks from physical blows (not projected spells).",

That kind of led me down the path of thinking just how world-changing being able to just conjure water would be. In my own Magic systems I often include a line about how conjured water doesn’t actually pack nutritional value, you can drink it to get the sense of being full but it doesn’t actually do much in terms of proper hydration. Fool’s Water, essentially But a mage being able to just conjure clean, drinkable water means securing a pretty key resource in times of need. Farmers won’t have much issues, desert-based civilizations won’t need any sort of water trade etc etc Really makes you think how even the smallest forms of magic can heavily influence a culture.",

      "content_preview": "Beneath Lake Ghir lies a colossal ice shard that holds memories of the past, freezing every moment in time. This spire is more than a record. Its presence is a safeguard to existence itself. If the ice melts, the memories it holds would vanish, and with them, the past. And without a past, the future can't exist. The ice has begun to weaken. Echoes from forgotten times seep into the water, manifesting as voices, illusions, and dreams. Those who drown in the lake become part of it. Once the chilling waters breach their lungs, they are claimed by the ice. They live on, unable to die, bound to the water. If they attempt to leave, their bodies melt, erasing the memories of them from the world. Only their past, frozen in the spire, remains. The drowned develop what is called a salt eye in their lungs. It is a slush of ice and water that consumes their old memories and feeds them to the spire. And acts as an eye the spire can see through. However, with this connection to the spire, one can also reach into the realm of memory and change reality to be more favorable. Maybe by tying timelines together momentarily. Or fogging the memories of the past. The bigger the salt eye grows, the more powerful the magic user. One can only affect very recent events. Most can only reach back a few moments. One can really only affect themselves. Though if they touch something, they can cause ice from their salt eye to grow on it, allowing them to manipulate it as well. (I want to introduce some sort of paradox consequences, but I haven't really figured that part out yet.) The salt eye grows with usage of magic. But as the salt eye grows, it will puncture the body and grow around organs, muscles, or bones. Eventually, it will be so painful, or the ice freezes so many parts of the body, and movement becomes impossible. Everyone who lives in the lake knows that one day, they either melt away or become paralyzed by their salt eye.",

      "content_preview": "In my world, magic is called Tephamancy, and it isn’t a gift so much as a curse. It comes from a mythic conflict between two primordial brothers: Cineris, who embodied ash and rebirth, and Phlogis, who embodied flame and endless hunger. When Cineris sacrificed himself to bind Phlogis in the Ash Veil, fragments of his essence bled into humanity. Those touched became the first Tephamancers. But Phlogis, enraged by betrayal, cursed them with the Whispers—insidious voices that gnaw at their sanity, promising power or dredging up their darkest doubts. Tephamancers manipulate ash as their medium. With training, they can harden it into constructs, weave it into weapons, or shield themselves in battle. But every act comes at a cost. At first it’s simple exhaustion, but push too far and the body starts to bleed, then burn, until the caster risks destroying themselves from the inside out. Worse still, when a Tephamancer finally gives in to the whispers, their essence collapses and they become an Ash Husk—a hollow, feral creature animated by despair and Phlogis’s malice. Very rarely, a Tephamancer is born closer to Cineris’s essence. These rare prodigies are known as Ashbourne. They can conjure ash without an external source, ignite it into flame, and even cauterize wounds. But what makes them exceptional also makes them cursed. Ashbourne are far more vulnerable to the whispers, and when they fall they don’t become Husks. They become Kindled—vessels for fragments of Phlogis himself, monstrous avatars of his hunger that are infinitely more dangerous. Because of this, the world both needs and fears Tephamancers. Most are pressed into military service, but the Ashbourne are hunted relentlessly by an elite order called the Grey Cloaks, who see them as ticking time bombs. Cloaked in authority and zealotry, these inquisitors are both protectors and executioners, carrying weapons designed to disrupt Ashbourne control and erase them before they can ignite into Kindled. To the common folk, they are bogeymen; to Tephamancers, a necessary terror. To the Ashbourne, they are the end of hope.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I've been toying with this magic system for a while now. Everyone in this world has \"magic\" powers, or are at least born with the potential for it. There are 3 broad categories (all names tentative atm) Artists: Basically all your magic item creators and alluring singers, etc. They do magic through an art medium but can't do magic until they've had an amount of proficiency honing their craft the ordinary, nonmagical way. After that, passion deepens their power, and skill and experience allow them to do magic the way they intend. Some can be very fearsome, being able to shape cloth with only their fingers, or so average their hand hemmed handkerchief shrank by accident. 2. Thaumaturges: They can alter the environment in some way. Healers and element manipulators are usually Thaumaturges. Born able to do magic at once, but unequally. Some can freeze lakes with a wave, while even more can only cool their tea. Their strength never grows beyond what they’re born with. 3. Mutants (suggestions for this name would be nice, I dislike it but need a placeholder) Anybody who is born with an alteration or an ability to alter themselves falls under this category. Run the gamut from super strength to shape-shifting to mind reading to as ridiculously specific as \"your magic powers increase the more secrets you keep\". They can't grow their strength the way Artists can, but they are born with an equal adequate base ability, unlike Thaumaturges. Magic is clan-based, and can be broad or ridiculously specific, depending on the clan, ie filigree Artist clans can only do magic through filigree, alchemist Thaumaturge clans can only transmute elements, echinoderm Mutant clans can only turn into echinoderms and show its related traits. Marriage and inheritance is a big deal. People always have two powers, often with a preference for using one. They can inherit either one of their father's two powers, and either one of their mother's two. (That's how the aforementioned secrets boosting powers work—it's inherited from one parent and boosts the gift from the other.) If your parents' four powers include one of each of the 3 categories, you are equally likely to inherit any of them in theory, as long as one's from the mom, one from the dad, but in practice, people claim that Artist inheritance has the highest likelihood, followed by Mutants, and Thaumaturges are last. It's not a very big difference though. There are overarching limitations like no bringing back from the dead, time travel, fortunetelling or spellcasting, but smaller limitations vary from clan to clan. I often make my characters' inherited power match their surname as a form of shorthand, but I'd like to figure out a way to make inheritance feel more random without losing my mind. This system's still a work in progress, so feedback is appreciated!",

(“Gods”) The first life form that were created have mana according to the god that created them. The people created by the goddess of wind possesses wind typed mana, for example. Now, “elemental mana” means the density of mana. Mana gas various densities. When compressed together, they create the Everglow Crystal, a crystal useful for enhancing mana. The higher the mana density is, the harder it can hold onto things An earth-types mana user may find it hard to manipulate water as it is too “soft”. (Though with practice, you can eventually do it) The mana of highest density is dark mana And the lightest density is light mana Frankly, elemental magic can’t really fight each other. Water will get vaporise by fire, but water will also kill the fire. A hard wall may block someone’s attacks, but with enough strength, it will break There’s only one mana that overpowers all types of mana Dark mana. with enough mana, you consumes and absorbs all. Just like black that absorbs all light, blackholes that sucks everything in and nothing can come out. Yeh idk if this makes sense-",

      "content_preview": "my whole worldbuilding process actually started with my magic system. (Science-Fantasy with magic system that it is more and more explored/explained via physics but has the magical and cultural core) At work I deal a lot with radiation (mostly linear accelerators and CT), and that inspired me to create something based on real physics (with a few necessary fantasy elements. (im not an expert of physics but i got some basic knowledge) The first spark came back in school, when we had the topic: gamma rays and how they develop The “m-state” of an atom means metastable = an atom with more energy in its nucleus than it should normally have. Metastable atoms can stay in that state for so long that, compared to a normal lifespan, it feels almost endless. When they finally become stable, they release the excess energy in different forms – including gamma rays. From that I created an element called „Szintigraphit“ (from scintigraphy in nuclear medicine) together with a schoolmate(shoutout to Röntgang). It exists in most of the living world (except Aetharii) the concentration is random and some species have an higher amount of Szintigraphit Atoms in their body (if they can and when they can, how they can use the abilities depends on the user —> amount of Szintigraphit, talent, experience, training, …) •\tIt is metastable (practically endless in duration). •\tIt can resonate with other stintigraphit atoms to manipulate them (via specific Runes also other elements can be manipulated via resonance) •\tIt can emit small amounts of energy without leaving the metastable state. •\tIt has a huge tolerance for changes – only drastic disruptions can trigger a full collapse and total energy release. •\tIt can slowly “reload” spent energy through cosmic fluctuations. But since those fluctuations are weak, users must meditate to feel them and channel them into their Szintigraphit-atoms. •\tIf the changes are too drastic, the user suffers heavy damage (like being exposed to extreme radiation). This is also what causes the death of one character in my timeline, who basically goes off like a nuke on his home planet. Skills of Szintigraphit Users There are three natural types of “magic”: 1.\tReinforcement – boosting physical attributes such as speed, strength, toughness, awareness, precision. 2.\tManipulation – using resonance to alter elements in the environment (the more complex the change, the harder it is). 3.\tBleeding – using your own internal energy to create elementary compounds. (Later in the timeline, a fourth type develops, tied to an artificial form of Szintigraphit called Bloodstone) —> 4. Leeching – draining energy from the environment (or even from others) to empower yourself with more possibilities. Runes Runes are used to activate specific abilities or “spells.” •\tThey can be engraved into Virelium or pure Szintigraphit (and later Bloodstone). •\tRune Tattoos are a secret, painful procedure where Szintigraphit-ink is etched into the body, connecting with nerves. With training, they allow the user to actively boost their abilities. (Dangerous: when your boost yourself to hard with that Rune-Tattoo you can literally burn the nerves that are connected/used by that Rune —> damage parts of your body) Relics Relics are created by Coresmiths from Szintigraphit crystals (rare, pure Szintigraphit in crystalline form) combined with Irelium (a useless metal that becomes functional when fused with Szintigraphit into Virelium). Every relic has its own resonance signature. The closer a user’s personal resonance is to the relic’s, the more of its potential they can unlock. •\tPartial match = some power access. •\tPerfect match (identical resonance signatures) = full potential, nearly godlike abilities. That’s what i got so far. I’d love to hear your thoughts does it sound balanced, interesting, understandable? Am i too deep into explaining everything xd? Do you guys see „weak spots“ in that system? EDIT: The Knowledge is only necessary for The Aetharii and how the Galaxy developed into way more futuristic World with the technology of Aetharii, because all other species didnt had to go with science because they can use that power source naturally And that specific hard nerd stuff is for the minority of players/readers (for those who want to know more and more because they like the whole worldbuilding) I wanted to create every little part of the system to use it in mythical cultural ways or religious ways that are known to the most in the world but also a good reasona why it works like it works for a species that cant use it the natural way",

      "content_preview": "It is easy to damage the body, not so easy to damage the spirit. When an arm is chopped off your spirit's arm still remains attached to your spiritual body(unless certain kinds of magic is used in that attack), and will invisibly to the naked eye still try(and fail) to grab hold of and experience things, but without a vessel this spiritual arm will slowly wither away until your spirit doesn't have that arm anymore. This is my explanation for the phantom limb/pain phenomenon. To remedy the pain, mages have devised a way to allow the limb to possess an object, giving it a vessel and preventing spiritual withering. What they had not expected was that the person whose arm had possessed the carved wooden arm would be able to move the limb without any muscular mechanism, at the cost of mana per movement just like how mana is spent when poltergeists possess and move objects. However, this was still a stiff limb that could not do much. After giving the limb joints they found the possessed arm could be used just like a living arm in every way, except for sensation which is still lost to the amputee. Sadly this is not a solution for everyone who lost their limbs, because if it has been too long since the limb was lost and the spiritual arm had withered away then the prosthetic will not work because there is no spiritual arm to possess it. What other limitations and considerations could I add to this?",

      "content_preview": "The magic system is linked to one of the themes of my story. Reality is based on your perception and how different perceptions is what makes a person unique. In my magic system, everything has two halves: the physical and the immaterial. The physical world is built on top of the immaterium. Meaning when something changes in the immaterium, the physical world mirrors it. The more you understand something in the immaterium the more you can control it with willpower. The users of this magic system are called perceivers. A perceiver’s perception of the immaterium is divided into three depths. Mortal, soul and universal. To deepen their perception a person must study and train their senses to view the unknown. If senses are stressed too hard while trying to deepen perception, it could cause sensory death: no hearing, no taste, no sight, no touch, no smell. Base Perception – the perception granted by basic sensory organs. First Perception – the ability to view the immaterium of one’s own body, granting awareness and control of life energy. Users can flex their life energy to alter their body. The deeper the perception, the more Minute parts of the body a user can influence. Flexes: •\tStone Skin: draw life energy into the skin to harden it. •\tHeavy Bone: draw life energy into the bones to increase blood production and density. •\tBlood Streaming: rush life energy through the circulation system to boost blood flow. •\tMuscle Growth: draw life energy into the muscles to enhance flexibility and strength. Advanced Flex: •\tHealing: flow life energy directly into cells to promote mitosis and the creation of stem cells. Second Perception – perceive the soul and the circuit of life energy and mana flowing between it and body. This grants control of mana. The body has 12 gates that lead to the soul. These gates transmute life energy into mana before it flows into the soul. A user at this depth can control the transmutation rate between body and soul, empowering one at the expense of the other. At this stage, they also become able to create simple mana constructs. Constructs Shield: a shield made of mana Imbuing: imbue mana into an object to strengthen it. scouring: to disburse particles of mana to sense in a radius. Third Perception (paradigm)– the ability to view the immaterium of the world, also known as the world’s soul. Because perception is subjective, users at this level view the world’s immaterium through a unique lens called a paradigm. A paradigm determines what additional senses a perceiver gains and how they use their magic. Example: A siren views the immaterium as a grand symphony. By using her voice, she can resonate with it. As no one paradigm is perfect or free of biases. Paradigm also bind its owner to having an affliction. Something so contrary to the paradigm’s core concepts that it harms the owner. Example: Vampires have a paradigm of domination, blood, and darkness; therefore, things that symbolize the opposite harm them—the purifying blaze of the sun, holy symbols, etc. Perceivers cannot simply impose their will and understanding directly onto the world’s immaterium, or they risk backlash in the form of paradox. Instead, they must use a release method as a conduit for their understanding, with mana as the power source. This restriction crystallizes understanding into an ability. Release method categories: Action Release Method –  requires a specific action to be performed perfectly. Conductive release method - requires a specific item to channel. Cluster Release Method – that demands the joint effort of several perceivers to ignite. Independent Release Method –  built-in limitations that can be used without relying on other release methods or resources. Accumulation Release Method –  requires external resources to activate or sustain. Informational Release Method –  activated once specific information is obtained or shared. Sacrificial Release Method – requires a personal sacrifice. Anathematize Release Method – causes continuous adverse physiological effects during use. Dimensional Release Method –  can only be used at a specific time, place, or under a particular condition. Covenant Release Method – limited by self-imposed vows or pledges. Unlike independent methods, the restrictions are chosen by the perceiver rather than embedded in the method itself. Breaking these vows has severe consequences. Inciting Release Method –  triggered when others meet specific conditions. Modification Release Method – imposes negative characteristics on an individual as the cost of its creation. The more focus/restrictive an ability, the more powerful. My main character. Name: Hemlock Depth: Third Perception Paradigm: Hemlock perceives the immaterium as the lingering traces of memory left behind on objects, spaces, and people in the form of colorful patterns he calls echoes. Abilities: Memory Hiding (Action): Hemlock can conceal himself by shielding his presence from the memory traces of others, rendering him effectively unnoticed. This effect lasts only as long as he holds his breath. Memory Edits: (Conductive and Action): Hemlock can alter the memories of others by carving into or rewriting existing memory traces. This requires tools or mediums, chalk, ink, blades, or any object capable of leaving a mark to overwrite imprints. Memory Fawn (Sacrificial): In return for his own memories. Hemlock can coax “reality’s memory” of an object to the surface, temporarily restoring it to a former state. A broken sword might remember being whole, or a crumbled wall might recall its unbroken strength. These alterations are temporary, and when the memory fades the object often degrades further. Affliction: Hemlock is vulnerable to possession by the strongest memory traces he encounters. Powerful echoes of grief, rage, or obsession can seep into his mind, overriding his thoughts and forcing him to relive another’s experiences as if they were his own. If left unchecked, these traces can steer his actions or even erode his identity over time.",

      "content_preview": "This is how i will structure my magic in terms of spells and incanations, including runes Magic This is a broad term used to describe the unordinary formations of substances from magical energy(mana) or the processes of chanelling mana throughout the body. Earlier Post , this post will help for better clarifications for the types and classifications of magic. Spells Spells are formations of mana that replicate a similar aspect/force of nature, for example fire. The amount of mana that a spell needs to configure depends on many factors. The following are the factors: the duration of how long the spell will last, how large the formation is needed, the amount of force needed to move the formation from a distance to another, the type of magic being casted, and the quality of the manacirculatory system of the person. Humans/Humanoids are capable of casting spells due to their complex thinking, allowing them to mold mana into intricate structures mimicking real forces of nature. Some animals and plants can use \"false\" spells which are lesser in quality compared to sentient species. Though, these pseudo-spells may be more powerful and destructive in nature. Spells are created inside the body but are activated out of it. All elemental magic and some parts of the primal magic are spell-casted. Spells are considered as active-magic, meaning the user is actively channeling and molding mana in their bodies. Incantations Incantations are closely linked to spells. Incantations allow users to better visualize the complex formations of mana to mold them to replicate the real forces of nature. It is made up of an old alphabetic, though it can be translated into modern languages of the world. It is regarded better to use the old tongue in incantations as it is deeply correlatedto spells. In most spells, incantations are not necessarily needed to activate them. They are a tool used for visualizing and refining the formations of mana. Users with great visualization and imagination can cast spells without the need of using incantations. Though, they are rarely found doing so as it is easier to use incantations. Runes Runes are magical markings placed onto objects or animals that do a specfic function, even if the orginal source if farther away from it. This orginated from adaptations of plants like the Tenercapto Koyahius idk either , otherwise known as the Grabfruit. The Grabfruit has evolved with magical adaptations that allow its magical markings to attach itself to animals. The Grabfruit's pollen create magical markings which allow it to stick much longer on surfaces. The pollen, sticking on to the host's body, releases hormone-like reactions that urge the host to find another Grabfruit to pollinate. The runes that humans and other sentient species created cannot be placed direcfly on to any animal, object, or surface. However, certain materials that have great compatibility to mana can have runes etched on them. Mana Steel is one of the mahy examples with its stable composition allowing mana to be channeled through it easily. If you have any questions or suggestions about this, don't be shy and ask away!",

      "content_preview": "Among the 8 Great Races of the world, the orcs possess a unique form of magic based on the lands of the world. Orcs hold the power of Worldskin, an ability to physically transform their bodies by absorbing the aura of an environment. This aura is the echo of life, death, and memory that permeates a place, and by breathing in a visible mist called the Breath of the World, they can turn their flesh into the conditions that define the land. Their bodies become a literal manifestation of Deserts, Forest, Grasslands, or Tundras, reflecting the raw endurance and fury of the world around them. Fundamentals Source of Power Aura: The ambient essence each land radiates (mountain, swamp, desert, etc.). Breath of the World: Aura manifests visibly as mist, fog, or haze, which Orcs inhale and draw into their veins. Activation An Orc begins by performing a grounding act, stomping the earth and inhaling deeply. In response, the Breath of the World rises from the terrain. The Orc pulls this mist into their body through every available opening, from scars and pores to their nostrils and mouth. As the mist is absorbed, the Orc's body transforms, becoming a living embodiment of the terrain. Rules & Limitations Worldskin is never fully predictable. An Orc cannot summon any transformation at will, they are entirely dependent on where they stand and the aura that place offers. Only one environment’s aura can be embodied. New aura overwrites the last. If multiple Orcs attempt Worldskin at once, the aura splits among them. Each Orc receives only a fraction of the mist, weakening all transformations. Examples: Volcanic Aura: Orcs draw in the Volcanic Aura of their surroundings which reshapes their bodies to mirror the terrain. Their bodies literally become fragments of the land: ash, obsidian, magma, eruption, or poison gas. In this state, an orc's powers are derived from the Ashlands. Ash provides concealment and suffocation, while obsidianforms armor and blades. Magma allows for fiery, molten attacks, and eruption creates destructive shockwaves. Finally, gas can be used for poison and corrosion.",

      "content_preview": "Contrary to what their name suggests, Giants are actually dwarfish in stature, rarely reaching human height. They possess a compact and incredibly dense physique, with muscles and bones built for immense power, making them disproportionately strong for their size. The name \"Giants\" actually comes from their special power: Body Expansion. This magical ability lets them temporarily make parts of their body, or their whole body, much bigger. They can use this for fighting, heavy work, or just to show off, which is how they manage to compete with species that are naturally a lot bigger than they are. Principles of Body Expansion Temporary: The larger a Giant makes their body, the more mana is consumed. They cannot stay expanded indefinitely and must return to their normal size to rest and recharge their energy. This temporary nature of the ability means that they often use it in short bursts during combat or for specific tasks. Targeted: Giants can expand their whole body or just specific parts. They can expand a single limb to deliver a more powerful blow or expand their legs to take enormous strides. Expanding a small part of their body is less taxing and allows them to sustain the effect for longer. Draining: The mana needed for Body Expansion is stored within the Giant's  body. Expanding the entire body is the most draining and risky use of the power. If a Giant overexerts themselves, they risk \"collapsing\" and can't use their power for an extended period. Because of this, experienced Giants learn to be efficient with their power, only expanding as much as they need to. The \"Giant Form\": The complete expansion of a Giant's body is referred to as their Giant Form. When in this state, they can reach up to three times their normal height and gain immense strength and durability. However, maintaining this form for more than a few minutes is extremely difficult Practical Applications Giants primarily use their power for three things: Combat: A Giant can expand their fists to deliver crushing blows or their arms to increase their reach and grapple with larger opponents. They can also briefly expand their entire body to absorb an enemy's attack before returning to their normal, compact size. Labor: Giants are invaluable in construction and mining. A small group of Giants can expand their bodies to move enormous boulders, lift heavy steel beams, or excavate tunnels much more efficiently than other species. Competition: Among themselves, Giants often engage in friendly competitions of strength, showing off how large they can get or how long they can maintain a specific expansion. This competitive spirit drives them to master their abilities.",

It isn’t just moral points, it’s the literal unit of value, earned through actions others find meaningful. Karma can be traded, borrowed, taxed, stolen, or invested. Families might pool Karma to buy a better future, businesses pay wages in Karma, and governments run on it through taxation Everyone is born with zero Karma (Zero Birth Theory). You only gain it by doing something valuable to others. Karma exists in the mind , but can be made official through scribes, contracts, or rituals. It can be exchanged for almost anything: memories, time, lifespan, reputation, even emotions. Banks, markets, and even black markets exist for Karma trades. Archons (godlike regulators) oversee transactions of intangible goods & services, inflation, fraud, and forbidden trades (like selling a child’s life).",

      "content_preview": "While in the process of developing my own magic system, I realized that although I do have “Spells”, they aren’t like typical spells where this specific spell does this. That led me to think about systems that actually do have specifics spells. Like, this spell creates this amount of water or this spell dries clothes. How does your system go about ‘teaching’ spells and why do they take the form they do? I don’t think I’ve really phrased the question correctly, so let me give an example: In Mushoku Tensei, each Spell is accompanied by a specific incantation. This incantation produces a specific effect, and that effect constitutes the Spell. You teach said Spells by teaching someone the incantation and how to manage the resulting effect. In my own system, “Spells” are just specific defined effects one creates. Things like a fireball, for example, would be a Spell. Incantations are a thing, but they’re specific to the individual and while you could teach an individual an incantation, no specific spell has an assigned incantation… for the most part. If someone with a fire affinity was taught by someone with a different fire affinity, I suppose they could inherit Spells from their Master. I suppose it’s the difference between hard-and-set spell effects like in DnD versus “manipulating mana for a desired result” spell effects that could, realistically, be anything",

      "content_preview": "Hey good people of this sub, I am here today to share with you my joy and pride, the main thing of my whole world building right now, that is..the power system! Feel free to ask questions, and constructive criticism is the goal here. ... Domains/Dominions My magic system revolves around domains , these are like your RPG classes: paladin, assassin, etc. A mage/someone who belongs to a domain is called a Pact Bearer. Each domain is centered around a concept/Authority of the universe, meaning that, in-verse, there are unlimited domains. Examples include: Femininity, Masculinity, Justice, Death, Land, Sea, Sky. A domain has 6 ''tiers'' of power, called Stellations. A stellation 1 Pact-bearer would be barely different than a normal human, while a stellation 6 is a full fledged god of their concept - Numen. With each stellation you gain more godhood and lose humanity, Which is why Numina need the belief of others to keep them grounded in sanity, since godhood is fluid. At any time there may be only One Numen from a domain [3] , since for this spot you need to subdue The Will of the Domain : An abstract or not so much thing/being. The Will is the thing that the mages get their power from. A will may never be split, destroyed or affected in any way. Most wills are sentient, with some simply acting as items of high levels. At higher levels (3+) there are many dangers. Corruption [1] , loss of control. [2] Pact/Progression One reason why mages are called Pact-Bearers, is because they bear the weight of their Pact with the Will/Numen. This is perhaps the most mysterious part of the magic system. A human, or any other sentient and not being can make such a ''pact.'' A ritual of sorts, where you make an altar and call for the blessings of a domain. A sacred temple / holy site is what it sounds, these are your Jerusalems, Meccas. Such holy sites have a higher chance to successfully forge a pact. Of course, a holy site can act only for one domain, meaning each dominion has it's own sacred place. After a pact is established, the Pact-Bearer is able to easily use the abilities of the respective stellation - 1. A pact is being '' absorbed '' all the time, depending on the person. Meaning that the time before advancement is always different. Some may have to wait a week, others many years before they can safely advance. To advance, you must complete a ritual (depending on the stellation & domain) and from stellation 4 upwards you also need a specific item to sacrifice. (For 6 this would be the will of the domain) Of course, the difficulty & time rises exponentially, with only a small few ever reaching stellation 4. Miscellaneous: Luminary: someone ''chosen'' by the Numen/will, stronger than a normal pact-bearer of the same stellation. Godhood - fluid, which means that the believe of others is able to shape you and your actions. Humanity - solid, which means that you are independent from the judgement/belief of others. [1] - Corruption is any power, knowledge or any information you receive that is far above your level, usually corruption causes Loss of control or severe backlash. Seeing a true form of a Numen is considered corruption too. [2] - Loss of control refers to a state when the burden of a pact becomes too heavy to shoulder, and you usually turn into a mindless beast seeking destruction, or become an absolutely different, crazy person than you once were. This is why it's advised to only try to progress when your physical & mental states are alright. [3] - Technically, A Numen could progress further by taking another will of a different domain and trying to subdue it too, effectively becoming a lord of 2 dominions at the same time. Though there are no known such cases, nor any studies at all. There is no knowledge what domains can be mixed together, and which must not.",

      "content_preview": "Magic has two categories which are based on their functions: Elemental Magic and Primal Magic Elemental Magic This magic is only able to be wielded by certain individuals whose manacirculatory systems can process mana with distinct attributes to the elements. These attributes may come from the environment of the mana or the instructions/information that the mana holds.(Check my other posts for manacirculatory systems and mana.) For example: A person who is compatible to mana with fire attributes can use fire magic, but not earth magic. Though there are individuals who can use utilize more than one type of attributed mana, it is harder to master and  use two types of elemental magic. This has made people more reliant on one element opposed to controlling two elements. Pre-existing elements such as water can be restructured and controlled by users, as mana exists in almost everything. Though this is the case, it is more efficient for users to utilize their internal mana as a basis in forming the elements, as opposed to using internal mana to reconfigure external mana into the desired form. It has 7 types corresponding to natural elements, forces, and aspects of nature. The following are: Earth Magic This magic allows users to reshape the solid world around them. This is typically used for defense as wielders of the earth element use walls made of rocks as barriers to separate themselves from threats. There are 3 sub-types to this element, those being: Metal magic, Sand magic, and Soil Magic. These sub-types can be wielded individually or fully by its wielders depending on their compatibility. Fire Magic This magic allows users to conjure up fire as potent offensive weapons to burn enemies. From intricate and dazzling flames to wild and uncontrollable infernos, this magic is very adept for offense and other environments. It has 2 subtypes, which are Lava magic and Heat magic. In hotter regions, this magic is enhanced due to higher concentration of fire attributed mana. Wind Magic This magic allows users to create powerful gusts of wind to knock enemies away, to pull objects closer, or to move in a single direction through the use of quick bursts of wind. This magic is among the most flexible of the elemental magic as wind-attributed mana are the most widespread. This has 1 subtype which is Sound Magic. The larger the area that the user is in, it becomes more advantageous for them to cast this magic. Water Magic * This magic allows users to restructure water in to waves of water for defense and icicles for piercing through enemies. This magic can be used to bend water in all its forms from liquid,  to vapor, and to ice. Not all available liquids containing water can be used, as certain substances may break down/separate key components for this to be possible. It has 1 subtype, Ice Magic. Water magic gets stronger when casted near to bodies of water such as rivers and coastal areas. Lightning Magic This magic allows users to cast devastating bolts of lightning at their enemies to quickly incapacitate them. This magic is the fastest to be formed and casted. It is also the deadliest as the lightning quickly infiltrates the body, shutting down all the body systems including the mana circulatory system. During thunderstorms, lightning magic is the most volatile and dangerous magic amongst the elemental magic. Dark Magic This magic allows users to control the darkness and shadows for stealth and unpredictable attacks. Although it may seem taboo as darkness is associated to the contradiction to Light magic, it is not considered evil because Darkness represents the absence of Light. It has only 1 subtype, which is Shadow Magic. Dark Magic is stronger when used in night or places of little light. Light Magic This magic allows users to bend light to blind enemies and slay them with strong beams of light. This magic can be used for illumination for scouting purposes or exploration. It has no subtype as light. This magic is strengthened during days with bright sunlight. Artificial light do not strengthen the effects of light magic Primal Magic Although mana is sill needed to perform this, this magic does not need mana with specfic attributes, unlike Elemental Magic. This magic does not reflect any natural element or force. Most creatures can use this depending on their ability to process mana in ther bodies. It can passively happen and affect the body without the user actively commanding it. It has 4 types: Enhancement Magic , Diminishment Magic , Cursed Magic , and Archaic Magic Enhancement Magic This magic is used for strengthening the muscles, ligaments, organs, and all the other parts of the body for greater efficiency in doing tasks. This is the oldest magic type as prehistoric organisms used this is need for protection against other organisms. It sends a large amount of mana to the body part/s. It is not possible to directly heal another person but supplying mana to them so they can use that mana to speed up the ealing process is a viable option. It can used to speed up the healing process of non-fatal injuries. It can increase the blood flow to the head for faster reaction times when in danger. It is also known as \" Buff -type\" magic. Diminishment Magic It is, otherwise, known as \" Debuff \" magic. It is the counterpart of Enhancement Magic. This magic is known to be used more passively as the body uses it to fight off mana infections. This lessens the flow of mana to a certain body part so that the infected mana will be weakened and expelled out the system. This can also be used in creating magical contracts. This will give specific commands to the internal mana for it to follow. If a magic contract is broken, the contractor who broke it will be subjected to penalties from their internal mana. Cursed Magic This magic is a forbidden taboo that if caught practicing it, they will be slaughtered immediately and mercilessly. This magic works by infiltrating another creature's manacirculatory system using their internal mana. After infiltrating the creature's manacirvulatory system, they will manipulate and control the creature's internal mana, effectively hijacking the will and movements of the creature. Archaic Magic This magic utilizes external mana as a source of energy but has long been forgotten by the people. This is because of the improvement of processing of external mana to into internal mana has made internal mana a safer and more stable choice.",

      "content_preview": "Every spell you cast, every ritual you do is a withdrawal of your own karma. The better the wish, the more karmic point it grabs from you. You will need certain potions to make your mind as concentrate as possible, so the universe can hear your wish loud and clear. Wand is being used to point at the objects you want to cast a spell at to make it clear for the universe to fulfill your wishes. Casting spells on humans is not allowed and it might take off some of your karmic points. Karma can be generated by doing good deeds. However, the less genuine the good deed is, the less karmic point you gain. What do yall think?",

      "content_preview": "Been working on a space opera setting, and I want a power system for it. Most such settings have psionics, but I want to be a little more unique, so here's what I have come up with. There are two dimensions: realspace and the Aether. The Aether is basically hyperspace, but it is inhabited by alien entities that are native to that dimension. They are fourth dimensional entities. They can enter realspace (our universe) when summoned by an individual from realspace. Upon being summoned, the entity's powers are restrained, so they aren't as powerful in realspace as they are in the Aether. They also cannot remain in realspace indefinitely and will inevitably be pulled back into the Aether. The summoner makes a pact with the entity, much like a sorcerer does with a demon, and there might be even be a summoning ritual for the entities. It should go without saying that there are great risks with interacting with an entity, especially making a pact with one.",
