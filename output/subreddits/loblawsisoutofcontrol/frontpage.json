      "content_preview": "I’m from the uk. They have a website that price compares every major grocery store, and tells you where the cheapest items are. It’ll like for like on size, brand etc. Everytime I’ve tried to search something similar here, I’m directed to the Flipp app. Don’t get me wrong, Galen et al can shove it, but I am broke. More so since all this tariff stuff started happening. I can’t get anywhere near as many groceries for $100 as I could even last year. But I also live alone, shopping only for myself and between taking care of myself and trying to stretch my meal prep and not having a nervous breakdown at the state of the world, it leaves little time to search every website and list off what is cheaper where. I guess this is more of a rant than a discussion. But the information is there to be scraped. Why isn’t there a service that is doing it? It’s a subscription I’d happily pay for if it saved me the legwork and a substantial amount at the grocery store. For example, on yesterday’s Costco chicken run I actually checked the Flipp app and found that Sobeys had cheaper chicken thighs. “Damn I was just by Sobeys and don’t want to drive all that way again”. So I buy the pricier chicken. No big deal for my one thing but I can see it saving families TONS! Signed, someone who is tired, broke but does not know how internet things work xo",

But all I see is “JUST STOP SHOPPING THERE!” “Why are you even stepping foot inside of a loblaws?!” “Just go to Costco!” “Stop posting about Shoppers Drug Mart, they’ve always been expensive!” “Oh you’re buying___out of season? Aren’t you fancy!” “Stop shopping American you idiots! Canadian only!” Etc. I feel the majority don’t even read the posts. I made that post about the absurdly expensive soap at Shoppers that is half price other places. I specifically said I didn’t buy it there, and I was only present because my friend wanted to go in so I thought I’d check how ridiculous the price was. Got a bunch of “hey heres an idea-DONT SHOP THERE” even though I clearly stated I didn’t, and that I always pick that brand up at Dollarama anyway. I’m sick of people not reading posts. I’m sick of people shaming folk who have no choice but to shop at Roblaws cause it’s the only available option in their area. Some folk don’t have cars. Some people could be disabled. I thought that was freaking obvious??? I’m sick of people being shamed for shopping American products when that may be all they can afford. Hello? The point is groceries in Canada are EXPENSIVE. I’m not gonna flame someone for buying that cheaper american product/american product that’s on sale when they’re already stretched thin af. I’m sick of grocery policing. I’m so annoyed. I thought this group was about coming together for Canadians but it has devolved into a bunch of judgemental Canadians nitpicking every single post that goes up here. It’s very disappointing.

      "content_preview": "So a few years ago. Maybe more than a few. As I get older time seems to stop. But yes I used to shop exclusively at No frills because it was literally affordable. 2$ for a 12pack of eggs, 5$ for chicken thighs, 1$ to 2$ for canned beans etc. Basically you could go in there with 30 to 40 dollars as a single person and come out with a lot of food to feed yourself. Now I work somewhere that is close to a No frills. But it is kind of out of my way at the same time so I grocery shop on my way home and I'd prefer that the shopping is along the route and while this No frills is maybe 2 blocks from my work place it is 2 blocks in the opposite direction from my home so in reality I realized that I hadn't been there in like 3 or so years even though it's literally right there. Instead I opted to go to the Metro that was on my path towards my home. I only even remembered the No frills because we needed something from the store for my work and I was like whoa i can check it out it's been a while. Plus I can jist grocery ship there instead of Metro since they are kinda expensive anyway. Imagine my utter shock to find that No Frills was MORE expensive than Metro. What is going on?! Like am I crazy?! Did I sleep and fall through some like alternate dimension? When I work late I like to buy the McCains pizza pockets so it's like you microwave for 2 mins and you don't have to think about it. It's bad for you but I don't really end up eating all day so it's fine. It's 7$ at Metro. It is 8.75 at No Frills. I like to buy juice boxes so I can take my meds in the morning cause I struggle with it and I can at least have a quick calorie bit while walking to the subway. ( seems like I have a food problem I don't just very picky ) anyway 2 dollars at Metro . 5 dollars at No Frills. I went there for the work thing. I ended up not actually grocery shopping. I just bought a snack that was not available at Metro, bought the stuff for work and went to Metro. It's like Bizzaroville. The yellow signs was there talking about how everything was supposed to be cheaper but like the no name toilet paper I forgot it's name it used to be 5$ it was 8$ I believe. I don't know what the point of this post is. I just feel that No Frills have forgotten their core mission. Or maybe it was just that location. A lot of high end condos and middle class or upper middle class families live in the area so maybe that is why it is priced so crazily but at thar point just call it a Loblaws and not no frills.",

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/billionaire-david-thomson-interested-in-buying-hudsons-bay-v0-62xfq6so5fkf1.jpg By Tara Deschamps, The Canadian Press Posted August 21, 2025 1:09 pm. Last Updated August 21, 2025 2:40 pm. TORONTO — Two of Canada’s richest families appear poised for a battle over one of the country’s most famed documents. A holding company owned by David Thomson, the billionaire chairman of Thomson Reuters, announced in new court filings Thursday that it wants to buy the royal charter that formed the Hudson’s Bay retailer. Thomson is willing to spend at least $15 million on the historic document he wants to donate to the Archives of Manitoba. Thomson’s filing could become a hurdle for the department store, which is due to ask a court on Sept. 9 for permission to sell the charter for $12.5 million to Wittington Investments Ltd. The holding company belonging to the Weston family, which is best known for its grocery conglomerate Loblaw Cos. Ltd., wants to donate the charter to the Canadian Museum of History. The charter was issued by King Charles II in 1670 and gave the Bay rights to a vast swath of land spanning most of Canada and extraordinary power over trade and Indigenous relations for decades. When the Bay filed for creditor protection under the weight of immense debt in March, it started looking to assets to recoup cash for the lenders, landlords and suppliers it owed money. After closing all 80 of its stores and another 16 under the Saks banners, it turned to its 2,700 artifacts and 1,700 art pieces. The Bay was going to auction off the items, including the charter, until the Westons’ offer emerged, scuttling the original plan. News that the Bay had already brokered a sale surprised Thomson, who had “been waiting for the timeline and process for the art auction to be announced,” said Patrick Phillips, a director at Thomson’s holding company DRKT, in an affidavit. Thomson is one of the country’s most prominent art collectors, building on a passion shared with his late father Kenneth Thomson, who donated 2,000 works to the Art Gallery of Ontario and gave it a $20 million annual endowment. David Thomson was also a store manager at the Bay’s Cloverdale Mall location in Etobicoke, Ont., in the 80s and president of department store Simpsons Ltd., which the Bay bought. Thomson thought the Westons’ offer was “significantly lower” than what the charter could fetch and “does not maximize value for creditors,” said Phillips who said he was also “taken aback” by the sum. Rather than move forward with the sale to the Westons, Phillips’ affidavit suggests the Weston family’s offer should serve as a minimum bid in an open auction. If a court agrees to that approach, the affidavit says Thomson is willing to place bids beyond his initial $15 million offer. “Put simply, David believes, as do I, that the Royal Charter will realize a substantially greater price in an open art auction than is currently being offered,” Phillips said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 21, 2025. https://toronto.citynews.ca/2025/08/21/billionaire-david-thomson-hudsons-bay-charter/",

      "content_preview": "If you online order check your accounts METICULOUSLY. On Thursday of last week I placed a 126$ (140$ according to the app with taxes and the extra charge), 172$ was debited from my account right away. Already not making sense even with the online order extra % that gets charged. The next day, on Friday, another 175$ was debited from my account. The Saturday when I picked up my order 126$ was debited from my account. Coming out to 470+ dollars out of my account for a 126$ grocery order, later that evening the 175$ was reversed. We are now on the following Wednesday, tomorrow will be a week, and the 172$ is not back. I have tried the online chat support through the app only to get nowhere, it's an endless loop of AI replies. Tried calling yesterday and it just rang and rang, went to the store yesterday at the customer  service kiosk and was told by one manager that he didn't understand how that happened and that this is the other manager's job who would be in tomorrow. He took my name, phone #, and the $$ amounts on a sticky note that he then used a cellphone to take a picture of, telling me the other manager would call me very early this morning. As of 11:30am today I received no phonecalls. So I tried calling the customer service desk, it just rang and rang. Went through the menu and called the customer service manager, it just rang rang rang no option for voicemail. Went through the menu again and finally got to the store manager, rang rang rang, left a voicemail, it's almost 2pm and no call back. Just at superstore now and none of the customers service employees had a clue what I was talking about...The PC manager/online order manager stepped in, told me she was \"going to call me before she left for the day\" and hasn't even started looking into the issue yet. When I brought up that I was promised a call early in the AM, she just said she had a busy day and can't directly look into the issue herself, she has to call their own internal support office to look into the issue...which again, she has waited until 2pm Yukon time to not even start doing. Keeping in mind I live a half hour from the store so that's two days and two 1 hour round trips wasted. The store manager claims it's just \"on a hold probably\" however money that is being held and money that has been directly debited appear differently in my account, it is a very obvious difference, and all 3 charges were directly debited. I'm very fortunate to have a comfortable salary and that all my bills were paid, no children to feed, no emergencies (knock on wood), however I had planned to go camping for a few days and had to cancel that since that 172$ was going to be my fun money for that trip. This could cause some serious problems for people or families who survive on strict budgets. Do not order from there if you don't want hundreds of dollars debited and every person involved on every level of management being like \"sorry that's somebody else's problem 🤷\" . Was thinking of switching to local grocers only like I've done for gas, pharmacy, and dog food... This solidifies that desire into a decision now.",

When paramedics showed up they said \"if we knew you were only 14 we would have been here sooner\". It was a busy summer day and they were swamped with calls and were trying to go with who was more of a priority. The manager also tried to mop up evidence infront of me. I still think about that day so much that I haven't walked into that store since the day I left in an ambulance. I refuse to even walk on the sidewalk near that building. I avoided every Loblaws since till maybe the last 5 years or so I started shopping at a different location only because it was cheaper but it took me awhile to not be freaked out. I also regret not using that location, my family convinced me against it because a family member moved an a different Loblaws. Even he says we should have sued him cause he hated that job. I know 15+ years is so long ago but that injury comes back every now and again, most recently was december last year and a mild one a couple weeks ago.",

Upon calling about this, waiting for over an hour to speak to a customer service agent (who was situated in the Philippines), he was told that because of the threat of possible mail disruption by Canada Post, the option to receive a paper statement was switched to online access only, without his knowledge or consent.  We have other Mastercards in this household and this is the only one that has done this.  Other companies have sent email to warn of possible mail disruption, but none have taken the liberty to switch us to online access only & especially not without informing of such a change.   Also, there has been no mail disruption to date and all other statements, invoices & etc are being received.  Not everyone has online access.  How are such people supposed to find out what’s going on when PC Financial decides to summarily change their terms of access?  This is not acceptable and would subject many people to surprise interest charges.  The customer service agent admitted that this has been the case for some of their (especially elderly) customers.  How is this permitted or considered decent business practice?  Shame on PC Financial.  We are considering putting aside this credit card to use others with more transparent behaviour.",

Before going to the store I bring it up on their website for that location and it says the sale price is $1.49, oh really, but the flyer says $1.25 and that's what it should be. I go to the store, there's no notice anywhere about a wrong price in the flyer and the shelf says, on sale for $1.49. I picked up 4 cans which because the flyer said they were $1.25 each, went through self check out and they all came through at $1.49 sale price each. I finish my order and walk over to customer service and said the flyer says no name tuna flakey or chunky is $1.25 per can, they came through at $1.49. The lady insisted that the sale price is $1.49. After arguing back and forth another employee came up to see what was going on and I said that the flyer says it is on sale for $1.25 and that there was no notice when entering the store to say that the flyer was wrong. The other employee agreed with me and refunded me the difference. The amount isn't a big deal but it's the point of it. How many people are buying items because they see a sale price in the flyer and don't notice that they actually paid more it in the store. You really have to watch them with eagle eyes. This isn't the first time happened, it seems to happen a lot - maybe it's their way of scamming people to try and get more money out of people without them realizing it.",

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/weston-family-wants-to-buy-hudsons-bay-charter-donate-it-to-v0-2cuw8gmfh2gf1.png TORONTO — The Canadian Museum of History says the Weston family wants to buy the royal charter that formed Hudson’s Bay 355 years ago and donate it to the Quebec institution. The document issued by King Charles II gave the Bay rights to a vast swath of land spanning most of Canada and extraordinary power over trade and Indigenous relations for decades. The museum says the acquisition still needs court approval but if that is obtained, the Westons will donate the document immediately and permanently. The Bay put the charter up for sale to put a dent in the roughly $1.1 billion in debt it had when it filed for creditor protection in March. The Weston family has made its fortune through Canadian retail chains including Loblaw Cos. Ltd. and Holt Renfrew, as well as several European department stores. While most of the Bay’s artifacts were previously donated to the Manitoba Museum and the Archives of Manitoba, 2,700 more items will eventually hit the auction block alongside 1,700 of the retailer’s art pieces.

Please post your picture, and general location (ie: urban Ontario) here as opposed to posting on the sub. A reminder for the community, this is a trial for the next month, and we will have a check-in during the first week of March to confirm this is beneficial for the community before making this change permanent.

      "content_preview": "I quit going to Superstore years ago due to their complete disdain for the Canadian people and their garbage produce. After five years, with prices out of control everywhere, I thought I'd try again and see if I could save some money. I did two click and collect orders over the past two weeks and had to throw out 50% of the produce. Throw it out the DAY I brought it home. They gave me absolute garbage. Strawberries visibly moldy. Peaches so bruised you cut it open and it's black and purple inside. A bag of snap peas that was liquid at the bottom. Absolutely disgusting. I made a complaint and got the money refunded, but it's not worth the hassle. I have to drive from my town to the local city to get groceries, it's a huge pain in the ass to come home with stuff I can't use. I'm never buying fresh produce from them again, so might as well just completely shop elsewhere. That's at least $400/week for life that they will not be getting from me. ETA: I use Safeway Voila (their curbside pickup service) weekly and the produce has been great every time. They are also super prompt and it usually takes about half the time as Superstore. The produce is more expensive though. I have small kids and not having to take them through the grocery store is a huge deal.",
