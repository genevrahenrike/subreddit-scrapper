      "content_preview": "I will move to Co.Meath for a temporary professional stay that will last 5 months. I come from an EU country and will go back to it afterwards, I have no intention of staying in Ireland. I will be placed in a very rural area with lack of public transportation. I can either drive to work (10 min drive) or catch the bus/carpool (30 mins and weird timetables). I am torn between: Bringing my own car to Ireland (with the steering wheel on the left) in a ferry and purchasing a complementary insurance. Buying a cheap busted car for my stay and then selling it afterwards. I have zero idea of legal requirements, if it's easy to buy an used car in Ireland and sell it, if it's possible to insure it for 6 months, etc. Any advice will be super appreciated! Ditching the car idea and stick to public transportation, carpooling or biking when the weather allows it. Thank you in advance! I'd love to read to your experiences and advice!",

Not moving all the house, so we would have only a few large furniture pieces such as couches. We do have fragile items: artwork, pottery, glassware… All in all I think it would fit 20 ft container tops. We don’t have time to do prep on our own so would need to agree on a day with a troupe of movers to package all items in Sicily and take care of everything, including door delivery in Cork. Anyone has experience with this please share feedback and advice. TIA",

      "content_preview": "Hi folks! I am an incoming international student from USA bringing my 6 year old cat Marla with me. I've been looking for a pet friendly accommodation in Dublin for nearly 8 months, and I have had next to no luck. Some landlords have been on the fence, but nearly none have ended up agreeing or letting me sign a lease/pay the deposit. I will be a full-time student, however I will be working while I am there (I already have a job offer). I would leave Marla back home, but she unfortunately has no other place to go (I have no family and none of my friends are able to take her). She was in the shelter for 3 years because she is a black cat, and I've had her for a few years. I really do not want to leave her or take her back to the shelter; She means a lot to me and has helped me through a lot these past few years. Some folks have mentioned in the past just hiding your pet from the landlord. How reasonable do folks feel this is? In the US a lot of places are pet friendly, but if they are not pet friendly and the landlord finds out they have pets, they often will be immediately kicked out. Does anyone have any specific housing recommendations, or ideas? I've been working towards going to school in Dublin for 2 years, and the limited amount of housing (let alone pet friendly ones) have been a huge set back for me. It would absolutely break my heart if I wasn't able to go to school this year.",

I've been trying to get a definitive answer about how the Revenue Commissioners treat withdrawals from ROTH accounts.  I asked Revenue and they said to ask a tax accountant.  So I asked tax accounts ( multiple , expensive , tax accountants) and received contradictory or ambiguous answers.  In particular, I am curious about the intersection between Revenue's 41% tax on ETFs and Deemed Disposal rules and ROTH accounts - is a ROTH account exempt from those rules?  So I was wondering if there are viewers here that are Irish tax-resident and making withdrawals from your ROTH accounts?  If there are, would you share your actual experience with how Revenue handles your withdrawals?  There are many Irish expats in the same boat as us, so I believe your experience and insights would be valuable to many people. Thank you for any help you can offer.",

I have submitted an inquiry on the visa portal with no response so I’m kind of in the dark.

I'm not looking for a full home move, just a small volume shipment. Has anyone here used a reliable shipping company or freight forwarder for a similar move between Canada and Ireland? So far, I've seen quotes in the $2,000–$3,500 CAD range online, but I'd love to hear your experiences.

      "content_preview": "I made a post on this the other month, so this is a follow-up with the latest for anyone else in the same situation. Bringing a car permanently into Ireland would involve paying customs duties, VAT, and Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) which can all total many thousands of euros, but you can apply for relief to have these charges waived entirely if you apply for Transfer of Residency (TOR) at the same time. However, there was a question mark over vehicles like 4x4s and jeeps, as the Irish Revenue says on it's forms that relief will not apply for \"commercial vehicles\", but did this mean vehicle usage/taxation class, or just any mention of \"commercial\" on the vehicle log book, be it a 12 seater mini-bus or a  Land Rover? I raised the question directly with Revenue back in June, stating my understanding was the former (vehicle weight <2500kg, standard 5 seater, only ever been used as a private vehicle, would be taxed as a private vehicle, all supporting evidence could be provided etc.) and can they confirm. A representative at Revenue responded, saying 'yes' and I can go ahead with the relief application and I just needed to provide specific evidence to support the claim and duties would be waived, so happy days! I followed up with the actual form and provided him with everything requested. Roll forward several weeks to yesterday afternoon and the same rep at Revenue has responded again, rejecting the pending  application he told me to make and now saying the latter (i.e. any mention of commercial  is not applicable for relief). I'm due to move to Ireland in the next few days (ferry booked, my worldly belongs ready to be loaded up into my jeep, starting new job the week after). I've raised a grievance with Revenue over their rep's U turn at the 11th hour, but I don't hold out much hope in all honesty. Likely outcomes are now: Vehicle not allowed to leave Dublin Port (unlikely, but not an impossibility) Given 30 days grace to have the vehicle registered and pay all the taxes, or have it out of the state Allowed to use the vehicle as normal under UK insurance (90 days) providing it is returning to the UK and will not remain in state. I'll know in a few days! TL;DR : I strongly recommend you do not attempt to import any vehicle that is not a bog standard car classification (so anything with commercial in the log book, light or heavy), unless you are prepared to pay all the import taxes - even if Revenue claim otherwise and lead you up the garden path.",

Would this process be easier if we had a place lined up in the Republic prior to him receiving his stamp 4, therefore excluding the need to reside in the north first? Thanks in advance, and please be kind, we’re still trying to grasp some of the finer details of everything",

Something I’ve noticed: some studio apartments that seem reasonably decent—okay price, nice interiors — have been listed for a while and still say they’re available. Given how competitive the rental market in Dublin is supposed to be, I’m confused. Why wouldn’t those be snapped up already? I haven’t reached out to any of them yet since I don’t have a move-in date, but I’m curious—are these listings real? Are they outdated? Or is there something I’m missing? Would appreciate any insight from people more familiar with the market.",

Had planned to hire a Luton Box Van instead of using Careline or the likes as the quotes were 2/3 times higher than doing it myself for the amount of stuff I’ve got to move. It seemed like it would be grand as there are LOADS of places to hire box vans in and around London, or so I thought. I’ve gone ahead and booked a van with multiple places (Europcar, Enterprise etc etc) and they keep cancelling saying the vehicle isn’t available. Feels like they advertise having them to make their fleet look bigger but they don’t actually have them? A lot of the smaller companies I used to use have changed their policies so the vans aren’t allowed leave the UK, presumably since Brexit. My question is: has anyone successfully hired a box van, and if so, where from? Specifically which branch, so I can try them. I would even be open to hiring in Ireland and going back and forth that way if I have to. Thanks in advance!",

I’ve got a few hobbies, woodworking being one of them and by far the most expensive. Over the years I’ve amassed quite a collection of hand tools (hand saws, planes, chisels, rasps, spokeshaves, etc. - admittedly more than enough for a home wood shop) plus a fair number cordless power tools (Makita - batteries would be bought locally) and a joinery workbench I’ve built. Also more general household tools, like wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, and whatnot. None of it has ever been used for any business/commercial use and likely never will  (at least in my lifetime) but I’m a bit concerned about how much it may end up costing to bring all of this over, inventory headaches and shipping aside. Am I correct in assuming (from what I’ve read so far) that all of these tools would fall under the 23% VAT rate since they could certainly be used for business purposes?",

      "content_preview": "There is a lot of misinformation out there on this subject, so making this post so that it can benefit others. If you want to take your guinea pig (or other small rodent) from the British Mainland to Ireland, you'll likely be told by some vets that you need to have pet passports, AHC (Animal Health Certificate), EHC (Export Health Certificate), rabies vaccinations and microchipping, which could all cost hundreds. Some other vets will tell you they can't help you because they're not a Government Official Veterinarian (OV) which is required to carry out the above. Quite simply, they're wrong! The problem looks to be that some vets, ferry companies etc. are applying post Brexit regulations for animals like cats and dogs, thinking it's a blanket policy to all animals including guinea pigs, which they should not be doing. To save paying out on unnecessary fees, putting your pet through unnecessary procedures, and potentially getting your pet quarantined or refused entry in Ireland for not completing the actual required process and documentation that Ireland needs, here's the correct information: You will need to have a Veterinary Health Certificate completed by a vet (this is a totally different certificate to the AHC or EHC and doesn't need to be completed by a government OV) which is valid for ten days. This is where you add details about your guinea pig and you make an appointment where the vet signs and stamps it to confirm there's no visible health issues. The form is called (a bit of a mouthful here!): \"Model Health Certificate for the Movement of Pet Rabbits and Rodents into Ireland, from countries other than other EU Member States and countries other than those listed in Part I of Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 577/20132\" The form is available to download on the gov.ie website http://www.pettravel.gov.ie/ . The webpage does look like a Geocities page from the 1990s, but it's a legit government site. Select \"Rodents\" at the top and then \"Great Britain\" from the drop-down search list. The page that loads has an entry with a download link under \"National Health Certificate for the Movement of Pet Rabbits and Rodents from Great Britain: Download\" 4) You'll then need to email the appropriate DAFM (Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) contact (depending on where exactly you will be arriving in Ireland) to inform them of your travel. The list of contact emails is on the same webpage, below the download link of the form. Here's some more context : You don't need rabies vaccinations for a guinea pig or other animals where it's nigh on impossible for them to contract/transmit rabies, unlike cats, dogs, ferrets etc. You don't need to get a guinea pig microchipped (inserting a microchip into an animal so small is not without health risks to the animal according to some animal health professionals). Vaccinations and Microchipping requirements are only been thrown around as they are a requirement to obtain an AHC/EHC/Pet Passport. These are not valid for guineas pigs (with the exception if your guinea pig isn't a pet and you are bringing it into Ireland for research or exhibition purposes, in which you would need specifically EHC #8614: Export rodents to the Republic of Ireland). And here's my experience that took me down the rabbit hole: Three UK vets misadvised about what was required. One quoted £400 for pet passports, another £500, and another (our usual one) said they can't help as they're not an OV but put us onto a  A forth (who specialises in pet travel). This forth one put me on the right path and confirmed the process for guinea pigs is very different to the process for cats, dogs and ferrets. The UK DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) didn't know what the processes were post Brexit (the advisors on their help line were Googling the process when I called them) The Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine confirmed the above process is correct. I also reached out to their contacts at Dublin Port who I would be going to, who also confirmed the above is correct I then ended up going back to our normal vet (the one who's not an OV) and showing them the official documentation/forms and the feedback from DAFM and that 4th vet. They said they hadn't seen this info before but agreed they can perform the health check and sign the form for a one-off £120 charge Irish Ferries (and probably other companies) are also misadvising people just like the UK vets are, and their website FAQs are just listing \"pets\" and saying they need rabies vaccinations and microchipping to travel (again, incorrectly thinking all pets are under the same regulations as cats, dogs and ferrets). I contacted them in writing cofirming the above process and stating why I don't require this and how an EHC is invalid for a pet guinea pig. I would strongly suggest any of you do this so you can print out their confirmation, just in case you are challenged when you are boarding. I hope this post helps anyone coming across it and saves you countless hours or emails and phone calls! I am travelling in a few weeks with guinea pig in tow, so I'll come back if there were any issues",

Due to various factors I've decided to move to Ireland as soon as possible. I have a car here, it's a standard Golf 2015 1.6 diesel. I made up my mind to take the car with me as it'd save me a lot of hassle (and money) once I'm there. Having done all research on VRT exemption through TOR, I realised that since my car was previously my father's (who gifted it to me a year ago), the V5c was still in his name..which means although I owned it, used it, insured it..he was the registered keeper. Obviously there's a 6 month rule for the exemption which I have to meet and although v5c isn't proof of ownership, I wouldn't be wrong in saying it's a  substantial part of it?? So to fix it, my father then did a transfer online through DVLA and put date of sale to last year..and now we're waiting for a logbook v5c in my name and wishing it comes with the backdated date we put. Also another question, when the logbook comes can I immediately then take the car to Ireland with me and do the tor/exemption paperwork once im there? Or do I need to submit and wait for decision before I go? Honestly in a bit of a pickle. Any advice  on this situation or previous experiences appreciated.",

Because we both speak advanced English and my husband got an offer there. No more questions.) But we’re stuck in a loop: No lease, because landlords want 3–4 references or Irish payslips (we have none yet, he starts his work in July now). No PPSN or immigration registration, because Airbnb host letters might not be accepted. He has a place rented for July on Airbnb with the letter from the host but if Intreo or Burgh Quay won’t accept that, we’re basically stuck. The bank account isn’t a big deal, but if we can’t prove our address, we might have to give up the offer. Anyone been through something similar? What are our options? How did you break this “spell”? Thanks in advance.",

For those who've used it recently: Do I (the applicant) fill in all the job details, or does HR/the employer handle that part entirely? My portal mostly shows personal details and a signature page or the declaration page that tells me to \"contact your Employer to fill in the details.\" I couldn't see the page to enter job details, remuneration details and all. Did I miss anything? Anyone who applied recently please help Thanks!!!",

About 18 months ago she relocated back to Ireland with the intention of me joining her once I finish my work contract in Dubai. I’ve been over multiple times on a C type visa countless times over the last 18 months . We are in the process of buying our own house and she has her own family business that she is currently employed in and will eventually take over . My question is that do I need a different category visa . i.e category D or can I turn up at Dublin airport with a C type visa and claim that I am reuniting with my spouse. Any other advice would be greatly appreciated . Many thanks 🙏🏻",

The company I'm relocating to requires me to give them an address to send a work laptop to me right now. I'd rather avoid giving them a shared Airbnb address - what is the best option in this case? Should I give them a parcel locker, parcel shop, or should I try to find a friend of a friend to have an actual person receive the package? It's a work laptop, so it's important for me that the address I give them is safe. I'm open to all suggestions. Thank you in advance!",

The income is enough but he hasn’t worked in almost two years because of it. I work in retail myself so I can easily find a job within retail if that’s even a field that qualifies to get me my working visa or a visa or any kind in general. Any advice would be fantastic on what the requirement would be need OR would he absolutely need a job. We just need a temporary stay until things get okay again here.",
