For centuries, entire communities were excluded from education and jobs. Quotas gave them a chance to enter the system. Without them, they would still be shut out.But society changes. Some groups have moved forward, others are still struggling. every decade a powerful caste like Marathas, Patidars, Jats, Gujjars, Kapus etc demands reservation. And the smaller OBC groups fear their already reservation quota shrinking.It feels like we need a reset:Every 10 years, run proper caste + economic surveys.Recalculate quotas based on population, poverty, and social backwardness.Apply a universal creamy layer so wealthy families don‚Äôt misuse it.Over time, as inequalities really narrow, shift towards purely economic-based quotas.Reservations will always matter. But they can‚Äôt stay frozen forever, they need to evolve with society, or we‚Äôll keep seeing the same cycle of protests and anger, over and over..",

On3rd September 2025 around 2 PM, he was declared dead atHindu Rao Hospital(Casualty No: CYO9/46083).The situation feels very suspicious:The shop owner has suddenly fled.The boy who was living with him is missing.Amrit was healthy and young.When we went toTis Hazari Chowki, instead of helping us, the police (led bySI Sandeep Mathur)refused to file an FIR or conduct a postmortem, which is normally mandatory in such cases. Instead, we were harassed and discouraged from pursuing the matter.This has left us completely helpless. Without FIR or postmortem, evidence is being lost, and we strongly suspect bribery and foul play.üëâ I am reaching out to this community to ask:What immediate steps can we take legally?How can we ensure FIR and postmortem are done?Are there NGOs, lawyers, or journalists in Delhi who can help?How do I make this issue reach higher authorities like Delhi Police HQ or NHRC?I have already tried filing complaints online (NHRC, Vigilance, ACB), but the system feels slow. Meanwhile, the police are blocking us.Any advice, connections, or even just helping spread this will mean the world. Amrit was only 22 ‚Äî he deserves justice.

      "content_preview": "As a woman, I often feel that being born here comes with so many unspoken restrictions. From childhood, parents pamper us but are also extremely overprotective‚Äî‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go here, don‚Äôt go there.‚ÄùNo late outings, no hanging out with boys, and even if you‚Äôre allowed to go out, it‚Äôs usually only with female friends that too only in the day and not too far away places inside 5km radius lol!Endless questions: ‚ÄúWhere are you? With whom?‚Äù followed by sharing live locations. Honestly, the whole fun of going out gets ruined. And for context-i dont want to smoke, drink, or have boyfriends(even if I ever dated it should be my own experience I mean dating having heartbreaks itself is called living a life especially in these times, if I don't how would I ever know right n wrong or how to interact with the opposite gender in future) I Just want to explore places n build friendships ...Then when it comes to competitive exams, parents say, ‚ÄúWhy study so much, you‚Äôll get married anyway.‚Äù But later they turn around and ask, ‚ÄúWhy are you always at home, go out and enjoy!‚Äù The same people who restricted us from making friends when the time was to build friendships explore and gain  independence suddenly expect us to be outgoing, confident, and independent. I feel like I have lost interest in emotional investing in friendships or going out cause of these scenarios in my life right now!It makes me wonder: in many Western cultures, children are encouraged from a young age to be independent, build their own personality, and make choices. That early freedom shapes their character. In India, it often feels like we‚Äôre held back until suddenly expected to handle adulthood flawlessly.Do others here feel the same? How did you deal with this contradiction in parenting?edit-used chatgpt forbettert grammarEDIT 2-PLEASE DON'T REPLY WITH OH IT'S FOR UR SAFETY I WISH THEY DID THIS WITH MEN ONLY THEN THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW RESTRICTED WE FEEL IN EVERYTHING WE DO!",

      "content_preview": "This incident happened a month ago but I am writing about it now because I recently discovered that he (A) is also a disgusting casteist (though not directed to my sister as she's not \"LC\" ugh).I returned from coaching and found my sister (in 11th) standing in front of the mirror. Before I could even put my bag down, she asked me if she was really that dark. I knew something was wrong the moment I heard that. My sister is already insecure by nature. She often makes small jokes about her complexion but this time her tone was different. It was a genuine question.When I pressed her to tell me what had happened, she finally admitted that at school, while she was writing, A came over, picked up a sticky note, tore it in half and tried to stick it to her forehead. When she instinctively leaned back, he reached out further, placed it on her forehead, called her ‚ÄúIyer‚Äù (from TMKOC), and then laughed hysterically, other students also laughing with him. My sister immediately brushed it off.To be clear, I have no issue with her being called Iyer because personally, I admire the actor who played that role in TMKOC as despite not being given much material, he still made the character enjoyable, and in some story arcs even showed his real acting talent.But we all know what he really meant by doing that. His actions were not just dehumanizing to my sister but also disrespectful to people who wear the white tilak on their foreheads (like Gukesh, for example). And this crude mentality of equating darker skin tones with South Indians is not only ignorant but also revolting.I know this is nothing new. It happens everywhere in India ‚Ä¢but what irritates me is that this particular guy constantly parades himself as someone who \"respects every culture and race.\" A Korean influencer gets called Chinese in the UK and he posts a story: ‚ÄúStop Asian Hate.‚Äù Someone on the other side of the world faces discrimination for their skin colour and he posts: ‚Äú#BlackLivesMatter.‚ÄùSo does his basic empathy extend only to foreigners? Or is it something about the foreign land that makes colourism (or internalized racism/racism) more of a serious issue? It baffles me how Indians rage when one of us is discriminated against abroad but the same people laugh off the racism and colourism that festers within our own country, against our own people, by us. Does a fellow Indian in India, not deserve to be treated with the same dignity?[One more thing I'd like to clear is that I'm not accusing a whole bunch of people of being like him but there are certainly more people like A and neither I'm mad that he compared her to a \"South Indian\", please don't get distracted halfway and stick to the post's spirit.]A little vent: Fck you, A. Your favourite rapper Drake and your beloved Miles Morales would hate a casteist and colourist like you.",

      "content_preview": "Two years ago, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S22 from Amazon India. Recently, it was affected by the notorious green line issue, a widespread problem with AMOLED screens.I took the phone to a Samsung service center, and initially, they were ready to replace the screen for free under their special policy for this issue. However, they later denied the free repair. The reason? The phone's activation date was before the invoice date from my Amazon purchase. According to Samsung's records, the phone was activated before I even bought it.I contacted Samsung support, and they confirmed this discrepancy. They told me that because the activation date didn't match the invoice, they couldn't honor the repair, and told me to take it up with the seller, Amazon.When I reached out to Amazon support, they were completely clueless. They kept insisting that the phone was out of warranty and there was nothing they could do. After a frustrating and heated conversation, they finally said they might be able to help if I could provide an official letter from Samsung, with a seal, confirming the activation date issue.The problem is, Samsung support has no process for providing such a letter. They only send emails, which Amazon refuses to accept. It feels like I'm stuck in a never-ending loop between two giants, with no one willing to take responsibility. It's clear to me that Amazon most likely sold me a refurbished phone as new, and now I'm paying the price.TL;DR: I bought a \"new\" Galaxy S22 from Amazon India. It developed the green line issue, but Samsung denied a free repair because the phone's activation date was before my purchase date, suggesting Amazon sold me a used or refurbished unit. Amazon is refusing to help without an official letter from Samsung, which Samsung can't provide.",
