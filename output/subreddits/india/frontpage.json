      "content_preview": "A poor person is poor for some reason, because everyone dreams of becoming rich, and if they still fail to achieve it, there are always reasons behind it. Many alcoholic men don‚Äôt earn, and many women don‚Äôt take a stand for their children. Such children are educated by the government, they get free food, clothes, and continuous benefits for being below the poverty line. I myself have received benefits from the government since childhood. I know very well that if these facilities did not exist, I would never have been educated. I would have remained illiterate, been married off at a young age, and could have destroyed my own children‚Äôs dreams.Education changes mindset. I was good at studies, and because of the praises I received from my government school teachers, my parents were motivated to educate me further. I am the only girl in my family who has studied this much.Yes, the government exists, but the truth is, whether the government is good or bad, they do not pay from its own pocket. The money comes from the rich and the honest taxpayers, who work tirelessly to earn it. And then that tax is either swallowed by a corrupt government, or wasted by drunkards, while only a small fraction truly reaches those in need.I have seen many billionaires who never pay taxes, while those who do are left with broken roads and polluted air to breathe. If someone really wants to help, without letting a corrupt system misuse their contribution, then please support education. Because greed and dishonesty can exist in both the rich and the poor.Maybe this note of mine will bring some comfort to those who, unwillingly, work 9 -5 jobs, who sacrifice their dreams, while watching corrupt people live lavish lives.",

Nithin Gadkhari sons own two Ethanol producing companies and whose profit soared to 3000% in the last year, data available publicly.India's petrol consumption per day is around 30 crore litre, with 20% of ethanol, that means 6 crore litre ethanol per day, ethanol price have crossed more than ‚Çπ100 recently, so just imagine the size of ethanol sale per day.So is this Ethanol mixing petrol the biggest scam in India? Bigger than 2G scam?",

      "content_preview": "jee has ruined engineering in india. it has killed creativity and turned the whole thing into a rat race where the only skill that matters is mugging up formulas and solving the same pattern of problems. i‚Äôm a software engineer and it makes me sick watching kids who started coding at 12 or 13 and had so much potential just lose it all once they get sucked into the jee grinder. they stop building projects, stop experimenting & stop being curious because none of that matters in jee.the result is obvious. no indian college is anywhere near the top in qs rankings. not a single indian university shows up in the top 50 of icpc, the most important competition for competitive programmers worldwide. years of coaching and hype and the ‚Äúbest minds‚Äù of india cannot even break into the top bracket globally.jee is a psyop to keep the middle class middle class. it eats away years of their youth, drains their parents‚Äô savings and then spits them out into overcrowded colleges with mediocre teaching. and don't get me started on how btech professors themselves don't know how new frameworks & new technologies work, most continue this outdated chalk and talk method, recycling the same 20 year old notes, teaching students c and java like it‚Äôs still 2005 while the real industry has already moved on. they‚Äôve never built a real project, never shipped code, never touched the tools companies actually use, but they‚Äôll grade you on theory exams and make you feel like you‚Äôre not good enough. it‚Äôs a joke.the coaching mafia has made billions selling this dream. kota is basically a factory farm where kids are treated like products. they don‚Äôt care if you burn out or die, as long as the fees keep rolling in and they can plaster a few toppers on billboards.this is what happens when you worship an exam instead of actual learning. jee has turned engineering into a factory that produces unskilled degree holders not engineers.",

      "content_preview": "1.Have you ever wondered why, given that Lord Ram was also away from his wife, just Mata Sita was required to grant the agni pariksha? Why Mata Sita was the only one who needed to prove herself when they finally met? Even when we all know that lord Rama ate Sabri k juthe ber . Only a person in love can eat someones leftover food (Koi pyaar mein hi kisi ka jutha kha sakta hai) . Women from forest were generally beautiful in those days . They used to eat fruits , nuts , vegetables but scriptures showed that she was a old crippled women so that nobody questions any further about the incident. Why are women's morals usually questioned?2.In the Mahabharata, Pandav gambled and kept their bride, Mata Draupadi, on the line. Following the public stripping of her garments, her five husbands, along with other dignitaries like Bhism, Guru Dronacharya, and many more, chose to remain silent. Imagine the wife was used as a scapegoat for the husband's avarice for the crown . She was even divided among five brothers. When one was with her in the room they used to keep their footwear outside so that others can understand that one of the brother is having his turn .They didn't even ask her what she wanted. Imagine what kind of scriptures we follow .3.A man will be referred to as a Buddha if he leaves his home, wife, and children to enter the forest, while a woman's character will be questioned by society if she leaves her home, children, and husband to enter the forest. But u know what we women won't do that we don't run away from responsibility.4.Even in Jainism, it is said that women cannot achieve moksha, or liberation from the cycle of life and death. To achieve moksha, you must have another birth as a man and then follow the digambar Jain route walking naked, pulling your hair . What a philosophy, wow. Seems like women body is the only problem.5.In Islam first of all women must, cover her face and entire body when she is in public. Second, she is prohibited from entering the mosque since women's bowing during prayer can divert the attention of other men. She must follow the nikah halala procedure, which requires her to have physical relation with another person by getting married to them, if she wishes to get back to her 1st husband after her spouse has divorced her. After this second person gives divorce, she is free to go back to her original husband. Why only women have to go through this bogus custom?If this is our belief system and the culture we come from, then nothing will ever change in this modern era. In many modern households, the mother-in-law has passed down the same outdated mindset to her daughter-in-law‚Äîa mindset she inherited from her own mother-in-law‚Äîthat a woman‚Äôs sole purpose is to produce a male child. Shockingly, this still happens even in educated families, despite knowing that the gender of the child is determined by the male‚Äôs sperm (through the XY chromosomes). Yet, women are still blamed and made to feel guilty. If a woman is unable to conceive or gives birth to a girl instead of a boy, she is often harshly criticized and treated as if she has failed. What‚Äôs worse is that this pressure and cruelty often come from another woman‚Äîthe mother-in-law‚Äîwho fails to empathize, even though she is a woman herself . Do you really think education can bring equality and respect for women ?",

      "content_preview": "Not long ago, the government and its supporters were loudly anti-China. Every speech, every slogan, every social media post was about Galwan, boycotting Chinese goods, and standing firm against the dragon. If someone questioned the government's China policy even out of genuine concern they were immediately branded a China sympathizer or accused of being anti-national. It wasn‚Äôt about supporting China, it was about asking for clarity and accountability.Now Modi visits China, shakes hands, talks trade and diplomacy, and suddenly those same voices are giving lectures on GEOPOLITICS. They‚Äôre all about strategic partnerships, economic pragmatism, and mature diplomacy. The same people who once said ‚Äúno compromise‚Äù are now telling everyone to chill and understand the bigger picture.And this comes just months after Operation Sindoor, where China actively supported Pakistan during the conflict. According to Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Rahul R Singh, China was providing live battlefield intelligence to Pakistan, helping them track Indian military movements in real time. He even described the situation as having ‚Äúone border and two adversaries,‚Äù with China using Pakistan as a proxy to test its own military hardware.Galwan? Not a word. Martyrs? Forgotten. Criticism? Still unwelcome but now you're just ‚Äútoo emotional‚Äù or ‚Äúnot smart enough‚Äù to grasp foreign policy.It‚Äôs funny how patriotism gets rebranded when the handshake comes from the top.P.S. - Guys please don't comment  the same line 'No permanent friends or enemies in geopolitics. Only permanent interests.' again and again, you're making it too obvious where it is coming from. And if you're still commenting this then atleast mention what interests of India are going to be served here and how they will counter the USA tariffs.",

At the C counter (last counter), I was told that the Police will contact me soon.The police contacted me next day, came and collected all the documents I took to the Passport office with a signature. (did ask for some money which I gave) He left without saying much.I have no history with police and am a mere student. As I glance at the passport Seva website to track my status, it shows pending with police station. And after a grant has been processed from the local police station, the Police clearance certificate will be dispatched to me.My questions.I am going away from Bangalore to another state for 2 months in a few days, will my physical absence affect this process at the time of PCC delivery or anything else?Is this normal? The fact that PCC is getting delayed.Please help me understand if this is expected or if it's out of the ordinary.Unable to attach images, but here is the text associated with Status row:\"PCC application has been granted on 01/09/2025. Police Verification has been initiated and a request has been sent to XXXXXX Police station, Bengaluru. PCC will be dispatched to your current address after a 'Clear' Police Verification Report is received at the RPO. You would receive an sms once the PCC is ready for dispatch.\"",

As a kid i used to believe i could make a difference through sheer hardwork and excelling in my own domain.What‚Äôs the point of anything now? The very foundation of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù is corrupted. This didn‚Äôt even make headlines on Times Of India today. How crazy is that. Modi meeting putin(tentative )is still the main article. The media has been sold for so long.As a young man why should i continue to believe in the system that is so blatantly rigged against me.I gave up moving abroad cause i had faith that India will provide. But now it feels like sunlight through a prison cell window.Ask around in your friend group if they can recall one major fuxk up/scam of this government. None of my friends could üò≠. No govt is so perfect. What i‚Äôve noticed in my friend circle is people are just so unbothered. Idk if this the case with other generations as well.Hope i don‚Äôt go to jail over this rant jeez. ü§£",

      "content_preview": "It's a long post please bare with me. I don't have anyone to talk to or listen to me either.My parents went to Vellore a few weeks ago to get a proper diagnosis about their deteriorating health.My dad smokes ciggerate, one day he just coughed a few times and collapsed on the floor unconscious. My mother yelled and I rushed out of my room to see what happened. I saw my dad lying on the floor and I just went to shake him awake. He got back into conciousness a few seconds later and he wasn't even aware that he was lying on the floor.My mother has been losing weight since a year with low hemoglobin and since January her skin has been itching really bad. We went to a derma, the derma diagnosed scabies and gave her some meds and ointment. The meds didn't work even after a month of consistent use. So we went to another, he diagnosed scabies too and gave some powder. It didn't work either. And then another derma. Her skin itch was persistent with purple spots on her back and marks on her leg.So they went to Vellore CMC to get a proper diagnosis.Dad's report was pretty much normal the doctor just asked him to stop smoking.They ran multiple tests on my mother and the doctor said it could be myeloma. But they still wanted to do a bone marrow test to be sure. So they did the bone marrow test on 26th August (2 days ago). I didn't want to believe that it was cancer. I just thought she is losing weight because of her poor diet and she doesn't drink enough water throughout the day. I used to go after her poking her to drink water every hour but I wasn't very consistent with my poking.So I just didn't want to believe it was cancer. I mean doctor were just guessing until the bone marrow results came.The bone marrow results came yesterday and I just can't stop crying ever since. It's not curable. And patients always relapse. I don't know how will everything figure out.They are coming back on 8th September so we will figure it out then.I still had studies to do and now me and mom might have to shift to Kolkata for weekly chemotherapy. This is going to hamper my studies severely. Dad will stay in the hometown because someone has to earn.I am also worried about my mother. She can't handle pain she crys over littlest stuffs. And I have heard chemo is extremely painful. People vomit, get fever and body aches and fatigue. I just can't imagine seeing her in so many pain.Why did it have to be cancer... She didn't deserve this.",

      "content_preview": "My close friend,Amrit Tiwari (22, from Indore, MP), was working at a shop nearTis Hazari Court, Delhi. On3rd September 2025 around 2 PM, he was declared dead atHindu Rao Hospital(Casualty No: CYO9/46083).The situation feels very suspicious:The shop owner has suddenly fled.The boy who was living with him is missing.Amrit was healthy and young.When we went toTis Hazari Chowki, instead of helping us, the police (led bySI Sandeep Mathur)refused to file an FIR or conduct a postmortem, which is normally mandatory in such cases. Instead, we were harassed and discouraged from pursuing the matter.This has left us completely helpless. Without FIR or postmortem, evidence is being lost, and we strongly suspect bribery and foul play.üëâ I am reaching out to this community to ask:What immediate steps can we take legally?How can we ensure FIR and postmortem are done?Are there NGOs, lawyers, or journalists in Delhi who can help?How do I make this issue reach higher authorities like Delhi Police HQ or NHRC?I have already tried filing complaints online (NHRC, Vigilance, ACB), but the system feels slow. Meanwhile, the police are blocking us.Any advice, connections, or even just helping spread this will mean the world. Amrit was only 22 ‚Äî he deserves justice. His family deserves answers.What can I do right now to make sure FIR and postmortem are conductedPLEASE HELP SHAIRING THIShttps://x.com/neelu_shailesh/status/1963532824138616966",

THESE PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO AFFORD THIS HOTEL FOR THE FUNCTION, BUT NO MONEY FOR THE FOOD FOR US.So, we were told to reach hotel by 8:30-9:00. A tourist vehicle picked us from campus and dropped us off at the hotel.Since we had to wake up too early to get ready and reach there, no one could have had breakfast (hostels usually serve breakfast after 8).When we entered the hotel, we saw everyone having breakfast, so our senior asked the NDTV team first if we were allowed, to have breakfast. They said yes, around 9:50 (in batches of 2 students). When our seniors went there, the team head of NDTV (an old lady) shouted at them and made them stop eating. When they had just begun, some of them had to leave their untouched coffee, scolded in such a manner, and one criedd, just because they were having breakfast????That was not the end, during the whole session, we were treated as outcasts (mind you, they invited us with great excitement and respect to attend the event), the same lady kept scolding.Cool, we had no breakfast. Coming forward to lunch, we were told that we would be served lunch, very clearly. Guess what? They made us exit right in front of the people who were having lunch, standing in queue for the buffet.And we with empty stomachs and tired brains, were made to exit, right in front of the food and they handed us a small-sized pizza at the end, and that was it.I hope someone from other media channels notice it and publish itt",

From childhood, parents pamper us but are also extremely overprotective‚Äî‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go here, don‚Äôt go there.‚ÄùNo late outings, no hanging out with boys, and even if you‚Äôre allowed to go out, it‚Äôs usually only with female friends that too only in the day and not too far away places inside 5km radius lol!Endless questions: ‚ÄúWhere are you? With whom?‚Äù followed by sharing live locations. Honestly, the whole fun of going out gets ruined. And for context-i dont want to smoke, drink, or have boyfriends(even if I ever dated it should be my own experience I mean dating having heartbreaks itself is called living a life especially in these times, if I don't how would I ever know right n wrong or how to interact with the opposite gender in future) I Just want to explore places n build friendships ...Then when it comes to competitive exams, parents say, ‚ÄúWhy study so much, you‚Äôll get married anyway.‚Äù But later they turn around and ask, ‚ÄúWhy are you always at home, go out and enjoy!‚Äù The same people who restricted us from making friends when the time was to build friendships explore and gain  independence suddenly expect us to be outgoing, confident, and independent. I feel like I have lost interest in emotional investing in friendships or going out cause of these scenarios in my life right now!It makes me wonder: in many Western cultures, children are encouraged from a young age to be independent, build their own personality, and make choices. That early freedom shapes their character. In India, it often feels like we‚Äôre held back until suddenly expected to handle adulthood flawlessly.Do others here feel the same? How did you deal with this contradiction in parenting?edit-used chatgpt forbettert grammarEDIT 2-PLEASE DON'T REPLY WITH OH IT'S FOR UR SAFETY I WISH THEY DID THIS WITH MEN ONLY THEN THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW RESTRICTED WE FEEL IN EVERYTHING WE DO!",

There is something about the energy, and always new scenarios showing up.But it's crazy how people want to scam me so bad all the time, it's just part of their business model at this point, today I took a long taxi ride with a guy on Uber, before we would arrive into that city he told me that the road was closed because of landside and that we have to find a hotel for the night.Ofc he brought me to a place where his accomplice would try to overcharge me for the night and confirm the road was locked.Unlucky for them I figured it out, I told the staff that they had 2options, 1) call me another taxi and we forget about this, 2) i would still leave on my own and give them a 1 stare review mentioning their scam tentative.They ended up calling a taxi for me, but what annoys me the most is that first driver with who I spent 6hours, he didn't give a sh*t about making me lose my time, eventually losing the night I previously booked etc. It just make me rethink about the entire humanity.I'll report him badly to Uber and hopefully he is losing his right to drive on that app.And my point is, I would not tell my mom, my sister or my friends to come here, it's just so much scams going on and many people have bad intentions towards you. In just 2days I withnessed so many tentatives..",

      "content_preview": "This incident happened a month ago but I am writing about it now because I recently discovered that he (A) is also a disgusting casteist (though not directed to my sister as she's not \"LC\" ugh).I returned from coaching and found my sister (in 11th) standing in front of the mirror. Before I could even put my bag down, she asked me if she was really that dark. I knew something was wrong the moment I heard that. My sister is already insecure by nature. She often makes small jokes about her complexion but this time her tone was different. It was a genuine question.When I pressed her to tell me what had happened, she finally admitted that at school, while she was writing, A came over, picked up a sticky note, tore it in half and tried to stick it to her forehead. When she instinctively leaned back, he reached out further, placed it on her forehead, called her ‚ÄúIyer‚Äù (from TMKOC), and then laughed hysterically, other students also laughing with him. My sister immediately brushed it off.To be clear, I have no issue with her being called Iyer because personally, I admire the actor who played that role in TMKOC as despite not being given much material, he still made the character enjoyable, and in some story arcs even showed his real acting talent.But we all know what he really meant by doing that. His actions were not just dehumanizing to my sister but also disrespectful to people who wear the white tilak on their foreheads (like Gukesh, for example). And this crude mentality of equating darker skin tones with South Indians is not only ignorant but also revolting.I know this is nothing new. It happens everywhere in India ‚Ä¢but what irritates me is that this particular guy constantly parades himself as someone who \"respects every culture and race.\" A Korean influencer gets called Chinese in the UK and he posts a story: ‚ÄúStop Asian Hate.‚Äù Someone on the other side of the world faces discrimination for their skin colour and he posts: ‚Äú#BlackLivesMatter.‚ÄùSo does his basic empathy extend only to foreigners? Or is it something about the foreign land that makes colourism (or internalized racism/racism) more of a serious issue? It baffles me how Indians rage when one of us is discriminated against abroad but the same people laugh off the racism and colourism that festers within our own country, against our own people, by us. Does a fellow Indian in India, not deserve to be treated with the same dignity?[One more thing I'd like to clear is that I'm not accusing a whole bunch of people of being like him but there are certainly more people like A and neither I'm mad that he compared her to a \"South Indian\", please don't get distracted halfway and stick to the post's spirit.]A little vent: Fck you, A. Your favourite rapper Drake and your beloved Miles Morales would hate a casteist and colourist like you.",

      "content_preview": "Two years ago, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S22 from Amazon India. Recently, it was affected by the notorious green line issue, a widespread problem with AMOLED screens.I took the phone to a Samsung service center, and initially, they were ready to replace the screen for free under their special policy for this issue. However, they later denied the free repair. The reason? The phone's activation date was before the invoice date from my Amazon purchase. According to Samsung's records, the phone was activated before I even bought it.I contacted Samsung support, and they confirmed this discrepancy. They told me that because the activation date didn't match the invoice, they couldn't honor the repair, and told me to take it up with the seller, Amazon.When I reached out to Amazon support, they were completely clueless. They kept insisting that the phone was out of warranty and there was nothing they could do. After a frustrating and heated conversation, they finally said they might be able to help if I could provide an official letter from Samsung, with a seal, confirming the activation date issue.The problem is, Samsung support has no process for providing such a letter. They only send emails, which Amazon refuses to accept. It feels like I'm stuck in a never-ending loop between two giants, with no one willing to take responsibility. It's clear to me that Amazon most likely sold me a refurbished phone as new, and now I'm paying the price.TL;DR: I bought a \"new\" Galaxy S22 from Amazon India. It developed the green line issue, but Samsung denied a free repair because the phone's activation date was before my purchase date, suggesting Amazon sold me a used or refurbished unit. Amazon is refusing to help without an official letter from Samsung, which Samsung can't provide.",

      "content_preview": "I have Jio as a second number; I just use it to get OTPs. For years, I kept getting calls with the same script:‚ÄúSir, it‚Äôs been a while since your last recharge. Your number will be deactivated tomorrow. Please recharge now.‚ÄùAt first, I didn‚Äôt know the rules, and I‚Äôll be honest,,  I panic recharged a couple of times just to avoid ‚Äúdeactivation.‚Äù Money down the drain.One day, I finally googled the rules and realized the threat is straight-up bullshit. There‚Äôs a90-day non-usagerule for prepaidnumber deactivation, plus a‚Çπ20 retentionoption and a15-day graceperiod afterward. Also,incoming calls count as usage.So basically, what that means is the minute I answer their scare call, the 90-day clock resets. Kind of hilarious how their own call undercuts their threat.Since then, I‚Äôve confronted agents a few times. To be fair, most are underpaid call-center folks reading a script. The problem is the script. Yesterday, I finally escalated and filed a complaint onCPGRAMS. The response I got was basically:‚ÄúWe will take it as feedback, sir. We‚Äôll stop such calls for your number.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs not good enough. This isn‚Äôt just me; I‚Äôve seen similar cases offline and on Reddit. It‚Äôs apattern. It‚Äôs scummy, and itdepends on people not knowing the rules. NAL, but this definitely seems illegal.What TRAI actually says:No prepaid number deactivation before 90 days of non-usage.‚ÄúUsage‚Äù includes incoming/outgoing calls, outgoing SMS, data, VAS.Any activity resets the 90-day clock.If your main balance is ‚â• ‚Çπ20, they mustretainthe number by auto-deducting up to ‚Çπ20 for30 more days(and can do this repeatedly).Even after deactivation, there‚Äôs a15-day graceperiod toreactivateby paying up to ‚Çπ20.Yourplan's validitycan expire, and services can be barred ‚Äî butnumber deactivationis a different thing and must follow the rules above.So when someone says,‚ÄúWe‚Äôll deactivate you tomorrow‚Äù, it‚Äôsan obvious lieunless you truly hadzeroactivity for90 straight daysandthe other safeguards were followed. And it's impossible for that not to be a lie cuz you just picking up that phone proves that your phone number is active.‚ÄúOthers haven‚Äôt complained no sir....‚Äù That's what the Jio care dude said when I asked for such calls to stop for everyone, not just me.That‚Äôs exactly the issue. Awareness is low, and they are abusing it. They already created a duopoly market, and that money is not enough for them. Now they are relying on lying and illegal shit to steal more money. Lots of folks hand over money because the word ‚Äúdeactivation‚Äù freaks them out, cuz people have their numbers linked to lots of shit, and they don't wanna lose it.If you get similar calls, try torecord the callsif you can, or at least note date/time/number. Then you can do the following things-File a government grievance on CPGRAMS (DoT)Go tohttps://pgportal.gov.in/Sign in(orClick here to sign up‚Üí register ‚Üí sign in)Top menuGrievance ‚Üí Lodge Public GrievancePlease select a Ministry/Department/State Government:TelecommunicationsMinistry / Department:Department of TelecommunicationsSelect main category:Mobile RelatedSelect next level category:UCC related complaintsMobile Number: enter your numberService Provider: selectJio(or Airtel if they‚Äôre doing the same scummy shit)Text of grievance: type your details or paste a template (see below)Template you can paste(feel free to edit to fit your case, or just use GPT or something to generate one ez):I am receiving repeated calls and messages from Jio stating ‚Äúyour number will be deactivated tomorrow unless you recharge.‚Äù This is misleading and coercive. As per TRAI rules, prepaid deactivation requires at least 90 days of non-usage; activity includes incoming/outgoing calls, outgoing SMS, data, and VAS. If balance ‚â• ‚Çπ20 the number must be retained by up to ‚Çπ20 deduction for 30 days, and there is a 15-day grace to reactivate. Threatening next-day deactivation misrepresents the regulatory framework and induces panic recharges. I request action under TCCCPR 2018 and DoT directions to stop such scare tactics, correct agent scripts, and ensure compliance. Please treat this as a systemic issue, not only my number. I can provide call dates/times, numbers/headers, and recordings/screenshots.2)Report as UCC (spam) right away.Just theTRAI DND appto report the call.btw ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt already haveDNDenabled, please do it now. It takes a minute and cuts most promo spam:  SMSSTART 0to1909‚Üí blocks all promotional calls/SMS.(but these scare scum calls get through even if you have DND on)3) If you want to do even more to fix this, you can also take up the TRAI course of action: follow the official grievance chain via your operator (log a formal complaint and get a docket) ‚Üí escalate to the Appellate Authority for your circle if it isn‚Äôt fixed within the timeline. Look up the TRAI website for specific steps and contact info for your specific area.This scummy stuff only stops if we push back together. Don‚Äôt feed into such tactics. Know your rights, report, and share the info with others.",
