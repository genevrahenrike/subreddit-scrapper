      "content_preview": "My friend 24F, joined Bhatia along with me after our graduation. Those 7-8 months i went to all classes, wrote notes, gave tests, lived in a cramped pg and basically had a shitty life. During those same months, she‚Äôd skip the classes, get printed notes, explored the city with her non medico friends, went to gym, basically had a glow up. From looking normal like all students, she started looking posh and proper. Cut to exam, both of us got bad ranks. I got 65k, she didn‚Äôt qualify. Following months, i took another drop, made my parents trust me and told them I‚Äôll definitely get good scores next time. Meanwhile she got married to an architect, whose parents are doctors and own a huge hospital in a tier 1 city, travelled to Europe Japan and Bali and enjoyed her life. She‚Äôs a single child, he‚Äôs a single child, they now live in the costliest society in the city in their own penthouse. Cut to this year, despite trying hard, i got a similar rank to last year, more worse i should say. Parents have lost their trust in me. They‚Äôll arrange money and join me somewhere in private. I‚Äôll have to live with the burden my whole life. She on the other hand qualified this time. Her in-laws are getting her a derma seat in a private college for 3.75cr. In the future she‚Äôll takeover the hospital and employ somebody like me to work for her. She might have her struggles too let‚Äôs give her that, but she‚Äôs also extremely lucky. Tldr: just ranting about my friend who got very lucky in life.",

      "content_preview": "Well I got a decent rank in this year neet pg (<1000). This is an advice my own medicine PG gave me and I think this is very relevant since we have more than 200 videos in reputed apps for studying medicine. In the end the only thing that matters is whether u get enough number of questions correct in tests. I think out of the 20 q that get asked in medicine 10 can be answered from path micro and pharmac. Atleast 60 percent of remaining questions can be answered by studying pyq and py topics that is available in good qb and same topics get repeated again like MS, Parkinson and scleroderma etc.. The mistake I made for inicet was that I wasted some time for studying medicine and tried to finish it. In an exam like neet pg if you waste time watching 6 videos of SLE and in the end when people ask what is the most common symptom of SLE and u r not able to answer it then what is the whole point. We as people who pursue mbbs have a natural tendency to read more. But if reading more is not getting translated into more questions correct then what is the whole point of preparing for entrance. I studied medicine by taking some time in April. Before studying medicine I used to get 10 questions correct in GTs. After I put some weeks into medicine in the immediate GTs following it I was able to make it into 16 or 15 q at the cost of losing marks in other subjects. Then after 3 weeks again my number of questions dropped to 10q. When I tried revising 200 chapters I understood I forgot everything in a month and I only focused on pyqs instead. In a rat race like NEET PG I feel like making 200 videos of medicine can only affect our preparation in a bad way.  Having said this much I myself am going to take medicine but please keep in mind that reading about treacherous 13 and faithless 14 in diabetes for neet pg where diabetes itself isn't that important other than the pharmacological aspects of  it can do more harm than good.",

In an ideal world, we would get answer key exactly like coaching platforms' GT. Exact questions with exact options with your marked answer and a full explanation. Obviously this can't happen with NEET-PG because every other idiot will challenge every other question and all of us will be busy with court cases & whatnot rather than moving on. I saw one post saying why haven't they shared answers, how am I supposed to remember what I marked? BhaiüòÇüòÇ that isn't their issue, even neet ug is calculated based on OMR response not what you ticked in your question paper. People who have watched multiple recalls from different coachings/sources and considered all controversial questions as negative have scored similar marks. This answer key has been released for those people who were claiming to have attempted X amount of questions and were refusing to believe that they could be wrong. This answer key is helpful for those who were claiming mathematically impossible scores, they can now tally their marks. This isn't for you guys who were waiting for exact questions to be released üòÇ Exact questions with your marked option and correct answer isn't possible because- it's NBE, not Marrow. They actually do have limited questions as understood by this year's paper. It's not even logical. There are a lot of questions where multiple options can be contested based on different literature. Several questions can have varied interpretation and treatment. This is not maths, you can't have just one single answer. End of the day, you have to accept the exam setter's answer. Your coaching faculty's answer doesn't matter, it's a tough pill to swallow ik. The entire motive behind this post is that let's move on from this. Some of us will attend counselling, others will study. There's no point banging our heads over NBE (who have still done a decent job this year).",

And based on the feedback I‚Äôve received from there and the kind of work that I‚Äôve done, I know my worth and that is more than enough than any rank NEETPG can give",

It will hurt you being a general candidate(I am) seeing your sc/sc batchmates coming to college in car, having apple products. But you hardly can afford a bike.(I always favours reservation, if right person avails the benifit) Another reservation no one talks about is money.. people having money can buy anything from mbbs to pg to mch.. MOST People having EWS certificates and getting seats are not actually EWS. Thanks to corruption Your hardwork or intelligence can only gives you a seat of mbbs, pg or Mch. But when it comes to getting a job of SR OR AP only money and connections matter in 90 percent cases. Even after doing mbbs pg or ss from central university or tope colleges. It's very difficult to establish yourself in market if you are first generation doctor with no family money. Earning money and living a goot life after engineering is a better option.( If you can get a central university in mbbs you can easily get a computer science seat in a good eng. College) Think about it. Most of the friends you make in mbbs will show their true colours in internship and leave you. The ones  who stay with you will stay for life . Being a doctor is a very demanding and hard working job. Do it if you really love this friend.. please don't come here for money. May be you will earn money but it will cost you your whole adulthood and give you lots of stress.. not worth the money you get.. And please don't blindly follow these all med influencers.. most of them are fake.. they are just warning money making by looking cool and making you fool. All the statement I made are genuine, can give at least 5 example on each statement. Kindly reply if have any doubt.. Thankyou...",

      "content_preview": "I've read a lot of posts on Reddit criticizing Neet PG and saying it's all about memorization, and that there are no concepts and all. But what separates the sheep from the GOATs, is the strategy. The secret to cracking the exam lies in how good you are at predicting what can be asked based on the previous papers, and then studying that in the last 10-15 days before the exam. Yes, you need a good grasping power, but simply chalking up your bad result to 'Im just not good at memorization' is not the way to go. You need to refine your strategy, and put in the work. You need to get inside the examiner's head and think and study the way they think and study. That is not an easy feat, it takes a lot of figuring out. Most medicos are too used to being spoon fed notes and content, they're not willing to put in the work themselves to figure out what to actually study and what not to study. So for all those preparing for Neet PG'26, don't blame the game, refine your strategy",

      "content_preview": "Heyy! I am seeing a lot of posts on this sub asking people for advice and a lot of DMs after I randomly mentioned my rank in a previous post. So here are a few things I want to tell people who are attempting the next INI or NEET. Please do not listen to any med influencer or any coaching faculty who will always have thousands of advice to give you. Sure, take inspiration from them but no plan works the same for 2 people. For instance, there were multiple faculties asking to revise quickly and revise 6-7 times possible and there were others who said just 3 revisions were enough if you do them properly. Always ask yourself what kind of person you are. Do you read quickly or are you always slow? Think about how you study and then make a plan that is best for you. 2) From the beginning itself, I had a book called - \"Things my poor brain cannot handle.\" These were filled with very confusing things that I noted down. For instance: The components of different MEN syndromes Causes of different Renal Tubular Acidosis Electrolyte abnormalities seen in Refeeding syndrome, tumor lysis etc. Vectors of different diseases Types of erythemas in Dermat The moment I realise that my brain is getting these things missed up - however little they were, I wrote them down. I went back to this note whenever I wanted to read about them again. 3) Making a 20th notebook is not a mandatory. I made so many small notes but ended up revising none of them for the exam. I just read my main Bhatia notes for my last revision. But if you are planning to make one, do it only during your second to final or final read! If you make the notebook in the beginning itself, you will want to write everything in the 20th notebook and it will be as big as your notes. By the end, you will know the topics that you forget frequently and the 20th notebook will be crisp. Don't attempt to use anybody else's 20th notebook. That's not how it should work. 4) BTR is a great preparation source. I have watched all videos and loved her videos. But I only edited my original Bhatia notes to include some of the content. That made me feel like the notes were complete. Doing BTR or not doing it should depend solely on where you are at your preparation phase. If you have read your main notes twice or thrice and feel like you are getting bored of them, watching BTR can feel like a breathe of fresh air for sure. 5) Have an accountability partner, especially if you studying alone from home. I had several close friends who motivated me and I wrote my GTs with one of them. We fixed a time and then discussed the GTs for the entire day. It helped both of us a lot. He got a 1.4K rank too. . . . 2024 was my first attempt without a single ounce of preparation. I never had Marrow or Prep during my college life. I read from normal Indian textbooks, maybe a little above average student. I had the most wonderful college life and internship and I have absolutely no regrets. The drop year was essential for my physical and mental health. . . . Also, finally a lot of this exam is pure luck. Anybody who ranks between 500 - 10K have put in the same amount of grind to prepare. It's unfair that some of them gets stellar ranks while some don't get what they deserve. I was quite sad with my 4K rank too because I thought I had studied enough to get a three digit rank but ultimately, I will only end up where I am destined to. You can ask me anything about my preparation. I will be happy to help and answer in any way.",

      "content_preview": "Yesterday I had posted a ‚Äújust to give hope‚Äù (GT score 60 to 163 in NEET) Post and many had messaged me asking about my prep journey, so I thought it would be helpful for all as a post. BACKGROUND I think its important to tell what my base level was before you start reading this. If you are somebody who has scored more than 75% in all Proff exams or if you have started early during college years, I dont think this post might be useful for you except for the gamechanger part. Rest you can skip and save time. I was an average student during MBBS. Did not use marrow or anything during MBBS. Didnt even bother to start studying in internship. So started studying only in August 2024. SOURCE Before even starting with my classes , I gave a GT to understand where I stand. It was at 60 correct. My primary source for all subjects was Bhatia live classes. No regrets at all.. I read the  notes right after a subject was over and did the Marrow QBank of the subject as much as i can along with it(Marrow Plan B). Completed all the live videos and first read by mid January. From mid January, I started BTR along with the first revision. It took me about 2-3 months for the first revision. I did not consolidate everything to btr as many do, i didnt believe i need to waste time over making new things. These are the only sources I used for the subjects. Honestly, Stop worrying about content of the sources, all provide the same thing. What actually matters is if you are able to retain what you already have with you. There are tons of strategy videos out there, and I KNOW how confusing it was for me. I honestly think nobody can decide how your day looks like other than you. So please dont get overwhelmed. Even if you are following someone else's strategy make sure you dont lose your own method in it. What I do want to do is to let people be aware of the tools I used that are not usually mentioned in the sub which are GOLD GAME CHANGERS / HOLY GRAIL 1. Pixorize ‚Äì TRUST ME. Biochemistry, Genetics  Vitamins are going to be a cakewalk for you. You will not dread the subject or topic ever again. Autosomal Dominant or Autosomal Recessive, not even a teeny weeny confusion will come to your mind deciding which is which. 2. Sketchy ‚Äì For Micro and Pharmac. If I was rich enough, I would have found the guy who made Sketchy and built a Taj Mahal for him. I don‚Äôt think I can forget the side effects, the mechanism of action of drugs even if I wanted to. The bugs will be your besties soon. 3. Ninja Nerd ‚Äì I used it for some stuff in Physiology like stretch reflex and all complicated things like Renal System. Maan, that guy literally took my brain into his hand and carved the concepts in it. I seriously don‚Äôt know why people are not talking about these three enough, especially when these 3 subjects are the ones people mostly struggle with remembering. I swear I am not kidding when I say I hadn‚Äôt revised these 3 subjects in the last 10 days because the pictorial mnemonics will get engraved into your head for years. Spend some time to watch these things I said in the beginning prep phase, you are gonna save TONS of time in subsequent revision. GT and qbank I gave a total of 22 GTs in total. 18 from marrow and rest in Cerebellum since they were free. Till January I gave one GT per month, Later increased the frequency. This is how my GT corrects progressed over the year in marrow- 60-85-90-106-102-117-127-127-131-127-143-134-142-140-147-152-154-153 One day before GT, i used to give 2 hrs to read my sticky notes and screenshots. I wasnt able to finish it with 2 hrs, but something is better than nothing. This really did help me. I completed 599/829 qbanks in marrow. What i would recommend is to NOT add anything more into your notes from it that are not made correct by more than 50% people. If less than 50% got it correct, leave it. When you do qstns just after you read the subject for the first time, it helps to re enforce and apply what you learnt. I feel many people begin to think of mcqs as a testing tool during the first read itself and get disheartened when they get many mcqs wrong. BUT its NOTTTT a testing tool in the first read, its just to apply and re enforce what you read 2 days back. MCQs become testing tool only after your 1/2nd revision. So do mcqs early, dont wait to finish one entire cycle. This is what I realised that helped me later. NOTES I made handwritten notes for all the subjects and I personally believe it will help in photographic memory, but my opinion could be biased. if you are asking me which to use, I would always say HW notes. PROGRESS INICET NOV - 17000 INICET MAY - 7** NEET 24 - 1,40,000 NEET 25 - 15** I am not a good writer ü•≤ü•π, so please feel free to ask your questions since I don‚Äôt know how to write things out of the blue . I will certainly answer it. All the best and Good Job reading till here !! :))",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I‚Äôm from the 2018 MBBS batch and I recently secured an All India Rank of 2XX in NEET PG. I thought I‚Äôd share my preparation journey and what specifically worked for me, hoping it might help someone out there. 1. First Read For my first read, I mainly followed Marrow Rapid Revision (RR) for all subjects except Medicine. Subjects where Marrow RR felt extremely useful for me: Biochemistry, ENT, Ophthalmology, PSM, OBG, Surgery, Dermatology 2. Subject-specific resources Microbiology & Pathology ‚Äì Preeti Sharma Anatomy ‚Äì Ashwini Kumar Pharma - GRG Medicine ‚Äì Deepak Marwah RR for concepts + T&Ds from Dilip Kumar** PSM - i had watched Neha Taneja youtube question discussions in addition to Marrow Epidemiology and biostatistics question discussions on youtube was extremely useful 3. Revision Strategy Did 3 full revisions of Zainab Vora‚Äôs BTR which I found much more manageable than bulky RR notes. BTR was super helpful for integrated subjects and short subjects . Made sure to do at least 3 rounds of EnDs from Zainab ma‚Äôam as well. 4. Active Recall Used Anki extensively. Created personalised decks for every subject ‚Äî this was a game-changer for me in retaining content long-term. 5. Peer Group Had a small WhatsApp group with just 4-5 friends at a similar prep level. We shared questions, discussed concepts, and clarified doubts. Surprisingly, many actual exam questions ended up being from our group discussions. 6.On Resources All the resources I mentioned are easily available on Telegram and YouTube. Don't get stuck in FOMO - you don't need to do everything. The key is to choose what works best for you and then stick to it for multiple revisions. üí°** Final thoughts:** Find resources that you can stick with and revise multiple times ‚Äî not just what‚Äôs ‚Äúpopular.‚Äù Active recall and spaced repetition (Anki, BTR revisions) made a massive difference for me. A good peer group is underrated ‚Äî it keeps you motivated and sharp. Best of luck to everyone preparing! üöÄ Edit: For people asking for my anki decks , ANKI works best when its personalised and based on your shortcomings. If it has 1000 notes made by another person u are gonna be stuck. I made mine based on my mistakes (max 200-300 notes) and stuff which is volatile to me. If u still think you need it, DM me",

      "content_preview": "For my introduction, Hey everyone I'm currently pursuing MD Pathology from a central institute. I'm making this post because u/CupNo5298 suggested that I should share my views on Pathology as a branch and what to expect from it. Pathology needs no introduction regarding it's importance as a branch. Likely from your exposure during 2nd year of MBBS and maybe from internship you might have a rough outer perspective of this branch so I'll discuss what people don't know and what you should know before entering into residency. This is going to be a very long and exhaustive post but you will get a proper idea of the pathology as a branch. A. UNITS OR SUBSPECIALITIES IN PATHOLOGY Pathology department in most of the colleges have the following units/subspecialties:- 1. The OG \"HISTOPATHOLOGY\" Histopathology deals with the solid tissues/organs and all the biopsies that clinicians send from various departments. Here the tissue is processed in a stepwise manner and the slides are prepared which are seen under microscope and depending upon findings a diagnosis is made. In my college Histopathology has further three subunits - Surgery, UroGyne and Special reporting (Special includes dermapath, nephropath, neuropath, pulmonary biopsies, special gastro biopsies, cardiac biopsies and transplant rejection related biopsies) How histopathology works? I) On the 1st day we will receive samples ranging from small skin punch biopsy to Modified radical mastectomy or Whipple's specimen. The tissue we receive is not fixed so we make multiple cuts on the large organs at a distance of 1 cm while preserving it's anatomical orientation. After making cuts we put the specimen in formalin overnight. II) On 2nd day the specimens are fixed and we \"gross\" the specimen. Grossing means that we take small sections from the diseased part and surrounding normal part, for example for a tumor we will take a section from tumor area (tumor proper) and surrounding normal looking area to look for the extent/infiltration of the tumor. And grossing requires a good knowledge of anatomy so that when you're grossing you should know proper orientation of the specimen for example you should know how to differentiate anterior and posterior surface of uterus so that you can identify whether attached fallopian tube and ovary is right or left sided. III) After grossing the sections are processed overnight and on the 3rd day they are sent into embedding area. In embedding the tissues are put into wax according to the orientation required by the pathologist. IV) On 4th day the embedded specimens are taken into the cutting section where very thin slices of tissue are taken over a slide and mostly on the same day or a day after the routine (H&E) staining of the tissue is done. V) After this (4-5 days later) the slides along with forms are given to the PGs and SRs. So on the 4th day the slides are seen by residents and they make their differential in accordance to the history, clinical and radiological findings. VI) On 5th day the slides are seen by consultant and reports are made. But there are special scenarios :- a) Regross and More sections - The sections taken didn't have adequate tissue or some representative tissue was not seen on the slide. (Takes 2 more days for the new slide to come) b) Special stains - If required, consultants can ask to apply special stains on tissues like ZN to look for AFB, Giemsa to look for H. Pylori, Reticulin for fibrosis etc. (Takes 1 more day) c) IHC (Immunohistochemistry) - For this tissue blocks are cut again and then they are processed overnight for antigens to come on the surface and then the IHC markers (antibodies) are applied. (Takes 1 or 2 more days for the slide to come) d) DIF (Direct Immunofluorescence) - It's done in a dedicated room and slides are stored in refrigerator. (Takes 1 or 2 more days). e) Decalcification (Decal) - Bony tissues are not processed immediately. They are kept in a decal solution to soften the bone so that it can be cut without distorting the tissue. (Takes a few days to weeks). f) Re-embed - If the tissue section was not according to the specific orientation of the pathologist then the embedding is done again and subsequent cutting and staining is repeated. (Takes 1 or 2 more days) g) Repeat cuts - In this part of tissue was cut very superficial then deep cuts, better cuts, thin cuts etc are asked by consultants. So cutting and staining is repeated. (Takes 1 or 2 more days) VII) After all of the above things the handwritten report is made and signed by consultant. Then these handwritten reports are typed on the same or next day. Following that the typed report is verified by PG/SR and then it's sent to the consultant for signing and if no mistakes are pointed out then the final signed report if given to the concerned person. This is the reason why Histopathology reports can take 10-15 days to prepare. 2. The special posting under Histopathology \"AUTOPSY Posting\" Pathology residents are posted in mortuary alongside forensic residents to learn the forensic pathology. Many medicolegal pathology specimens are routinely received in histopathology department and the expert opinions are given as requested and required by the court of law. 3. The lesser known \" CYTOPATHOLOGY\". In cytology unit again there are subunits as described :- I) FNA/FNAC unit - In this unit the FNAC (Fine needle aspiration cytology) samples are routinely taken from the lumps/swellings/lesions by the pathologist. The detailed history of the patient is taken by PG residents following which the local examination findings are written and then the FNA is performed. II) The Imaging Guided Cytology - USG guided or EBUS guided FNA samples are taken in this. In this the difference is that the patient doesn't come toY pathologist instead the pathologist has to go to the designated place. So what's the difference between the FNA and Imaging guided FNA unit? It's nothing except that the pathologist has to go to the different department for ROSE (Rapid On-Site Evaluation) of the adequacy of the sample taken by clinician/radiologist. III) Fluids and Imprint Cytology - In this the fluid samples and various types of Imprints are received or taken by the pathologist. IV) Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) - This units mostly deals with the PAP smear related gyne samples. Instead of conventional PAP smear made by the pathologist, the SurePath or ThinPrep machines prepares the high quality slides. This method can be used for other samples also. How Cytology works? a) On the 1st day history is taken, local examination findings are written and samples are taken and slides are made. b) On the same day slides are processed and stained and by the evening the slides are given to PG/SR. c) On the 2nd day the reporting is done by the consultant and a handwritten report is made which is then typed, verified and the final printed report is signed by the consultant. d) Special Scenarios :- ‚Ä¢ Restaining slides - Takes 1 more day. ‚Ä¢ Destain and then restain - Takes 1 more day ‚Ä¢ Inadequate sample - Whole FNA is Repeated ‚Ä¢ The Cell Block - Sometimes the sampling needle is rinsed into a cell block vial. Then the cell block vial is centrifuged and cell pellet is made by various methods (We use Thrombin method). Then this pellet is treated like a tissue sample and processed in histopathology unit as I have described above. (Takes 2-3 more days) The cytology came into existence so that clinicians can ascertain quickly whether the lesion they are dealing with is benign or malignant without taking a biopsy. So cytology reports are made quickly unlike Histopathology. 4. The Bread and Butter \" HEMATOLOGY\" Hematology needs no introduction but this unit also has subunits. I) The OPD and Ward Reporting - In this the CBC and peripheral smear reports are prepared by PGs and SRs. II) The HPLC and Coagulation unit - Here the hemoglobinopathies and coagulopathies are diagnosed respectively. III) The Bone Marrow unit - In this unit the bone marrows are either done bedside by the pathologist on requisition or the clinicians perform bone marrow biopsy themselves and send the samples to the hematology lab. The Bone marrow aspiration slides are prepared and stained on the same day and reported by consultants on the next day. However as I have already mentioned, the bone marrow biopsy is kept in a decal solution for decalcification. It takes 2-3 days for biopsy to de-calcify following which it is sent to Histopathology lab where it is processed like a normal biopsy. So the bone marrow biopsy report preparation can take 10-15 days depending upon how quickly bone decalcifies, the normal histopathology processing and if any special IHC is applied on the biopsy. IV) The Flowcytometry Unit - In this unit the various bone marrow aspirate samples are processed and CD markers are applied to reach a definite diagnosis of leukemia. 5. The Phantom limb of Hematology \"BLOOD BANK AND TRANSFUSION MEDICINE\" Here residents are posted for a month. Some institutes have 24 hour blood bank duty whereas some institutes have only working hours duty. Here PGs learn about Blood typing, processing and storage of various blood components and how to manage a transfusion reaction. 6. The shy one \"CLINICAL PATHOLOGY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE\" In this unit many routine samples are processed like urine, stool samples, serum studies, semen analysis etc. 7. The uncommon one \"CYTOGENETICS AND MOLECULAR UNIT\" Unfortunately my college doesn't have this unit so I cannot share my views on it. B. The WORKING HOURS Working hours will depend upon whether your college is peripheral or central. In peripheral colleges you may get free by 5 PM. Since my college is central and has a lot of workload my working hours vary depending upon the unit I'm in. The following timings are of a 1st year PG resident. ‚Ä¢ Histopathology - Morning 8/9 AM to Evening 7/8/9/10 PM ‚Ä¢ Cytology - Morning 8/9 AM to Evening 6:30/7/8 PM ‚Ä¢ Hematology and Clinical Pathology - Morning 8/9 AM to Evening 6/7 PM ‚Ä¢ Autopsy and Blood Bank - Morning 9 AM to Evening 4 PM ‚Ä¢ DRP posting - Morning 9/10 AM to Evening 1/2/4 PM ‚Ä¢ Trauma Lab Duty (Done only by SRs) - 6,6,12 hours duty. C. THE WORK LIFE BALANCE In my institute we have all Sundays and gazetted holidays off. But if there are 3 or more consecutive holidays then we might have to go on duty on a holiday too depending upon the orders from ministry. But for that we get compensatory off. And on routine days you can at least sleep everyday. D. THE LEAVES We get 20 Casual Leaves (CL) and 5 Academic Leaves (AL). There are no Medical Leaves and if we take one then our CLs are deducted. E. THE ACADEMICS On the academic part we have twice weekly academic activities which include Seminars, Journal Clubs, Faculty lectures, Slide Tests, Slide Seminars and CPC meets. We have to do thesis, posters, oral papers and if interested you can opt for voluntary research beside your thesis. Every 3 monthly we have written exams of various units like General Pathology, Cytology, Hematology Part 1, Hematology Part 2, Histopathology Part 1 and Histopathology Part 2. Besides this we also have National and State level meets like CYTOCON, HAEMATOCON, APCON, DCIAC, UPHGCon etc. F. WHAT TO DO AFTER PG? THE OPTIONS Pursue FRCPath/AMC/USMLE/MCCQE Join as SR Go for DM or Fellowship Join as Medical Officer in State or Central Govt. Join Pharmaceutical companies Join as Scientist in ICMR Complete SRship (1 year for peripheral and 3 years for central institutes) and join as assistant professor in a medical college Complete SRship or gain post PG experience and join as Junior Consultant in Private Hospitals Start Freelancing services and tele reporting Open your own lab Switch to clinical hematology (if NEET SS allows MD Pathology by the time you finish your MD) G. AI and PATHOLOGY Well Pathology is the most subjective branch. One slide can be interpreted in different ways by different consultants depending upon context and history provided. A common example is the TURBT chip biopsy of an Intravesical BCG treated patient. Without the history of Intravesical BCG the slide can look like a Urothelial carcinoma to a Pathologist but with the history of Intravesical BCG that same slide can be reported as reactive changes post therapy. AI can aid us but to replace a Pathologist is impossible. H.  FUTURE OF PATHOLOGY The Pathology will boom in the future since all new treatment modalities are targeted therapies. And those Targets (Oncogenes, Antigens, mRNAs, Receptors etc) are diagnosed by a Pathologist. The coming future is of molecular and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Our old consultants had Special Stains in their time. Our new consultants have IHC, cytogenetics and flow cytometry nowadays. We will have Molecular and NGS in the coming time. The Pathology is ever evolving and every advancement in a treatment will be guided by pathology. So Pathology will always have a bright future. I. NO BIG TALK - THE GROUND REALITY One of my SR after completing his SRship was offered a post of Junior Histopathologist in a famous private hospital from delhi with a package of 1.9-2 LPM. In Delhi if you Join SRship you will have approx 1 to 1.5 LPM salary. There are many private and state government colleges which have empty posts of assistant professors where you can join (I know that because I have seen my SRs who are about to complete their SRship getting such offers). If you have generational wealth then you can  hire people and successfully run a Pathology lab. Many people \"rent out\" their signatures to private pathology labs for a certain monthly fee. Some people do freelancing after working hours. So ultimately the earnings depend upon how much you can grind. Money is in every branch but you will have to devote your time to earn it. Maybe you will earn less comparatively but you'll never have the financial difficulties. This is the ground reality. J. WHICH COLLEGE TO CHOOSE Patient load - more the better. (Patho is a very hectic branch in all the colleges) Whether that hospital has superspeciality departments or not. - prefer superspeciality departments college. Is the department research oriented or not. And if research oriented whether it has MOU signed with foreign universities or good Indian reasearch institutions or not. Location from home - If a family emergency occurs can you reach home within a day or not. Toxicity in the department. Whether that department has Flow cytometry and IHC or not. Whether that college organises CPC meets or not. Working hours - If you have some medical condition 12 hours workday can take a toll on your physical and mental health. The number of residents in the department - The more no. means less workload and if less no. of residents then more work but more experience. The location of the college with respect to the nearest city or recreational area. If your college is far away from the city sometimes you will have to struggle to get things done. Whether that college has UG teaching by PGs or not? - It should have. Whether they teach Patho residents bone marrow procedure or not? Whether the college has these three departments at least under Pathology - Histopathology, Cytology and Hematology. (For example GB Pant, Delhi doesn't have Hematology so residents are posted in MAMC for 6 months for Hematology) The stipend Post MD how many years of bond you have to serve. These are the things that you should look at as a bare minimum in a college besides your personal reasons. K. MD vs DNB vs DIPLOMA IN CLINICAL PATHOLOGY Your order should be:- MD from Central institute (eg- MAMC, VMMC, RML, UCMS, IMS-BHU) 2. MD from a very well established state institute (eg- TMH mumbai, KEM, KGMU etc.) 3. MD from reputed Private college (eg. Manipal, CMC Vellore, AIMS Kochi) 4. DNB from a reputed institution which has latest technology and advancements (eg- Sir Ganga Ram Delhi) 5. MD from a Peripheral Govt. college 6. DNB from private college 7. Diploma in Clinical Pathology. Thank you and all the best for your counselling. Eagerly waiting for new people to join our Pathology family. Have a nice day. üòÑü§ó",

People who scores less in ini have scored more than me. People whose gts were less than mine scored more than me. My mbbs was from a private college too. My dad says not to drop. They want to take up a loan again. I keep saying I wanna take a drop he is so adamant about it that he shouts back at me. I am okay with a non clinical seat too but he doesn't want that for me too. Both my parents support me. They say I did my best and now I should let it go. They want me to relax. But kaise? With all the loan they have because of me? I did say if I take a management seats I'll take up a student loan and it's my responsibility. Everything I did goes to waste. I wanna stop believing in good things I smile and laugh and pretend to be not depressed. But I am. Waking up everyday feels like an ache in my heart. Why can't I be a success story one day? Why can't things work out for me just once? If only I had a brother or a sister, I would have taken up any step to be away from this misery. But I have to live for my parents. Probably I am not smart enough. Probably I am not meant to be successful this time. Maybe I made mistakes I don't know about yet. But my efforts and strategies shouldn't have landed me at 43k. I deserved better. My parents deserve better. I am heartbroken. Sorry for the rant. I have no one to speak to about this.",

      "content_preview": "I really think India should revamp how medical college admissions work. Right now it‚Äôs completely based on marks and so one exam decides everything. Sure, academic knowledge is important, but the reality is medicine isn‚Äôt only about scoring high on MCQs. It's also about listening, communicating, working in stressful situations in teams, and treating patients with empathy. Our system barely has any of that, which is why I think we often see medical students who are brilliant on paper but arrogant, dismissive, or toxic in real life. Other countries have already solved this problem. UK, US, etc. admissions isn't only about grades, they also include interviews, situational judgment tests, personal statements. I guess they figured it out, because being a doctor is about trust and judgment, not just recall. Infact, college admissions and life in general, they tend to focus on the overall holistic development of an individual. Let me be clear, marks matter, and no one is denying that. Without solid knowledge, you can‚Äôt even enter the profession. But here‚Äôs the truth, everyone in medicine knows once you step outside the exam hall, marks are necessary, not sufficient. I‚Äôve seen some insanely smart people in college, some are absolute geniuses in everything they do, and then there are the hardcore bookworms who basically class‚Äìread‚Äìsleep‚Äìrepeat 24x7. Honestly, if I was on some sort of admissions board, that only looked at marks, I‚Äôd admit them too without a doubt. Scoring high shows discipline and memory, sure. But ask yourself, how many of these ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù are also genuinely kind, trustworthy, and the type of person you‚Äôd want at your side? And how many are cut throat, dismissive, or so obsessed with numbers that they put others down who are not at that level. Some say India‚Äôs huge population makes interviews or empathy tests cumbersome, so marks only simplified it. But it‚Äôs not like adding an interview means someone with 75% will get in over someone with 95%. In such a big country (and with applicants  rising every year), there will always be plenty of 95%-ers. The point is just to make sure the 95% we pick is also someone trustworthy, empathetic, and not a red flag or something. Academic performance and personality are two very different things. It‚Äôs time we stop confusing ‚Äúgood student‚Äù with ‚Äúgood doctor.‚Äù",

Don't talk nonsense to them and ask questions with dignity. Don't leave the senior's message on the scene. Do not unsend the message under any circumstances. Unless the senior tells you to do so, speak in pure Hindi language and format. Do not react to senior's messages. Do not send any request without an intro. Don't send emoji to senior. Don't be frank with your seniors. Say \"Sir\" and \"Madam\" in every sentence. Don't wish good luck in college and hospital sector. Always go to college in proper attire and look the same on campus. Come learn about the anatomy or modified structure. Do not look into the eyes. Reply to the senior within two hours. Name and place of seniors should be available for all the batches. Unless all the seniors are informed, hotspot or amul will not be available. Unless all the seniors are informed, no one will be seen on the ground. Believe whatever your senior says. Don't argue at all. Seniors are paramount. Never take videos or photos of seniors. Credits:- u/Excellent-Finish-802",

      "content_preview": "I really don't know how to start , Feels like everything just shattered! Studied in a deemed college due to me being non serious with my career. After admission I became fully focused on clearing NEET pg with a gov seat to turn things around. Throughout college had a decent academic performance used to be within 25 out of 250 everyyear. During Internship I worked my ass off, also faced a lot of toxicity from some Pgs. On the other hand there were students who would just not come to internship and study whole day at home/flat. 3-4 guys even went on a cerebellum/BTR offline bootcamp or something I dont know but literally didn't come for internship for 5-6 months, one guy in my posting batch who used to come to duty late just to study from his ipad watching btr/marrow videos, and there I was working my assoff watching him doing his studies. I learned a lot of handson skills during my internship but always knew in the back of my mind that although this guy doesn't know shit , but maybe he would get better rank than me in neet. Still I prioritized my duty ( i regret now). After my intership was over , with no extensions I came back home on April and started preparing for neet pg with dedication, used to wake up at 6 am and sleep at 12. One thing I lacked was giving Gts and doing MCQs, but I managed to revise all my RR notes before exam. And then on 19th Aug my rank comes out to be ~ 35k. I was broken, to add salt to wound, I came to know from my friend, That guy who didn't attend internship for 5-6 months got a rank of 4k , and the guy who used to come to just watch vids on iPad got a rank of 6k  , Both of them didn't do shit during internship. They didn't get extensions due to their 'connections' with Pgs and due to their luck. This broke me down in shatters . Now my parents are telling to take a branch of my choice in a private/deemed college, they are proud of me , they say I did the right thing by doing my Internship duties, but I feel this pain inside me , this regret which I can't get over with. I want to take up Surgery as my branch but wanted to do that on my 'khudka dum' . My parents don't want me to take drop, they say We know that you would 100% do better next year but still if possible take the private seat. I feel like a failure who couldn't prioritize his choices . Edit - Yesterday saw my Neet score card , did 131 corrects and 55 wrong",
