      "content_preview": "Hello, My name is Alex Genadinik. I am a long-time instructor on Udemy teaching for 12+ years with almost 1,000,000 students. As an instructor (and as a student too) I wanted to share why the personal plan is great: often when we want to learn something, we don't know which instructor or course will be the most helpful. The personal plan allows people to try unlimited courses, so you can study anything, and find the course and instructor that is perfect for you. On the other hand, if you have to pay every time you want to try a course, for many people that creates hesitation, which leads to not paying and not learning. So the personal plan just reduces the friction to learning, which is why I recommend it. It's a better experience.",

The calls are usually with my Udemy students where they can ask me any questions about marketing, SEO, AI, professional skills, entrepreneurship, and more. Those are the topics I teach. The session is free. Everyone is welcome! HOW THESE CALLS USUALLY GO: I usually have a pre-planned theme. Today's theme is that I'll try to do an A-Z sales walkthrough of how to write a cold email pitch, do lead generation, and send the pitch, and monitor for replies right on the call. Q&A: ask me anything any time. It's a welcoming and friendly atmosphere.",

Why already working good companies has to come up with stupid UI changes suggested by some new comer stupid predatory CEO probably, just to destroy what is already good and familiar with existing users. Comparing hours etc of courses feels much more convenient to do up and down than sideways. Maybe that's the reason they made this change- to make it harder for people to compare and choose the correct course, instead they want us go with whatever course they shove up on your throat. Just like their other predatory practice of not putting any button to login with a password, but yeah they have a url for it, but won't expose it for predatory reasons on their login page. So annoying to login to your email and then go to their stupid email and write the stupid code again and again. Anyways, I was talking about a different thing.. Literary degraded it's UI into some Bootstrap tutorial project on YouTube 🤦‍♂️ Such confidence these entitled UI mongorers have, they know they're big now so they can get away with anything, that's why literally pushing stupidity down the throat of the users. At this point it feels like they purposefully do it just to remind people that they're the owners and to annoy people, like for no reason but just to fuck you.",

      "content_preview": "I used to get wrecked a lot in the market (and still occasionally am!) — chasing narratives, buying dips that kept dipping. What nobody told me back then: you don’t have to bet on direction to trade crypto. You can trade the relative performance of two assets instead. That’s called pair trading : Long one asset, short another. Hedge market swings. Profit from narratives and correlations instead of pure luck. After experimenting with it for a while, I realized there’s basically zero accessible education on how to actually do this in crypto. So we built a short, structured course that walks through: Picking pairs Narrative vs stat-arb trades Entries/exits Real case studies How to execute on-chain (we use Pear Protocol for this) The whole thing is free on Udemy (about 30min video + 1-2h of articles/quizzes). No upsells, no catch - just trying to make this strategy more common in the space. If you’ve ever wondered how to trade safer without getting wrecked by leverage, check out our announcement here: x.com/pear_protocol/status/1958145400671711295 Happy to answer any questions about pair trading here. Curious if anyone in this sub has tried it already?",

      "content_preview": "So I've been considering getting a basic Udemy subscription and upon checking out the subscription pricing I noticed that there were two different quoted prices when I was on two different networks. Same gmail/account on my browser on each network. I was on my university's wifi and it quoted me $14/month but on my home network I was quoted $12/month. Now, upon connecting my laptop to my phones hotspot and entering an incognito tab ( I'm not sure if this was necessary ) it is quoting me $11.9/month. Just curious if anyone knows why this is.",
