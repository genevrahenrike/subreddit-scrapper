I am simultaneously doing an in-person/stream of an “AMA: Professor with ADHD” next week. Everything is setup and being advertised for YouTube Live, so we can’t make any changes to the streaming service or platform. That said, I desperately need to borrow a PS5 camera for streaming the video to YouTube Live. I know that the PS5 camera has been on the endangered species list for a while, but I thought I’d try to reach out to the students for help! Does anyone here have one that I could borrow for Thursday? Thank you for your time! Enjoy your long weekend! P.S. I know there are other tech solutions here, but the IT department is very busy at this time and has already given me several hours in support, so unfortunately a PS5 camera is the only feasible solution.",

I was told we only had to do this once as long as we went to fsu, which Im finding out now is false. I just submitted my insurance waiver but its during the late waive time window. Does anyone have any experience with this? My insurance didn’t change at all from last year to this year. Im so nervous since its a bit close to the end of the time window (ends aug 31st) that if i submitted something wrong, itll be too late to find out and appeal it. I really cant afford the insurance plan they automatically enroll you in. If you have a similar experience, let me know what the outcome was! Thanks :)",

I’m looking to add 1-2 other moderators, both to ensure there is a backup plan for the subreddit if I get hit by a bus one day, and to make sure someone is still checking in on things, approving posts etc. to keep things running smoothly and keep the community engaged. Ideal candidates would be an FSU staff member, recent alumni, or student who has been posting on the sub somewhat actively for at least a year or two and knows the community. The majority of being a moderator is clicking “approve” on posts the automod has blocked, facilitating community engagement, and helping handle the occasional extreme situation where the sub gets flooded due to a national news event drawing people here. If you’d be interested in volunteering please let me know and tell me a bit about yourself!",

There was a crackhead that catcalled me and this other girl who was walking too. I didn’t mean to be in the area after dark but I was on an accidental side quest so stuff happens sometimes. If you’re a girl, I’d recommend walking with at least another person or steer clear of Tennessee street all together after dark. Learn from my mistake lol.",

The cops also serve as a constant reminder of what happened, which is frustrating. I consider myself to be a fairly resilient person, but whenever I am on campus I just think about the shooting. I heard shots but I never saw the gunman, which makes me feel like I shouldn't be struggling like this. I am also frustrated with how people talk about the shooting in vague terms, like 'the events of last semester.' Does anyone else feel this way?",
