My partner and I went to see Weapons at 10pm at the Williamsburg cinema and there was this lovely couple next to us who were quite intoxicated.  Ofc horror movies on a weekend generally have a more lax fun vibe in the theater but specifically the woman was rather homophobic, fat phobic, and also was kicking the chair of the girl in front of her on top of talking/ yelling throughout the entire film. After a manager tried to get them to leave, they declined, so 4 cops came into the theater mid finale as things are going crazy on screen to escort them out. Big props to the girls who called out this vile lady and stood up to her.  Also the manager was very patient and did the right thing getting the cops.  Lastly, as the credits rolled and the intensity of the finale subsided with the hateful movie goers evicted, the lights revealed a wonderful Williamsburg community, people who didn’t know each other coming together smiling, laughing, and talking about how crazy/awful this lady was which was beautiful. To end this mishy mashy story, one movie goer said to the lady as the police escorted her out, “bye diva”",

This is absurd and UNLAWFUL to deny refunds when the terms of the original event (date + venue) are changed?? And you may not even get in due to limited capacity?? Since Brooklyn Mirage has already filed for bankruptcy, makes it clear they don’t care about honoring their customers at all. Has anyone else been dealing with this? We need more articles written on how they’re keeping our money!",

I just got a message from my landlord that someone from their office will be coming in two days in the afternoon to do a walk-through. The place isn’t awful, but it’s definitely not ready for anyone to come in and look around, and I don’t wanna take a risk. I’ve been behind on cleaning the past couple weeks. floors need attention, a layer of dust on the shelves, bathroom mirror and sink are a mess, haven’t had the time to clean the kitchen properly in a while. It’s not terrible if you live in it, but would probably make someone think I don’t take care of the place. I really need someone who can come either tomorrow morning or at least by afternoon. It’s a small space (about 550 sqft) but I’m looking for someone who’ll do a thorough job. Ideally they’d bring their own supplies and vacuum. I’ve got some basic things here, but nothing strong enough to actually deep clean the kitchen or bathroom. If you know any local services or individual cleaners who’ve done good work for you, and can work on short notice, I’d really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read this",

Here's the deal -- to get it going any further, victims or witnesses need to reach out to the CM's office by emailing district33@council.nyc.gov They said they've been in touch with the 94th Precinct about these incidents since they first circulated at the end of last year but need the actual victims of this to talk to the Councilmember's office so they can push this further. So, did this happen to you or a friend? Did you see it? Email district33@council.nyc.gov",

I'm so disappointed that not one person asked if I was okay or snapped a photo of his license plate. I was shaking too much to get my phone out fast enough.
