      "content_preview": "John D. , formerly of Arcade1Up, recently posted on Facebook a small tidbit about Arcade1Up sales that might have been previously unknown. Quoting John: At Arcade1UP, sales of 80‚Äôs games outside of Pac Man sold significantly less than games of the Revival Era. ¬†IMO, the revival era games hold up better than the Golden Era games, but that‚Äôs a controversial opinion. ¬†(I love me some Robotron, Mr and Ms Pac Man, Galaga, Missle Command, Double Dragon, Dragons Lair and Star Wars) In this context, John is referring to \"The Revival Era\" as being the resurgance era defined by Wikipedia , which is basically the 1990s (think Street Fighter, MKII, etc.). And, frankly, I'm not at all surprised that these games outsold Centipede, Tempest, and that controversial Atari 50th cab (among others). So, what are YOUR favorite games, and eras? We recently took a poll , but these surveys never tell the full story. Drop a note below with your bangers! https://preview.redd.it/1980s-arcade1up-titles-were-outsold-by-newer-titles-v0-itljl24a8tmf1.png",

This aligns with the customs report showing large quantities of these units arriving in the US. I know everyone here probably has their fill of Pac Man, but I am actually thinking of adding a Cocktail Table.  Only if it goes on sale though.

I am wondering if I could just plug the volume switch or on/off switch into the encoder and they would work as buttons? Is there any risk to trying this or anyone who has done this? I tried googling and looking around here and could find tons about using them as Audio or Power by wiring them to the Pi directly but I would really prefer to wire them to the encoder to be used as buttons, like a player 2 start button etc. Any help appreciated, thanks in advance :)",

What does all of this mean for customers? Well, you'll have to listen to James's stream for thoughts and speculation, but it could have implications already (including products being more available in Canada, to start!).
