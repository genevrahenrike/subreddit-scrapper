Noah Kahan has had such an amazing impact on my life and I hope that the jacket finds its way to someone who will cherish it as much as I have. I’ve never worn it, only displayed it. It’s in the exact condition it arrived in from Noah’s team. It includes the original setlist in the pocket, which is how it arrived. I’ve linked the listing below if anyone is interested. https://ebay.us/m/2AeYYH",

It came sealed and we opened it today and went to play it and it looks like we got three records but two copies of disc 2 and no sides E-F. I’ve messaged the seller as well but has anyone experienced any mistakes like this for his vinyls? I feel bad that her birthday present isn’t 100% perfect and I’d like to rectify it without just buying a whole new one",

Then years of mix up country, semi indie, decent songs floated around. Noah Kahan is by far the best artist I’ve heard in a long time. Every song, every album, I am left listening again and again. I’m traveling to London ON to see him from the states. I have not been this “in love” with an artist on so long. I hope to dance and sing with so many fellow Noah Kahan fans, and perhaps find my other half. I can’t wait!!",

And I just feel like the line in the chorus  “I was not baptized” is sort of random. From the lyrics that I’ve analyzed it it’s not talking about religious trauma or anything about religion. So it just makes me wonder why he included something that’s significant in religious culture. Of course there could always be a different meaning and maybe I’m not reading it correctly. But to me this song is mainly about emotions weighing on somebody “calling you back” which could be interpreted literally considering today’s world or basically just giving somebody the time of day. I love the song so much! But genuinely what was the line “I was not baptized” talking about? (PS: I know I know I didn’t do my research and I forgot about the line before. 😓 im sorry but I know now! Thanks to everyone that replied!)",

But why do you think this is? Is he a car guy? Or did he just live in a rural area or something? I don't know much about him, just a step above a casual listener I guess. update: only 7/14 songs on stick season with mention of cars or driving. solid 50% maybe i am being dramatic. 😅 great commute album.",
