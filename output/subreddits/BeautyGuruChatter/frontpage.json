      "content_preview": "In light of Youthforia shutting down, i’d like to say that the incident was a lot more egregious than it has been presented as.If you don’t know, back in 2024 youthforia was urged to increase their foundation shade range to be more inclusive. In response, youthforia released shade 600 which was, quite literally, black. no undertones, no mixing, just charcoal and foundation. They proceeded to ship the batch out to dark skinned influencers and were rightfully called out for the fact that they’d basically released black face paint.My issue with this whole debacle comes with the fact that most people assume it was down to ignorance. I believe one individual on tiktok reached out to youthforia for comment and were told that the reason they’d released the shade was because they’d drawn inspiration from the REM beauty dark mixer concealer. Many people have assumed the issue came from the fact that the team had assumed that people who are charcoal black actually exist.However, i do not think this was an issue based on ignorance. I don’t doubt that some members of the youthforia team had assumed that some people would be able to fit the shade, but I also think that they’d understand that the supposed people who would fit the shade are such a tiny market that there would be no way to break even on the cost of manufacturing.In my opinion, youthforia manufactured this shade specifically to send to dark skinned influencers and to have as a tester in store. they wanted dark skinned people who often struggle to find foundation shades to swatch the shade and go “oh my gosh, they’re so inclusive they’re even making shades too dark for me! they’ve really stepped up their game” and ask no further questions.this entire stunt wasn’t an act of ignorance, it was a ploy to fain inclusivity without actually having to put the work in. they knew damn well that nobody would fit the shade. it existed only to act as a fake milestone. they attempted to insult the intelligence of dark skinned influencers and customers to get brownie points, which to me is much more egregious.we’re in an age where racism cannot be excused by ignorance anymore. people know what they’re doing. the lack of any real apology from youthforia proves that.",

She was quite lovely and the last time I watched her she mentioned having some health issues, perhaps MS or Lupus. Does that ring a bell with anyone?",

      "content_preview": "There’s a few influencers that go on and on about how they’re always brutally honest whenever they give a bad review, and how they aren’t like everyone else because they aren’t afraid to get kicked off PR lists. It just rubs me the wrong way because it feels less like they’re explaining why a product didn’t work for them, they just bash the product and call it terrible, and it feels more like they’re trying to prove to us that they’re honest. A couple influencers I see a lot keep talking about how they’ve gotten kicked off certain brands’ PR lists for being “brutally honest”, but the brands they’ll list are known for changing up their PR lists! I’ll also see comments being like “finally an honest review” under a negative video about a hyped product, or “why are you lying” under a positive video about a product that a lot of people don’t like, and it irks me so bad as a makeup artist because different products work differently for different people, and things like taste also play a major factor in what products specific people enjoy. For example, the Haus Labs foundation looks horrible on me— it emphasizes texture and pores that I do not have. Yet, it looks amazing on several of my friends/clients. Is it a bad product just because it doesn’t work for me? No. I honestly want to see more reviewers that can review things more objectively. Ex: This didn’t work for me because of xyz, however I have x skin type, and I could see this working better for y skin type.",

Now I can’t find that information, but I came across the Clarisonic’s seemingly “official” website. They claim to have been back into business this March, and wikipedia says the same thing (though I’m not sure how credible their information is).Has anyone tried purchasing anything from their “official” website since March of 2025? I don’t see any news or reddit threads out there that talk about it. So it leaves me questioning if this is legit.I even tried calling their number listed under “contact us”, but it sends me right over to voicemail without stating anything about the brand name or anything.https://www.clarisonic.onlinehttps://www.clarisonic.online/2025/03/02/clarisonic-roars-back-to-life-in-the-skincare-arena/",
