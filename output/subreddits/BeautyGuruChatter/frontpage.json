For Mugler to come back to beauty via a limited edition L'Oreal collection seems more like a flex of ownership by L'Oreal. Also given that they chose Kendall Jenner as the face of the collection seems tone-deaf when Mugler was known for using models with big personalities or models of unconventional backgrounds.Whole thing seems really lackluster even though the brand itself isn't. I wonder if this is part of the direction of the new Mugler creative director...More here:https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/loreal-paris-collab-sees-mugler-return-to-beauty",

      "content_preview": "There’s a few influencers that go on and on about how they’re always brutally honest whenever they give a bad review, and how they aren’t like everyone else because they aren’t afraid to get kicked off PR lists. It just rubs me the wrong way because it feels less like they’re explaining why a product didn’t work for them, they just bash the product and call it terrible, and it feels more like they’re trying to prove to us that they’re honest. A couple influencers I see a lot keep talking about how they’ve gotten kicked off certain brands’ PR lists for being “brutally honest”, but the brands they’ll list are known for changing up their PR lists! I’ll also see comments being like “finally an honest review” under a negative video about a hyped product, or “why are you lying” under a positive video about a product that a lot of people don’t like, and it irks me so bad as a makeup artist because different products work differently for different people, and things like taste also play a major factor in what products specific people enjoy. For example, the Haus Labs foundation looks horrible on me— it emphasizes texture and pores that I do not have. Yet, it looks amazing on several of my friends/clients. Is it a bad product just because it doesn’t work for me? No. I honestly want to see more reviewers that can review things more objectively. Ex: This didn’t work for me because of xyz, however I have x skin type, and I could see this working better for y skin type.",

I remember her doing a lot of hauls or makeup tutorials, she was into hello kitty as well as mac makeup. She wore contacts as well, like blue or green I believe! I want to say she had tattoos on her arms but I don’t remember. Her aesthetic was super girly girl. I want to say she either had a marlyn monroe piercing or drew a mole on in that area. It’s literally bothering me trying to figure out her youtube name, I use to watch youtube off my older brothers account when I was younger so I have no clueeeee how to find her.",
