      "content_preview": "Our healthcare system is collapsing. The only reason it hasn't, is because of the amazing healthcare workers who have stayed behind. I went to the Regina Pasqua hospital on Friday, July 25th, around 1am with severe pain. I have had kidney stones before, but since this pain was lower, I was convinced it was something else, like my appendix. The ER was fairly empty, and I got a bed quickly. However, there were only two nurses in my area (I don't know how many are supposed to be there), and very few doctors. The nurses apologized for being short staffed a few times. I lay in pain because the nurses were unable to do anything without a doctor seeing me first. I saw a doctor at 7am because they were finally free to see me. One walked into my room around 5am, but had to attend to an emergency and ran out. At 8am I was hooked up to IV, bloodwork taken, and given some low level pain meds that did nothing, but at least there was progress. I got a CT scan around 10am and a diagnoses of a 6mm kidney stone around 11am. I was finally given appropriate pain medication. After 10 hours of lying in pain, concentrating on my breathing, my pain was finally over. Ask anyone, kidney stones are one of the most painful things a person can have. Since I was in so much pain, I didn't sleep that entire night. I was sent home with medication and encouragement to come back if the stone didn't pass or if the pain was not manageable that afternoon. Monday night, July 28th,  I went back to the ER because the pain had become unmanageable. I arrived around 9pm and waited about an hour for a bed. I saw a doctor sooner this time, and the CT and bloodwork were repeated. In the morning I was moved to a recliner chair to wait to be admitted to the hospital, because the stone hadn't moved. I waited until around 2pm to get a bed. The lady beside me was similarly exhausted and waiting to be transferred to the appropriate location to support her care. Once admitted, I was told I was on the waitlist for surgery. Scheduled surgeries were until 4pm and then the waitlist started. I learned that only one OR was opened. I think this included emergency surgeries. They had mentioned maybe opening a second OR, but I don't think they had the staff to do it. The Urologist was a nice guy. He was pleasant, and said he was at the mercy of the OR availability. So we just had to wait. Tuesday night I waited, but my turn never came. They scrambled some food for me to eat around 9pm. The nurses in short stay were a dream. I learned that they are the most senior ER nurses on shift because they only had two of them in the unit. They were always extremely kind, always smiled and always attended to my needs. I overheard that many of them were working overtime shifts. The porters and cleaning staff were also absolutely amazing people. Wednesday I was given breakfast, and then my wait after 4pm for surgery would start again. My turn never came. The staff scrambled some food for me in the evening, a repeat from the night before. Thursday morning I had breakfast, and again waited for my turn to start at 4pm. Around 6pm it was finally my turn to have surgery. It was great news. The urologist apologized for the wait, and both him, the anesthesiologist, and the OR nurses were, again, absolutely amazing people. It sounded like there had been some emergencies that pushed everything back in the OR. After surgery, I woke up to more smiles and kindness, and was back in my room less than 2 hours later. Friday morning I was in a lot of pain. The nurses were patient with me, and gave me pain meds as needed. My urologist wanted me to have better control of the pain before I went home, so I was not sent home that day. Today, Saturday, August 2nd I felt a lot better. I was finally able to leave. The whole week gone by in a blur. I had a similar surgery in 2018, and the surgery was done the next day. My hospital stay was a total of 2 nights, because I needed a recovery day back then as well. Because of the short staffing I was left in pain, and then left to wait for days to have a very standard procedure. I am blessed to have sick leave where I work, so I am fortunate to not lose any income. However, I know this is not the case for many of us.  I shouldn't have had to stay in the hospital as long as I did. I can't imagine how many people's lives are affected in a similar way. Our healthcare system is understaffed. Our government needs to work on hiring and retention. We can't have more clinics and hospitals until the ones we have are properly staffed. The healthcare workers at CUPE 5430 haven't had a raise in 3 years. These amazing people deserve a raise, and they deserve better working conditions where they aren't forced to work short. We are evenrually going to lose the ones who stayed behind, they will eventually burn out. Then what? The Sask party needs to do better.",

      "content_preview": "One of the constant frustrations in Saskatchewan (and honestly, most places in Canada) is figuring out how to actually see a doctor. Walk-ins are unpredictable — you don’t know which clinic is open, how long the wait is, or if they’ve already capped the day. Booking appointments isn’t much better since every clinic has its own system or you need to phone in. I’ve been thinking about building an app that brings both together in one place. The idea would be: See which clinics are currently accepting walk-ins, with live wait times or spots left Browse and instantly book available appointments at nearby clinics Get notified if a slot opens up at a preferred doctor Manage bookings for family members from the same app Book a same-day or scheduled appointment directly. Clinics would update their availability on a simple dashboard, and patients could easily find the nearest clinic with the shortest wait or preferred time slot.",

Once it was the story ‘Cages’ by Guy Vanderhaeghe about a young man not wanting to be like his old man and work at the mine (where there was a cage elevator) only to end up in jail, a cage of his own making. Another was based on a story by Morley Callaghan about a priest. Then there was one that was filmed at Cornwall Centre back when it had Coles and Smith Books and Hans Christian Andersen Toys. A little kid in the toy store gets lured away by a kindly middle aged to elderly lady who’s not quite right in the head. She takes him to her home nearby. She lets him watch tv and on it he sees the news that he’s been abducted and he calls the police. And one where it’s just a kid and his grandfather just driving around in his grandfather’s 1970s pickup truck. There was little plot to it, they were just bonding as they drove. The grandfather eerily looked like my own so that’s why it stuck in my head. Does anyone remember this short film series?",
