      "content_preview": "Greetings, champions. Today's a big day. I didn't want to make this too formal, but I'd rather not let the moment pass without saying something to mark the occasion. We've just released the first content update for the new \" Tales of the Champions \" campaign, which comprises all bespoke stories of my own design, rather than being an adaptation from an official campaign book. That's a huge responsibility, a great honor, and a dream come true. It's also an enormous team effort (making video games is hard!), and it wouldn't have happened without the contributions from our amazing artists and brilliant developers. This project is a labor of love and was born out of deep gratitude for this community, without whose support and camaraderie I would not have made it this far, progressing from being just a random player in 2017 to becoming the content designer on staff in 2025. Idle Champions—and its players—changed my life. I turned a hobby into a career, and now I get to say that many people all around the world are playing my original D&D adventures (even if most folks don't read the dialogue; it's okay, I understand). I'm living the dream, and I owe it all to absurd luck, intense passion, CNE taking a chance on me (thank you, Eric!), and the support of everyone in this community—those who have been with me for the whole journey, those who have moved on to other games, and those who have only just started their adventure. Life is often messy, and the world is frightening. In defiance of that darkness, this campaign represents my attempt to create at least a little bit of fun, whimsy, and hope for you all to share. I take pride in this work, which is rare for me. Thank you, everyone, from the bottom of my heart. I sincerely hope that you enjoy this campaign. Stay sharp.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, This is not a guide, not a story. I'd like to discuss possible relevant metrics to assess an account power. To start the debate (hopefully), here are some questions I struggle with. The game uses favour to assess your ease to defeat a variant. I doubt anyone thinks this is a good way to do it, although in some situations (like being able to click through it), it may be alright. Is this useful? There are loads of numbers floating around the game, like % of variants done for each patron. I don't think this one is relevant in any meaningful way, because unless the number is 100%, it doesn't say your capable of doing those you miss. Are other % more relevant? Highest achieved area or highest achieved BUD, although more difficult to track, may be more relevant. But are they really? I mean, variants are very different one from another, so if your super champions aren't available can you still do the job? What about a scoring system? Like 1 point for each unlocked champion, 1 point for each unlocked global blessing, 1 point for each level of your highest modron core, 1point for each global perk, 1 point for each stack of 20 achievements, ... ?",

I have been playing for maybe 6 or so months, and have a decent AA team that reaches somewhere above e630 in most variants where everyone is available. My biggest problem when it comes to pushing is usually that my team is, for instance in Trials one shot by the dragon bosses, who spawn 2 variants per 100 i think. This week in trials I went to about 1500, then got 1-shot. I then changed the team a bit and put Baldric in there, along with most of my AA team, and tried again. I am now cruising over z2000 by BUD-maxing on z1, then switching to Baldric Team, and then just smashing the dragons with noone dead. This is a total gamechanger, since the problem with the magic core is usually no +HP, so very low survivability. Just wanted to share this with this awesome community. As Tyredack usually says: Have one hell of a time out there champions!",

As you enter the Tower of Mystra to seek advice from Kaylaar Allun, a tiny, magical, one-eyed construct whirs to life and calls for attention, speaking with a familiar voice... < Mip-Mop > Greetings, champions! This is an automatically generated scheduled post for the open discussion of Time Gates. Please use this thread to ask questions and seek advice concerning Time Gates. Don't know what Time Gates are? Not sure which champion to choose for your Time Gate? This thread is for you! Time Gates allow players to unlock and gear up previously released event champions! A natural Time Gate opens every three weeks, on weekends in between normal events. Time Gates can also be opened manually by using six Time Gate pieces, which have a chance to drop from defeated bosses in any adventure every five to six days. Natural Time Gates offer a random selection of event champions. Manual Time Gates allow you to choose any event champion from the full list. Once you choose a champion, you can play their event adventures. Complete up to two normal adventures and one adventure variant for that champion to receive one gold chest for that champion for each completed task. You can also do free plays of the event adventure. Each time you defeat a boss on unique stage increments of 100 during that Time Gate, you will earn one silver chest for that champion. From the moment a Time Gate opens, you have exactly three days to earn its rewards before it is closed. When the Time Gate closes, you will be forced to convert your Mystra's Favor to a permanent campaign favor of your choice, however the conversion rate will be 25% that of normal event favor conversion rate. For example, 1.00e10 Mystra's Favor will grant a 25% increase to a permanent campaign of your choice, whereas this same favor amount during an event would grant a 100% increase. You will be given two Time Gate Pieces when the Time Gate is closed (minus one for each claimed gold chest reward). Good luck with your Time Gates, champions! < Mip-Mop >",

Any suggestions would be great, thanks. Edit: I also have been using contracts on Hew-Man because it's suggested in the guide. When do I actually start on others? I feel like Widdle increased my speed by more than anyone so was thinking of switching over to her.",

The booting only happens at exactly the end of every 75 levels, so 75, 150, 225, 300 etc. If you take out champions just before the level ends then you can get to keep them.",

      "content_preview": "Last Updated: Initial Post Table of Contents Event Introduction General Game Tips General Event Information Event Champion Information Ahghairon's Day - Year 8 Ahghairon's Day commemorates the birthday of Ahghairon, the first Open Lord of Waterdeep and founder of the Lords of Waterdeep. In his name, Lords toast Ahghairon and the Watchful Order, while guildmasters toast the Lords in Ahghairon's name, and common folk leave violets at the base of Ahghairon's Tower, the Plinth, and atop the altars of the House of Wonder. As part of the festivities, the party is tasked with seeking out a Lord of Waterdeep who stepped down long ago. It seems like an easy request — but if it were easy, it wouldn't have come directly from the Open Lord of Waterdeep herself... Ahghairon's Day lasts for 21 days and runs from Wednesday, August 6th, 2025, at Noon, Pacifically, thru Wednesday, August 27th, 2025, at Noon, Pacifically. You can find this year's official Ahghairon's Day blog post here . Gaar's Note: Ahghairon's Day is August's event in the Idle Champions Event Calendar. General Game Tips I highly recommend reading my Guide to Event Planning for basic progression information and ways to maximize your gains/efficiency during Events. There is too much information to put here as this specific Event guide is long enough already. Don't be afraid to ask questions in the comment section! Also, I stream the game and welcome any and all questions there as well! You can find all of my 190+ Idle Champions guides here . Good luck & have fun! ~Gaar If you'd like to support the creation of guides like this one and you play on the Epic Games Store, you can use the code below when making a purchase of any kind. Epic Games Creator Code: GAARAWARR In connection with Epic Games’ Support-A-Creator Program, I may receive a commission from certain in-game purchases when you use my Creator Code when making a purchase. If you play on other platforms and wish to support guides like this one, you can hit up my Ko-Fi as well as subscribing to my Twitch if you can. You can also rate my guide collection on Steam to ensure new players see it. Thanks! General Event Information You earn Event Tokens at a fixed rate and in any campaign, regardless of how many parties you have running. This means you'll earn the same amount of Tokens whether your game is open or not. (Roughly 1 every 25 seconds.) The overall total of Event Tokens you will earn passively during the Event is roughly 72,576 give or take a few based on CNE's math. You'll have a chance to unlock up to 6 Champions in an Event. There will be two Featured Champions everyone gets, 3 Flex Slots you can use to select a Champion from a pool available during the event at no charge, and 1 Support Flex Slot that unlocks with the purchase of an Event DLC to give paid supporters an extra boost. Events start everyone off at zero Favor. Due to this, you'll need to manually click, or have Familiars click, on the field to damage enemies during the start of your first mission to make sure your lone Champion isn't overrun. Even if you complete the Champion Unlock Adventure you're on, you don't necessarily want to hit \"Complete\" right away. You want to continue on and try to earn as much Favor as possible. This lets you work on getting more Favor so you can more easily complete the Variants that are offered once you finish the unlock adventure. Important: Whatever you do, don't spend lots of time sitting at a wall during an Event, or generally ever.  Time is your enemy (the past it threatens...) and you want to spend your time efficently running Free Plays to maximize your Favor gain and easily complete all the Variants on the first try. Once you have completed all the variants and no longer truly need to farm Favor other than for the conversion bonus, you can now work on the Event Achievements if you haven't done them already. Other than that, you want to check your token total to buy a new Chest Pack from the story whenever you hit 7,500 tokens. New players can fully complete Tier 1 of Events if they know what to do. Make sure to check for a guide to the specific Event to review when it comes out and don't hesitate to ask questions. The rest of us are here to help you succeed! Once more for the people in the back: It's usually wise to not attempt the Tier 1 mission Variants until they show as Easy difficulty for brand new players. The difficulty rating is based off the Favor you have accumulated and while it isn't an ideal indicator of difficulty, it's a decent starting point. I highly recommend waiting until a mission shows as Easy before starting it so as not to waste your time or frustrate you. Again, this is for brand new players as you'll need other power to complete higher Tiers of content. Once you've earned your Event Champions and gear for them, the rewards for your hard work aren't over. The other major reward from Events is a conversion of Event Favor into the main campaign of your choice. This is why, even if you've finished all the variants, it's still good to do deep runs to gain Favor in the Event. You can use the following table to see if it's worth it to you to keep doing runs based on how much Favor you're getting with each one. As you get more Global Blessings, Patron Perks, and better gear on your Champions, you'll be able to get higher and higher conversion percentages. Here's a quick example of the conversion breakdown from Event to main campaign. The percentage is multiplied by the total Favor you have earned in that campaign, including what you've spent on Blessings. There is no need to reset Blessings when converting Favor. There is no cap that I'm aware of to this conversion; the start numbers and end numbers are just examples but continue both ways. Event Favor Total Main Campaign Conversion % 1e07 70% 1e08 80% 1e09 90% 1e10 100% 1e11 110% 1e12 120% 1e13 130% Note: Numbers are in Scientific Notation for ease of reference. You can switch your UI to show Scientific Notation by hitting the Y key or selecting it in the settings. After you get out of normal number range, this is the best way to easily see your progress. Before You Buy Packs from the Store If you plan on buying Event Packs with real money from the store (which is a great way to support the game!), keep this in mind: Be sure you buy any Gold Event Chest Packs before opening any earned Gold Event Chests as you're guaranteed a Golden Epic with your real money purchase.  When you flip the Golden Epic card, close out of the Store and verify it on your Champion, then go back in and open your other Chests.  This way you're guaranteed to get other items when you open your Gold Chests instead of just duplicating that one on accident. Even outside of events, you get buffs when spending real money based on how much you spend. Plan your purchase in advance! $6 - Empowered Power Boost - Increases the damage of all Champions by 100% (lasts 1 day) $12 - Empowered Power Burst - Increases the damage of all Champions by 300% (lasts 2 days) $23 - Empowered Faith - Increases all Favor earned from Resets by 50% (lasts 3 days) $55 - Empowered Clairvoyance - Increases all Gold found by 100% (lasts 4 days) Getting multiple of the same purchase amounts adds to the duration of the buff. All buffs stack with each other. Event Boons are now available for spending real money in the store on any Event DLC. Event DLC have an icon for a Boon as well as for their related Event Currency. You can have up to 4 total Event Boons and they buff your entire account while the event is active as shown in the table below. All Event Boons are able to be toggled on/off in the UI if you wish to. Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Increases the damage of all Champions 100% 300% 500% 900% Increases all Gold found 100% 200% 300% 400% Increases the health of all Champions 50% 100% 200% 300% Adds your BUD to the base damage of each click 60s 150s 300s 600s Time accelerates and everything moves faster 1.25x 1.75x 2.25x 2.75x Note: Generally, every $10 spent in one transaction gets you a guaranteed Shiny item or Potion of Polish! Keep this in mind as well as those can greatly increase the power of your items and thus your Champions. Event Augment Information Each event has different augments associated with it that make it a bit different than other events in terms of bonuses. Here is a list of the bonuses for this event: Epic Platinum Chests - Opening Champion-specific Platinum Chests for any of the Ahghairon's Day event Champions will upgrade all the cards inside them to Epic rarity! Empowered Rewards - Tier 2 and higher event variants award Corrupted Gems in addition to their normal rewards. Golden Weekly Offers - One of your weekly offers will be Golden during this event. Golden offers provide an additional 10% discount! The Golden tag persists when an offer is rerolled. Boon Enhancements - An additional boon buff at each level increases global damage based on the number of Champions in the formation that are from smaller species, stacking additively. The small species are: Dwarves, Fairies, Gnomes, Goblins, Halflings, Kobolds, and Plasmoids.

      "content_preview": "Hello fellow Idle-Champions players, Unless I am missing something, I do not really understand the purpose of the Overwhelm mechanic. While I comprehend its actual mechanics, at a certain level - say board levels 1200+- it seems to become a largely irrelevant mechanic. For example: Let’s take Sgt. Knox. I’ve enjoyed using him because: He was one of the first tanks I acquired when I started playing, and He pairs well with Celeste and Makos. This trio has helped me build my first real gold farm/favor-pushing team. I believe I am in the mid-game phase of *Idle Champions*, as I'm just beginning to collect legendary gear and form my Modron cubes. Sgt. Knox has a 25 Overwhelm stat. At board levels beyond 1200, assuming the monsters are not being killed before they reach him, the idea that he can “tank” up to 25 creatures becomes questionable. The whole concept seems to be that these mobs attack your tanks and in return they (the tanks) begin to buff the rest of your party. Eventually, those buffs should push your team over the damage threshold needed to kill the monsters. But what actually happens - assuming I'm doing everything correctly - is that a monster charges in for three or four hits, and Knox is down before he can even get started. I understand Overwhelm *is* meant to mitigate (somewhat) the incoming damage so that your tank has time to absorb those 25 creatures and give your team sufficient power-up time. However, at higher levels, Knox’s HPs, Celeste’s healing ability, and any mitigation mechanics become negligible. The tanks simply die too quickly for Overwhelm to matter in practice. I am starting to believe that having a \"real\" tank class (one capable of actually tanking) is sub-optimal unless it provides other meaningful benefits. As such, I may be better off ignoring the Overwhelm stat altogether. Is this your experience as well?",

(Also, when is the next good breakpoint for AA Ilvl's- since I want to pump even more into them, since I can crack zone 2000 with them for some events).",

I know there are some mains in the past 3 years that I really need to work with. I just haven't set down to really figure out who they are. I think I will have to gate some.

I have unlocked every champion except Lazaapz, who is the rework for the current event, and free in four days. All base adventures and variants completed, but still hundreds of patron variants to work through. 330/503 completed with Mirt, which is exactly double my progress with my next-highest Patron (Zariel, 165/503). Still, I've completed enough to max every Patron blessing and have gained enough favor to unlock every campaign blessing. According to byteglow, my highest ever damage is e647 and highest zone reached is 2,434. I have been focusing on Absolute Adversaries from the start, with a lineup of Lae'zel, Minthara, Karlach, Valentine, Shadowheart, Nrakk, Volo, Yorven, Durge, Wyll. I definitely need to start working on pumping ilevels into an Artemis team, as well as gold find and many remaining speed champs outside of Briv and Hew Maan. I don't gem farm or do Trials nearly as often as I should, but my 4j Briv brings in about 30,000 gems/hour when I do. Every gold chest feat and skin has been unlocked and purchased, and I have 30 familiars. Currently making my event champion selections based on locked feats, as I have been able to complete all T4 event variants for about 4-5 months now. Nearly full shiny with my core/evergreens, and about 80% epic for event champions. Just gotta keep grinding these patron variants. That's about it. Lazy Saturday.

Previously I didn't use D.M., because I was using the Drow champion, Fen, in the same slot as him, but opted for the help of an extra champion due to the D.M.'s ability, which helped, as previously I only got to somewhere in the 640s... I also tried going backwards to let the Click Damage build back up, but still no luck... Any ideas?

I refuse to keep trying for something that’s broken . It has been laggy since day one . As somebody else had mentioned the past few weeks, it’s been like 10 times a day that it crashes. I’m done ! I have my stats showing me on the Xbox how much time the game was running on my Xbox 476 days 15 hours and 25 minutes of time played . Highest area beaten 2500. Monsters killed 441,730,864 it says gold gained 0.00 Manual tax 501,640,613 Variant adventures completed 2094. I’ve also spent a good amount of money over the years. Either way, I’m done ! Maybe I’ll play NHL or something, because I’m not great at it . My buddy and I have a team, but he’s British and doesn’t understand hockey . He says he understands enough … when you’re supposed to be playing your position and you don’t understand what a friggin position is or what the job is.. that’s not understanding hockey. His giveaways is crazy. He has more goals than I do, but that’s because he doesn’t pass very much. He will be a defenceman and make the forwards at their blue line , so he can try and go in to get around their guys and score. The problem is their defence are already there and he would be unable to even get a shot off. we go upwards on the screen. He was right defense., yet he was behind the other team’s goal line.  We played threes as well. The defence starts with the puck in threes. He doesn’t pass the puck very much anyway , we won a couple tournaments of that on NHL 24, I think we may have won one on NHL 25. Our record is like 9 wins 111 losses and nine overtime losses. When I tell him to get on his side, because he’s always on the board on my side . He will start to attack me personally trying to hurt my feelings. It’s been very, very frustrating, but not as frustrating as champions not working . If anybody is on NHL 25, then you’re looking for a team, send me a PM or something . The last time, my friend and I played, I was like an All-Star, I scored at least a goal in the game , the one game I got two goals and an assist, and then a goal and an assist and then a goal and she assist or something.  So it’s not like I’m trash, it’s just who’s supposed to be on my team seems like he’s working for the other team because he’s never in position and doesn’t understand what the position entails. I need somebody else who knows hockey to yell at him for being a dick when I tell him to get in a position . Then he tells me when I’m like 2 feet on the right of the centre , he tells me to get on my side, when he is against the boards on my side to play before and the play after and continues to do so. He doesn’t understand that he’s supposed to be the open man , he would rather come and try and take the pup from me and the center, so he can try and score.  He’s trying to be a hero, but he’s also trying to be a one person team and that just simply does not work. He would’ve been fired from a team if he gave attitude to them like he gives me. He would be kicked out of the NHL. I’ve been starting to score more lately. He’s not doing very well , even if he was, we could lose 10 to 9. The one game we had seven goals and then still lost. It doesn’t help when the guy is defence and trying to play like he‘s the centre. It’s still less stressful than idle champions has become .",

The restrictions state: “Lae’zel starts in the formation with her Straight to the Point ability unlocked. She can’t be moved or removed. You may only use Champions with a base attack cooldown of 5 seconds or faster. Getting to know Lae’zel: Lae’zel is impatient when facing weak does. She’ll occasionally skip the rest of an area when the enemies aren’t challenging enough!”",

Year 8 Champion - Baldric, the Dwarf Cleric Source: The Fallbacks series of books by Jaleigh Johnson Event: Ahghairon's Day (August) You can read their Champion Spotlight here. Seat 12 Good with: The Fallbacks, Dwarfs, Healers, Gold Find Champs, and/or Magic Base Attack Champs Affiliation: The Fallbacks - Baldric, Tess Eligible for Strahd, Zariel, Elminster (until August 6th, 2028) (Vajra w/Feat) Species Class Alignment Gender Age Role(s) Overwhelm Point Dwarf Cleric Lawful Neutral Male (He / Him) 80 Healing / Support 5 Strength Dexterity Constitution Intelligence Wisdom Charisma Total Ability Score 14 10 12 13 17 15 81 Bio: Baldric left his position as a prominent member of his family’s mercantile empire to seek his fortunes elsewhere. He’s a unique cleric who often confounds other clerics because he refuses to pledge his service or faith to a single deity. He prefers to bargain with any and all of them, depending on the situation, to receive his magic. This has lent him a cocky confidence that has landed him in his share of trouble. But now he’s with the Fallbacks, and over the course of their adventures, his faith in them has become unshakable. Basic Attack: Two-Handed Mace - Baldric attacks the closest enemy, dealing 1 hit. Base Attack Type: Melee Base Attack Speed: 4.75 seconds Base Critical Hit Chance: 2.5% Base Critical Hit Damage: 100% Ultimate: Faith Aflame - Baldric's mace ignites with radiant light, preventing Champions from being stunned and empowering his attacks for the duration it is aflame. Base Ultimate Cooldown Time: 360 seconds Passive Abilities Uggie!: Uggie joins the party, starting next to Baldric unless she's already in the formation next to another Fallbacks Champion. Uggie increases the damage of all non-adjacent Champions by 100% Interesting Abilities Bargaining Power: Baldric's bargaining partners are Fallbacks Champions and/or Champions with Charisma of 15 or higher. Baldric increases the damage of his bargaining partners by 100% for each bargaining partner in the formation, stacking multiplicatively. 2.10e08% post-stack multiplier after upgrades; Supported by an Item & Feats Gaar's Note: This is Baldric's main buff meaning you'll want to build around it, where possible. It's not a huge buff even with gear/item levels, so not necessarily your first priority when building a formation. This ability's Item & Feat support buff the pre-stack modifier, making it a Mathematically OverPowered (MOP) ability which means the more item levels you put on this Champion, the better they get without worrying about the same diminishing returns as other Champions. Undeniable Uggie: Uggie's buff is increased by 400% when Baldric is in the formation. No Upgrades; Supported by an Item & Feats Gaar's Note: This is a freebie because if Baldric is in the formation, so is Uggie. Healing Word: Baldric heals the Champions in all the columns in front of him for 20 health per second. 2,372 after upgrades; Supported by an Item & Feats Gaar's Note: If you're actually trying to heal the party, you'll want Baldric in the back of the group. Shield of Filth: When Uggie is with Baldric, any Champion that is being targeted by Baldric's Healing Word can't take more than 33% of their max health in one hit. No upgrades; Supported by Feats Gaar's Note: This helps to protect everyone in front of Baldric from being one-shot by an enemy. Can come in really handy as you get to much higher areas in the game. Healing Lantern: When any Champion drops to or below 50% of their maximum health, Baldric lights his lantern for the rest of the current area, and all healing received by Champions in the formation is increased by 100% for each Healing Champion in the formation, stacking multiplicatively. No upgrades; Supported by a Feat Gaar's Note: This one scales with Healers in the party but most parties don't have lots of them, so that part is a bit of a bonus. Keep in mind, this boost to \"healing received\" also boosts temp HP shields as well! Global DPS Buff: 5.90e06% First Specialization Set Bargain With Tyr: Baldric increases the pre-stack bonus of Bargaining Power by 50%. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This is the straight-up best bet for damage if you're fine using his base bargaining partners. Bargain With Moradin: You may use any Dwarf Champion in the current adventure, even if the Patron, Variant, or other restrictions would say otherwise. Additionally, Dwarf Champions also count as Baldric's bargaining partners. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This is for the all-Dwarf formations that don't currently exist in the game because there aren't enough Dwarves... deep sigh. Or just adding Dwarfs to the existing bargaining partners. Bargain With Tymora: Baldric gains the Gold Find role and increases the party's gold find by 100% for each bargaining partner, stacking multiplicatively. Additionally, Champions with the Gold Find role also count as Baldric's bargaining partners. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This is for your Gold Farming formations if he's what's available for you in Seat 12 or you just don't want to stack up the other Gold Find Champs there. Or just adding Gold Find Champs to the existing bargaining partners. Bargain With Mystra: Baldric's base attack also deals 5 seconds of BUD-based damage and counts as a magic attack. Additionally, Champions with a magic base attack also count as Baldric's bargaining partners. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This is for formations built around Magic Base Attack DPS and Supports. Or just adding Magic Base Attack Champs to the existing bargaining partners. Bargain With Eldath: Baldric increases the effect of Healing Word by 100%. Additionally, Champions with the Healing role also count as Baldric's bargaining partners. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This is for more survivability, especially if you happen to have some Champs with the healer role. Or just adding Healers to the existing bargaining partners. Second Specialization Set Dark Bargain (When Tyr was chosen): Baldric increases the pre-stack bonus of Bargaining Power by an additional 50%, but the effect of Healing Word is reduced by 99%. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This is the second choice if you're just going full damage with the base set of bargaining partners. Dark Bargain (When Moradin was chosen): The damage of Dwarf Champions is increased by 100% for each Dwarf in the formation, stacking multiplicatively, but you may only have one of each non-Dwarf species in the formation. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This leans into the full-Dwarf party while recognizing it doesn't exist currently. Dark Bargain (When Tymora was chosen): Bosses have a 10% chance to drop twice as many gems, but non-boss area quest requirements are increased by 100%. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This earns you 10% more gems at the cost of some speed, unless you make up for that via other Champions' effects. You'll need to do some tests to see if this works out better for you and your setup. Dark Bargain (When Mystra was chosen): All Champions with magic base attacks deal an additional 5 seconds of BUD-based damage with each attack, but all Champions without a magic base attack no longer deal any damage with their base attacks. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This adds some nice BUD damage to all Champs with a Magic Base Attack which can help chew through armored enemies, but it comes at a cost. Dark Bargain (When Eldath was chosen): Champions are immune to damage for 15 seconds after the first instance of damage that they would take in every area (including that damage), but take 100% additional damage from all sources after that. No upgrades Gaar's Note: This could be super handy in scenarios where a boss AOEs you instantly and wipes the party but you know you'd progress if you could just survive for 10-15 seconds.

Formation & Mission Information Once you complete the first mission, three Variants and a Free Play show up.  It uses a formation that holds 10 Champions.  It has a Champ-specific format that I've done my best to re-create below. Back Column 4th Column 3rd Column 2nd Column Front Column 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 New Player Formation & Specializations: While I recommend learning to build your own formations , here's a set of starter formations for brand new players to use while they get the hang of things. Anyone with other options should check that link for how to figure out how to make the best of them. You can also ask for help in the #formations channel in the official Discord . Back Column 4th Column 3rd Column 2nd Column Front Column Jarlaxle - Leader of Bregan D'aerthe Calliope - College of Valor Nayeli - Oath of Devotion Minsc - Undead Celeste - War Domain NA Hitch - More Daggers Asharra - Dwarves & Elves NA Bruenor - Battle Master This formation is for the first couple of runs where you're just not going to get enough Gold to get everyone on the field, let alone level people up into their power curves. At this point, Jarlaxle is focusing on being your Primary DPS while everyone else is set up to support him. The following formation is for once your Asharra starts doing more damage than your Jarlaxle. You can find this out by changing Asharra's first Specialization Choice to Potpourri (via a Potion of Specialization) and swapping her position with Jarlaxle at the end of a run. If Asharra is higher, next run start Asharra in the DPS position from then on. Back Column 4th Column 3rd Column 2nd Column Front Column Asharra - Potpourri/NA Calliope - College of Valor Nayeli - Oath of Devotion Hitch - More Daggers Celeste - Life Domain Tyril - Wild Shape Makos - Dark Blessing Minsc - Undead Jarlaxle - Leader of Bregan D'aerthe Bruenor - Battle Master This formation should get you through the Event as a new player. If you have other options or think a different DPS is geared better, try it out and see what happens! Swapping DPS around like this can help you figure out what works best for you with your specific items. These are the rough Favor values you need to reach to make a Tier 1 Variant say Difficulty: Easy. Keep in mind that this is just a generic rating system and some Variants may be harder than others, even with Favor in this range. Earning lots of Favor (above what is shown below) before trying variants can make them much easier than they would otherwise be. Variant Favor Level (Normal) Favor Level (Scientific Notation) 75 20,000 ~2e04 125 15,000,000 ~1.5e07 175 150,000,000 ~1.5e08 Beyond Tier 1, Favor isn't going to be all you need to get through them. That doesn't mean you can't try though, just remember that if it isn't green it could be problematic. Tier 1 Area Tier 2 Area Tier 3 Area Tier 4 Area Reward Reclaiming the Past 50 Baldric + Favor Free Play 50 Favor High Stakes Negotiators 75 250 600 1200 Baldric Gold Chest + Favor The Tavern Keepers 125 350 800 1400 Baldric Gold Chest + Favor A God for Every Occasion 175 450 1000 1600 Baldric Gold Chest + Favor Tier Reward Tenacious Feat Onerous Odor Feat Tier Buffs Increases the damage of all Champions by 200% Increases the effect of Baldric's Healing Word ability by 400% Increases the effect of Baldric's Undeniable Uggie ability by 2,400% Increases the effect of Baldric's Bargaining Power ability by 100% Not everyone will be able to complete all four Tiers of event content. Here's how to think about it: Tier 1 - Brand new player power (Can earn 5e08 Favor or more but gear is mostly Greens/Blues) Tier 2 - Early game power (Can earn e20 Favor or more, gear is mostly Blues/Purples, but Modron Core isn't leveled up or piped well) Tier 3 - Mid game power (Can earn e40 Favor or more, gear is all Purples, some have Legendary Effects, Modron Cores are 15 and Purple flow) Tier 4 - Late game power (Can earn e75 Favor or more, Legendary Effects on all their primary Champions at Level 5 or higher, Supercharged Modron Cores) This is a progress measurement system that lets you know where you are in the power progression arc and potentially what you need to work on to move forward. The table below has the approximate boss health values at the various end stages. Comparing this to your BUD will let you know how close or far you are from being able to complete things. Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Tier 4 First Variant e22 e68 e162 e322 Second Variant e35 e95 e215 e376 Third Variant e48 e122 e269 e429 Initial Adventure: Reclaiming the Past Info: No restrictions. Gaar's Notes: Coming Soon! First Variant: High Stakes Negotiators Info: Baldric starts in the formation. He can be moved, but not removed. Only Champions who have a Charisma of 15 or higher and are not next to Uggie can deal damage. Fallbacks Champions can always deal damage, regardless of their position or Charisma. Gaar's Notes: Coming soon! Second Variant: The Tavern Keepers Info: Baldric starts in the formation with his Healing Word ability unlocked. He can be moved, but not removed. A thrown mug hits a random Champions every second dealing 5% of their max health in damage. After area 125 this increases to 10%. After area 350 this increases to 25% and after area 800 this increases to 50%. Gaar's Notes: Coming soon! Third Variant: A God for Every Occasion Info: Baldric starts in the formation with his Bargaining Power ability unlocked. He can be moved, but not removed. You may only use Champions that coutn as one of Baldric's bargaining partners. Gaar's Notes: Coming soon! Achievements Gaar's Note: All of these achievements can be earned at any time, not just during their Event. Recruit Baldric - 1% Recruit Baldric, the Dwarf Cleric Parlay with Gods - 1% Complete all three variants of the \"Reclaiming the Past (Baldric)\" adventure. (This achievement can be earned via Time Gates.) Worth the Price - 1% Obtain a piece of gear for each of Baldric's six equipment slots. (Event Champ gear does not come from regular Silver/Gold Chests. You can earn Event Champ gear from their specific Event Chests, Time Gates, qualifying Patron Chests, and other Chests as noted.) Knowledge Unlocked - 1% Complete area 250 in any \"Reclaiming the Past\" adventure, variant, free play, or Time Gate. You Drive A Dark Bargain - 1% Reset in area 200 or higher once with each of the five Dark Bargain specializations chosen. Gaar's Note: No way around it here: you'll have to do this in five runs. Remember what you're choosing each time because historically they don't let you know which you've done already.

      "content_preview": "So i started an adventure: The Nimble Grove, Zariel patron. Initially, i chose Grimm as my tank and Beadle for support. the game allowed me to do this, and i didn't question it at the time. I came back the next day and found that both had been removed from the formation and were no longer allowed. upon closer inspection, i found the problem: Grimm is legal for Zariel (str 10+, cha 13+), but not legal for Nimble Grove (dex 14+). Beadle is legal for Nimble Grove, but not for Zariel. for some reason, when i started the adventure, the game checked and saw one was legal by one rule, and allowed the other, saw the other was legal by the other rule, and allowed the first. then i guess when i logged in just now, it double checked and ruled differently (luckily the adventure was 1 zone from completion) what was different about the second check that changed the outcome? is this something reproducible? or something that can be take advantage of in someway?",

      "content_preview": "Hello, I’ve been playing for about a year and a half.  I play on my mobile phone.  I have 125 champions unlocked, and I generally clear through level 800 for most events, so most of the tier 3s (just cleared a level 1000 for one adventure in the current event).  I have a gem farm that gets me about 12,000/ day offline, 25,000 if I’m running it online.  I’ve unlocked the first four patrons and should be able to unlock Elminster by the weekend.  I’m a member of the Discord but have trouble navigating it, so I do most of my research on Reddit.  This is my first post. Questions: at this point in the game, how should I use bounty contracts?  I usually get plenty of gold, other than maybe at the start of a new time gate.  Is there a smart use for them to help level characters up? I recently unlocked the Tiamat trials but have not started them, as some of the stuff I’ve read sounds like you get teamed up, and I’m not sure if my party is strong enough to keep pace with others. For Briv, do I need to still have the 4j feat if I already have the 9j feat?- is there any benefit to having both active at the same time?  And right now he’s still only jumping one level at a time; I’ve been tweaking with getting him loaded with more stacks- does he gradually start jumping more than one level? what do Black Viper’s red gems do? Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "Hey, I just started to gemfarm and I do have a few question about it. I did follow u/Gaarawarr (I think I spelled the name good) for the champions for gemfarming. I did let it run for 12 hours and it did get like 150k at gems, so 10k+ gems per hour. I think this is a good base to start. I am farming at the mad wizard, have 10 familiars (9 on the champions and one for the click damage) and 5 for the field. so 15 in total. And I do have the perk unlocked that every skinn for a champion is giving 20% extra damage. So my question, would I best invest in gold chests to upgrade my gear of my champions or best in skins? I feel like the chests arent coming in fast at the moment",

All Im looking is for tips from people who did succeed in beating that lvl. From ivls, to upping the blessings, to anything that can be helpfull in clearing it without much trouble.

It's a lore podcast in which we look at the official villains of D&D (among other systems as well like PF, WoD or any system in between). Each episode we look at one of these epic BBEG and examine their history, abilities and lore. For Ep 42 We dive into the villains of Idol Champions. We follow the travels of a warforged from Eberron to Forgotten Realms. We study the evil hexblade warlock known as The Warden. LISTEN ON Apple Podcasts · Spotify · Amazon Music · Youtube",

I like using her in a lot of forms. Is there any real reason to get Omin? I know he has some good support. But does he need iLvls or can I just gate him and get good use of his support at lower iLvl.",

Not the end of the world, gonna lose some gems and chests since the speed champs don't work offline but whatever. When I logged back in, I had 24 Electrum chests, got an achievement for finishing all the Icewind Dale variants, and had easily 100 of the little potions of each type than I did before I left. (Plus all the other potion sizes had some more of each too.) I can't have completed the variants because I don't have Kent and Virgil, which are required to do one of the variants. The capstone variant requires having completed all other variants, so I haven't done that either. I also have had and used Diana enough she couldn't have had more than 2 chests \"banked\" that I hadn't already snagged. Obviously not complaining but I'm wondering if there is anything happening or I guess happened, that I am unaware of.",
