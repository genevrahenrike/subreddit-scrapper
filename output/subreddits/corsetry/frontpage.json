The backs on the rivets we ordered (multiple sizes) seem a lot thinner and flimsier than what commercial manufacturers are using. Same for spiral boning. We have multiple widths but they all feel flimsy compared to corsets we have ordered from Europe. Are there any recommended suppliers or brands we should look into?",

Well, i'm planning on crafting a bodysuit with an overbust corset to be my birthday party outfit. the theme is formula one and i wanted it to be the colors of my favorite team with a bit of a grid girl vibe mixed with 80s glam. so i have a couple questions, since it'll be my first: about boning, which one provides more structure and support: flat or not flat? i need a lot of support for my back and bust. normally strapless things tend to fall and make me look almost naked, i wanna prevent that from happening about materials: i planned on it being super sexy, so i was looking into latex/vinyl fabric. but i know the fabric has to be stretchless so it looks good on a corset. idk if these fabrics can be used on real corsets (i found a couple tops with that material, but i don't think it's from a reliable store), so i need you guys' opinion. about lacing: can satin be used in proper lacing? i found a couple references, but i just wanna confirm that it really works i don't have a lot of room for error, so i'd really appreciate your advice",

The problem is that I can't wear it because while I'm wearing it, I start to feel sick. My breathing starts to falter, the corset feels too tight even when it's loose. It's suffocating, and the pressure it puts on my stomach seems to increase as I wear it, and my breathing becomes labored. Then my body, my breathing, screams for me to take it off and breathe normally again. I'm healthy, I exercise, and I've been doing sit-ups. Is it normal to feel this way? I really can't even stay in the corset for twenty minutes. I wear a classic underbust corset that hugs my stomach and my entire belly.",

      "content_preview": "I’m making Aranea Black’s Amber Bunny suit and opted to reduce the waist by 4” (31” to 27”). In finalizing my mockup I have found that I can easily fully close the corset. It’s comfortable and body hugging, but I’m not sure if I should reduce the waist by another size down to 25” so I have the options to wear it with a 4” or 6” reduction. This is my first corset made to my body so I guess I’m just feeling like I measured wrong (even though I measured 4 times and got the same number each time) or that’s it’s supposed to feel tighter since that’s what I’m used to with ready made corsets?",

Basically, a corset that I can use for a wide variety of time periods for the purpose of rehearsal. I am, however, a broke college student. I'm hoping to find something that would accurately give me the feeling that most accurate costumes would give, would last me a long time, but still is budget friendly. I wouldn't be using the corset for any waist training/cinching. It's simply just to be used to get used to the feeling of moving around with the layers and different movement constrictions. Let me know if you have any recommendations of where I can look!",

Strapless dresses with corset bodices are super popular, but we have a couple designers whose boning is ridiculously flimsy. I’m trying to source the kind of synthetic whalebone that Berta uses in her dresses. It’s somewhat transparent, lacks the vertical striations you find in most rolls of poly boning, is flat on one side and rounded on the other, and is wonderfully rigid.  I’m looking for a piece of it so I can take a picture, but in the meantime, if anyone knows what I’m talking about and/or where to get it, that would be so fantastic!",

Id like to have the best fit possible of course, and I've read that patterns are often not the best for corsets without making your own adjustments.
