      "content_preview": "I feel very conflicted and need advice! I feel terrible about it. I got rhinoplasty with this one doctor around two years ago when I was seventeen years old. My nose ended up botched, I still have trouble breathing, and I had a bad experience with the doctor overall. I had made multiple posts on here about this doctor with pictures of my botched nose, and i detailed my bad experience with the doctor and the way he had spoken to me. I had not gotten many replies, but I did get quite some views. After I made these posts I started focusing on finding new doctors for a revision (I still haven't found a doctor to get it done yet). Today the doctor called my dad, and according to my dad he was on the verge of tears. He apologized over and over again for being rude, and said he would give me a revision free of charge and would make sure to fix it. He said he would do anything and just begged for me to take the posts about him here down because it was affecting his business really badly according to him. Edit: i also wanted to add that i posted this on a throwaway because the posts are still on my other account and I dont want to bring more attention to them before I can make a decision I made the posts because i feel responsible to make other people aware of my experience with him to help them make a decision, but on the other hand I know that this is his livelihood and now I just feel shitty and guilty even though I was just talking about my experience.  Do you guys have any similar experiences to this or advice for me on what to do? I already decided that regardless of my decision I will not do a revision with him since I don't feel comfortable with going under the knife by him again, but I don't know if I should delete the posts or keep them up.  :(",

      "content_preview": "Can users please start reading the community rules? Every single post I see is somebody asking “should I get xyz done?” or “am I candidate for xyz?” “what will fix my face?”. I implore everybody who’s looking to get a surgery done to identify what area needs work, what you’d like to change about it and your options with a QUALIFIED surgeon. There are clinics and hospitals that offer free consultations and will answer any questions you might have. Asking strangers on Reddit what invasive procedure you need is NOT safe for anybody involved. Not the person who’s asking and not the people with 0 surgical experience who are answering. I feel like the sub is turning into an echo chamber of people saying “you don’t need any work done!” And are actually opposing others to surgery since they don’t have the qualifications to answer the question being asked. Others are playing doctor and are possibly leading people down the wrong path, mentally and possibly even physically, if they take the wrong advice or try a DIY approach. This is muddy waters, imo. Just felt like sharing my 2 cents about recent activity in the sub🤓 How are you guys feeling about it? I honestly miss when I’d mostly see users sharing their results, experiences, healing process, etc.",

      "content_preview": "I want to share my experience to make others aware — please do NOT work here or any of its location. I was a nurse at this clinic, and it is an extremely toxic and unsafe environment. There is no proper oversight or governing body ensuring that things are done correctly, and the leadership is unqualified and disorganized. I have been a nurse for five years, and I have never encountered such alarming practices. For the first time in my career, I genuinely felt my nursing license was at risk. I was asked to sign charts for patients that I did not see and refused to do them. The managers show no concern for the high turnover rate among staff, and they refuse to listen to employees’ perspectives when problems arise. The manager I worked under routinely used fear tactics, created unnecessary paper trails through lengthy emails and meetings, and fostered a culture of intimidation. Nurses and medical assistants are left overwhelmed, carrying unsafe workloads, and then unfairly blamed when things go wrong. This toxic culture doesn’t only harm employees — it directly impacts patients. The clinic engages in questionable billing practices, taking advantage of patients while ignoring legitimate complaints and health concerns. Despite patients reaching out with serious issues, follow-up is often nonexistent. In short, this is not a safe workplace, nor is it a safe place for patients. The lower procedure costs may seem appealing, but please be cautious: what you are getting here is not quality care.",
