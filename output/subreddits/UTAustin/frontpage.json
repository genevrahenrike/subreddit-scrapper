I actually graduated last year and decided to take a gap year in Texas(Dont ask why texas). I've been told that UT Austin's admissions process can seem pretty random, but I'd say I have good stats. I went to a competitive private high school and graduated with a 4.8/5.0  GPA. We were basically required to take AP classes, which I guess is why my gpa is weigthed idk. My choice are either ut austin, txst or tamu if you got any tips well lmk. 🙂",

I can pay $12-15/hour or we could do a language exchange if you’re interested in improving your Spanish (I'm a native Spanish speaker). If you enjoy teaching or helping others with language learning, and you're available to meet regularly, feel free to DM me! Thanks!",
