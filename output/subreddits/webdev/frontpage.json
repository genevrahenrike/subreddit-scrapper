By combining artificial intelligence, a live coding environment, and modern teaching methods,LearnPython.AIaddresses a critical gap in the global online education space.The Origin: From a Childhood Need to a Global PlatformLearnPython started as a personal journey. The original motivation was simple but powerful: introducing my 10-year-old son to programming and Python. At the time, there was no complete, interactive resource available in Greek. Out of this need,LearnPython.grwas created – entirely in Greek – to give learners access to high-quality programming education in their native language.The success of this initiative quickly showed that the vision could go further. Building on the momentum, the platform expanded intoLearnPython.AI, adding English support and AI-powered tools, making it accessible to learners worldwide.The New Feature: Personal AI Python TutorWith the release ofVersion 3.0.0,LearnPython.AIintroduces a groundbreaking feature: thePersonal AI Python Tutor.This tutor is designed not just to generate code, but to truly supportunderstanding. Students can:Study directly with the platform’s lessons– discussing concepts, clarifying doubts, and learning interactively.Upload their own files (PDFs, notes, textbooks)– allowing the tutor to provide explanations and guidance tailored to personal study materials.Work on assignments step by step– focusing on comprehension rather than simply receiving a ready-made piece of code.Access full Python expertise– covering both fundamentals and advanced topics.Privacy remains central: all uploaded files are processedlocally in the browser, ensuring absolute confidentiality.The Strategy: A Learning Experience for the New EraLearnPython.AIgoes beyond static tutorials, creating a dynamic, learner-centered experience that is:Engaging– encouraging consistent practice.Effective– building true understanding, not rote memorization.Interactive– involving learners in every step of the process.Key platform features include:Interactive Live Editor & Terminal– write and run Python code directly inside lessons.Structured Curriculum– from basics to advanced libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask/Django.AI Assistant– explains, debugs, and creates examples on demand.Gamification & Progress Tracking– motivation through badges, challenges, and milestones.Global Access, Local RootsLearnPython.AIis free to use, accessible from any device, and fully bilingual. What started as a Greek-only project is now open to learners from around the world, without losing its original mission: to make programming education accessible, interactive, and human-centered.Start Learning TodayDiscoverLearnPython.AIathttps://learnpython.ai, write your first lines of Python code in the live editor, and meet your newAI Tutor– a learning companion designed to help you truly understand programming.",

While cloudflare is working on a paywall solution, some further providers (like tollbit) are already in the market offering scraping bot paywalls. My question is, do these paywalls actually work? Or is it so far rather a glorified AI bot blocker? In theory the scraping bot will be forward to a third party domain with a paywall where a payment must be made before it is able to access the content of the respective website. How would a scraping bot even pay? Or would it just rather stop „scraping“ this website instead? I would assume that can only work with solid contracts in palace between the paywalls and the AI provider. I have never heard of such. What is your opinion/experience on this topic?",

I am looking into Shopify, but it is unclear whether it would allow for such deep customization.

Despite multiple attempts to pinpoint the issue or implement solutions, we are still unable to find a way to fully address this issue and unfortunately there are even more instances of this error reported by our sales team after they encountered that feedback on several of their calls.My youngest brother is currently responsible for the website work as he is the most knowledgeable when it comes to programming, PHP, Javascript, and other essential skills needed to manage/develop a website. Any feedback or observations from anyone with web development experience/knowledge is much appreciated, we really just want to get some ideas of where the issue may come from and try to see if we can figure a way to lower instances of this issue or even outright get rid of it completely.",

      "content_preview": "Hey senior devs, I’ve been exploring how tools likeBuilder.io, Lovable, and DhiWise turn Figma designs into working code, and I’m trying to understand how it actually works behind the scenes. I thought I’d share what I’ve pieced together so far and ask if my understanding is on the right track.From what I can tell, the process starts by pulling raw design data from Figma using their API or a plugin. That JSON describes every frame, text, and layer, but it’s messy to work with directly. So the next step seems to be normalizing it into an internal schema. For example, a “Frame” might get mapped into a “Container,” “Text” into “Typography,” and so on. This part looks mostly rule-based rather than AI-heavy.Once that schema exists, code can be generated using templates filled in by rules. A button schema with text, font size, and colors would plug into a predefined template and output a React<button>with inline styles. This makes the result predictable and avoids AI hallucinations.What I don’t fully get is how these tools handle user prompts like “make this button rounded” or “switch this layout to grid” when those exact variations weren’t in the original template. Do they just keep expanding their rules and templates, or do they layer in AI on top to patch and adjust the generated code?Does this overall flow sound accurate? Am I missing something important? I’d love to hear from anyone with experience building or researching design-to-code systems, or even links to solid technical breakdowns I can dig into.",
