      "content_preview": "Hey guys, I have been wondering how the future of monetizing content will look like with AI taking over traffic and using website content they don’t own. While cloudflare is working on a paywall solution, some further providers (like tollbit) are already in the market offering scraping bot paywalls. My question is, do these paywalls actually work? Or is it so far rather a glorified AI bot blocker? In theory the scraping bot will be forward to a third party domain with a paywall where a payment must be made before it is able to access the content of the respective website. How would a scraping bot even pay? Or would it just rather stop „scraping“ this website instead? I would assume that can only work with solid contracts in palace between the paywalls and the AI provider. I have never heard of such. What is your opinion/experience on this topic?",

I am looking into Shopify, but it is unclear whether it would allow for such deep customization.

As a result, I find very few websites that I want to bookmark or go back to. The web started with egalitarian information-centric motivation, but has devolved into a morass of dark patterns.

If it is not that message they will get a message saying something like how they are unable to connect to the website.Our business is mainly based on billing and logistics (we are an authorized reseller for DHL services).We use Joomla for the CMS on the website and have it hosted via Network Solutions while using Host Gator to manage our domain name ownership. Despite multiple attempts to pinpoint the issue or implement solutions, we are still unable to find a way to fully address this issue and unfortunately there are even more instances of this error reported by our sales team after they encountered that feedback on several of their calls.My youngest brother is currently responsible for the website work as he is the most knowledgeable when it comes to programming, PHP, Javascript, and other essential skills needed to manage/develop a website. Any feedback or observations from anyone with web development experience/knowledge is much appreciated, we really just want to get some ideas of where the issue may come from and try to see if we can figure a way to lower instances of this issue or even outright get rid of it completely.",

      "content_preview": "I am using \"AI\" since the day OpenAI released ChatGPT. It felt like magic back then like we had built real intelligence. The hype exploded with people fearing developers would soon be replaced.I am a skilled software architect. After years of pushing every AI platform to its limits I came to the conclusion that AI is NOT intelligent. It doesn’t create it predicts the next best word. Ask it for something new or very complex combination of multiple problems and it starts hallucinating. AI is just a fancy database with a the worlds first natural language query system.What about all those vibe coders you ask? They have no idea what they are doing. Theres no chance in hell that their codebases are even remotely coherent or sustainable.The improvements have slowed down drastically. ChatGPT 5 was nothing but hot air and I think we are very close to plateauing. AI is great for translation and text drafting. But no chance it can replace a real developer. And its definitely not intelligent. It just mimics intelligence.So I don't think we have real AI yet let alone AGI.Edit: Thank you all for your comments. I really enjoyed reading them and I agree with most of them. I don't hate AI tools. I tested them extensively but now I will stop and use them only for quick research, emails and simple code autocompletion. My main message was for beginners to not rely solely on AI and don't take the outputs as the absolute truth. And for those doubting themselves to remember that you're definitely not replaceable by those tools. Happy coding!",

If someone writes a detailed, articulate, and helpful comment or answer, people immediately assume it was generated by AI. Like.. Since when did clarity and effort become suspicious?I get it, AI tools are everywhere now, and yes, they can produce solid technical explanations. But it feels like we have reached a point where genuine human input is being dismissed just because it is longer than two lines or does not include typos. It is frustrating for those of us who actually enjoy writing thoughtful responses and sharing knowledge.Are we really at a stage where being helpful = being artificial?

I have a hosted server which i want to configure to do four things:To be notified when myfacebookpage gets amessage.To be notified when myinstagramaccount gets amessage.To be notified when myfacebookpage gets acommenton a post.To be notified when myinstagramaccount gets acommenton a post.I have been led to believe that the meta graph API does give webhooks for all four events and i can register my server for those webhooks, through the \"Messenger Product\" after creating an app on my meta developer account. So far, I have been able to satisfy requirements1and3without any hassle or any app reviews. But I can't get2and4to work. I've configured the webhook and added my page to the \"Instagram Messaging\" section under the \"Messenger Product\", but it doesn't send my server anything, unlike for the facebook page.This shouldn't be very hard to setup since these are my own facebook pages and instagram accounts. Does this functionality require app review for any instagram page? Any guidance on this would be highly highly appreciated! Thank you in advance.",

      "content_preview": "I work at a non-profit centre attached to a larger institution. I'm trained in graphic design but wear a lot of hats (not always well) since it's a small team. I recently lead the creation of a series of webpages for an external client. As discussed with them, I built the pages in WordPress and then, after approval, created a backup file for them to upload on a subdomain of their main website (also built in WordPress). I have not done this before and there's no one with experience in anything similar at our centre. The client's web team okayed the plan prior to commencing. The client recently informed me that they had it uploaded and ready to go, and when I went to check it out I saw that it is living in an iframe embed on one of their main website pages, which isn’t what we discussed. Testing the links, I see that none of the links to our institution’s pages (a major feature) work, and the reason seems to be that our institution doesn't allow its pages to be opened in embeds. I had no idea that was a thing.I’m going to reach out to our IT team to see if it’s possible to figure something out, but I’m just wondering if anyone can give me an idea if this is something that can selectively be worked around so I can know what to ask IT. I’ve read a bit about how this can be set in the first place, but struggled to understand it as this is all a bit beyond me. Could we give this one website the ability to embed our institution’s pages? Would we need to set open permission (whatever that entails) to embed on each of the pages in question? I’m sure our IT wouldn’t allow the latter.I went through the client’s embed to find the actual page they’ve embedded, thinking we could just go back to the plan as I understood it and link to that. However, from there, none of the internal links for the series of pages I created work—instead they all direct back to the client’s main page. If anyone has an idea of how that could be easily fixed, feel free.Obviously in over my head here lol. Wishing I could go back to what I was trained in…",

      "content_preview": "Hey senior devs, I’ve been exploring how tools likeBuilder.io, Lovable, and DhiWise turn Figma designs into working code, and I’m trying to understand how it actually works behind the scenes. I thought I’d share what I’ve pieced together so far and ask if my understanding is on the right track.From what I can tell, the process starts by pulling raw design data from Figma using their API or a plugin. That JSON describes every frame, text, and layer, but it’s messy to work with directly. So the next step seems to be normalizing it into an internal schema. For example, a “Frame” might get mapped into a “Container,” “Text” into “Typography,” and so on. This part looks mostly rule-based rather than AI-heavy.Once that schema exists, code can be generated using templates filled in by rules. A button schema with text, font size, and colors would plug into a predefined template and output a React<button>with inline styles. This makes the result predictable and avoids AI hallucinations.What I don’t fully get is how these tools handle user prompts like “make this button rounded” or “switch this layout to grid” when those exact variations weren’t in the original template. Do they just keep expanding their rules and templates, or do they layer in AI on top to patch and adjust the generated code?Does this overall flow sound accurate? Am I missing something important? I’d love to hear from anyone with experience building or researching design-to-code systems, or even links to solid technical breakdowns I can dig into.",

Thanks for your pointers!(My current plan is to try again with `@shopify/draggable`, to disable Shadow DOM for the components in the page that needs drag and drop, figure out how to work-around the fact that I also use slots).",
