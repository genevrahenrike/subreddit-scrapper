I bring a systems-thinking approach to solving complex urban challenges, grounded in scientific inquiry, implementable strategies, and a strong commitment to community engagement. I am passionate about creating better cities and confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to the City. It's been over a year of applying for jobs, and I have not heard back from organisations or municipalities! I find it unreal to have had a career dotted with achievements, but now experiencing eerie silence on my applications. Please help me out, if anyone is reading this. I am truly passionate about urban development, but seeing zero response in my environment is beginning to get me down. Guidance/reference/ info chat of any form would be extremely helpful!

      "content_preview": "I am one of these people who likes apartment living in the city center. I grew up in a flat in downtown Sofia, where it is very common a family of 4 to live in a condo.  The closer to the center you are located - the more prestigious your location is, the more connected to the place you grow to be. You are walking where all the historic figures of the time were making history. Downtown offers a lot of convenience, since it is developed to service the residents. You have many bakeries, grocery stores, libraries, doctors, dentists, hotels and all this within short distance, they all service the population that lives in the heart of the city. When I moved to US, I quickly realized that the society is different. In the USA, the house in remote suburbia is looked upon in a positive light, while the downtown living was frowned upon, especially when it comes to family living. Per the local logic the families should live in suburbia, because the crime rates are lower, there are less to no homeless people, and the school districts are better. All valid points to choose suburbia. The suburban mindset however created a problem. In the second part of 20th century, the downtown turned into predominantly corporative center, which after 6:00 PM becomes deserted crime-welcoming city. The beautiful historic buildings from the 1900s, businesses and stores of the older generation - closed. The businesses strategically moved towards suburbia, since no one wanted to step in downtown after dark. School quality in downtown deteriorated with the abandonment of the city. Schools and crime became a problem as a result of converting downtown into a corporative ghost town. The trend amongst the modern urban planners in recent times, is to remediate the problem of the dead centers by making the American downtown livable again. They are inviting residential builders to erect apartment complexes, or to convert abandoned factories into lofts. All these new flats and condos are marketed to the younger professionals dog owners, luring them to move to the city through the abundant bar scene and the walking distance to the office. This is how the American downtowns were redesigned but the families with children, however, were completely excluded from the project. The planners and architects, are perhaps the same young childless professionals, who find it normal to make a dog park for each residential building, but never dedicate a children’s playground. There are not many children’s playgrounds in the public areas either, but many doggy parks and even dog bars over huge lots of expensive downtown land. I am trying to find excuse for the planners, speculating that they may be reluctant to put playgrounds in the parks out of fear that the homeless will sit there, but then why are the architects also so reluctant to put a playground on premises? I find this collective exclusion of children an odd coincidence. The urban planners, architects and investors had good intentions to revive the city, but failed to make the urban space an all-inclusive environment. This segregation between childfree people and families is a strange phenomenon. Most of the same young professionals will start families eventually and will have to part ways with their fun lifestyle. They will continue to need to socialize, to live conveniently, to want to spend time at the beautiful parks, to benefit from the culture, to want to save time rather than waste it driving back and forth to suburbia. They will be most likely eager to introduce their children to things like theater, museum, history, architecture, other kids…  yet they will fall victims of their own deficient urban design, architecture and prejudice that suburbia is for the families. What do you think the outcome of this short lived urban \"remediation\" will be? The downtown is now converted into a temporary bedroom for the workers, who do not really look at it seriously, because for them the city is just for fun. Soon when they meet The One, they will move to their “forever home” in suburbia.  When people see their city as a “temporary bedroom”, they do not respect it and do not invest in it as they should. Since they are not invested in it, the place eventually is used and abused, and deteriorates. This is not how you make a city. A city is a place where people are citizens - civilized and engaged. Where you as a citizen care how the life in your city is because you will stay there for longer than few years. Where you see the diversity of the world and you learn to interact with a diverse community – to at minimum grow some manners, overcome your anxiety and say “hello” to the neighbor in the elevator. Make the city centers more family friendly to stimulate the return of the families to them, and stop treating downtown as soulless faceless amusement park for adult entertainment. Growing a feeling of belonging towards a place is the way to build a city.",

The next best I've is Australia - and I'm confused if UQ (based on my GPA is acceptable), RMIT, QUT etc. Should I try even UK or Ireland?",

I’ve been looking at how some countries delivered homes very quickly when populations were rising like Singapore’s modular HDB flats, South Korea’s new towns, and Vienna’s large-scale affordable housing. It got me thinking: could Australia do something similar by combining government support with private-sector speed? For example: Using modular / off-site construction to cut build times. Delivering whole precincts (housing + shops + community space) instead of just scattered projects. Tapping into existing programs like the Housing Australia Future Fund or state PPP models. I’m curious about the local perspective: What do you see as the biggest roadblocks here, is it zoning, financing, political will, or something else? Are there Australian examples where partnerships have actually delivered quickly? From an investor or developer view, does this sound realistic or naïve? I’d love to learn from people in this community who’ve dealt with housing delivery on the ground. Thanks in advance!",
