I’m not one to complain but it’s old and played out at this point I know T1 said something about the YouTube editing a while ago, and it’s seriously improved since. The only input that matters on video quality is his, you’re shouting into a void but I have to listen to it every day.

I’ve been working on something similar for a while (a real-time AI voice coaching tool called STATUP.GG ), so seeing Tyler test his version on stream was really impressive. It makes me wonder — was it a technical challenge, or more of a user traction thing? If anyone here actually used it, I’d love to hear what the experience was like. Would be cool to know if Tyler or anyone on the team is still interested in the AI voice coaching space. I’ve always believed there’s real potential in it.",
