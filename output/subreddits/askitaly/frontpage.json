We've used the toll road and collected our slip as we entered but unfortunately we took the wrong lane when leaving, which was for people with tags I believe? There wasn't an option for us to pay in the lane we took. We pressed the help button and spoke to somebody, explaining that we took the wrong lane and they opened the barrier for us. Is there anywhere for us to go online to pay the fare that we owe?",

My partner has never been to Italy so I plan on going to Rome with her and would like to travel to where her Grandmother lived to Propose to her. However, from what I understand it's a very small town and not the easiest to travel to. I just wondered what the best way to travel there would be and if there are any recommended local places to stay (doesn't have to be in the town). Thanks in advance.",

However: Nobody was going slower than 90 kph. There was no construction work, no crossings, industrial zones, etc. A fine Italian road. Other restrictions without the bottom sign, e.g. 70 kph limits, did make other drivers slow down. There were solo 50 kph signs, too. Trucks were still overtaking whoever they wanted to lol. No speed traps either. This went on for long stretches. It's not limited to this one road. What am I missing? Or is this some kind of fake sign? It's been up for years now, according to Google Street view.",

But most people seem to drive 60 to 70, completely ignoring the orange automatic speed checks. Outside of towns, it’s usually 90, but many drive only 80 (sometimes the same that just drive 70 inside of town). Sometimes speed is reduced to 30 inside and 70 outside but I rarely see a sign that it’s back to regular speed. Often I don’t see a good reason for the reduction as the road seems perfectly straight and well kept. I try to respect the limit, for everyone’s safety (and to avoid a fine). But I also don’t want to be an obstacle for other drivers overtaking me in a town center. So how fast would you Italians recommend me to drive?",

Now, it's August, we haven't got a letter and we haven't paid either, because first we didn't know where to pay it and then we forgot to investigate this topic. Where can we check how much did we fucked up? The Pedemontana Lombarda website is in Italian and asks for a login and password to pay. We have a car with EU-country licence plates and the stretch of the highway we used was short, like maybe 5 kms.",

Is this common in Italy to do that? I never had to upload my ID in any hotel I've stayed in multiple countries.

When in Italy, I’d love to drive thru a plate recognition lane much like Brenner / ASFIN in Austria allows for, and auto pay, receiving a receipt by email. In Italy, I have to stop, pay by card / cash, and if I’m lucky enough to encounter a live person, I can in fact get a receipt. Which business travel wise I do require for accounting purposes. When it is not available (i.e. payment is automated — which is the case is mostly — again, feel free to correct me and tell me what I’m missing, call me a dumbass, if you must), I have to resort to excruciatingly annoying practices to fulfill my accounting related obligations. Having read up on this topic, I understand there is a box of sorts, that you can place under your windshield, comparable to EZ pass in the US? Is there any pure plate recognition system?

I know that her 8 great-grandparents are Italian immigrants from Lombardy and Veneto. But despite this, her grandparents, parents and she were born in Brazil. People here always think I'm \"Italian\" even though I have \"old stock\" origins in Brazil. Once when I was asked about my surnames, I said that I don't have an Italian surname like her, so she said that I am \"Brazilian\", and in fact I am, although there is no \"Brazilian\" surname, as far as I know, my surnames are of Portuguese origin, even though my Portuguese ancestors came to Brazil before 1800. But what I found strange was that in my head she is as much Brazilian as I am, it doesn't matter if my family has been in Brazil for longer or not, If you were born in Brazil and are the son of parents born in Brazil, for me that person is 100% Brazilian. But some people here in the South of Brazil of German or Italian origin from more than 150 years ago, think they are Europeans and those of us who have older roots are the true Brazilians. I heard that this also happens in some places in the USA.",

We encountered italian bidets in every hotel.  IMO these are superior to the bidets that are growing in popularity in usa.  The usa bidets are simply water jets while the italian bidets are entirely separate plumbing fixtures.  You have access to soap and can fully wash yourself.  You emerge from the bathroom completely clean as if nothing ever happened.  We are sold! What happens when you visit someone at their home and use their bathroom?  The bidet is usually located immediately next to the toilet.  Is it permitted to wash yourself on the bidet - as if it were your own bathroom?  Or is that too intimate or a violation of the hospitality you have been shown by your host? To be blunt:  if I poop at someone else's home, can I clean myself with the bidet?  Or do I only use toilet paper and later on I can bidet in my own home or hotel etc...?  Again, apologies but I dont want to risk insulting when someone invites us to their home!",

I am very proud of my Calabrian identity because I grew up and was immersed in it since my childhood. Today, I work in finance in a geographical area where I have quite a few Italian clients. I have a B2 level in Italy because I learned Italian for 3 years in high school, and I have a little command of the Calabrian dialect. However, I have noticed that some Italian customers coming from the North and Center of Italy are borderline suspicious and don't care that I am the only one who makes the effort to speak Italian for them, because yes, it is not at all an obligation in the company. Well, I don't know, maybe it's a bad impression on my part, but apart from the Calabrians with whom I get along very well and the relations are very cordial, I have the feeling that the Italians from the North and even the Neapolitans/Sicilians are not too friendly with me especially coming from the young people, the older people are really friendly. Afterwards, I don't know the relations between the regions in Italy, so if you have any clarifications or advice, I am interested. THANKS",

      "content_preview": "Hiya, I’m starting my gap year in Italy - where I plan to be perhaps 1 or 2 months. Is anyone aware of any particular networks that offer affordable plans (€15 or so a month) which can be easily canceled after this period ? I see most are a rolling contract for a year or two, and hence I imagine the cancellation would be with fees or such. Thanks !",

I'm just asking if there are pdf downloads available of the displays of train arrivals and departures that I saw on train platforms in stations in Italy. There was a different one for every station. I was wondering if they can be downloaded by the pubic. I was stationed at Aviano, and I miss looking at them. Grazie!",
