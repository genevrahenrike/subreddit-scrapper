I can stare at the assignment for hours and not make head or tails out of it.I might not be working hard enough on it. I know I just have to start but omggggg I just can't.Can you guys please send some encouragement and kind words my way. I have already wasted a month procrastinating on these assignments.",

I gave a few things from the book a shot, and two weeks later, I've been way more organized with my studying and not freaking out before every quiz or exam. Here's what I did from the book:﻿﻿﻿Habit Stacking - Started studying right after my coffee every morning. Now I can't make coffee without automatically studying for a bit. Weirdly works.﻿﻿﻿Bribing myself - I’ll watch a 10-minute YouTube vid after studying a chunk of my notes every hour or so. Super motivating.Identity Shift - Instead of saying, \"I should study,\" I'm like, \"I'm the type of person who studies every day.\" Makes skipping feel wrong.4 Fix Your Space - Cleaned my desk, hid my phone, and used a website blocker every single day. No more zoning out for hours. ﻿﻿Results:Actually finished an essay early (who am l?)studying feels part of my day now, not forced.Stress has been way lower for exams and quizzesnow I’ve been getting excited to studyDefinitely not a miracle, but honestly, it's been so much better than before. If you struggle with procrastination (like me), this might help. Anyone else tried it?Share your hacks please!",

Be strategic, not chaotic.Mind-map your classes Before lectures pile up, grab a sheet and map out each course + big topics. Turns your brain into a spider web of connections instead of a random soup of notes. And yes, there’s science that says it boosts memory.Build buffer time Stop scheduling life like you’re a robot. Add 10–15 min cushions between things. That way, when class runs late or you spiral on a calc problem, you don’t nuke your whole day.Change your scenery Your bed is for sleep, not essays. Rotate in a café, library, or even a park bench. New environment = new focus, and you’ll dodge the “oh look my fridge again” problem.Track your time like a nerdy wizard 🪄 Don’t just hope you’re studying enough  track it. I started using Studentheon (it’s free) and it legit changed the game. You hit start on a Pomodoro timer, and it spits out stats/graphs of how much you actually worked. Wildly motivating to see “wow, I actually studied 30 hours this week” instead of just vibes.Drop ur best tips in the comment and lets which which one is the best",

      "content_preview": "1. Stop getting price-gouged when you shop online.The ultra-rich obviously have personal shoppers to compare prices for them, but most people don't have that kind of time…I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but Capital One Shopping has always worked well for me and I'd recommend trying it (link here).When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will automatically compare prices for you, and auto-apply coupon codes when possible.2. Your home equity is a gold-mine. If you need cash, stop taking out high-interest loans.So many people take out high-interest payday loans – please don’t do this. If you get into trouble you can typically get a relatively low-interest HELOC (a home equity line of credit).Essentially with a HELOC, you’re borrowing against the equity you have in your house and use it for whatever you need (much like a credit card).Typically, you’ll get lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms compared to traditional loans.Here’s a calculator you can use to see how much/little you could borrow (link here).Side note: if you hate debt, you can still get money out of your home’s equity by using something like Hometap, where you more or less sell investors a portion of your equity without a loan)3. Switch auto insurance companies every 6-12 months.If you haven’t compared auto insurance rates in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$400/year¹).Example: I cut my car insurance bill by ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers (same exact coverage too) and it took me a whopping 5 minutes.Take two minutes and pull up a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, Auto-Savings.com is fine too) and compare multiple offers from different companies in one go.Worst case scenario: you stay with what you’ve got. Best case scenario: you save a few hundred dollars a year.Here’s a link to a good comparison site: link.4. Get yourself a dang advisor.Most people are under the false impression that financial advisors are just for wealthy people.They absolutely aren’t: if you have a net worth of $100k+, you can typically qualify for an advisor. Having an advisor can boost your yearly net returns by 3%¹.If you don’t have an advisor in your family, use a site like Datalign to find somebody with good reviews in your area.5. You don't have to pay off your debt by yourself.Very few people know about it, but If you have $10k+ in debt, you can technically ask a debt relief to come in and take over the process for you.It’ll typically save you 23% off your total debt, after fees (according to NDR, a big debt relief company).They’ll negotiate with your creditors and try to get your debt reduced (then they take a cut of the savings).Typically people who are struggling with debt save 23% on avg. when they ask for help from debt relief companies.Here’s a little calculator you can use to see how much you’d potentially save: link.6. Save on home insurance.Some homeowners save $1k+/year just by switching home insurance providers (typically saving them more than changing auto insurance policies).If it’s been over a year since you’ve reviewed your rates, it might be worth taking a few minutes to compare offers. Here’s a home insurance comparison site I’ve used: (link).",

Now I'm in a situation where I have to pass at least 3 subjects to be able to enroll in the second year, otherwise I'll have to repeat the first year :( I have 4 subjects to take in the next 20 days (programming in 7 days, physics 2 in 11 days, mathematics 2 in 17 days and fundamentals of electrical circuits in 20 days).I'm free 24/7 and if I could still study that much now it would be great :DIs it possible to take all these subjects in such a short period and should I even study fundamentals of electrical circuits (since it's a book with about a thousand pages) or should I focus as much as possible on these 3 to secure my second year?P.S. We also have a penalty session in 14 days with the opportunity to take only one subject from the first semester that I haven't passed (it would probably be physics 1 because it's the easiest subject compared to the others).",

Like my eyes moved across the words but my brain was completely offline.It's especially bad with dense textbooks where every sentence is packed with information. I'll read something, realize I retained nothing, read it again, still nothing. Sometimes I'm re-reading the same sentence 4-5 times before anything actually registers.Tried reading slower, taking notes while reading, even saying the words out loud. Nothing seemed to help with this weird brain-deletion thing.Recently started usingBeeprept AIwhich breaks information into more interactive chunks instead of just walls of text. Been working better for me so far since it keeps my brain actually engaged.But seriously, does this happen to anyone else? How do you get your brain to actually process what you're reading instead of just going through the motions?",

      "content_preview": "1. Overpaying for car insuranceThe average American saves a whopping $410+ a YEAR (source) when they switch auto insurance carriers - sometimes significantly more than that: I saved $1,300 this year.The reason: some carriers offer discount prices to new customers when they switch.Take 30 seconds and go to a 3rd party comparison site (Coverage.com and Auto-Savings.com are both fine) to see if you can find cheaper rates. You’ll likely save yourself a bunch of money.Some people suggest switching every 6 months, that's a little bit overkill imo. Once a year should be fine.2. Overpaying when you shop onlineBig stores like Amazon know that no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites, so there’s often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices.I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but Capital One Shopping has always worked well for me and I'd recommend trying it (link here).When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will automatically compare prices for you, and auto-apply coupon codes when possible.3. Dealing with debt on your ownIf you’ve got $10k+ in unsecured debt (think credit cards, medical bills, etc), you can ask a debt relief company to come in and negotiate it for you. You typically will save around 23% on average (after their fees).Here’s a link to a savings calculator from National Debt Relief's website if you want to see how much you could save: link here.4. Not having a financial advisor.You know why so many rich people have financial advisors? It isn't because they're better at picking stocks (spoiler alert: they're not)It's because a good financial advisor will help you with all of the bizarro tax implications you never would have thought of. People with financial advisors end up making ~3% more/year thanks to better tax planning.If you don't know an advisor personally, use a 3rd party comparison site to find somebody with good reviews (WiserAdvisor is solid).5. Using normal, low-interest savings accountsI'm always shocked at the number of people still using garbage savings accounts that pay 0.5% (or less) a year. There are literally hundreds of banks that will pay you 8x that, usually 10x that rateHere's a link to a bunch of options.--There are tons of other things (obviously) but these are the ones that I see the most. Hope that helps.",

I used to play games or over stimulate myself with series and manga.Breaking this habit required too much of my mental fortitude. My brain literally begged me to go in the comfort zone, screamed inside to not do it again, but somehow I still wanted to take this path. But there were many obstacles in front of me like being drained after the job + gym, no proper diet and nutrients for brain functioning, regular allergies and headaches, stress making my stomach upset, my lazy mind, distractions. I faced all kind of minor challenges to get into study.Getting into studying once again felt like a hassel, it's a double edge sword to me. It feels good as well as painful. To get the joy of studying you really need to indulge yourself into it, visualize it and connect it to your previous knowledge threads. And for that you really need to get in the flow of study. I am currently working towards it.If anyone faced similar kind of problem, or can't know what's wrong with them, or doing everything right and still not working out, you can ask in the comment, I will try my best to help :)",

This is the whole basis behind active recall.But without reinforcement, these connections fade fast, this is the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. The fix is spaced repetition and self testing Each quiz/flashcard and review, timed right before you’d forget, strengthens memory and builds mental resilience.Think of it like lifting weights, the struggle means growth, and spacing your reps locks it in. you can use software likequizzifyorankito handle the spacing for youWhether it’s math, coding, or languages, breakthroughs come from struggle, review, and testing. Don’t quit during the hard part. Each quiz/flashcard is like an investment in a sharper, more durable mind.Your future self is counting on you to push through todays discomfort. Every moment of mental strain is an investment into a sharper, more resilient mind.happy studying :)",
