I wonder how other people are doing it!You an get a glance of my Computer Graphics study here:https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tXcGR2I work as a web developer now and want to transition to CG (Computer Graphics), which as I said, is no easy feat, since to enter in CG you need a lot of preparation and foundational knowledge.",

      "content_preview": "I swear this happens to me constantly. I'll read a sentence, get to the end of it, and have absolutely zero clue what I just read. Like my eyes moved across the words but my brain was completely offline.It's especially bad with dense textbooks where every sentence is packed with information. I'll read something, realize I retained nothing, read it again, still nothing. Sometimes I'm re-reading the same sentence 4-5 times before anything actually registers.Tried reading slower, taking notes while reading, even saying the words out loud. Nothing seemed to help with this weird brain-deletion thing.Recently started usingBeeprept AIwhich breaks information into more interactive chunks instead of just walls of text. Been working better for me so far since it keeps my brain actually engaged.But seriously, does this happen to anyone else? How do you get your brain to actually process what you're reading instead of just going through the motions?",

I can’t afford to actually study in a field that I enjoy so I chose something adjacent… turns out, I have no idea how to study. I just can’t sit down and actually do work over the weeks that I still have till my exam.Some backstory: I am from Germany and had excellent grades up until my first graduation after which i started an apprenticeship to earn money to leave my abusive household. Finished that with good grades after which I pursued higher education to earn a qualification that would allow me to go to university, which I also aced. The issue is… i never studied. I am really good when it comes to absorbing information by listening to teachers talk and using them to solve tasks and questions asked by teachers but I never took work home. Homework usually didn’t take me that long so I usually did it the night before. The grades made me confident and people called me smart and a genius which just felt unearned. I did jackshit.Now I am here and I struggle so bad. I can’t focus, get distracted, get scared and I‘d rather do anything else than studying because i’s painful. I really want this education but I have no idea how to get there. If i drop out, i’d admit defeat and i will not do that but pulling through feels impossible.Thank you for listening to my rant.",

I've used Anki, Quizlet, and a few others, and while they're great tools, I've always felt there was a need for a modern, powerfulprogramthat's truly built for the community—and completely free.So, I've decided to build it.My goal is to create a top-tier flashcardprogramthat combines the best features you love with a clean, intuitive design, all without any hidden costs or paywalls.Before I get too deep into development, I want to hear from you, the power users. What would make the perfect flashcardprogramfor you?What are your non-negotiable, must-have features?(e.g., spaced repetition, rich text/image/audio support, cross-device syncing)What are your biggest frustrations with the programs you currently use?(Is it the user interface? The learning curve? The subscription fees?)What's a \"dream\" feature you've always wished existed?(e.g., collaborative decks, better progress analytics, a super simple way to import notes)My aim is to create something that genuinely helps everyone learn more effectively, regardless of their budget. Your feedback will directly shape what gets built.Thanks in advance for your ideas—I'll be reading every comment!",

      "content_preview": "So i work 4-5 times a week, where i have from 9-12:30 to study before i start work from 13-21. i wake up at 6 to go to the gym before studying (i need to take the train to the nearest gym, so im not there until 6:30) and then i workout and shower etc before i go straight to the library. So i study 3,5 hours maths in the morning. I learn extremly slow, and not everything goes into my brain straight away.And then i have deadtime at work from 17-20, where i can study science. And do some recall. I try to do this every day, but i dont feel like im learning TOO much. Well, i learn, but it doesnt sit in my brain. In my sparetime, when im done with library, i dont think too much on what i have learnt.I dont want to waste my time either, as im working so hard on achieving my goals, but i want to know if im doing this in a right way? Im on chapter 2 on both books, and i need to solve more maths so it sits in my head, but i need advice on when i should do math solving, and how often? I have never been good at school, and many times t the library i just wanted to give up because i use so much time to learn, and i learn little (idk if its true). Im also 28, so i dont want to waste any more time. Or have more doubts. Is it true if you doubt yourself, you do worse? If i have more confidence, will i achieve more?",

      "content_preview": "I’ve always found it tough to review my notes effectively. Some subjects leave me with pages of scattered information, and I end up forgetting most of what I write down. Recently, I started experimenting with a simple method to summarize and organize my notes, and it’s actually made a huge difference.Here’s what I do:Break notes into chunks:I separate topics into small, digestible sections rather than keeping one massive document.Highlight key ideas:After each chunk, I summarize the main points in my own words.Test recall immediately:Before moving on, I try to write down what I remember from memory.Quick reviews:I revisit the summarized chunks the next day and again a week later to reinforce memory.This made me realize that organizing notes is just as important as reviewing them.To make this easier, I built a small AI web tool that helps you quickly summarize your notes, and generate flash cards or practice tests:Learnify. It’s helped me keep my notes neat and made reviewing way less stressful. I want to make sure its the best possible version of itself that it can be, so I haven't launched it yet, but if it's something that you are interested in, feel free to sign up to hear as soon as it's finished! :D",

      "content_preview": "Okay, so real talk — I was spiraling. I had this annoying Philosophy essay due in 48 hours, the topic was \"Free Will vs Determinism in 21st Century Ethics\" (like??? what even is that), and I’d already procrastinated so hard I could’ve won a medal. At that point, I was Googling random examples and crying into my cold coffee. Reddit being my usual last-resort oracle, I found someone mentionPapersRooas thebest essay helpthey’ve used.Link hereAt first, I figured it was just another sketchy essay writing service with recycled content and broken English. But bro… I wasshook. I took the leap, made an account, dropped my topic, andboom— someone from their team hit me up almost immediately. We chatted about the structure, deadline, formatting, and citations (they were super chill and not robotic at all). I told them I needed 1,500 words, Chicago style, no fluff, and 5 legit sources. They saidno problemand gave me a quote that wasn’t insane — way better than the $200 scams I’d seen before.The writer they matched me with knew their stuff. They even asked if I wanted a draft before the final version. I got the papera full day early, it was clean af — citations, original research, and not a single hint of AI or plagiarism. Ran it through Turnitin just to be sure — 100% clean. I'm not even exaggerating when I say I thought they mixed up my order with some professor’s sample essay.What Ireallyliked? They weren’t pushy, prices were actually fair, and they talked to me like a real person. None of that cold bot-like stuff. Honestly felt like I got professional-level ghostwriting without selling my soul.So yeah, if you're out herebarely hanging ontrying to juggle classes, work, life, and 15 readings a week,don’t roll the dice on shady services. Use somethingreliablelikepapersroo.com. It’s thebest writing serviceI’ve come across, and trust me — I’ve been burned before (RIP to my $70 and that disaster of a “business case study”).Moral of the story? If you’re gonna pay for an essay writing service, go with one that actually knows what the hell they’re doing. You’ll save time, stress, and your dignity 😅Also, fun fact: My prof wrote “thought-provoking argumentation” in the feedback. I legit laughed because the only thing I wrote was my name.Stay smart, stay lazy.",

I have tonight and tomorrow to read The Hobbit, and How to Read Literature Like a Professor. My wpm is around 300-450 depending how immersed I am in the book. My English homework requires me to write notes that will aid me in our essay coming up soon (on Friday!) Is it better to read one chapter, and then write/analyze it, or is it quicker to read in chunks of 3-5 chapters and then summarize/analyze them separately after? Or is it more efficient to read the entire book and then go in and write about it? I'm not particularly too worried about reading and how much time it'll take itself, but I am worried about how much extra time writing about it will cause me to add. I read Tale of Two Cities within three days, ending up with around 33 pages of summary and analysis... (Although How to Read and The Hobbit are significantly less difficult than ToTC...) I'm not worried about comprehension, as I have this thing where I physically CANNOT miss a detail... (I hate to do so) I know I want to write chapter by chapter, consisting of a general summarization of the chapter and a bit of analysis contributing to my theme (Heroism!)Any advice on how I should approach getting all of my summer homework done in time for my essay? Thanks!",

I do not care about my country's popular poems, stories, authors and shit and I will NOT remember them no matter how much I want to pass. I cannot reach the minimum words needed for literature essays. I can write max around 5 sentences. My mom screams at me when I can't do it and calls me an idiot for being unable to do it at 16. That just makes me cry and want to kms even more. This is also almost useless to the world (for example it doesn't reduce pollution, doesn't save innocent people or animals, doesn't help invent very useful objects like phones etc) so being forced to do it to pass makes no sense to me. My family says I will have a very poor paying job if I don't study it or pass, I won't be respected and I'll be an idiot. But that won't h@ppen because I would rather kms LITERALLY than to be forced to study in this unfair world full of shitty people, including my dad who skinny shames me while being extremely obese, knowing that some people get successful through things like OF, rich families, sugar daddies/mommies, lottery winnings etc. and that some bullies, murderers, rapists, assaulters and pedophiles are doing well in life with good money. I'm convinced this world doesn't deserve me and if I won't be able to study or understand, I'll kms because I'll be shamed and probably get kicked out I do not want to study or learn at a lot of subjects and if that won't h@ppen I'll kms Is there a way for me to actually study without thinking about how useless it is and how much I hate it and also get a job when I'll be able to work, especially when society makes it look very important?",

      "content_preview": "Hi!I just started university and I am actually not overwhelmed and not behind on work. I've been on track, but since it's only been two weeks I realize that I can take this time to optimize my learning strategies for the latter half of the semester and future classes. So I'm asking for advice, based on observing my learning behaviors.Notes:Ever since 8th grade I've been trying to get better at note taking. The repetition of writing something down, pencil to paper definitely helps me +0.5 in memorization, but 0.5 isn't super effective. Mymain issue with my notes is that I never looked at them ever again (for studying). I mostly took notes in HS if they were required and during that time I tried to improve my handwriting, color coding, annotating, reading the textbook and taking notes, or not wasting my time transcribing everything by instead only taking notes on things that confused me (to get clarification on) or drawing visual or concept maps. Nothing really stuck, it didn't make me want to look at my notes again and in senior year I had a leisurely schedule so I drew during class and I was able to understand better. I think I was able to focus better. This is also a weird note, but I have a weird thing with notes where I hate lined paper and I hate taking notes vertically I just feel so trapped and I hate the feeling of typing notes because I am an organization freak, but the lined paper thing is just a weird gut vibe. It's also just so hard to focus on taking notes and listening to a lecture like my brain can't comprehend and it's just so messy.I bought a tablet for university to reinforce the notion that I should start note taking and although I've gotten over the learning curve of the application, etc. I barely look at my notes. I've been asking for advice from other students and what I've been trying to do is to take notes on the slides/only writing questions I have and ask the professor after class. It's been working out, but it could be better you know.Studying:I've been a straight A student and how I studied was typically just going over the classes' slideshows, asking the teacher, participating actively, and taking practice tests/doing practice problems. I think actively participating and doing practice tests helped me the most. I like doing tests and asking for help from a teacher in person more than self-studying from a textbook. Since starting university I've joined study groups and I participate by going to office hours and explaining concepts to my friends for clarification. I'm mostly including this information for context (since notes don't help me this is what does).Question:So I guess my question is, is there a better method for me to take notes (I know there's a lot of methods out there and that's why I included my experiences trying to improve note taking), do you think I should even take notes if they aren't benefiting me substantially? I feel like I'm trying to force something when I take notes in class and I have enough homework already and I don't have the time always to take notes in advance before the lectures to focus on the lecture (I do go over the slides beforehand though).",

      "content_preview": "Hello y'all. As you can see from the title, I lack the motivation to study. I find it hard to see the point in it, which subsequently makes it difficult for me to even want to study. In fact, I'd much rather focus on honing my studying skills, and I gave up on maintaining As long ago.See, there's a number of causes for my apathy and disgust for studying. One, it all feels forced now, especially after figuring out the specifics of my scholarship's contract. I'm legally bound to enroll in a STEM course, and I am unable to leave without paying a massive fine for the breach of contract. I can't even take a gap year without a medical reason. This part makes me feel trapped.Second, the workload and the sudden increase of groupworks. I have to maintain connection with multiple people at all times to maintain my grades. This would be fine if projects were few and far between, but we have at least one or two group projects active at any time. This includes making research papers, getting materials, and the like. I'd rather only have to worry about myself and my own output, but I cannot. This leads to derailing my own plans to accomodate the others, which causes me an irrational amount of stress.Third, lesson pacing. Just. Everything coming so fast that we never have a peaceful day. Even school events are mandatory, and interrupt academics. This led to some unholy amounts of cramming, and this is with the \"easier\" curriculum from after the pandemic. Luckily, they stopped the sheer number of events, but the lessons and subjects always pile upon us. Makes it hard for me to even understand the subjects I struggle in, before the next exam rolls around. Very demotivating, especially when the teachers say the material is easy.Fourth reason is the lack of time. Like I said earlier, I like writing. I would rather devote my free time to it, my friends, and maintaining my health. Buuuuut no, I don't get to do that because we always have something to do or study for. It sucks.Lastly, I just don't see meaning in it. I know it's for job opportunities. I know having a degree is the only way to get the job in my country. But, I came here hoping to spend my days learning cool science things. I didn't want to participate in what feels like a rat race of grades, where I pay the price of my health, passion, and time just to get something people deem acceptable.I mean, I pass, but this school turned out very competitive. They want us to excel, to develop the skills as scholars to fix the country's problems with our scientific work (which I have significant dislike towards, but not the point here). Everything in it has burnt me out and turned my former passion in academia into a pile of bitter ash.Anywho, tl;dr. How do I find meaning and a will, a motivation to study? When the workload is absurd, when I have to derail my own desires and health if I want to excel like the rest, when I'm already very, very tired of what I saw in this school?Also, really sorry for the big rant above. Had to get those frustrations out, as they've been festering in my mind for ages. There's more, but that already felt like a lot to say. I want someone to give an alternate perspective to such. I can make it more concise if asked to.Edit: Oh yeahhh, I forgot that we also had to file paperwork for certain required projects, which just makes those incredibly annoying and tedious to deal with. How do I overcome that sorta distaste?",
