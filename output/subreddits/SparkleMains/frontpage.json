      "content_preview": "Sparkle is leaked to be Fire Elation and looks like her myriad celesta look. We don't know too much more about her personally. We have a few leaks that started some speculation in other subs I thought I‚Äôd bring here. Yae Sakura was recently leaked to be the 4.2 Anniversary character whose team will likely be the best of 4.x. We have slightly older leaks telling us Yae is the main push character of 4.x and that she is Ice Elation. We also have leaks about her Sparkle SP and EMC all being in testing this has led to some people in the leak subreddit to speculate that these characters are all actually on the same team. I am sceptical about this being true. If true who would be the DPS EMC is likely a support both HMC and RMC were, Sparkle has a Harmony form but im doubtful theyd make Yae a support, debuffer, or sustain. Sparkle is likely to be a DPS but it's not impossible to have her fill another role or for Elation to shake up how team building works. We have another leak stating that Hoyo is testing a in battle path switching mechanic, This could just be for the Trailblazer, an event unrelated to Elation, or a special feature of one of or all of the elation characters. Personally I wouldn't mind for the Yae Sparkle team to be true. I love Sparkle and really like Yae‚Äôs design (I don't know much about Yae lore) Fire and Ice is a cool element pairing as well. The next option is the Elation path being break focused. I know that will be controversial with quite a few players but there's some evidence however not much either. When the Elation test event was first leaked the damage type dealt was Break however the leakers themselves said they were unsure if that was the actual damage type or just a place holder. Early in 3.0 or 3.1 we got a leak that stated if there was a patch 3.8 then we would have a playable Constance. We recently got a leak stating that both 3.7 and 3.8 will be 1 new 5 star each 3.7 is Cyrene 3.8 is still presumably Constance as we know 3.8 is Penaconey and we have no other leak as to who it could be. In the star rail station comments alongside a few hsr leak comments people presumed Constance would be break and could be for the new Elation path because of the Elation test event leak. I myself couldn't find the leak in the Hsr leak sub but Constance is a rough name to search and Reddit has a terrible search feature. I popped over to r/ConstanceMains to see if they had the leak which I found. It's a translation of a screenshot by Luna claiming Constance would be a break support for FireFly via tibia. The people of this sub believe it to be fake and so do I. (we personally agree DOT sustain is how she should be.) It could be a Sunday situation where the support of the next path/archetype gets released the last patch of the previous version but it's unlikely. The next bit of speculation is that Elation will work similar to how it does in DU. being follow up and after taste based. This is possible because the archetype is wide and does not restrict 4.x and beyond Character kits. You could argue the Remembrance was changed from what it was to what it is now, however you could also argue Elation gives a lot more design freedom then the old Remembrance path did. I am personally fine with this as well. I quite like the follow up archetype and wouldn't mind seeing more of it. The last bit of speculation comes down to things we haven't seen before like bringing in Items or having a UD like scepter power. There's not much to tell as there's not much known. What do you think Sparkle and Yae will do? Do you think they'll be on a team together? Would you want them to? Would you be fine with break if instead of super break it was something else that used break as a trigger?",

      "content_preview": "With all the leaks we have currently at our disposal I figure it might be fun to do some speculation. I won't be going over absolutely everything here though. That would be quite long And I already have a few posts detailing quite a bit of that info. What I'll be talking about is the newer information we have and the implications it could have for the Elation path and maybe some other non Elation related characters like Constance and Cerydra. Patches 3.7 and 3.8 will only have 1 new 5 star each, this being Cyrene and Constance. Cyrene might not be for the Elation path but she could be a good partner; her current speculated kit is a cross between RMC and Tribbie with some added energy buffing. She could be very good with Elation if she is similar to what she's speculated to be. 3.8 is Constance, she's a nihility break support. Anon leaks stated that she was specifically not a DOT unit so they must be pretty sure she's a super break support even saying she's a dedicated superbreak support. The elation test event was leaked to be break damage type. The 3.8 Character is break. I wonder if it is just meant to be a boon and replacement for the now obtainable outside of Gacha Ruan Mei. Or if one or more Elation characters is/are going to be break oriented. Sparkle SP is Fire Yae Sakura is ice. We don't have an Ice break Character, we do have a well known fire one. I really hope they don't make Elation a break path but maybe have break be a way to trigger a random effect if they do intend it to be break. Someone brought up how making Constance a break support was a missed opportunity as they could have made Constance a Elation support like they made Sunday a Remembrance support but this could actually be the case. I'm hoping this isn't the case as It's not what I personally want, but the Elation test event when first leaked was break damage however the leaker didn't know if that was a place holder or not. One or more Elation characters could break. Aglaea is really the only Remembrance character who's BIS is Sunday so it would be the same if even one was break. They can't do Sparkle like this again /s. But I'm sure Sparkle will be good, break doesn't necessarily have to be super break it could just be one of many ways for an Elation Character to trigger their Elation effect like how they do in the gameplay event. In the current event we do have some break stuff but we also have other things Sparkle's event is all about SP usage Cerydra is about skill usage. I think Aventurine is also skill usage. Their laughter boxes all do different things as well. It's possible each Elation Character will not only be able to fill up their own boxes but others as well, kinda like Feixaio and Acheron's ult. They might have one or multiple ways to do this for example Sparkle could be skill usage. I don't think Yae will be break¬† her HI3 ults are cool so I'll just say maybe she's ult usage, And someone could be break. Once the conditions are met the box does its thing. I hope Sparkle and Yae Sakura are on the same team. Maybe Sparkle, Yae whoever the break Character is and Constance could be a good sustain less team. I wonder if Constance and Cerydra can be non Elation, Elation drivers. Super break doesn't have to be where Constance utility ends. She could cause debuffs and buff break efficiency or be an even more break tuned Ruan Mei and be slightly better for DOT as well? The break part of her could be for Elation as a way to meet one of the conditions to charge the laughter box or whatever system they go with while still being good for super break teams as we don't really have any other break type teams except superbreak which could also be why She was described as a dedicated super break support we don't really have any other break archetype currently . In the event we see skill usage is a possible way to charge that laughter box Cerdyra might be good for charging the laughter box fast if you‚Äôre not running another Elation character or be able to charge just as fast as having a second Elation character while buffing the other Elation character making her a valuable support for skill oriented Elation characters. I personally don‚Äôt know too much about Cerdyra as I wasn't interested in the characters she supports and she didn't seem to do well outside of those teams so there might be more pros and cons for Cerdyra in a Elation team. Elation might work like the scepters or the items from the galactic baseballer events. There are conditions that need to be met before the laughter box does its thing just like the scepters. The scepters and the items/weapons from the galactic baseballer event are pretty similar and are undeniably powerful even if the scepters can be annoying to activate. It's possible that not only will the Elation characters be able to fuel each other but maybe they laughter boxes could be combined (the abilities combining are pretty unlikely but one or two could happen) Different Elation characters having different conditions to activate their laughter box lines up with how the scepters work. Elation might also be a support follow up, Summon, or sub DPS¬† role. Both the DU and SU simulated universes have Elation be a support follow up role giving buffs more damage all kinds of things. The SU and DU aren't important however as Remembrance changed how it worked in DU but not SU. You could argue the old remembrance branch was too narrow to make an entire path and characters revolve around. The Elation path we currently have doesn't have the same problem and could easily support an archetype. The event does augment some characters skills, maybe that could be a potential feature of the path.¬† While giving buffs possibly launching follow up attacks the laughter box charges and activates a scepter like ability, This seems to be the least likely however. Any of these could be pretty fun. We might get a mix of the present and unpresent theories. All I want is Sparkle to be strong.",
