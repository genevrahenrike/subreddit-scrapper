At first I was leaning towards the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 6 with an i7-13700H (~BRL 5,547), but the price is close to the Yoga Slim 7i (~BRL 5,710) which has the new Intel Core Ultra 5 125H and an OLED display. There’s also the cheaper option of the ThinkBook 14 with an i5-13420H (~BRL 4,000). What worries me is Linux compatibility with the new “Core Ultra” chips (Meteor Lake). I’m not sure how mature support is for the Ultra 5 125H. I’d likely run Ubuntu 24.04, Zorin OS or Fedora (or almost any other distro with gnome), so recent kernels aren’t a problem. Does anyone here have experience running Linux on the Yoga Slim 7i with this processor? Any issues with GPU (Intel Arc iGPU), Wi-Fi, battery management, or just general stability? Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "I recently bought the Asus Expertbook P5 (P5405) which I got for $870 usd on sale for sole linux use and the experience has been fantastic. It's becoming increasingly difficult to find a device with high refresh rate IPS display with no PWM and even more so one that supports linux at a decent price. There's been a few anecdotes about some breakages on this hardware but all of it has been fixed as far as I can tell. Overall an excellent device if you can get it on sale. Notebookcheck also has a great in-depth review of this exact laptop, and after using for about 2 months I agree with pretty much everything in their review. Everything works out of the box on the latest Fedora 42 update including wifi and bluetooth, all audio fixes has been upstreamed with the lastest kernel and linux firmware. The laptop was a bit unstable and crashes every few days when it first came, but the latest UEFI firmware update appears to have fixed it (been testing for about 2 weeks). Everything has been fairly stable on Fedora 42 + Gnome and I'm currently sitting on about 2 weeks of uptime with no crashes. Some notable points The display factory calibration is a bit too cold, but I've gotten used to it over time. Applying ICC profile in gnome or kde causes smearing and ghosting issues. Not sure if this is hardware or software. Other than that, the display is fantastic, but response time is quite slow so there might be some ghosting. Battery charge can be limited by writing to /sys/class/power_supply/BAT?/charge_control_end_threshold but needs to be done every reboot The UEFI firmware does not come with Microsoft UEFI CA 2011 and Microsoft UEFI CA 2023 by default (wtf?) so secureboot does not work out of the box with Fedora. You can download them from microsoft and install these CA cert files manually through UEFI firmware settings if you need secureboot. ASUS provides UEFI firmware update files that can be flashed through the BIOS directly so no need to boot into Windows to update UEFI. ASUS's BIOS is excellent compared to my old lenovo devices. Battery life is fantastic on lunar lake especially with intel EAS that was merged in the 6.16 kernel. I manage about 8~10 hours with normal work+web browsing+youtube on wifi and bluetooth at 50% brightness. Great performance even on linux. You probably won't be gaming on it but I can get around 30~40 fps on Nightreign (Elden ring) which is surprisingly playable. Compiling the kernel is around the same speed as my older Ryzen 6900hx laptop which is acceptable for my development work, but it won't be anything crazy like the newer m4 apple chips. The trackpad compared to macbooks is pretty much a joke, but it's workable on linux and tracks accurately. The problem is the mechanical clicking feels quite low quality. Fingerprint sensor works out of the box in gnome with fprintd suspend/wake works perfectly ootb Specs Intel Core Ultra 5 228V 32gb memory 1tb nvme IPS display 2560x1600 144hz Overall really happy with this purchase. It's probably not worth it at MSRP but if you can get it on sale it's wonderful. Where I live it's almost 1/3 the price of the thinkpad x1 carbon gen 13 aura and very comparable in specs. Before this, the only laptops I could carry around and work on the go with acceptable performance and battery life were the apple sillicon devices but lunar lake really is a game changer.",

      "content_preview": "I posted around here a while back asking for other users' input on the 2012-2015 generation of MacBook Air, and based on the feedback, I snagged a 2015 13\" with 8GB of RAM for $75. I dropped another $100 on a higher-capacity replacement battery from OWC since the original battery was toast, and then got an SSD adapter and 4TB Crucial NVME (even though the stock 256GB drive was fine, I want the flexibility to jump machines if needed). Fresh install of Fedora 42 KDE, and this thing is freaking sick. For anyone looking for an inexpensive machien for basic web browsing and document editing, it does the job in spades, and I'm getting 4-6 hours of battery. 99% of it works perfectly out of the box. Minor tweaks needed: had to put the drive in another machine with working internet access in order to install the broadcom-wl package from rpmfusion. That activated the MBA's Broadcom wifi chip. Also installed the h264ify extension in Brave to get CPU usage down when watching YouTube. When I calibrated the new battery, I let it play YouTube nonstop and it died after about 4:30. As of right now, I last charged it three days ago, used it for 1-2 hours each day since, and am still sitting at 45% battery. Super happy with this and would highly recommend for anyone who wants a basic, snappy, secure computer for cheap. I'm almost sad that someday I'll have to upgrade to a modern machine to use my game library. EDIT: Given that some people can't look beyond numbers on paper when choosing a computer, allow me to add that this little MacBook Air handles some websites I use for work far better and smoother than the much newer MacBook Pro I used for the past two years. The newer machine with more cores and more RAM would bog down constantly, and this MacBook Air takes it like a champ. https://preview.redd.it/2015-macbook-air-13-is-a-fantastic-budget-linux-device-v0-fmmxnkt8yemf1.jpg",

Then I get massive, intermittent lag spikes: Without NVMe: Consistent 3-4ms ping to router With NVMe connected: Random spikes from 3ms to 100-700ms Example ping pattern with NVMe: 64 bytes: time=3.76 ms\n64 bytes: time=3.84 ms\n64 bytes: time=274 ms   <-- spike\n64 bytes: time=11.8 ms\n64 bytes: time=439 ms   <-- spike\n64 bytes: time=3.75 ms\n64 bytes: time=687 ms   <-- spike What I've tested: ✅ Ethernet works perfectly (0.5ms consistent) even with NVMe ✅ WiFi returns to normal immediately when NVMe disconnected ✅ Different SD card from working Pi - same issue ✅ Fresh Raspberry Pi OS install - same issue ✅ Disabled WiFi power management ✅ Set PCIe to Gen 2 ( dtparam=pciex1_gen=2 ) ✅ Set CPU governor to performance mode ✅ Stopped all Docker containers and services ✅ No undervoltage warnings ( vcgencmd get_throttled shows 0x0) ✅ WiFi signal excellent throughout (70/70 quality, -25 dBm) Additional observations: Another Pi 5 in same location with SD card only: perfect WiFi Lag spikes happen even at boot with minimal services No correlation with CPU load or disk activity Pattern suggests EMI/interference rather than software issue Has anyone experienced similar WiFi degradation with NVMe on Pi 5? Any suggestions for EMI shielding or other fixes? Considering just using USB WiFi adapter at this point, but curious if this is a known issue with certain NVMe HATs or drives.",

      "content_preview": "I recently (3 weeks back) purchased an NVMe M.2 SSD and a corresponding enclosure for it, and installed Debian on it. It was plugged into the USB-C Thunderbolt 4 port of my laptop and I was booting from it. Everything was smooth, no sluggishness, no issues whatsoever while the Debian system was running. Suddenly the disk seems to have failed. My concern is whether this is just a rare case of a defective piece or is there anything more to the story? The full details are below ... The enclosure is USB 3.2 and uses the RTL9210 chipset. Prior to this disk failure, there were a couple of incidents that were fishy. Sometimes, while booting, the disk would disappear from the UEFI boot menu (i.e. it was plugged in but it was not listed there). 1-3 retries would fix the issue. There was an incident where the system failed to boot beyond the Debian GRUB screen. The error messages indicated that the initramfs was corrupted. I re-installed Debian on the disk and everything was fine thereafter. The situation of the current disk failure (as I'm seeing by booting up a live ISO and plugging in the disk) is that it is failing to mount, failing to open directories. It's sort of random : sometimes a certain directory fails to open, sometimes it works. The funny thing is that smartctl reports its health assessment as PASSED . Trying any self-tests is giving an error which I'm interpreting as self-tests not being supported by this disk. I ran fsck on the disk and it complained a lot about inodes, after fixing all those errors it reported the disk as clean, and running it a while later reports a set of different errors. dmesg has a lot of critical target errors, buffer I/O errors, messages about uas_eh_abort_handler , Device offlined - not ready after error recovery , Sense Key errors (illegal request, invalid command operation code), etc. Can anyone make more sense of this or have I just bought a bad SSD?",

Many times I've been considering going back to Asahi, which is an amazing project, but it's not in a state that allows me to be fully productive.

Price tag doesn't matter. What I definitely want is: 10+ hours on battery while web browsing with Firefox (not videos) and running simple programs in terminal as little heat on the bottom as possible (also I hate air vents on the bottom of the case) it doesn't get all heated up and start spinning fans like a jet when I simply play a youtube video firmware support didn't end on the first day after laptop released on the market (LVFS updates if possible, but not necessary) (Unfortunately Linux has nothing to do with this, it's just the majority of manufacturers don't give a shit about released hardware) good build quality (e.g. no cheap plastics, no screen wobble) enough performance to be able to run multiple podman containers (such as redis, postgres, kafka, Rust programs, Python apps etc.) or sometimes a VM (or even two VMs at the same time). working fingerprint reader 32GB RAM minimum no additional GPU besides integrated (I'm not going to run games on this machine) (although it would be awesome to be able to run LLMs such as gpt-oss-20b on-device, but it's not something that I need right now and I could be happy without it) Thank you for any recommendations.",

Or is this assumption not feasible at all, and they ship different devices to different countries ? (Edit: I am located in Europe)",

It was mint condition, with a replacement panel and cost me just £90 on eBay in an auction. It's a good machine and fine for my current use case but I am conscious it is getting long in the tooth so thinking about an upgrade. My wife similarly has a x250 which is starting to feel a bit flakey. In both cases, I had thought simply get a more up to date (but still old) replacements - e.g. T480 and x280 but don't know if that would be the right thing. They are pretty old themselves by now. Equally, I am not sure about going beyond the T and X series ThinkPads as I had heard they went downhill after that (as well as being pricier). Any thoughts? Do you have alternatives to a ThinkPad that will be as good?",

I knew SSDs could lose data when without power for a longer period of time, but I was surprised that it lost SMART data too, apparently with the ability to log self-test results. The drive seems to work alright though. Is it possible to restore SMART in such situation? (I've also had an incident with the system freezing during another SSD's self-test, for unrelated reasons, and now that error breaks GSmartControl's parsing of SMART output.)

I haven't been able to locate info about, for example, the maximum nits of the display. The reviews (see above and https://www.techradar.com/pro/chuwi-hi10-max-2-in-1-tablet-review ) seem to indicate that one should not expect more than about 4 or 5 hours of battery life. Does this also hold when using Linux? (For completeness, I've considered other options too. Most attractive were the StarLite 12.5 or the Juno Tab 3, but their price is outside my budget range ---and the Juno Tab 3 seems not to be available, and will be replaced by the 4.)",

In the linux hardware db it seems the fingerprint for this device is not working, but I could configure it without any issue and it is super fast to unlock the laptop. I have not tested how long the battery can go, but it seems quite decent compared to my previous experiences (e.g. compared to a 12y-old Inspiron). I'd say it should last for at least 4h with light office usage. Suspend seems to work good too: a few times I was stuck with a black screen after suspend and I had to reboot, but it seems more like a bug than an hardware compatibility problem. I haven't tried hybernation. A lot of audio devices are shown in the settings and you have to pick-up the right one before you can hear any sound at all: when you find it, you're ok with the audio and mic. Also the webcam works fine. The copilot button does nothing to me: I don't know if it is not detected or simply not assigned to some action. The touchpad is supposed to support three and four-fingers actions (it does on windows), but I have yet managed to have them on Linux.",

My current setup is an HP Zbook studio G5 mobile workstation from 2019 but it's slowly falling apart, I don't really use the nvidia quadro in it anymore(for engineering studies) since 2021, battery life has decreased a lot, very heavy, cpu is lagging behind etc Could anyone maybe share their experience using linux with these? Specifically, the drivers/devices and the battery life. Comments on the build quality are also appreciated but are less important. As a last point, I have seen AMD AI 9 365  versions of the yoga pro 7 and but it's around 200-250 euros more expensive and a bit older 8840HS versions of the zenbook. I would still consider them if linux really works much much better or the battery life is better. Please refrain from \"refurbished thinkpads\" I want as new as possible personally.

I will start my first year soon and I want to get myself a laptop and put linux on it ( first time user ). Been a windows user for almost a decade and beside my computer I want linux on my work laptop. My budget is around 2000-2500$ max 3000 let's say. That'll be overkill but I want something that will last me. Aside of programming and everything I might need at school I would like it to run some lite gaming from time to time (when I am away from home). I've looked into thinkpads but tbh I don't really like the keyboard even thought I should not complain about designs",

I've been wanting to learn Linux for a while now as I've heard you learn a lot from it. I'm currently daily driving a XPS 15 with windows 11 and i don't think I'm comfortable yet just to switch on that laptop or even running a VM. Maybe in the future when i do get comfortable using Linux, I'll switch completely, and maybe turn the 2nd hand laptop to a small home server. Essentially, I'm looking for a cheap 2nd-hand laptop to install Linux on and to just mess around with. Any advice on what i should be looking for regarding hardware? (RAM, storage, CPU, GPU, etc?). I'm looking at Thinkpads primarily. Are there any hardware that’s more compatible to certain distros? Or are they practically the same? Should I consider anything else?",

      "content_preview": "Hey folks, I wanted to share something I found while digging through GitHub that could be a big deal for anyone running Linux on an OLED laptop — but it needs help to become reality. The project is called GNOME OLED Shield , and it’s a GNOME Shell extension designed to extend OLED panel lifespan by fighting burn-in. It does things like: Pixel shifting : tiny, barely noticeable movements of the screen image to prevent static burn-in Pixel refresh : running full-screen refresh patterns to even out pixel wear Selective dimming : lowering brightness of static UI elements like panels and menus If it worked properly, it could be one of the best tools out there for protecting OLED displays on Linux laptops. The catch: Right now, it’s broken — syntax errors (and more) stop it from working correctly. I’ve tried fixing some of those and fixed some smaller bugs myself (wrong imports, etc.), but there are still issues beyond my current programming skills. Without a few capable GNOME/JavaScript devs stepping in, it won’t get off the ground. Why you should care: OLED laptop displays look amazing, but they’re prone to permanent burn-in over time — especially with desktop environments that keep static elements on-screen. Windows and macOS users already have decent burn-in mitigation tools; we need something solid for Linux too. If we can get this working, it could be a must-have for every Linux user with an OLED machine. How to help: Check out the repo and try running it on your machine Help fix syntax/build errors or test changes Share ideas for better OLED protection methods on Linux 🔗 GitHub: kimasplund/gnome-oled-shield (I am not Kim Asplund) TL;DR: Promising GNOME extension to protect OLED laptop displays from burn-in. Currently broken, needs developer help. Could become the go-to OLED saver for Linux.",

The idea is to be able to access them both locally (when I’m at home) and remotely (like from my college network). I'm trying to pick a solid Linux distro or NAS OS for it. Something lightweight and reliable would be awesome. I’ve been looking at things like OpenMediaVault, TrueNAS SCALE, and even thought about slapping together a minimal Debian setup with something like Nextcloud or Samba. Would love to hear what others are using in a similar setup—or anything I should avoid? Appreciate the help!",
