      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and would really appreciate some advice. I have just one month to prepare for my GRE and I’m stuck choosing between Gregmat+ and PrepSwift. From what I’ve researched: Gregmat+ seems very comprehensive, affordable, and strategy-focused, but it also looks like a lot of content that might be overwhelming in a short time. PrepSwift looks more concise, with bite-sized lessons that seem easier to digest, but I’m not sure if it’s enough for full preparation. Since my timeline is only one month, I want something that’s efficient, realistic, and effective under time pressure. For those of you who’ve tried either (or both): Which platform gave you the most value in a short prep period? Did you feel Gregmat was too much for just one month? Is PrepSwift comprehensive enough to rely on for strategies and practice? Would a hybrid approach (Gregmat’s one-month plan + some PrepSwift lessons) be better? Any honest reviews or personal experiences would help me decide. Thanks in advance!",

We are adding the tags according to the classification above. You simply need to do the following. Go under the TC https://gre.myprepclub.com/forum/text-completion-16/ or SE https://gre.myprepclub.com/forum/sentence-equivalence-12/ subforums; On top, you have the filter Pick up the difficulty level you want : medium questions for example the tags: one or two or three blanks for the questions and the questions you want to practice also: contrast rather than definitional sentences the source you want: Manhattan GRE (MGRE) or kaplan or else Simple Have a great practice. https://preview.redd.it/gre-premium-verbal-question-banks-topic-wise-over-500-v0-5g6iwvwpvkmf1.png After the GRE PREMIUM Quant Question Banks - Topic-Wise 2700 Questions which has had a great success with over 120k unique views by the students in a few months, now we have the exact conterpart for the verbal part of the GRE test. We spent over a year studying every single official question available to us among OGs, PowerPrep free software, and other official resources to identify the essential patterns. Any psychometric test, such as the GRe or the gMAT, has patterns because they repeat themselves. we identified these patterns in GRE Text Completion & Sentence Equivalence The Definitive Guide #0 - GRE - Verbal Section: Question type breakdown #1 - Introduction #2 - Definitional Sentences #3 - Punctuaction:Colon,Semicolon, and Dash #4 - Contrast and shift #5 - Parallel/Balance Structure #6 - Conditional Sentence #7 - Subordinating conjunctions According to the patterns above, we have collected the best questions on the forum in each single category, both TC and SE. How to use the question bank It is fairly simple, and conversely, by doing so, you will improve in each area tested by the GRE. Start with the first category, which is the definitional sentences (just for example) Study what that means and all the implications. We covered every siongle aspect to tackle these kind of questions Use the questions collected to practice the specific area until you are confident that every single question will not create you difficulty and you master them I suggest you to open 10 or 15 questions at time simply. Just open the questions in single tabs in your browser and start the timer. Always practice under time conditions SOON we will have the tags to search the questions based on the categories above, and have a reservoir of practice questions of OVER 7,000 questions (i) blank # -

      "content_preview": "I took my GRE about a week ago, and I got the score I wanted on the first attempt! Just some general tips, based on how I prepared: Verbal: For verbal, I mainly used u/gregmat . I spent four weeks going through the Vocab Mountain every day, and brushing up on Latin/Greek roots so I could extrapolate definitions if necessary. For the question strategies themselves, I found Gregmat strategies very helpful because I have a tendency to over-interpret questions/passages, and he really emphasized staying grounded in the material that is concretely visible in each passage. I went along with all of the Verbal videos for the two-month plan at 2X speed, then I did all of the ETS practice questions with the same strategies, and went up 5 points from my diagnostic. Quant: I was already pretty strong at quant, but I used Gregmat for practice on some of the more difficult combinatorics questions. Gregmat did also help with some of the arithmetic tricks that I hadn't seen before (finding the number of factors, finding the number of primes, etc.) I thought the full length practice tests on Gregmat were pretty useful in practicing time pressure, because the ETS tests seemed a bit easier/more doable within 21/26 minute time constraints. AWA: This was probably the part that I prepared the most for. My writing style is VERY different from the \"preferred\" style for the GRE essays. I prefer not having explicit transition-y/topic sentences, and progressing naturally from one idea to the next. I also tend to be very verbose/write very long sentences, which also was working against me. I watched a couple of the Gregmat essay sessions, but I found the graded essay practice a bit more useful. I chose essay topics from the GRE question bank, then plugged them into the \"custom prompt\" feature. I wrote about 20 essays before my final test day, and that seemed to help me practice a few structure strategies. On the day of, I was finding myself a bit stuck arguing \"for\" the prompt, but the counter-example came very naturally to me, so I wrote those two paragraps first, like Gregmat suggested, then the introduction and conclusion. With the 8 minutes I had remaining, I wrote the first \"for\" paragraph, and had about a minute left to glance over everything. I think I ended up writing >800 words, which I also think worked in my favor. Obligatory disclaimer that this is just what worked for me, but I am happy to answer more questions/provide more direct advice if you have any questions! Also: All of this preparation came out to about $65 dollars total – ETS practice books + 2 months of Gregmat. I studied on and off over 6 weeks this summer while working 60h/week.",

      "content_preview": "I am extremely frustrated and mentally drained from my first experience taking the GRE (if this even counts since the test didn’t even start). I had my exam scheduled for yesterday after studying most of the year. I scheduled the at-home option due to my testing anxiety and ensured I had a direct Ethernet connected to my computer to prevent any delays. I completed all the system checks as required a week prior, and then went through the system checks with the proctor right before the exam, who approved everything and said I was good to go. Right when I pressed “start the exam” I got the notice “unauthorized software operating during the test administration.” The proctor had no idea what was happening and tried redoing the system check. However, it still wouldn’t let me start the exam, so he told me to call ETS for next steps. ETS was incredibly rude and unhelpful. They told me to email them. I explained that I had taken the day off work, got a dog sitter, and have been studying nonstop in preparation for the test, and that I would like to take the exam that day. They did not care. I requested to speak to a supervisor and was refused. I was given a separate number to call who I believe was the integrity office. They were also extremely unhelpful and hung up on me. Before they hung up, I was told that the decision could not be reversed and if I wanted to schedule an additional exam at my own cost, that would be my choice. This is incredibly unjust as I followed everything perfectly and have spent hundreds of hours studying for this moment. I was finally ready to rip the bandaid and am left with zero answers, and out money and time off work. I have since sent an email and got an automated response that I will hear back from them in 7-10 business days. I feel sick to my stomach as I was assuming my weekend would be celebrating finally finishing this exam that I have studied so hard for. Has anyone else had this issue? If so, how were you able to get it resolved? The email I received right after the exam was “Please be advised that as indicated on the GRE® General Test at-home website, the use of any screen-sharing or remote access software (such as Zoom®, Skype®, TeamViewer®, Microsoft Teams®, Apple Remote Desktop™, AnyDesk®, Grammarly® and Spell Check) are prohibited and that repeated violations may result in score cancellation and/or your exclusion from future testing.” Upon checking my computer, I do not have any of those applications installed, so I do not know what I would do to prevent this from happening in the future. What I don’t understand is if a proctor completes all the system checks which automatically closes all applications, how is this even possible? I genuinely feel like I’m being scammed by ETS and don’t know what my next steps are here. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",

      "content_preview": "After 3 attempts and months of on and off practice, I finally got the score I wanted, 169 Q - 166 V -and 5 AWA. I want to give the honorary thank you to GregMat for having plenty of test resources for a great price online. My verbal score increased from 158 -> 166 after GregMat. Just some tips: Q: I already had a decent CS/Math background, so the math content itself was not too tricky for me. The key thing I had to practice was deciphering the GRE questions and understanding what they were asking. Hence, the best solution for me was to just do practice problems. Since, I didn't have to learn any of the concepts, I don't have great advice for the Quant. Almost all problems are solvable, like I haven't seen an unsolvable one. Hence, option D is typically used if there are multiple solutions to the problem, one on each side of B. If you don't know how to solve the problem within the first 30 s, skip it and move in. Obviously, if you are doing this for every problem, this advice is not good. But it allows you to get all the questions you know out of the way in a fast manner, since the time pressure is quite a lot. After that, you can take some time to explore ways to solve the problems you didn't know at the end. V: For verbal, I recommend a two-pronged approach. Initially, I fell into the trap of just focusing on Vocab. This was a bad idea. Firstly, unless you spend a ton of time memorizing vocab words, you just forget them, and tbh I didn't have the time, nor the mental effort to go through that. Utilizing this approach got me a 158 and 160 V. The big jump happened when I switched my approach, although I will say that the vocab prep I had done to get a 158 and 160 did carry over in some extend. I just did a bunch of practice problems, focusing on what to look for or think about it reading passages and understanding what words should be going into each of the sentences. I did all of GregMat's practice tests, the tests in the GRE books, and PP2. This gave me a pretty good idea of how to answer these questions. While also doing this, I was refreshing on my vocabulary, trying to use the words in sentences (not doing that now as you can see), and trying to remember definitions on the go. If I ever came across a word I didn't know, either during a practice test, or in a meeting, I would take note of it and search it up and write down the definition later. This was extremely useful because once you start using these words, you have a stronger idea of how they will fit into a sentence. Also similar to herd immunity, you do not need to memorize all the words. You just need a rough idea of what a certain chunk of the words mean (70%) and you should be fine. You don't need to recite the words definition to heart, but you do need to know how to use it in a sentence and what does it mean in that scenario. Doing this for every practice material I could get my hands on GregMat helped tremendously and I would definitely recommend doing a joint vocab and practice problem approach. Of note, if you can't seem to remember a word, don't spend too much time and dwell it on. The probability that you will actually need that word on the test is low, and if it does show up, as herd immunity works, you would be able to cancel out the other options and realize that this is the word which has to fit, not because you know the word fits, but rather since you know that all the other words do not. AWA: For Analytical Writing, I would recommend not trying for a 6 unless you are a really great writer. Getting a 6 seems to require a great grasp of vocabulary (Not just memorizing its definition) and sophisticated sentences structure. I think a 5 though is achievable without any writing skill, it is predominantly just your analytical skill. The key thing to get a 5 is to handle the complexity of the argument by supporting a counterpoint. You have to make an argument for a point that is opposite than yours. This is not too bad because you don't need to necessarily disprove it. You can just say, that you feel that this point is not important to you, why an assumption it is based on is false, or even just concede the point. Also make sure that your examples are relevant. If you cannot think of relevant examples, just think of indirectly related examples and connect them to your point through analysis. Disclaimer, this advice is what worked for me. I understand my background could be different than most other people, i.e. I am brought up in the US and have been speaking English for a long time, I used to read a lot when I was a kid, and I have done quite a bit of math since childhood. So this advice may not work for you, but it did work for me. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want more direct advice. Thanks for reading my rant, I am just super happy with my score.",

      "content_preview": "(After getting my previous post removed, I am posting again incorporating the suggestions from moderators. I hope this time I will get the help I am looking for). So, I gave ets powerprep test 2 today and scored 315 (161Q, 154V). I have heard that PP2 is fairly representative of how I would perform on the actual test. I have my test scheduled in 24 days from today and I want suggestions for pushing my scores upto (or beyond) 320. Background about me and my preparation: So I am a full time job holder and I can only muster about 2 to 3 hours per day for preparation on weekdays. On weekends, however, I can go upto 5 or 6 hours. I followed gregmat's \"I am Overwhelmed plan\" for my preparation and I strictly followed its quant sections (in verbal ones, I occasionaly skipped some of them). Additionally, I have given all the foundational quizzes on the platform and have score above 80% on all of them. My study plan for coming three days I plan to focus mostly on quant. After having done with foundational quizzes, I plan to practice as much question as I can from gregmat quant question pool. I aim to practice around 1.5 to 2 hours each day on weekdays. For verbal, I am mostly following big book and plan to stick to it. I study vocab words on the commute. For weekends, I plan to give at least one mock test from gregmat. Finally for AWA, I plan to dedicate at least one writing practice per alternate days. I grade my essays with chatgpt. With that being said, any modification to my above plan and suggestions regarding strategies, materials to use and breakdown of allocation of my time in upcoming final three weeks, would be highly appreciated. If anyone of you gave GRE under similar circumstances as mine, I would love to hear about your experiences and how you managed to score high. Thank you.",

      "content_preview": "Hey friends, My eight-month GRE journey ended today with an unofficial 330 (163Q/167V) – an overall score jump of +13Q/+11V. As a long-time lurker, I often saw super-students in this sub who studied six weeks, scored 330+, and wondered if they should retake. Good for them, but fuck – those posts discouraged the shit out of me. So this one’s for any fellow passengers on the struggle bus. If you’d asked me last year (or the year before that or the year before that or the year before that) if I was good at math, I would have laughed and said I sucked. But those jokes papered over a years-old insecurity drilled into me by math classes that moved faster than I could follow and an 8th grade algebra teacher who labeled me a “struggle student.” (Thanks, Coach Sherman.) Numbers made me feel stupid, so I avoided them. But when I decided to pursue an MBA, I had to face the music. First diagnostic confirmed it: still hated that music, and it hated me. But I’ve got big dreams, so -- cue Rocky montage. (And study tips!) ROUND ONE Quant: I used the Gregmat “I’m Overwhelmed Plan.” Prepswift was the perfect mix of concise and comprehensive review for me to rebuild my math skills from scratch quickly. I got -- so -- many -- questions -- wrong. I asked ChatGPT to teach me how to solve questions I couldn't understand (what up, functions!), then had it drill me on the underlying skill. Kept a “Wrong Answer Journal”: logged every wrong Q with topic, mistake, and how to improve Verbal: The Loophole by Ellen Cassidy -- an LSAT book -- taught me text analysis far better than any GRE resources, which makes sense since that LSAT is, like, all text analysis. Gregmat Vocab Mountain + Magoosh vocab app I'm also a native English speaker with a journalism background. I know that doesn't help -- just being up front about my advantages. Writing: The Gregmat formula won't score a six, in my opinion -- but it's simple, practical, will earn an above-average score. If you want to go harder in the paint than that, go for it. First test (May 2025) : 158Q/162V ROUND TWO Quant: Shifted from Gregmat to ETS resources. (Gregmat questions: great for conceptual practice but sometimes at the cost of versimilitude with the test, imo. So I switched.) Did every Q in the 5lb Book → logged in Wrong Answer Journal → drilled weakest topics Made flashcards for sticky concepts; drilled them a couple times a week Actually studied less (6 days/week --> 3-4 days/week). Sometimes your brain just needs time to absorb concepts that can’t be hammered in any further. Mental shift: stopped seeing quant questions as unsolvable mazes, and started seeing them as contraptions to tinker with skills I learned. (\"Oo, what if I cancel that out? Then square it to get rid of the root? Hey! An answer!\") Started to feel, dare I say…fun? Verbal: Brushed up on vocab, think first test was just an off day Writing: Two timed essays right before test day, just to stay sharp Second test (today!) : 163Q/167V . Above medians everywhere I’m applying, except one quant median that’s a single point higher. OVERALL ADVICE You’re not stupid. I don’t care what some fuckhead told you. Fuck him -- or her -- or that 8th grade algebra teacher. You just never had the tools, time, and space to build the momentum that makes further learning fun. Now you’ve got Gregmat ($7/mo) + ChatGPT (free). Go wild. Use Gregmat/Prepswift to learn math. Use ETS resources to learn \"the feel\" of real test questions. There is not shortcut to learning more vocabulary. Sleep is a study skill. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. I know 163Q is a score some super-students would be embarrassed by. But I earned every single point of it. Take that, Coach Sherman. I'm good at math. I'm not stupid. And I'm going to graduate school.",

      "content_preview": "I have recently seen many posts with incredible scores and I wanted to make this post to show that it’s not all that rosy! I wanted to do an MBA because I want to get into entrepreneurship. It started way back in 2023 when I gave my GMAT, didnt get the score I wanted and the exam gave me a lot of anxiety hence switched to GRE. I gave my first GRE exam last year (yes after a long gap) and got a 308. Super sad with the score and I gave the exam in October 2024 so missed deadlines as well. Again, a long break and decided this year was the year! Studied for ~3 months and gave the exam today to get a 313. Today was my last attempt and closure I studied using gregmat, the content was really helpful and super affordable. I just cant solve questions in a timed manner. I followed the steps - concept, strategy, got 90% + in foundational quizzes, got 90%+ in untimed practise but timed practise is another ball game. I understood quickly that I need time, it takes me time to understand a question and answer it. I did do timed practise but it never got better even after maintaining an error log. Anyway long story short, I will continue to follow my entrepreneurship dream without an MBA. Might do a good online one. About the exam: Verbal- I studied around 30 groups in gregmat vocab mountain (~800-900 words) and can recall all of them, I still encountered new words in the exam. I surprisingly found TC and SE more difficult than RC. The sentence structure for some threw me off. One RC passage in the first section was also super esoteric (I think I got all the questions in that one wrong) Quant- In the first section the graph questions were puzzling and another numeric entry too. That reduced the time I had with the other questions and I was scrambling. I think thats the problem I have with GRE, you dont have time to attempt to solve a question, you just have to get it right in like 1 min 30 seconds (so everything has to go right, you dont have time to recalculate or think) Anyway I just wanted to write this post to all the people who are seeing 325+ posts and thinking it’s the norm. Its not.",

However, I feel like I've made no progress with the verbal section. Sure, the words have helped (magoosh and gregmat). But, I feel like RCs are just out of my league. Bar the absolutely easy ones, I am struggling like hell and every day I'm getting ever more frustrated. I thought sheer practice and dissection of my errors would help, but every passage feels like an absolutely new scenario with an absolutely new pattern. At this point, I don't want to give up because I paid for the test, but I don't know whether I'll get a respectable verbal score at the state I'm in. Could any kind soul leave their advices about how to tackle RCs and verbal as a whole? I've sat for difficult exams but it feels like GRE has absolutely ruined my confidence as a student.",

      "content_preview": "hey all! got my unofficial score after the exam:) wanted to share some resources that I used and some tips and tricks one might find useful. background: engineering major and non-native english speaker I used the free powerprep mocks and gregmat for vocab and practice. my experience with gregmat was generally positive. I found it useful for revision of some quant concepts I forgot over the years. some of the hard/extreme questions were a bit of an overkill imo and I personally found the powerprep mocks and the actual exam to be a LOT more straightforward. it still definitely helped me to get used to the style of the questions and solidify quant concepts. the vocab mountain was sooooo useful, I religiously followed all the vocab quizzes and tests that I could find and managed to do 20ish groups. I personally do not think you need to know ALL of the words but knowing most of them really helps, especially if you are not a native speaker. don't be discouraged if you make mistakes! if you are getting 85-90% of the words right, you are already in a very good spot. one day before the exam I took the 3rd gregmat practice exam (which I personally found really hard) and the untimed PP. my actual result was more or less the same as my PP scores. i think i did pretty good for the first try, I ended up studying for about a month not very regularly i am afraid, but as much as I could (1-1.5 h per day). let me know if you have any questions! happy to answer :)",

      "content_preview": "Hey folks, I’ve got exactly 1 month till my GRE and luckily unlimited time to study (I can put in 10–12 hrs/day if needed). Right now I’m stuck deciding between: GregMat’s 1-Month Plan The “I’m Overwhelmed” Plan And even PrepSwift (is this basically the same as IO or a different thing? super confused here). Here’s where I’m at: Both my quant and verbal foundations are weak. I’ve heard a lot of people say that if your quant basics aren’t strong, it’s really hard to finish the 1-Month Plan on schedule, so IO might be better to build foundations. But when I looked through the IO plan, it feels like only Week 4 really introduces strategies. So my actual question is: if I go with IO for the foundation, do I even need to do Weeks 1–3 of the 1-Month Plan afterward? Or would it be smarter to just stick with IO for the basics and then jump straight into Week 4 of the 1-Month Plan for strategies? And where does PrepSwift fit in here? Is it just another version of IO, or should I even bother with it given I’ve only got 1 month left and both my quant + verbal need work? Anyone who’s done these plans (or mixed them) — how would you tackle this with 4 weeks left, weak foundations, but plenty of study time?",

When I took my first practice test in April (Powerprep 1), I scored around a 153 in Quant and 162 in Verbal, so of course I’m really happy with where I ended up. Given I was such an avid lurker on this sub, I thought I’d share a bit about my study experience. First of all, like many, I owe a HUGE thank you to Gregmat. I remember scrolling through this sub a few months ago when I was trying to decide which resources to use and thinking to myself, “Who the heck is this Greg guy and why is everyone talking about him?” Now I know why: Gregmat’s resources truly prepare you for the test. When I started studying, I don’t think I realized just how much I needed to strengthen my foundation until I started following the 2-month plan. Those videos really built up my understanding- I not only knew how to approach the problems but WHY to approach them that way. His questions also over-prepare you for the test, IMO. If you take advantage of the resources on his page (specifically the HUGE number of practice problems) you can really avoid any surprises on test day. Lastly, I want to emphasize just how fortunate I felt to have access to this high quality resource at such an affordable price. So from the heart, thank you Gregmat! Lastly, if it gives anyone a sense of comfort, I was getting quite nervous after seeing a lot of members on the sub say that quant felt a lot harder on the actual test than the practice exams (I even made a post asking about it a few weeks ago haha). Maybe I got lucky, but I didn’t feel that was the case, and it felt to be very close to the level of difficulty on the Powerprep Plus tests (I actually got the same exact score on PPP+3) Happy to answer any questions or provide advice! Good luck to you all!!",

I'll be honest, not a huge fan as there are no lecture videos and should've just done GregMat's overwhelmed course but I'm already about 30% done. - For verbal, beginning around 9/20, I would begin GregMat's 2 Months Prep for Verbal since I read his verbal prep is really strong. - Upon completing TTP Quant prep, I would skim GregMat's PrepSwift Quant videos and the video questions on areas I am weak on as a review for few days to refresh. - With a little over a month remaining before my test date, would work on the power prep 1, then grind out the ETS official guide and power pack, knocking out the power prep 2 and power prep 3 on the weekends. This would be concurrent to GregMat's verbal and essay prep. - Take exam; if unofficial scores are weak, would spend a month restudying just the ETS material and and possibly the 5lbs book. Take retest prior to application deadline. Timeline summary: July - mid October: Complete TTP Quant material and tests Mid Sept - Exam Date: GregMat Verbal in the 2 month prep course Mid October: GregMat Quant review via PrepSwift, Powerprep 1 Late October-Exam Date: ETS guidebook Quant, Quant reasoning book, Powerprep 1 and 2 December: Study for retest Goal is to get about over a 163 on both Q and V for my desired programs.",

Yet yet yet, I was bummed on verbal during the test. The words felt out of place. I have that fear of verbal and the simplest of meanings start floating on the screen for me. Middle of the test, i knew i can play on my strength- quant. I tried to be very very accurate of my answers in Quant and got a 316 (168 Q and 148V). I dont have any attempt left before my deadline and hopefully this can work. Tbh a 316 and a 320 would have been the same for me, close to the 'atleast target' and could have gotten more aspiration.

      "content_preview": "I'm finally done with my GRE today. I prepared for a total of 3 months, though I kinda slacked off in my first month. I don't have any great advice that has not been said before in this sub. I don't consider my score that great either(to be giving out advice). It's a long read, so feel free to skip :) I was done with my Gregmat 2 months plan a week before my GRE exam. So I had a week in front of me. And I was confused as to what I was supposed to be doing. I knew I had to start looking at essays and time management. But other than that, there was nothing. But even then, I was pressuring myself to do more questions. But one day I went for a smoke and sat there contemplating. And finally, I decided that mental preparation was more important than doing some random questions. So I didn't do more questions. I just focused on preparing myself mentally. I did write a mock every day. I made sure my foundations were intact by going through both Quant and Verbal flashcards. But other than that, I just lived how I normally would. I went to a bar 3 days before my GRE. I watched movies, scrolled through Instagram, Reddit. I made sure I got enough sleep on my test day by not sleeping well the day before. And I just looked at the verbal list on the test day, went to the centre. Drank some coffee outside. Talked to some random people there. And I know that I perform well when I'm carefree. And I genuinely put effort to see that I was carefree(for the first time in my life). And I know for sure that it helped. I was very calm and composed during the exam. And that helped me stay away from my two bad habits: Making silly mistakes to be quicker.(Doing it right the first time is better even if it takes some more time) Not skipping questions even if it takes more than 3 minutes. I know you probably make these same two mistakes too. Even though I know it's not going to help my scores, I kept going back to my habits if I'm under pressure. So I made sure that I wasn't under pressure. And the solution is that simple. Make sure you don't feel tensed. Do whatever you have to do to make sure that you don't. That's going to help you more than you think it will. Feel free to practice more questions, but not if you don't get this right. And to whoever doubting if Gregmat is worth it, he really is the shit. The man really is the GOAT. Couldn't have done this without you. Cheers :)",

I will add that 2 of my answers I 100% knew, I just made a very very silly mental error. I must not have been paying attention. Another question I got wrong because I must’ve fat fingered something on my calculator because when I was reviewing my work after the test, i redid my exact calculations and got the correct answer, not what I had put down. I feel like I could’ve done much better, I’m not sure how much those 3 questions would’ve brought my score up, but I am very open to any feedback/advice/criticisms from anybody here. Is a 169 possible in my situation or should I lower expectations? Also how accurate is the free ets powerprep 2 quant section compared to the real thing? Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "I’ve scored 170 on my GRE verbal while getting 163 and 165 on quant over my two test exams. If anyone’s curious, I can speak about how I worked up from a 150 quant, but am most comfortable explaining the consistent 170. So here’s what worked for me: Integrated vocab into daily life Over ~6 months, I casually learned vocab every single day Used the Magoosh GRE Vocab app for 15-60 minutes (morning, commute, before bed, waiting on line - then of course while truly studying) Got my team at work involved, so picked a “word of the day” and used it in conversation Treated it as part of my lifestyle, not a separate chore: people knew I was prepping for this exam Kept and mastered a personal vocab log Any word I wasn’t 95% sure about (or mixed up with another) went into a Quizlet list Even if I guessed it right on a question, if it wasn’t rock solid, it went on the list My mom would quiz me over the phone as accountability helps I read 20-40 minutes daily already, so I was seeing multiple new words organically Ended with 1,000+ words I learned in addition to Magoosh’s list Employed a time-based section strategy Aimed to finish each section with 10+ minutes to spare (I’m very lucky that I read quickly and generally finished sections with 10-15 mins left) For easy/medium questions, completed quickly and double-checked once right away, then went back 1-2 more times to test my logic for holes For hard ones, flagged, guessed best, and revisited at the end. This requires real discipline to not spend too much time on hard questions upfront In review, asked: If I’m wrong, why am I wrong? This helped me spot traps and eliminate wrong answers over time This strategy was much easier on the first section given the adaptive difficulty. I’d usually narrow down the exam down to 1-3 truly uncertain questions in the second section that I’d spend long minutes on Context: I’ve always been stronger on verbal and know I had a head start, but it was the dedication that consistently put me over the line. Balancing that level of focus with a demanding job at an MBB consulting firm wasn’t easy. Takeaway: Daily exposure to challenging words, consistent revisiting of weak spots, and a disciplined time strategy helped me reach perfect scores. I’m not sure what will work for others, but hopefully there’s some wisdom above. Good luck all, and AMA below!",

      "content_preview": "Obligatory shoutout to GregMat! You are truly the goat. Hey all, I received the official scores for my most recent attempt a few hours ago and I'm glad to say I've gotten a 330 (167Q 163V) and 5W, up from 319 (164Q 155V) and 4.5W three weeks ago. Needless to say, I am extremely helpful with my result and I'm writing this post because I believe I can bring a different perspective from the usual discussion about prep resources et cetera. Some background: I'm an Indian candidate which I'm sure implies a few things about my quantitative ability, and I think I have a fairly good understanding of the English language. I prepared for around three months in total for my first attempt but really it was more like two as I wasted the first month faffing around with TPR until I made the switch to GregMat sometime around mid-May. I took the test for my application to econ master's programs which is why my sole focus was on my quant score. I did not prepare for verbal at all, no flashcards, no reading, no videos, nada. The actual prep: First things first, it is absolutely insane how dogshit TPR is considering the prices they charge. If you're looking for test prep, in under no circumstance should you even entertain the thought of enrolling with them. Now, on to the actual prep, I used GregMat's 2 month plan along with PrepSwift, following only the quant track. I solved every exercise, every tickbox quiz, every foundation quiz, every question set, every practice test and quite literally all the loose practice questions for algebra, arithmetic and geometry available. Furthermore, I also used Manhattan's 5lb (but only solved the last dozen questions for every chapter as I found the rest too easy), the official ETS material (OG and QR) and the ETS Big Book in which I solved I believe 20 whole sections. The results: Reading this, I'm sure you would agree that my prep was quite exhaustive and that I would do very well on the real exam and I would've very much agree with you before I took the test for the first time. However, despite my extensive preparation, confidence and very decent practice test scores, my test day performance was extremely disappointing. I scored quite literally at the bottom of my range on both measures and was, frankly, extremely distraught. At first, I could not understand how I could've performed so terribly but as they always say, hindsight is 20/20. Looking back, I created tons of subconscious pressure for myself despite appearing and feeling confident. I cancelled meetups with my friends just so I could solve a few more practice questions, did the same with my family and took a week off college. Hell, in the lead up to the exam, I started taking sleeping pills for the first time in my life just so I could be well rested come test day. And on the day itself, I curated every single thing I consumed and had it all ordered in. I left no stone unturned to make my first attempt as perfect as possible which was my biggest folly. What I changed: After taking a couple days to get my head on straight again after the travesty that was my test, I took the decision to re-sit and do it as soon as I could (on advice of a friend). I evaluated where I had gone wrong the previous time and worked to fix that this time around. In the three weeks between my last and my current attempt, I solved a grand total of zero practice questions. All I did was switch to the Overwhelmed plan, go through it as thoroughly as I could and worked on my foundation. In the last week of my preparation, I spent every day alternating between a practice test from GregMat and one of the PP+ tests along with solving a few sets from the OG and QR books each day. On the last day of my prep and a few hours before the test, I went through the entire Overwhelmed quant mountain just to revise my concepts. Also during my prep this time around, I did not sacrifice my social life at all. I went out with friends, family, took no time off college and in fact spent the entire last day of prep at my friend's place for his birthday (shoutout to my hb). My advice: On the technical side of things, build a very solid foundation. The GRE is not like other tests which my fellow Indian candidates might be familiar with where you can solve a ton of practice questions and get good without getting a check on your foundation. In my opinion practice questions aren't as useful for GRE prep as good ol' foundation quizzes are. Secondly and finally, do not succumb to pressure or chase perfection. The GRE is just a supplement to your application and should also just be a thing you prepare for on the side, not something your entire life should revolve around for a few months. This was an extremely long post and I commend you if you ended up reading what amounted to a blogpost at the end. Feel free to ask any questions.",

I’ve lurked around and seen amazing reviews and results with the Gregmat platform and went ahead with buying the subscription. Previously I had been super lost and wasn’t sure where to start, using Khan Academy for math (not a strong math foundation) and Anki for vocab (which coincidentally was the exact Gregmat vocab mountain so I have a 20 day head start lol). Now, having been familiarized with Gregmat and the platform, I decided on using the 2 month plan— but I’ve already scheduled my test for mid November since I wanted to give myself ample time to prepare. This leaves me with about 3 weeks in between the end of the study plan and my exam date. How should I use the time in between? Study sessions with the gregmat tutors? Fine tuning anything I’m not 100% sure about ? Please let me know what you would recommend !",

However, I am disappointed because I was targeting at least 325. I put in a lot of effort. I tend to study through PEDMORO, so I probably studied around 300 hours in total over three months for this attempt, yet the returns on effort were quite low. I exhausted a lot of resources. I followed Greg’s one month plan in its entirety, completed some chapters from 5 Lb and also did questions from Magoosh 589 q series, solved more than 400 of the 600 GregMat qaunt questions, worked through GregMat’s six hard, easy, and medium question series, and used ETS official guide (150 qs) for Quant. For Verbal, I did all of Greg’s exercises and quizzes along with official guide. Looking back, I realise my shortcomings. I did not put in the required effort to study under time constraints. The quant questions were somehwat different from those on GregMat. GregMat’s hard qs often requires some degree of long calculations, whereas the actual exam questions were more wordy but conceptual in nature. As a result, the intensive preparation through Greg’s question bank did not help me much much because I did not do enough of it under timed conditions. I wish I had done more timed practice, because the questions were not difficult and I understood the concepts, but spending too much time on some questions created an imbalance. I am also terrible at managing time pressure. I will be taking another shot at it, but this time my strategy will revolve purely around solving questions under time constraints. I would appreciate any analysis and advice.",

      "content_preview": "Hello Guys! I took the test a few days ago and got a really bad score(315 160Q 155V). I had used gregmat for prep and I have attached my prep journey. Would be glad if you guys could suggest if I should take it again or submit my applications without the score? Planning for Fall ‘26 MSCS I’m from an engineering background so I didn’t need a lot of time understanding the basics. I scored a 319 in PP2(166Q and 153V). I took some magoosh tests and scored(320+ with a 167Q being the highest). In one of the gregmat quants, I scored 170Q. 160Q before I started prep and 164Q in the other. I’m thinking of taking 1.5months and preparing again. Solving gregmat’s questions for quant and taking 1 mock per week(although i’ve already taken gregmat’s 3mocks and 2 Powerpreps). For verbal, I will be going through the 1000 words again, hopefully quicker this time and watch prepswift videos. Although this is very similar to my previous routine, I want to know if i’m missing any step in the process. Targeting 165+ in Q and close to 160 in verbal I’m heavily disappointed with my performance. This is a combination of silly mistakes and panic during the exam which led to shortage of time. I second guessed almost all of my answers which wasted a lot of time. What do you suggest I do? I had solved close to 400-450 problems on gregmat. How do I improve on these scores? I would be glad if you could help me out here! Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "This is for the people who just want to check the box for the GRE. I am officially done with the GRE. I have been studying for the GRE for the last three and a half months. I started out by learning words, but I was struggling for almost two months to retain what I had learned. I took a GregMAT subscription at the end of May and started the I am overwhelmed plan, because I was, well, overwhelmed! But life had some personal vendetta with me, or at least that's my takeaway since life has been throwing one crisis after another ever since I started studying for the GRE. For quant, I initially started doing the 5 lb, but it felt easy, so I didn't continue. I religiously followed PrepSwift for quant foundation and took the quizzes. Verbal was the tricky part for me, because I was struggling with retaining my vocab. I finished two-thirds of the vocab mountain and some other words here and there. I guess I studied 700-750 words in total. My downfall in verbal came from not being able to remember the meaning of the words. I could feel that the second verbal section was easier than the first, and I was certain that I screwed up verbal and eventually lost track of time during the second quant section. I took PP1 a week before my test and got around 153v and 161q (don't ask me how i know this; i asked chatgpt). In PP2, I got 146v and 160q (took 2 days before the exam). This was the most accurate representation of my test day performance. To be honest, from the beginning I wasn't aiming for any extra-ordinary score; I just wanted to be able to show that I took the test and hence fulfil all the requirements for application. Nevertheless, I am pretty bummed about the verbal score: I wanted to cross 150, but at least the GRE nightmare is over! Good luck to everyone taking the test in the coming days. Cheers!",
