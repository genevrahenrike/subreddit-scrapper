There seem to be plenty that focus on tackle/lure choice etc...but i'm interested how to work a lure, retreives, techniques etc... Pretty easy to pick up a LRF Rod, 2500 class reel, light braid/flouro and a selection of Isome, Berkley Gulp, Pocket in sets etc... But I can't seem to find much about when to choose jig head vs drop shot, when to cast vs work vertically, retreive speed, how to give a lure the correct action etc etc...the actual fishing rather than just some basic gear choices... Any links or suggestions?",

I’ve recently moved to the uk I want to get more into fly fishing. I know there is a good amount to be done both north and south of Manchester but I’d love to be able to link up with some fellow fishermen and get my feet wet. Right now I don’t have any kit here in the uk but I’m keen to get back into it. If anyone here can point me in the right direction to get started it would be much appreciated. I’ve see a couple of stocked places on the internet but I’d love for someone to be able to give me real world advice etc Thanks in advance, Benny",

      "content_preview": "Hey, I've been fishing since I was like 5, I grew up around lakes and rivers, but mostly was fishing on wild rivers in Eastern Europe where I'm from, fast forward 25 years, I got my 2 rod license and I am able to get into my favourite thing in the world again, but now here in the UK. I live in London, got a car and would like to ask the experienced people about their knowledge of places, most likely a river with carp, barbel and silverfish. I would either fish with 1 rod bottom or 1 match, nothing fancy, just wanna enjoy the game in quiet, doesn't have to be a place where everyone says there's constant fish, what I am looking for is peace and quiet, preferably not touristy, love greenery and forest, far from roads. Even if it's a lake that's okay, just have a preference for rivers, and these filled up and popular fisheries just take the point of it all out for me, plus I think the fishes caught there don't look natural, they are usually fatty and sluggish. I know it might be counter-productive to ask for a quiet place on a popular website where thousands are reading this, would just like some suggestions. Even in PM is fine. So far via research I came across with certain stretches of the Themes and River Lea, but again, nothing's more valuable than personal experience. Thank you in advance, hope everyone's making the most out of their bank holiday.",

      "content_preview": "This always needs repeating, as I still see so many doing it: it's much safer to hold off pike fishing until the cooler months, usually from October onwards. In warm water, oxygen levels are lower and pike tire much more quickly. Their muscle physiology means they build up lactic acid fast, and in higher water temperatures they struggle to recover, often leading to delayed mortality even if they swim off strongly at release. Sadly, it's quite a common occurrence where I live in the Norfolk Broads, with summer holiday anglers. They'll catch a pike (often with a lure, from a hire cruiser) and release it, and then the next day, I'll find it floating in the boat yard. And then there are fewer and fewer pike around for an ever-growing number of pike anglers.",

I went to a place I know there are loads of wrasse and I had a billion bites but im either failing to set the hook or something is wrong with my rig. 10oz teardrop weight. 9inch distance to size 6 barbed slightly offset facing up all on 6lb flouro attached to 15lb braid via swivel. Rod is a HTO Nebula 5-21g, i can feel everything well. Most bites were on those Japanese fake ragworm. I did shorten them after a while to see it it was an issue of the bait being too long and just being nibbled at the end. I did notice the hook was sometimes sideways, could it have been too heavy? The worms were also being pulled down the hook shaft but I think that was crabs. I was 'striking ' when it was a clear fish nibble. I could tell when a crab had hold vs a fish. Any ideas on what I was doing wrong? Thank you.",
