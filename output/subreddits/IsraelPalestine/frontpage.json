      "content_preview": "Israel didn’t just show up one day and take land at gunpoint. In 1947, the UN proposed a two-state plan: one for Jews and one for Arabs. Jewish leaders agreed. Arab leaders said no. And yes, Palestinians felt betrayed, watching outsiders carve up land they lived on. That anger was real, and that sense of injustice was real. But instead of turning to negotiation, the choice was war. The goal wasn’t a better deal, it was to stop Israel from existing. That war in 1948 failed. Then came 1956, failed. 1967, failed. 1973, failed. After that came decades of rockets, bombings, and uprisings. Different tactics, same goal: erase Israel. None of it worked. And after every defeat, nothing changed. No reckoning, no acceptance of reality. Just more rejection, more violence, and more kids growing up with no future. In most conflicts, repeated losses eventually push people toward compromise. At some point, peace, even if painful, is better than endless defeat. But that moment never came here. And the people who have suffered the most are Palestinians. They’ve faced war, displacement, poverty, and trauma. Many are stateless. Many live under corrupt leaders. Their pain is real, and it’s heartbreaking. But their leaders made it worse by refusing peace. There were real offers: 1947, Camp David, Oslo, Barak’s plan in 2000, Olmert’s in 2008, Israel’s full withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. These were not symbolic. They were genuine chances to start fresh. And every time, the answer was no. That isn’t how conflicts usually work. One side loses every war. One side rejects every deal. Yet the world still treats that side as if it never had a choice. Palestinian suffering is real. But it will not end through rejection. It will not end by waiting for Israel to disappear. It will only end when someone finally chooses peace over pride, reality over fantasy, and a future over another round of loss.",

      "content_preview": "A lot of the anti-Israel posts I see online fall into two buckets: ragebait posts, or \"Zionism is bad\" talking points. I want to address the second. If the last two years have proven anything, it’s the opposite: the success of Zionism and the natural result of Jewish people taking responsibility for their own destiny. Despite being outnumbered in the region by roughly 50 to 1, Israel has taken down multiple neighboring countries simultaneously and still stood strong. In this time it did not only survive, but it thrived. Israel's stock market grew faster compared to any other in the entire world. Our economy continued to grow. Our people continued to build new breakthroughs in science and technology. Zionism, at its core, is about Jewish self-determination. The ability of Jews to govern themselves, protect themselves, and to build a society according to our own creativity and idealism. The Jewish people's profound ability to flourish in the face of adversity is exactly what the Zionist movement predicted - and it happened this way. And recent years have made the case even clearer. In a world still plagued by antisemitism and radical politics Zionism is ever more relevant, not less. The story of the last two years is another story of the success of Zionism. It is not a story about about Israeli weakness or victimhood. It's our small nation proving, once again, the strength of Jewish self-rule. That is Zionism.",

I raise my hand and say i’m an Arab of Palestinian roots and I’m actually pro-Israel! I then get blocked lol i see my comment getting upvotes but can’t answer any questions or reply to her comment that she made before quickly blocking me. And to answer her CLEARLY out here.. THIS IS WHY YOU DON’T KNOW ANY NON-JEW WHO IS PRO ISRAEL. BECAUSE YOU BLOCK THEM AT FIRST GLANCE ! Alot of people like me exist out in the world. People who see past childhood indoctrination and ideals that have been planted in our heads for a century. They desperately tried to teach me hate, but my brain couldn’t register that hate. I was 12 the first time i saw a suicide bombing on TV that happened in Israel. It was at a restaurant. My parents were joyful! My dad especially excited about the Israeli fatalities. I asked them “ but how is this right? People were sitting at a restaurant dining!! How is killing them ok?!?” To which my dad replied “ this is the only form of resistance we are capable of. What was taken forcefully cannot be taken back any other way “. That didn’t sit right with me. So yes. Arabs exist who refuse this condoned “resistance” , and see it for what it is, terrorism. The same people who condoned suicide bombings are the ones who celebrated October 7th. It doesn’t go away, this type of hatred, it only festers and grows.",

      "content_preview": "This isn't very glamorous. I'm an American-Israeli dual citizen. I served in the IDF. I'm pro-peace, pro-2SS. In my perfect Barbie world I'd like to see a binational confederation of I/P with free travel, work, and even living in both countries. I joined a server called HeadOn that is supposed to be a place for people to talk about geopolitics - mainly I/P - openly. There were more Jews than non-Jews but there were many Arabs and several Palestinians along with Jews, Israelis, and just global people. At first my experience on there was very positive. It definitely changed me. It humanized Palestinians and Arabs for me in the sense that I got to see nuanced perspectives. Even people I disagreed with, I could listen to their reasoning and stories and history and understand better WHY they felt this way. I learned a lot of history, including a lot of things about Palestine I did not know. I learned more generally about Islam and also got to hear a diverse view from a lot of Israelis. Eventually things started to devolve. The fact that the space tried to maintain this philosophy of true \"openness\" led to it being extorted by some trolls. There were a couple of instigators and impossible members that got everybody's hackles up. It frequently became \"us versus them.\" Criticize one person who was being a complete ass, another more moderate person would jump in to defend them simply because they were the same race or religion. One man in particular was terrible. He was very smart and educated on the conflict but he was rabidly unkind and vindictive. The moderators tried a couple peace-keeping measures but without banning people there wasn't much they could do, and the overall creator of the space didn't want to do that. I was planning to do a discussion on practical steps for peace but I ended up getting into a heated debate with someone. I got ugly and so did he and I felt gross after. It kind of left me dispirited like how could I talk about peace if I couldn't even chill around one troll? So I will just share some of my core takeaways. Obviously it bears repeating these are MY experiences and opinions, not universal truths: -Palestinians and Muslims are largely ignorant of Jewish and Israeli history and beliefs. It goes both ways but it's much more pronounced with them, and even if you argue with them or try to explain Jewish history very few people were interested, saying it's not their responsibility to know or understand how Jews or Israelis think. Obviously this wasn't a monolith. There were several Palestinians that did care, including one peace activist that did a lecture and was ridiculed by several other Arab Muslims for advocating for understanding between both people. Also, this was true in the reverse for several Jews/Israelis on the server - they vocally did not care at all about Palestinians, their history, or their feelings. -A lot of Jews/Israelis/pro-Israel people really think that Palestinians and Muslims are all just stoked on martyrdom and extremism. They think these people really don't care about their families and loved ones and are just like this because they want to be or something. They also think all of Hamas is evil and twisted, which is what I used to think. It took going on the server and talking to people to really get it through to me that Hamas is the working government in Gaza. There are many bureaucratic Hamasniks, many Hamasniks that joined just to give a better life to their families etc. via a \"government job.\" I don't like death and it doesn't make me happy when people die, even Hamas members, so coming to terms with this was also difficult. -A lot of Palestinians and Muslims  just don't know about the bad things Palestinians have done. If you show them evidence they say it's hasbara or it just didn't happen. A lot really believe unequivocally that they are the \"good guys\" and that violence done against Israelis is usually measured and fair. -A lot of Israelis don't want peace unless the Palestinians also want it. This really frustrated me. To me peace should be paramount, and if Palestinians don't want it we should make it such an attractive option they just jump for it. Even if you don't care about Palestinians we should do it for the sake of our own kids. A lot of Israelis seem dangerously comfortable with the status quo and despite Israel not making any real overtures for a 2SS for a long time, they just want Palestine to I guess sort itself out, deradicalize, and I guess say they're sorry or something or admit they're wrong? before they want to make an effort for peace again. -Palestine means a lot more to Muslims worldwide than just the suffering of the actual Palestinians IMO. Watching the way Muslims and Arabs went after each other in the VC, but all rallied together to defend Palestine, made me realize this is an issue that is something kind of spiritual for them. Israel is a catalyst that unites a lot of these people who would otherwise hate and kill each other. They like having a shared enemy and they push Palestinians to keep fighting despite doing little to actually contribute to their livelihood and safety because \"that's Israel's job.\" -A lot of Israeli Jews seem to really not care about '48 Palestinians (Israeli-Arabs), or non-Jewish members of Israel. They treat them like afterthoughts. Israel doesn't do a lot to integrate Jewish and non-Jewish cultures. Israelis often treat these groups like they should be grateful to be a part of Israel, or like Israel is doing them a favor, or that Jewish Israelis opinions and desires for the country are more valid than non-Jews. -There are way too many involved in the conflict that aren't Israeli or Palestinian that just make everything worse with their strong opinions and glaring ignorance of the history and the people involved, etc. 99% of the people already have a strong conclusion that they are working backwards from, just looking for things to strengthen their beliefs. -A lot of the religious members on the server seemed normal and chill, but then when you get to really know them actually have crazy convictions and this was pretty unsettling for me. It was weird to talk to someone who then casually drops that they are in favor of capital punishment for infidelity, or they want to destroy the Dome of the Rock to rebuild the Temple, or that God is going to crush so and so under their boot, or that \"X\" religion is truly evil etc. In the end of it all I just got depressed. The conversations became cyclic to me. I left for a month, rejoined, but it didn't look like much had changed. I don't know if I will go back. Some final thoughts: the creator of the server, a dude named Adar Weinreb, seems to be legit even if I don't agree with him about a lot of stuff. He blames Israel for way more than I do but I think he's pretty sincere about peace and is very zen. There aren't a lot of people doing what he's doing, and his team for HeadOn are really good people. The conversations with experts, peace activists, settlers, Palestinian trauma therapists, etc. were super interesting. It was the best part of the server. I don't know if I'll ever go back but I am definitely glad I was a part of it for the time I was happening. I feel less hopeful for the future than before, although I wouldn't trade that for how much I felt like I learned and grew as a person from it.",

      "content_preview": "Here what really happened. The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS, or Asociación Internacional de Académicos en Genocidio) prepared an report in which it affirms that Israel is committing this crime in Gaza. La Asociación está integrada por 500 members and, como todo informe, it was announced that the content of the same would be open to debate to listen to quienes no estuviesen de acuerdo. The debate did not end. Voting proceeded directly, and the dissident voices were not heard. However, only a quarter (129) of the associates participated in the vote, and of them only 83% were in favor of the report. This is equivalent to approximately 21% of the total of associates. Given that the majority of those who voted supported the report, the RELATO now is that \"the majority of specialists in genocide say that Israel is committing one\". The reality is that 74.2% of the specialists had no interest in supporting the report . In other words, the report is a farce. The interesting thing is that this farce does not occur in a casual moment. There is a fundamental reason for this to be published today: Israel is raising its siege against Hamas in Gaza, and the entire global anti-Semitic lobby (financially supported by Qatar, mainly) is making the last desperate efforts to save the terrorist group. The only tool they have left is media pressure to try to make the international community feel obligated to stop Israel. That tool is not working. In previous weeks, the biggest media attack ever seen against Israel revolved around an alleged famine in Gaza, coordinated with Emmanuel Macron's attempt to convince the most important European leaders to formally recognize the Palestinian state this September. Las dos estrategias fellaron estrepitosamente. First was Germany, and behind it other countries like Holland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, rejected Macron's proposal tacitly. Canada and Belgium withdrew their initial support. And en cuanto a la hambruna, a minute and detailed Israeli investigation demonstrated that the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, an agency of the UN) had ALTERED its own diagnosis criteria, to be able to label as \"hunger\" what is happening in Gaza. Después de eso and, por supuesto que in la major discretion posible, 150 media outlets have committed to launch a global siege against Israel starting today, accusing it of murdering journalists. Unfortunately for them, the plan leaked, was exhibited by the government of Israel in all social networks, and the event lost the impact it planned to have. Por eso no surprende que ahora vengan presentar este informe supuestamente avalado por una majoios de specialists. Al igual que los demás intentos, tiene una limitante: Si no logra su objetivo en 3 o 4 días, quedará interrado, porque será necesaria apenas esa cantidad de tiempo para que se contundentemente refutado y exhibido como una farsa. At the end of the day, all these are only the last desperate attempts to save a terrorist group, aware that Israel has won the war in the battlefield. They are in a hurry, because the United States has already let it be known that Trump's plan for a radical reconstruction of Gaza is still in place. Saudi Arabia, believe me, is happy with that. If we do not detain Israel these days and Hamas falls, the United States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will ally with Israel to set the foundations of a completely different Middle East than we have known. The problem is that the cartridges have run out. No van a detener a Israel y Hamas será derotado por completo. Espérense más fuegos pyrotécnicos mediáticos como esta broma de informe de specialists. Es lo último que les queda. There were 129 of 500 specialists who voted for the report without prior debate. Only 83% of those 129 voted in favor.",

      "content_preview": "They aren't even hiding it any more. Hamas’s military wing spokesperson, Abu Obeida, declared on Friday that Israeli hostages are being held alongside its fighters in combat zones under the same perilous conditions, as Israel intensifies preparations for a full-scale invasion of Gaza City. “We will preserve the lives of the captives to the extent that we can,” the terror group said. “They will remain with our fighters in the places of confrontation, exposed to the same risks.” Hamas added that for every hostage killed as a result of Israeli military action, it would publish the individual’s name, photograph, and proof of death. Hamas announces hostages are held in fighting zones ahead of Gaza City invasion Pro-Pales, do you have any excuses for this? We said that they were using human shields. You didn't believe us. Now they are saying it themselves. There is only one option now. From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be Hamas free! There is no future for Palestinians as long as Hamas exists. There is no peace to be had as long as Hamas exists. Every death in this war is blood on Hamas' hands. We can no longer pretend like this is traditional warfare. Hamas has taken off the match and exposed their true selves. Debates can, have, and will be had about the events before October 7. But we have to get on the same page regarding October 7 and what followed. Hamas is a genocidal religious death cult whose only goal is the eradication of the Jewish state and the Jewish people. They will do anything they deem appropriate to achieve that goal. Decapitations. Rapes. Taking hostages. Using those hostages as human shields. We can not accept this behavior. And neither can Israel. The goal now is the elimination of Hamas and the deradicalizing of Palestinians. That is the only path to peace after 80 years of terror. If you excuse this behavior, you are no friend of Palestinians. They are being used as just pawns for the cause. Their deaths are nothing more than propaganda material for the Muslim Brotherhood. If you care about Palestinians, you have to support the elimination of Hamas. Anything less will just expose you as antisemites who use Palestinians' deaths to justify your hatred of Jews. It is time to decide which side of history we will be on. Do we support peace and democracy… Or do we support terrorism and dictatorship.",

It seems like you're either expected to pick a side or stay silent. But I want to speak up, not for one side, but for people on both sides who just want peace, safety, and a future. I’m pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian in the sense that I want peace and dignity for both peoples. I mourn for every innocent life lost, no matter where they’re from. I reject the idea that empathy has to be exclusive. You can care about civilians in Gaza and civilians in Israel at the same time. This shouldn't be controversial, but lately it feels like it is. I believe that no child should grow up under the shadow of bombs or occupation, No family should live in fear of rockets or raids, No people should be dehumanized, displaced, or silenced, and no one should be labeled as an enemy just because they hope for coexistence. If you're someone who feels stuck between the shouting matches—someone who refuses to dehumanize either group—I'd really like to hear from you. Are there others here who believe in peace without needing to align with nationalism, extremism, or tribalism? This isn’t about ignoring history or avoiding hard conversations, It’s about refusing to let our compassion be limited by borders, ideologies, or political pressure. Peace begins with recognizing each other's humanity.",

It has also set up hundreds of checkpoints and contributed to reducing entire neighbourhoods to rubble by embedding its fighters in residential areas, which are then indiscriminately shelled and bombed by the army.\" There are claims that Hamas has their fighters embedded in residential areas in Gaza, drawing indiscriminate Israeli bombing.

      "content_preview": "We've all heard that; some of us have probably even said it.  It's easy to say you're against Hamas; after all, they're an ultra-religious dictatorship that opposes everything the liberal West is against - they want to impose theocracy, they're anti-feminist and anti-LGBTQ, they refuse to allow elections, and they brutally suppress any opposition.  So the question is, if you're \"opposed to Hamas,\" do you want them to remain as the government in Gaza or not?  If Israel pulls out of Gaza and allows Hamas to reassert authority, any aid to rebuild will be appropriated by them and used to reconstitute their tunnel system along with their offensive capabilities. So it's clear, before Gaza can be rebuilt, Hamas has to go.  Critics will say that Hamas is an idea and can't be eradicated, and while this is true, it's also true that they can be removed from power.  80 years after the fall of N*z* Germany, there are still N*z*s around; they're just not in power anymore.  This is the goal with Hamas.  So how is this to be accomplished?  Just saying \"I don't support them\" won't do it.  They're never going to surrender as they don't have the interests of the people of Gaza in mind, otherwise they would have surrendered by now.  So their leadership and command structure has to be found and eradicated, and since they're a military force, this has to be done through military means. Is Israel doing this perfectly, with no mistakes or civilian casualties?  Of course not.  But the alternative, allowing Hamas to remain in charge of Gaza and continue to use it as a staging ground for attacks on Israel, along with oppressing the people of Gaza (and, very likely, taking over in the West Bank once Mahmoud Abbas is gone) would mean that the death of every Israeli and Gazan until now in this conflict was pointless.  If you truly oppose Hamas, that opposition has to be more than just verbal.",

Let’s be real this conflict has dragged on for decades, and not once has anyone stopped to ask the real question. Where is the bacon? We’ve tried peace talks, ceasefires, UN resolutions, even awkward Zoom summits. Yet, have we ever tried just sitting everyone down at a breakfast table with a mountain of maple-glazed bacon? No! And that’s the problem! Bacon doesn’t care about your passport. Bacon doesn’t care about your religion. Bacon doesn’t care if you’re Team Crispy or Team Chewy. Bacon only wants to be eaten loudly, proudly, and with grease running down your fingers as you realize maybe, just maybe, world peace was hiding in a BLT this whole time. Picture it. Hamas lays down its weapons for a platter of bacon-wrapped shawarma. Settlers stop arguing when someone brings out the candied bacon bites. Negotiators at the table stop yelling long enough to mumble through full mouths, “Okay fine, two states, whatever, just pass the napkins.” That’s not a fantasy, that’s the smell of bacoplomacy. And yet, bacon remains oppressed. Held hostage by religious bans, smeared as “ Haram ” or “ treif ,” treated like the most persecuted strip of meat in human history. This is the real injustice.

      "content_preview": "So for context, I’m not muslim nor am I Jewish, but I consider myself a leftist and like 99% of other leftists, I think that apartheid and racism and occupying stolen land is wrong, so I’ve always been concerned about the Israel/Palestine situation. Especially since the genocide in Gaza started three years ago. Obviously I know that there are a lot of people out there who dismiss anything that opposes Israel and the genocide it is committing as antisemitism, so I understand the conclusion that many people will jump to here that I’m just falling for things like that, but it’s not that I promise. I’ve been in a lot of online leftist spaces for a while and I, like a lot of other people, feel helpless seeing the stuff going on on the news and the suffering people are facing every day. So I want to help. So I follow a lot of pro-Palestine pages. But I’ve noticed a disturbing increase in the amount of comments that are literally just antisemitism, that often goes unchecked by anyone, and it bothers me a lot, because I don’t want to support any page or organisation that is allowing or even promoting bigotry of any kind. People will comment things like “the n-zis were right”, basically just neo-n@zi stuff and also a lot holocaust denial, and it’s making me honestly quite drained. Usually when I see that stuff I’ll reply, trying to challenge them and call them out, but usually I’ll get retaliation, not just from the op, but others too, sometimes even going as far as to call me a Zionist or Israel apologist which is bizarre because I am neither of those things at all. I stopped engaging completely with any kind of post relating to the topic now because honestly it feels like real antisemitism is being normalised these days. It reminds me of when the Manchester bombing happened, and it seemed at the time like Islamophobia was being normalised everywhere I looked. It just makes me feel even more depressed about the state of the world right now. There is a humanitarian crisis going on and people are using it as an opportunity to spread and normalise hate. Just the other day one of the top comments on a post I saw about Palestine was talking about how apparently nearly all Jewish people are Zionists and therefore hating Jewish people is okay, and they’re all evil. I don’t really talk about this much because I don’t want to be accused of trying to “distract” people from Israel’s crimes because that’s what I was accused of recently. But I just wanted to vent about it because nobody else seems to be talking about this issue and I just wanted to find one person who also sees this going on.",

      "content_preview": "Edit: I want to add more context to this. The video is footage from December 21 2024 taken from a hidden camera outside of Kamal Adwan Hospital. The source is likely Hamas who circulated it on social media with the unverified claim that it was caused by an Israeli airstrike and it was picked up by Al Jazeera. Hamas filmed it and claimed it was an Israeli airstrike. Amna al-Mufti was identified by her father from this footage. Kamal Adwan Hospital had been a previous military target by the IDF, and on December 27 a week after Amna al'Mufti died the Israeli army said that it detained 240 individuals it claimed were Hamas operatives during the operation and that the hospital served as a critical point for Hamas operations. According to a Times of Israel report, \"numerous explosive devices were neutralized in the area surrounding the hospital.\" End of edit. OK, fine. I've been watching this conflict from a safe space in America where I'm privileged enough to be protected from violence, but this situation really stuck with me. A video made the rounds on social media, like a lot of things do especially with this conflict and I don't think I need to link it, but it's a video of a young girl, a child carrying water and she walks in front of a camera and there's an explosion and she collapses, and probably dies. Immediately, there's someone with a stretcher that carries her body out of frame, but the caption says that it's an Israeli targeted airstrike. Al Jazeera picked the video up, of course off of social media and ran with it, but that doesn't make sense. Israeli ammunition doesn't do that. It tears chunks out of walls, it demolishes buildings. Israeli guns tear people to shreds, Israeli bombs don't cause a puff of smoke in a small localized area and leave an intact body behind, that's not what Israeli airstrikes do. That's not what Israeli guns do. This little girl stepped on an IED. She stepped on a booby trap, likely meant for an Israeli soldier, that's what the camera is set up to film, so Hamas can have a propaganda win on Arabic social media. She stepped on an IED and died, now Hamas has to go tell her family what happened to her. They can't say it's their fault, they're going to lie and say it was Israel, because that's what they already lied about and told the world. How many times has this happened, and people just believe it?",

      "content_preview": "Way too often, I see people who act like the creation of Israel was some sort of unique event that totally threw an established region into chaos. I assume these people have never bothered to look into the history of it, because it's quite obviously the opposite. Israel came into being in the mid 20th century as part of a wider pattern of post imperial state formation after World War I and II. Mr1worldin posted this on r/stupidquestions and I think it's worth reposting here to explain all that: Before the world wars, most people lived under vast, multiethnic empires such as the British, Ottoman, Russian ones and not modern nation states. When the Ottoman Empire collapsed, the victorious powers didn’t annex its Arab provinces outright and Instead they carved them into territorial mandates that eventually became the modern states of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and others. These new states weren’t pre existing nations, they were political constructs loosely based on ethnic, cultural, and religious groupings and their creation entailed the displacement of people and fair amounts of violence as their borders were quite arbitrary. Jewish communities on their part were not outsiders to this region. Its well established that they had lived in parts of the Middle East for centuries, and by the 1800s were the largest population in places like Jerusalem and Galilee. Many Jews (including Ashkenazi fleeing persecution in Europe) moved there under Ottoman rule through legal land purchases. Pogroms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries drove more migration and devastated the local jewish communities. When the Ottomans fell, it made sense in the mandate context to propose separate Arab and Jewish sectors as these were two distinct communities with established populations and legal standing. The plan for a dual state was rejected outright by local and regional Muslim leaders, for whom it was unacceptable that land once ruled by Islam could be under Jewish sovereignty. In the violence that followed which involved pogroms and the mass displacement of Jews from Arab countries into the nascent Jewish sector became pronounced. European Jews kept arriving as antisemitic persecution intensified, especially with U.S. immigration routes restricted. When war broke out after the UN partition plan, Israel emerged victorious, gaining territory in the process, which was entirely standard for postwar conflicts. The Arab defeat in ridding the region of jewish autonomous rule (the Nakba, or “catastrophe”) became later a concept referring to the plight of displaced arabs and central to the emerging Palestinian national identity which started as a post exile political project by defeated levantine arabs as a way to exert pressure in defeat and pursuing an alternative way to resist the jewish state and return to the land they had left. Seen in this broader historical frame Israel’s creation was not a bizarre unique colonial conspiracy of “white Jews” displacing natives as it is presented normally in the context of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict and instead appears by any historical metric that It was one of many post imperial territorial realignments and no more unusual than for instance the expulsion of millions of ethnic Germans from Prussia after WWII, with their lands ceded to Poland. The collapse of empires in the early 20th century — Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, British — led to the arbitrary carving up of vast territories by colonial powers. This process caused war, population transfers, and displacement across Europe, the Middle East, and beyond. If you believe Israel’s creation is a uniquely evil outcome of this process — but say nothing about the millions of ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe, the partition of India and Pakistan, or the creation of entirely new Arab states from the Ottoman ruins — then your issue clearly isn’t with post-imperial nation-building. You’re just angry that Jews got a state out of it.",

I’ve always been into food, art, design, music, and languages, and the more I come across Palestinian culture, the more interested I am. I also want to be honest: I feel really sorry about the recent violence and the racist anti-Arab attitudes I see around me in Israel. It’s frustrating and heartbreaking. I know words don’t fix anything, but I want to put it out there that I’m here with respect and because I want to listen and learn. I’m not here to debate politics or war; I just want to connect with people who know and love the culture. So if you don’t mind, I’d love to ask: What Palestinian foods or dishes have significance in Palestinian culture? Any old or modern musicians, singers, or bands you’d recommend? What are some Palestinian designs that are interesting and culturally significant? Are there certain phrases, words, and sayings that are exclusive to Palestinian arabic? Thanks a lot for reading, and for anything you’re open to sharing.",

      "content_preview": "Zionism is often downplayed in this subreddit and portrayed as something benign. But from its very foundation it is morally flawed. That is why debates with Zionists rarely find common ground: Zionism assumes that Jews have a special status and special rights that others, especially Palestinians, are denied. It turned a religious community into a people defined by ancestry, ironically echoing the logic of antisemites. This results in unequal rights, which is the essence of discrimination. True equality means giving the same rights to everyone regardless of origin, religion or appearance. Zionism does the opposite by granting Jews privileges that are not recognized in international law. Zionism claims Israel has a unique right to security and self defense. But every human being and every community has this right. Israel was established on the ruins of another state whose people also have the right to security. To justify this, Zionists invented the so called “right of a Jewish state to exist.” Yet such a right does not exist in international law. States simply exist or do not exist; only people have the inherent right to live and to be protected. Some may ask: why should Palestinians have a state but not Zionists? The answer is simple. Palestinians are the people born and living there. Their identity is not tied to religion a Palestinian can be Muslim, Christian or even Jewish. In contrast, a specifically Jewish state excludes everyone who is not Jewish. Creating Israel made Jews into a people with a state while turning Palestinians into a people without one. That is no solution, it is a new injustice. Jews are primarily a religious community, and no religion has the “right” to its own state. There is no state of Jehovah’s Witnesses either. Many other groups have also faced violence and genocide without being granted a state of their own – such as the Sinti and Roma under the Nazis. The real solution is not to carve out states for every group so they can discriminate in turn. The solution is to build a world where all people can live equally and safely regardless of their origin.",

The walls and checkpoints around Gaza and the West Bank are all dismantled within a month. Amnesty is given to all members of the IDF and terrorist groups. (incredibly unfair but you don't want people to become martyrs or start a potential civil war). Israel normalises relations with all countries (except North Korea) and a huge amount outpouring of international aid is used to fund social services within Israel. Everyone's taxes are cut while social spending increases (this arrangement only last a few years, taxes go up later). Arabic is upgraded to a state language. I'm not asking if this is a good or bad idea. But I'm wondering what would happen next and why you think that. I guess I'd also like to know two hypotheticals. What if this was done today, and what if this was done in say, 2018. Because obviously the population of Gaza is a massive variable that changes things. What happens to the more hardcore Zionist community? How many people leave? What happens to the remaining Islamic terrorist groups? How violent do things get? Does a further civil war break out? Can Israel retain its Jewish character? Side question: Is Benny Morris' Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist–Arab Conflict, 1881–1999 a good book to read on the conflict generally?

From my rather short research, I found that generally are considered very legit, without any prominent history of being tied or cooperating with Hamas. The creator of the fund, Steve Sosebee seems to be pushing a very anti-zionist (which very much just turnes into antisemitic) narrative, along with the fund itself completely demonizing Israel with a narrative like \"Israel invaded Gaza to kill anyone there without no reason\". In my short research, I found this link: https://ngo-monitor.org/ngos/palestine_children_s_relief_fund_ohio_/ It says there all the activities and fundraiser the PCRF has don't in all it's 35 years of activity. It says there \"PCRF does not report any donor information or sources of funding, reflecting a complete lack of transparency and accountability.\" Which is VERY shady. In addition, I've seen someone mention the don't do proper tax reports hiding information from the IRS, but I haven't checked that out. In oppose to what I said, I see a lot of people recommending only PCRF because of it's legitness, and the people who have donated say they always receive a receipt after the donate. With what's happening in Gaza you can never what organisation is truly real, and what organisation is just another undercover Hamas fund.

      "content_preview": "Judaism values life above everything. Everything. It’s encoded into every aspect of Judaism, it’s in the deepest parts of our religion, it’s entwined into every Jewish law and tradition and practice. One of our most famous founding myths is Abraham being tested by God, and he’s told to sacrifice his son Isaac to God. And Abraham is prepared to do it, but God tells him no. God tells him to sacrifice an animal instead. One of the foundations of the Jewish religion that separated it from other religions of that time and place was that it never required Jews to sacrifice people. Thousands of years ago in the Jewish Temple, Jews sacrificed animals and plants to God, while during the same time period around the world, other religions sacrificed people. Heck, the Mayans were still sacrificing people well into the 1600s. Serving false gods is one of the worst transgressions in Judaism, not because our God has a God complex, but in order to prevent us from practicing religions that sacrifice people. Life is prioritized above absolutely everything in the Torah. There are 613 commandments, and we are allowed to break every single one of them in order to save a life. (Yes, even to save a non-Jewish life.) Saving a single human life is akin to saving an entire world. Furthermore, it isn’t just about saving someone’s life. Treating people with compassion, loving others as you love yourself, is encoded into every aspect of Judaism too. According to Jewish belief, when you intentionally hurt another person, you can’t just pray to God and be forgiven. You have to make amends to that person, and then pray to God, in order to be forgiven. And this is all core Jewish belief and identity without even factoring in all the millennia of persecution, all the ways we chose life above all, over and over again, at any cost, by any means possible, because survival of the Jewish people was always the highest priority. Survival. Now, with this “Jewish POV” in mind, if you will, the Palestinian cause is utterly, certifiably insane from the Jewish perspective. The idea of putting real human lives on the line in the name of an ideology, or because of pride, is literally inconceivable. The only reason Jews fought for and continue to fight for the state of Israel was for our defense, for our survival because our goal is life above all. Palestinians did not have that same reasoning when fighting against the idea of a Jewish state, either then or now. They fought not for their survival, which they could’ve ensured by accepting their own state, but because they didn’t want a Jewish state to exist. The vast majority still don’t. You think Jews didn’t want the entire state of Palestine, including areas like Hebron, which had a continuous Jewish presence for millennia? Of course we did. But we were willing to give it up in order to save lives. We agreed to the partition plan in 1947 even though it robbed us of something we wanted, we accepted the bare minimum we could get, in order to save lives. Palestinians can end this entire conflict at literally any time they choose by agreeing to a proposal for a two state solution and forgoing the “right of return” that would demolish the Jewish state. No, they wouldn’t get everything they want. Yes, an injustice was still done to their people. But they would get to live. They repeatedly rejected proposals for two-state solutions that would’ve given them autonomy and freedom from oppression, and they chose to forgo these solutions because life is not their highest priority. Their highest priority is destroying the existence of a Jewish state, even at the cost of Palestinian lives . The most modern, forward-thinking Palestinians are still not free of this. Their vision is a democratic, secular, one-state solution, and it isn’t a new one. It was proposed by Arabs and rejected by Jews in 1947 because the Holocaust had proven that Jews needed sovereignty over themselves in order to ensure their survival. The Palestinian identity really suffers from being so new that it’s susceptible to weakness at its core. It hasn’t had time to build a strong enough identity of its own, a foundation separate from the Palestinian cause. Losing the state of Palestine from the river to the sea is not equal to losing the Palestinian people, but they act as if it is, because that original loss was one of the foundations of their identity. From the Jewish perspective, Palestinians need to reckon with their core beliefs. They need to reframe their ideology so that life is the ultimate resistance , and any solution that will provide them with better lives today is one they should be accepting with both hands outstretched. That’s what the Jewish people would do. That’s what we’ve already done.",

      "content_preview": "So… A lot of Pro-Pales believe in the Greater Israel Conspiracy Theory. My question is… What would Jews even do with the land? This is a mathematical question. There are approximately 7.73 million Jews in Israel, and Israel is approximately 22,072 sq. km. That’s about 351 Jews per sq km. (7.73 million Jews / 22,072 sq. km). Now, there are approximately 15.7 million Jews in the world. For the sake of this exercise, let’s assume that every Jew in the world would move to Greater Israel. The Greater Israel Conspiracy Theory would come out to about 2 million sq. km. Breaking that down, it would be about 8 Jews per sq. km. (15.7 million / 2 million sq. km.) That is approximately 44 times more sq. km. available per Jewish person. So, back to the original question of this post. What would Jews even do with the land of Greater Israel? Even if some of it would be devoted to farmland and cattle, not everyone living there would want to be a farmer or a rancher. I’m sure they could develop a few cities, but how would they fill them? In theory, I guess they could open up immigration and expand citizenship, but that would threaten the Jewish Majority mandate, so they could only accept so many non-Jewish immigrants. Not enough to fill the land. Even if they wanted to devote some of land as tourist destinations, they could renovate only so much of it that tourists would be drawn to before hitting diminishing returns. I guess I’m at a loss on the logistics of the conspiracy theory. Even if some fringe zealots believed in the Greater Israel project, I’m just not connecting the dots on how they would cultivate the land acquired if they were actually successful in their endeavor.",

On the other hand, I encounter claims that the United Nations itself is either failing or refusing to effectively distribute the aid that does arrive. Meanwhile, i have found plenty of video footage showing what appear to be hundreds of aid trucks loaded with food and supplies sitting rotting at the Gaza border crossings, waiting for clearance to move. I feel a sense of frustration and despair at the sheer opacity and cruelty of the situation. Gazans and hostages  are suffering and everyone is just pointing figures instead of doing something why, when the humanitarian need is so clear, is the delivery of aid so paralyzed? My own perspective has historically leaned toward supporting Israel. I have tried to ground that support in what seemed like logical reasoning. For example, when it comes to the Israeli military’s airstrikes or operations, I have felt that if evidence shows Hamas is deliberately using human shields—placing military assets in civilian neighborhoods, hospitals, or schools—then the moral responsibility for civilian deaths cannot fall solely on Israel. In such a case, Hamas’s actions would constitute a clear violation of international law, and tragically, civilians would bear the consequences. That does not make the deaths any less tragic or devastating, but it does create a framework in which accountability can be traced back to the choices of Hamas as a governing and militant force. Yet, even with that framework in mind, I find myself struggling deeply with the issue of the blockade and the humanitarian issues. Unlike airstrikes, which can at least be contextualized within military logic, a blockade that results in starvation, lack of medical supplies, and the collapse of basic infrastructure feels nearly impossible to defend. If people in Gaza are literally starving—and reports, photos, and testimonies suggest that some areas are reaching famine-like conditions—how can this strategy possibly help Israel achieve its stated objectives? Does it bring the hostages home? Does it meaningfully weaken Hamas? Or does it instead fuel resentment, radicalization, and despair among the civilian population, many of whom may already feel abandoned by the international community? If Hamas has shown repeatedly that it is willing to sacrifice civilians for political or military gain, then why would a blockade that punishes civilians make Hamas suddenly relent? The logic feels inconsistent, and my opinion in Israel’s approach starts to crumble when I consider this dimension. What makes this issue even more complex is the sheer difficulty of knowing who is truly to blame. I find myself asking: is the problem primarily with Israel, which has tight control over border crossings and approvals for what goes in and out of Gaza? Or is the problem with the United Nations and other international organizations, which may be overwhelmed by the logistics, security risks, or political obstacles associated with distributing aid within a war zone? Are there third-party actors—whether Egypt, local armed groups, or criminal networks—who are complicating the flow of aid further? Egypt could certainly have done more considering they control a border of Gaza. The result of all this uncertainty is a deeply unsatisfying cycle of accusations. Israel blames the UN for incompetence or for failing to prevent Hamas from seizing supplies. The UN blames Israel for not granting sufficient access, for bombings that damage infrastructure, or for setting impossible inspection requirements that delay trucks for days. Hamas, in turn, accuses Israel of deliberate cruelty, while Israel accuses Hamas of hoarding aid for fighters and using it as a tool of control over the civilian population. And for those of us watching from the outside, the effect is disorienting: it becomes almost impossible to discern what is propaganda, what is an exaggeration, and what is grounded in verifiable fact. One of the most frustrating images that circulates repeatedly online is that of long lines of trucks, sometimes hinders of trucks full of rotting food parked at Gaza’s border crossings, just sitting there going to waste. Gaza is visibly stocked with humanitarian aid. The images themselves raise more questions than they answer. If the aid exists and has reached the border, why does it not move? Why are civilians inside Gaza still going hungry when food is visibly within reach? Is it true that Israel is deliberately slowing the process through inspections and bureaucratic hurdles? Or is it true that the United Nations and its partner agencies lack the capacity to distribute it safely once inside, given the danger of airstrikes, collapsed roads, and the possibility of aid theft by armed groups? Or is the UN just flat out refusing to distribute aid because of a bias against israel? Or perhaps both things are true at once, with layers of dysfunction and obstruction compounding to create an almost unresolvable humanitarian issue. The human cost of this tragedy is staggering. Reports suggest that in parts of Gaza, families are surviving on one meal a day or less, that children are suffering from malnutrition, and that hospitals lack not only electricity but also the basic medical supplies needed for even routine care. Starvation is not a distant risk; it is a lived reality for many. When I consider this suffering, I feel increasingly disillusioned with the endless blame-shifting. Regardless of which party is technically more at fault, the undeniable reality is that civilians—ordinary people who neither planned this war nor have the power to end it—are paying the price. However , my mind will always still searches for accountability. I want to know who is truly responsible because responsibility suggests the possibility of remedy. If Israel’s policies are creating insurmountable barriers to aid, then international pressure on Israel might be the key. If the United Nations is faltering in its logistical or organizational responsibilities, then reforms or external partnerships might help, or protests aimed on the UN not Israel. If Hamas is indeed seizing aid and weaponizing starvation as a tool of control, then people need to blame Hamas and support Israel in their attempt to take them out. Without clarity, however, every call to action risks being misdirected. This brings me back to my original question: why is aid not reaching the people who need it, when we can literally see it sitting there? The lack of a clear answer is not just frustrating; it feels like part of the humanitarian crisis itself. The absence of a trusted, universally accepted source of truth means that aid becomes not only a matter of logistics but also a battlefield of narratives. Each side’s version of events serves its own political interests, and the truth—whatever it may be—remains obscured. I am left with the uncomfortable realization that in conflicts like this, information itself becomes weaponized. Propaganda is not just about shaping public opinion abroad; it directly impacts the flow of humanitarian relief. If one side can convince the world that the other is at fault, then pressure and accountability may shift accordingly. In the meantime, the people who suffer most are those who cannot control the narrative at all: the civilians inside Gaza who just want food, water, medicine, and safety for their families. And all the hostages still stuck in Gaza who are most likely starving as well. And have been away from home FOR YEARS! So I have continued to search, hoping for a definitive answer or a credible source that can and have been I’m able to find anything. Could someone please find a credible source that shows me what exactly is going on? And why on earth the food sitting in the border aren’t reaching the people that need it?",

Why did Hamas have to kill, rape, and take Israeli civilians hostage? Why didn't they go after only IDF members instead? This is what separates resistance from terrorism. If Hamas were truly a liberation movement, October 7th would've either never happened or only IDF soldiers and maybe some high-ranking politicians would've been killed or taken hostage, which would still be a world-shaking event in and of itself.",

In their latest propaganda video, he’s seen starved, shirtless, and forced to dig his own grave (yes, you read that right) deep inside a narrow terror tunnel. 🔗 [Recent Hamas propaganda video] At the end of the footage, Evyatar breaks down in despair, and I noticed a strange shape behind him. I took a screenshot, overexposed it, and from what I can tell, it appears to be another person. (Disclaimer: I can’t confirm this, but it’s worth noting.) 🔗 [Screenshot and close-up] The mother of hostage Guy Gilboa-Dalal, Evyatar’s childhood friend, has said she recognized her son in this same video. I believe she may have been referring to this frame. Evyatar and Guy were kidnapped together from the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023. In February 2025, Hamas staged one of their cruel hostage release “ceremonies,” driving the two men to the edge of freedom, making them believe they were about to be released. Instead, they were forced to sit in a car and watch other hostages be reunited with the International Committee of the Red Cross, just meters away... while they remained hidden. Then the car door was slammed shut in their faces. And they were driven back to hell. 🔗 [Video from the February 2025 incident] They have been rotting in Hamas tunnels ever since. There are still 50 hostages remaining in Gaza. Roughly half are said to be alive. You’re allowed to care. It’s okay to care about Israeli hostages.",

      "content_preview": "A little background about me is I’m mixed, my mother is Spanish with Sephardic Jewish ancestry, her family converted from Judaism and are Christians and have been for quite some time, my family are non-Zionists. I became aware of the conflict in 2021. When October 7th happened I learned even more & I’ve continued to learn more and more. I’m able to see past many talking points since I’m approaching with a neutral, nuanced perspective. After Oct 7th, Hamas took 240 hostages, with about 110-130 still alive, they’re believed to also be Hamas’s main bargaining chip, considering they’re isolated by most Arab governments 😟😟. So what if Hamas gives up the hostages, every last one? I don’t believe the war would all of a sudden halt. International pressure would be put on Israel to stop the war, but it wouldn’t stop. We know Netanyahu has incentive to keep the war going especially if he wants to hold onto that seat of PM. With Israel also being self sufficient on the US military industrial complex and it’s lobbying, would the military industrial complex allow for a slowdown of profit and cease to the simmer of conflicts? I don’t think so. Is Israel and Palestine locked into war forever due to forces bigger than the people? Maybe. Nevertheless what does the future have in store for the Israeli and Palestinian people, will we see another partition? Maybe one that’s not disgustingly insulting and predatory to the Palestinians to the point where the Arab league had to outright reject it? The Palestinians have lost the support of Jordanians after their bout with King Hussein, and the Lebanese aren’t too fond of them after their nation’s subsequent collapse. From Palestinians & Israelis only, what would you like to see?",

      "content_preview": "Shalom aleichem. I am not a Zionist but I am curious to learn more about Zionist perspectives. So here are several questions - I am not expecting someone to answer all of them (although that would be great!), even just one can lead to some interesting conversation. 1. Who are your favourite Zionist thinkers? In particular, I would be interested to know people's views of Haviv Rettig Gur and Benny Morris . But otherwise, who would be the best Zionist thinkers in your view? Both historical and present-day. Bonus question: What do you think about prominent Jewish anti-Zionists such as Noam Chomsky, Avi Shlaim and Ilan Pappe? (Hard mode: no mentioning the Faurisson thing, Cambodia, Bosnia or that Pappe apparently thinks it is okay to make up history - I've heard all these perspectives before). I'd also like to know where you stand on Gideon Levy (I am unsure if he is an anti-Zionist). 2. How would you rank Israeli PMs (excl Ben-Gurion)? I assume (like in Australia) that the PM is (on paper) the most powerful person in the country. I'm guessing Ben-Gurion is probably many people's favourites so I would like to know who else is the best in your view. In particular, I would like to know opinions about Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin, Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu, who seem to be the biggest figures around the current conflict. 3. Who is your favourite US President with respect to how they've treated Israel? This leaves you with Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush Jr, Obama, Trump 1, Biden and Trump 2. Since Johnson, all seem to have been generally pro-Israel (Truman obviously was the first person ever to recognise Israel, but him and Eisenhower both held an arms embargo on the country that Kennedy lifted - this is my understanding so please correct me if I'm wrong). I would be curious to know who is your favourite. Bonus question, what do you think specifically of Donald Trump? Who seems to be the most pro-Israel US President ever - recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, as well as working in the first offensive operation alongside the IDF (Iran). 4. What are some major political debates in Israel that aren't connected to things like war, ethnicity, religion and Palestine? (and where do you stand on them?) I know most people bring up a divide between religion/secularism, and mizrahim/ashkenazim. But I would like to know what the main debates are in terms of other social or economic policies are. I've heard Israel is struggling with a housing crisis and has a higher rate of poverty than you might expect. But maybe I am incorrect on that. 5. What is the fairest critique of Israel from the anti-Israel side? As you probably know, there's a lot of grievances people have with Israel. Most Zionists I've seen tend to argue these grievances are the product of some kind of necessity (ie blockading Gaza to stop Israeli civilians being killed) or that Israel is being uniquely singled out. But this makes me curious, what is the fairest/most reasonable critique from the anti-Israel? Bonus question: Which Palestinian political figure do you see as the most reasonable?",

      "content_preview": "This post is strictly about my experience and I am not making wide generalisations. I have been debating pro-Palestinian people since years now and I have noticed a pattern. A lot of people start with it, but most people i talk to will eventually revert to either/or: ad hominem attacks, selective outrage, emotive reasoning and a wide scale of logical fallacies when they cannot counter my arguments. This of course by its own is not unique to the conflict, people do frequently act like this on any given controversial topic. It is usually hard to process confrontation of one’s own beliefs but the question is, how people got to these beliefs in the first place. Is it because they care so much about Palestinians (when many could not name the river, nor the sea in between they’d like to see a free Palestine), or is it simply because they do not like Israel and it is now becoming increasingly politically correct to hate the Jewish state? The most frequent accusation I get is that is that either I do not care about the human suffering of Palestinian civilians or I want them to suffer. It is of course not the case, I keep telling these people: simply we maintain the view (due to the presence of empirical and historical evidence) that ending the war with Hamas remaining in power guarantees more, not less suffering in the future and not disposing of them and the ideology they represent is kicking the can down the road, given their firm stance on destroying Israel and their vow to repeat the 7th of October terror attack again and again. Now, of course, we may be wrong on this but no-one (in my personal experience) was even willing to seriously entertain this possibility on pro-Palestinian side. The above is just one example but the general pattern I am experiencing is that many of these people are irrational and emotional, utterly resilient to reasonable counter arguments and they refuse to change their views despite their evident cognitive dissonance. To me it seems their hatred towards Israel vastly overshadows their concern for the Palestinian people, instead they simply use their romanticised imagination of the “Palestinian cause” as a battering ram to bash Israel with. This of course has nothing to do with the assertion that legitimate criticisms of Israeli actions should not be allowed or to be deemed antisemitic. There is a difference however between legitimate criticism and smearing. It could be a legitimate criticism to say that Israel is not doing enough to prevent harm to infrastructure and civilians, or that they fail to appropriately prosecute individual instances of wrongdoings, even war crimes. It is legitimate to question their intentions when they are preventing international journalists to enter Gaza. Resolutely maintaining though that Israel is systematically and deliberately killing or causing the death of Palestinians as such (ie committing a genocide) despite the lack of conclusive evidence and the presence of substantive counter factuals is not legitimate criticism it is simply smearing.",

But at the same time, I also see that religious aspects seem to play a role: for example, Islamist movements like Hamas, or religious Zionism within Israel. So I'm wondering: To what extent is the conflict today shaped by religion (Islamism, religious Zionism, holy sites, etc.) compared to purely political or national issues? Has the influence of religion on both sides increased or decreased over the years? Are religious narratives a root cause, or are they more often used as tools within a primarily political conflict? I'd really appreciate perspectives or sources that could help me understand how important religion actually is in shaping this conflict today. Thanks in advance!",

People in the West like to think that everyone thinks and wants what they want: stable democracies, strong economies, safety and security for their citizens.  Unfortunately, this view is not shared with some groups in the Middle East such as the Palestinian leadership.  There are plenty of bad, selfish, corrupt governments in the world but none of them are as bad as the Palestinians which make it a specific goal to maximize their own peoples' deaths. As we all know (but some deny), Hamas as a deliberate strategy tries to maximize the Palestinian civilian death toll.  They don't fight in uniform, they hide behind civilians, they fight from hospitals and schools.  They proudly boast about using their people as human shields and tell their civilians to ignore IDF warnings about impending bombings.  They built underground tunnel network to protect Hamas fighters but not to protect their sisters/wives and babies. And most damning of all, they started October 7th terrorist attacks knowing Israel would respond, knowing many of their own Palestinian brothers and sisters/wives would get killed in the response.  Why would you start a war with a much more powerful army if you know this would lead to thousands of deaths?   Only because you are an evil motherf***er that hates Israel more than you love your own brothers and sisters/wives. Since Oct 7, Israel offered Hamas leadership the chance to exile themselves peacefully on condition Hamas surrenders and releases the hostages.  Hamas has rejected, knowing more and more of their own people would get killed the longer the war goes on.  Tens of thousands of Palestinian lives could have been saved if Hamas cared at all about their own people. Before someone calls me a Hasbara bot here are quotes from Palestinian leaders from their own mouths: Sinwar bragged about the high civilian death toll as a necessary sacrifice . Hamas spokesperson urges civilians to become meat shields Ismail Haniyeh: \"As I have said repeatedly, the blood of children, women, and the elderly should not make you cry out! Rather, we need this blood to awaken the revolution, to awaken stubbornness, to awaken and move forward.\" Hamas official Ghazi Hamad - \"We are proud to sacrifice martyrs,\" and vowing to repeat the October 7th attacks. Fathi Hammad MP \"...they have formed human shields of the women, the children, the elderly, and the mujahideen...\" Hamas Political Bureau Member Mousa Abu Marzouk: The Tunnels in Gaza Were Built to Protect Hamas Fighters, Not Civilians Full on detailed report used by NATO showing Hamas's systematic uses of human shields Israel tells Palestinians to evacuate areas before they are bombed.  Hamas tells them to stay. Palestinians Al Shifa hospital as a place to hold hostages, as a military HQ and weapons storage facility A doctor at Al-Shifa said the hospital staff were “suffering from fear and terror, particularly of the Hamas fighters, who are in every corner of the hospital.”  By 2014, the Al-Shifa had become a “ de-facto ” command center for Hamas. In 2014, the IDF said that Hamas had also turned Al-Wafa Hospital into a command center, rocket-launching site, and observation post. In November 2023, the IDF released footage of weapons and explosives stored at Rantisi Children’s Hospital. Does the UK, France, Spain, Sweden and other soon-to-be Muslim majority European countries think the Palestinians are ready for a state?  Palestinians have what seem to be the most irresponsible leadership in the world - one that is obsessed with hurting on both sides.  They don't seem to be interested in building a functioning Palestinian state. I hope for the Palestinian people they get better lives that look to build a future. It's a tragedy all the people that say they care about Palestinians not say a single word against the source of most of the suffering of the Palestinian people - their own leaders.   If pro Palis actually care about Palestinians they would demand Hamas be removed from power and be replaced with a peaceful government.

      "content_preview": "After reading this piece, I Don’t Want to Live Next to Jews I began to wonder why nobody talks about dhimmitude, the centuries when Jews and Christians lived under Islamic rule as religiously ordained second-class citizens. In the Ottoman Empire and earlier Islamic dynasties, non-Muslims were tolerated but placed under laws that kept them socially and politically inferior. They paid special taxes like the jizya, were restricted in what clothes they could wear, couldn’t ride horses, couldn’t build houses of worship higher than mosques, and were barred from testifying against Muslims in court. This wasn’t just “discrimination”; it was a formal caste system that lasted centuries . Fast-forward to today, and we constantly hear accusations that Israel practices “apartheid.” Yet even critics usually admit it’s only “apartheid-like,” because Israel has no laws creating a permanent legal caste system. By contrast, dhimmitude was precisely that: centuries of codified inequality written directly into Islamic law. If Jews were treated as legally inferior for generations, is it really surprising that many Arabs and Palestinians reacted with fury when Jews threw off those restrictions, rose out of second-class status, and founded a sovereign state? For them, the shift was not just political, it overturned an entire worldview. And if they still see Jews as inferiors who are rising above their stations, wouldn’t the continued violence make sense? Look at racism in the U.S. We hear endlessly about “76 years” of mistreatment since 1948. But why is there silence about the centuries of institutionalized discrimination that came before? If history matters, then all of it matters, not only the selective parts that can be weaponized against Israel. If people are content to suggest the oppressed can rise up, then what happens if, after 76 years, the oppressed are stronger than their oppressors? People disingenuously try to simplify it into oppressor and oppressed, but it doesn’t fit or make sense.",

It draws a comparison between how Palestinians talk about the Nakba and how some Southerners in the U.S. talk about the Civil War when they call it the “War of Northern Aggression.” Sure, it’s not a perfect analogy, but the similarities are actually really striking. In both cases, the losing side went to war not because they were defending themselves from unprovoked attack, but because they couldn’t tolerate the idea of another group living free, whether that group was Jews in their own state or enslaved people freed from bondage. Both fought really hard to preserve systems that kept another group under their control, and both lost. After the defeat, each side rewrote the story to cast themselves as the true victims by naming the conflict in a way that wrapped that victimhood into a permanent badge of identity. The article goes into detail about how, in 1947, the Arab leadership rejected the UN partition plan, launched attacks on Jewish communities, and invited multiple Arab armies to try to wipe out the newly declared State of Israel. That war, which they initiated, led directly to the Palestinian refugee crisis. But over time, the fact that the disaster was self inflicted has been erased from the popular narrative, replaced with a one-sided account that leaves out Arab culpability entirely, much like the “Lost Cause” version of Civil War history completely leaves out the Confederacy’s role in starting the fight.",

I'm doing my best to stay educated and open-minded about both sides of the conflict. As an ethnic Jew with family in Israel, I acknowledge that I may give Israel the benefit of the doubt more than I should, but I try really hard to consider multiple sources and question my own conclusions. So as I dove deeper into why Palestinians were starving, what was happening to the aid, at first I thought Hamas was interfering with supply drops to make Israel look bad, and that they were using fear to force compliance among their people. https://app.un2720.org/tracking Then I learned more about GHF, an American-led agency whose supply drop operations have continuously resulted in escalations of violence and dozens of Palestinian deaths - they supposedly put the food in dangerous zones that they've previously told Gazans are off limits, make them hike miles to get there and back without getting robbed along the way, then when they start lining up just before dawn the bullets start flying because the zone isn't supposed to open for another ten minutes. Its like those American cops that give conflicting / impossible instructions then arrest or shoot you for not complying, it's terrible. So from THAT info, I start drawing conclusions the US and Israel ARE manufacturing scenarios in Gaza that are criminally negligent at best and genocidal at worst. Even pro-Israel reporting acknowledges that, \"The issue of Palestinians attempting to reach sites before opening hours was apparently a factor in repeated deadly incidents in the first several weeks of the GHF’s rollout in which Israeli troops were accused of firing at aid seekers showing up at the wrong time.\" And these are the same deadly incidents that Israel explicitly claimed at the time did not occur. So I'm not walking any of that back - I want free flowing food to any and all hungry Gazans and Netanyahu behind bars - but all these stories about faked hunger photos have me confused again. If the starvation is real, why do they keep publishing and promoting misleading photos? Why are so many news agencies okay with posting photos without fact-checking them? And why don't agencies like NYTimes issue retractions when they misrepresent a child with cystic fibrosis as starving? Why do they need to line up children with bowls and pretend it's a food drop if the real food situation is so dire? I'm frustrated that the media is making it so hard to understand the truth here. I would love to see more sources and hear more perspectives from non-extremists about the realities of the hunger situation. If you opened this post with rage because you've already decided your truth and are offended by those still asking questions, this conversation isn't for you, please and thank you.",

Both Israel and Pakistan were organised as religious ethnostates and its identity is religious nationalism ( it was wrong but it happened), both are the cause of irresponsible policies by the British and both resulted in population exchanges ( Hindus fled Pakistan , Palestinians fled Israel )  Mizrahi Jews and Indian Muslims also settled in Pakistan and Israel. Although India’s partition was way more brutal , these scenarios are comparable so why can’t Israel exist alongside a Palestinian state? Why must it be dismantled ? Why is it never brought up that minorities in Pakistan have almost disappeared in one generation .. Why are there double standards ? Selective activism isn’t activism anymore , it’s sectarianism. As a liberal , I want to trigger a sustainable peace process .. I want people to thrive but it won’t come with a one sided narrative and double standards. Indigenous communities like Druze , Yazidis, Christians , Jews have every right to live in the Middle East and they should have every right to express their identity.

I will translate the main title for the non Hebrew speakers. \"The terrorists camera in Naser Hospital that threatened the forces Security personal have confirmed that the attack, that caused outrage in the world was aimed at a man who watched the IDF movement for several days, an Israeli civilian used surveillance tools and revealed a camera that was hidden in the hospital and recorded the IDF on the street. At the following exclusive images the camera is concelead with a towel - and near the camera, the suspect terrorist that operated it. The IDF have followed the camera for days and decided it's a threat so they decided to strike\". If this wasn't a mainstream Israel media, the largest mainstream Israeli media I wouldn't believe this story, I would think it's fake news, and badly written one. Because I wouldn't believe the IDF would BOMB A HOSPITAL BECAUSE A CAMERA WAS POINTED AT THE PUBLIC STREET! Now the worst part of it, you would think this article actually criticize the decision, but no, it's actually defending it. The whole following article goes on to justify it, and try to emphasize just how big of a threat this camera was. I think it just goes to show you that Israel media will defend ANYTHING that the IDF will do, even when journalists are being killed, while every other journalist associations is in shock and grief about it, the Israeli ones are not. And when the media so easily defend it, of course the public will defend everything too. It's a sad reality that hard to understand happening in a democratic country, and at this point feels like state media. By the way, an important context to it is that channel 12, that posted this article, are considered by Bibi and his party as a leftist channel that they warn their political base not to watch because it's leftist propaganda. This is the Israeli \"left\". Edit: Just to clarify I want to ask all those who justify it, if one Israeli hostage was killed by this operation would you stay say it's the right call, or there you would suggest the IDF could maybe eliminate a camera with a different method that wouldn't kill that hostage along the way?",

      "content_preview": "Accidentally shelling a hospital twice with one of the most advanced tanks in the world the Merkava MK 4, an MBT with an advanced targeting system consisting of high resolution cameras is in fact impossible and is a war crime. Targeting a journalist who is allegedly tracking IDF movements with his camera from a hospital and then shooting that hospital with a bigass 120 mm tank shell to take him out, is in fact a war crime. Even if there was a journalist scouting for Hamas from a hospital, THAT DOES NOT MAKE THE HOSPITAL A LEGITIMATE MILITARY TARGET. All of you who believe it does need to get a clue and understand the law of proportionality that is the main determining factor in regards to the legitimacy of striking civilian targets. Targeting an alleged scout and killing 21 other people in the process, including medical personnel and journalists is never proportional. Normal sane people would simply go and apprehend the guy and confirm if he was an actual scout and then lock him up. To shoot the hospital with a tank instead is morbidly sadistic. Next, waiting for emergency personnel and journalists to arrive at the scene of a strike and then shelling the same spot again to inflict maximum casualties, the so called \"double tap\" is in fact a blatant war crime and has seemingly become standard protocol in the IDF as the same tactic has been used repeatedly. Claiming this was accidental and that press and emergency personnel were not deliberately targeted is also objectively an absolute impossibility given the bright blue vests and helmets marked with the word PRESS that journalists wear and the standard florescent vests that emergency personnel also don. To blatantly lie and claim as much is insulting and also morbidly sadistic. At this point, it is clear that the IDF has decided that killing journalists and preventing the damage that they could potentially do by documenting their actions in Gaza and preventing Gazans from receiving medical assistance at hospitals is worth the condemnation that they will endure from striking hospitals and deliberately killing journalists...which again are war crimes.",

      "content_preview": "If you are truly pro-Palestinian, meaning you support Palestinian self-determination, and you are not merely pro the Palestinian “cause”, which has been hijacked by outsiders to destroy Israel, you would drop the colonizer narrative, effective immediately, as all it does is delay the possibility of a peaceful future between Israelis and Palestinians. From the beginning, the Arabs of Palestine viewed Jews as outsiders and as colonizers, and wanted to oust them. More recently, pro-Palestinians have been referring to Zionism as a “settler-colonial” movement, which is perhaps more technically accurate (only because decolonization from the diaspora is a brand new concept). However, for the purposes of this argument, let’s roll with the settler-colonial definition. Let’s say that Jews are to all intents and purposes, settler colonialists in the region, and then let’s explain why resistance in the form of terrorism is futile. When a colonizer brings people into a new region, it’s generally for purposes of profit - they want land or resources. When the natives of this region fight back, the colonizer’s military can fight them. However, when the natives turn to terrorism, the cost suddenly becomes too high for the colonizer. The death of their civilians is too high a price to pay for resources. Eventually, the civilian settlers choose to leave, and the colonizer pulls out of the region, taking their civilians and their army back home to their native country. Terrorism is horrific, but it has historically worked against colonizers, who will retreat when the price of staying becomes too high. When settler-colonialists come to a new region, they are not coming to acquire land or resources for a foreign power. They are coming to settle the land, because they are leaving a place that they have no desire or ability to return to. When natives fight against settler-colonialists, using the same strategy (terrorism) that they used to fight colonizers, this strategy will be ineffective because the settler-colonists have nowhere to go back to and nothing to lose. When we bring Israel into this example, the difference becomes even more stark because it’s amplified by Jews fighting for their homeland and safe haven. I cannot stress this enough: the price will never be too high. Israelis will keep fighting down to the very last man if they have to. Palestinians really need to realize this and accept this. Israelis aren’t going anywhere, and no amount of terrorism-as-resistance will convince them to, because they aren’t colonizers. Yes, you can keep calling them settler-colonizers, but really internalize what that means. It means they will never leave, both because they don’t want to, and because they have nowhere to go. They are there to stay , and peace treaties are the only way forward. To every pro-Palestinian who promotes the colonial narrative, you are personally culpable for every individual Palestinian that dies as a result of this twisted, mistaken narrative, which has served only to alienate Israelis and Palestinians further and further from each other. To everyone who supports terrorism as resistance (putting aside the egregious humanitarian failure) just think about it in the logical terms I’ve laid out. Terrorism will never work against settler-colonialism, because it relies on making the cost of staying too high, and the cost will never be too high for settler-colonizers, who have nothing left to lose and nowhere to go.",

      "content_preview": "I watched the October 7 documentary and couldn’t sleep for three nights. And yet if someone came up to me and asked “Do you condemn it?’ I’d probably roll my eyes. Because the question itself is insulting. It forces us to argue over something that should be obvious: killing civilians is wrong. It’s like a neighbor asking, ‘Do you condemn murder?’ The fact they even ask means they suspect you don’t. And the moment you start rushing to say, ‘Yes, yes of course I do,’ you’ve already accepted their suspicion as valid. I think that’s why so many are defiant. Better to refuse the theater than play a game that’s rigged. But if we’re serious, the better questions are How did this happen? Who failed in their responsibility? How do we make sure it doesn’t happen again? Nobody actually wants those answers. Because the point isn’t to fix anything, it’s to distract. The uncomfortable truth is we’ve mastered distraction too. Reporters dodge with the question and we dodge with the answer. It’s so much easier to call out Israeli hypocrisy than to admit we don’t hold our own leadership accountable. We’d rather look away from the fact that we’ve failed the very standards we demand of others. And if all this ends with us swapping one cruel regime for another then we haven’t built freedom. We’ve just built another cage, this time with Arabic calligraphy carved on the door",

Im pro Palestine but im tired of being treated like crap even if im on your side because i live here,every day on the internet i genuinely feel like i want to just support Israel so im at least not hated by my own side (i never actually will but yeah)",

Here's a summary: A coordinated campaign led by around 40 Wikipedia editors has worked to delegitimize Israel, present radical Islamist groups in a favorable light, and position fringe academic views on the Israel-Palestine conflict as mainstream over past years, intensifying after the October 7 attack ﻿﻿Six weeks after October 7, one of these editors successfully removed mention of Hamas' 1988 charter, which calls for the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel, from the article on Hamas ﻿﻿The group also appeared to attempt to promote the interests of the Iranian government across a number of articles, including deleting \"huge amounts of documented human rights crimes by [Islamic Republic Party] officials\" ﻿﻿A group called Tech For Palestine launched a separate but complementary campaign after October 7, which violated Wikipedia policies by coordinating to edit Israel-Palestine articles on the group 8,000 member Discord Tech For Palestine abandoned its efforts and its members went into a panic after a blog discovered what they were doing; the group deleted all its Wiki Talk pages and Sandboxes they had been using to coordinate their editing efforts, and the main editor deleted all her chats from the group's Discord channel After Rindsberg's article was published, Wikipedia's top adjudication body took action against some of the editors in the network. I think it was a promising first step, but there's still much more work to be done to fix the problem. If you have any thoughts on the article or possible solutions to this problem, please share them in the comments.",
