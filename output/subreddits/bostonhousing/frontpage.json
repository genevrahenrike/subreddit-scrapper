I had signed the lease along with two of my friends, but later needed to transfer it to another friend as I got a job outside of Boston. This was conveyed to the landlord, but he refused, mentioning that he is already in a dispute with the listing agent and brokers. Since then, he has completely stopped responding, including about the key collection and move-in process, which should have been completed before September 1st. We have already paid the first and last month’s rent, security deposit, and broker fees, (around $3000 per person) but we still have not received access to the apartment. The brokers and listing agents have also backed out, saying they will not be involved further due to their conflict with the landlord. At this point, we do not wish to sublease and instead want to terminate the lease. However, the landlord, who has a difficult history and resides in Texas, is unreachable, making it hard for us to take legal action directly. Could you please suggest if there are any legal steps we can take, or if you know of any contacts/resources that might be able to help us? We need legal help!!",

However our landlord just informed me he hasn’t paid rent in several months and he has till September 1 to pay in order to sign again. If he doesn’t pay and I sign a new lease with the landlord, without him on it, can I legally change the locks and move his stuff out to storage without eviction? He also owes me money and I just want him out of my life with the least amount of headache for me.",

      "content_preview": "The new brokers fee laws are really throwing me for a loop as I’m trying to apartment hunt for the first time. Every time I message a realtor about a property they say “That’s not available but let me send you other options!” Is this how they’re getting around the broker’s fee laws?? Would that count as me hiring them if they show me other properties? I straight up asked one of them if I would have to pay a broker’s fee and he said that the laws weren’t clear enough and most landlords won’t pay the broker’s fee still. He said that they somehow list them on an “open market” or something and so they don’t hire the broker? IDK if any realtors can explain better I would appreciate that. TLDR: Should I shut down conversations with brokers who try to show me multiple properties? What can I do if the realtor says that I would have to pay the broker fee on an apartment I really love?",

      "content_preview": "Hi Everyone! I'm a male professional in my early 30s who works from home full-time in the healthcare space and is looking to live with roommates who are intentional about creating a home environment that is open, warm, inviting, and peaceful. My preferred areas are Brookline (Coolidge Corner / Fenway), Brighton, or Lower Allston, but can be flexible! My preference is to move into a vacant room instead of apartment hunting with someone to ease logistics on my end. At this point, I would consider either a September or October move-in. Please see below for more information about me and what I am looking for in a roommate, as well as other preferences of mine. More About Me / What I Am Looking For: After living alone for a few years, I decided that I wanted to live with other people again, and not for budgetary reasons alone! In essence, I am hoping to live with other people who are interested in a co-living arrangement that is motivated beyond it just being a way to split rent. It would be great to live with others who are also intentional about cultivating an atmosphere at home that feels open, warm, welcoming, and peaceful. Ideally, I would like to have a dynamic where we see each other as friends to some degree and can enjoy each other’s company, even though I also very much respect and value alone time and the need to recharge and have privacy. Roommate Qualities: By extension of the above, I am looking to live with those who are kind, warm, friendly, emotionally aware, and can express their feelings and needs openly and respectfully. This is also how I would largely describe myself as well 😊 Because I prioritize having some level of routine and structure in my everyday life, I’d also appreciate living with people who generally have stable rhythms and tend to be even keeled. I do not smoke, vape, or drink regularly, so my preference is to live with people who follow a similar lifestyle. I would prefer to be in a pet-free unit. My Interests / Hobbies: Since I WFH, I do try to be outside at some point on weekday evenings and on weekends to get out of the house and be around people and community. I regularly attend yoga and tai chi classes, as well as other groups and activities that have aided me in my personal / spiritual growth journey. I also enjoy watching documentaries and movies that make you think, going out with friends to dinner, movies, and comedy shows, meeting new interesting people, and taking walks and hikes. I really value having meaningful conversations with people, whether it’s about current events or topics related to spirituality, self-healing, and personal growth. Preferred Area: Brookline, Brighton, Lower Allston (anything closer to Coolidge Corner is ideal) Other Areas in Consideration: Cambridge (Central, Harvard, Porter Sq), Somerville (Davis Sq), Jamaica Plain, Downtown Boston Preferred Number of Roommates (in addition to me): 1-2 Preferred Age Range of Roommates: Late 20s, 30s, 40s Other Apartment Specs : Reasonably sized kitchen; reasonably sized bedroom for me to fit my desk since I WFH or a separate space for an office setup Max Budget: $2,200 Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you feel like this may be a good fit based on what you have read! Thank you 😊",

      "content_preview": "I've posted before but my husband and I lost our jobs unexpectedly and had to move out of Boston. We gave 30 days notice, but our apartment complex, which has been terrible to deal with since day 1 (YAY EQUITY APARTMENTS!) is assessing us an \"insufficient notice\" fee because our lease says we need to give 60 days notice. I want to be clear that our lease was up August 10th and we fulfilled our entire lease, we just did not tell them we were not renewing until late June. They are now keeping our entire security deposit saying it is going towards the \"insufficient notice\" rent plus an extra $2000 charge. We moved out early and left the place in perfect condition and even said we could let someone move in early if it would help. We have no idea if they even attempted to rent the place-- they said they would not charge us the month if they found someone to take the place. They also marked the floors as \"dirty\" in our move-out report even though we had the place cleaned professionally, which... whatever I guess. My question is-- can they keep our security deposit on this basis? Do we have any grounds to fight this or am I screwed? Also, I posted this in a previous post, but the understanding was that we were NOT allowed to live there for an extra month unless we paid an extra $2000 per month. So the \"insufficient notice\" rent is not for us to actually live there, which I've never heard of. If you ever decide to live at Lofts at Kendall Square, the space is gorgeous, but it is a completely corporate entity that if you both lose your job, basically tells you to fuck off. They told us we were \"UNETHICAL\" for even asking for an exception (exact quote) to the notice period. We paid rent on time every month for two years straight with no issues and are quiet, clean tenants. The elevator was often broken, a fire alarm went off in the lobby for the full 48-70 hours every weekend for the entire year we lived there (it eventually seemed to get fixed. By the way, the fire department eventually stopped coming because of the false alarms every weekend... felt real safe about that!) Something was wrong with the plumbing in my bathroom from the first day we moved in and I asked them to fix it a million times (my toilet wouldn't flush, and the shower wouldn't drain so it would just collect 6 inches of disgusting still water) and they eventually told me \"that's how it's going to be.\" The heat in my room was out for a YEAR and the maintenance crew kept telling me nothing was wrong, until finally the second winter we lived there and it got cold again with no heat, I insisted they look at it and they admitted the entire unit needed to be replaced and didn't work. One day we came home to water pouring through the ceiling. We notified the office and they did nothing. When it happened again, they came by and said, \"Well, it's not happening right now, is it?\" and we were like \"No, but what if it keeps happening???\" and they said \"There's nothing we can do about it, it's not a problem unless it's consistent.\" We also came home to a layer of plaster/dust covering all of our belongings, and our two dogs were home, breathing that shit in the entire day. We asked the office wtf was going on and they didn't apologize and just said there was construction going on upstairs. There's more but I don't want this post to be a million pages long. I've lived in a lot of apartments including some pretty shitty ones but at least if things went wrong, someone would come by and try to make it right. Anyway, that was me just getting that off my chest-- obviously it's not relevant but it really is insult to injury to then have them keep our security deposit AND charge us on top of it. This subreddit has been very knowledgeable and helpful so if anyone has advice or if I'm shit out of luck, at least I'll know it.",
