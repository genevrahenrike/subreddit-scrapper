      "content_preview": "Hello ~ I’m an INFP and have been together with my ENTP for many years, we have a great relationship— however, I’ve noticed that my bf has been retreating into his shell a lot more, acting more distant and reserved. I worry that this is my fault as a few years ago I was in a pretty bad spot and unable to leave the house or do anything really, which he recently brought up made him nervous to go out with me since he associates it with having a bad time… I think it’s also made him more cautious around me, he quickly pulls away if I get moody or sad whereas he used to be more playful and engage. When we first met, one of the big things that made me fall in love with him was that I felt he saw through my shy and passive act and really encouraged me to be more open, and from this we had lots of fun and adventures. He would always push and banter and I loved it. I want to bring this playfulness and life back into our relationship, and think I need to take initiative to make him feel more comfortable again… If any ENTPs here have been in this kind of situation where you’ve retreated and become more detached, please let me know why and what I can do that would help! So far I’m thinking of trying to be more spontaneous, surprise dates, game nights that allow him to debate and challenge, going out for social events, etc. That’s another thing—for many years we’ve been isolated, and while I had my tough time, so did he as he was under a lot of stress and without much social contact, which he still now hesitates to seek out but I think looking for friends or doing more social activities would be good for him, it’s always brought him so much joy in the past so I’m trying to go to meetups and build a friends group I can hopefully bring him along to… I appreciate any advice and ideas, thank you!! And it it helps for types, I’m INFP 4w5, he’s an ENTP 8w7",

      "content_preview": "I rarely fall in love, but when I do… it’s with an ENTP, and this has lasted for years. At first we were just social media mutuals and now we’re friends. So lately he often replies to my posts, asks where I was, even gets awkward (avoiding eye contact, a bit nervous) whenever we meet. But when I replied straightforwardly, he’d be like “Nothing, just asking.” Over time, I noticed he does care but in a very ENTP way (I think? Haha) like teasing, sarcastic, sometimes even a bit harsh. He has sharp intuition like for example after he met my friend (whom I thought was just platonic) for the first time, he whispered to me “he has special feelings for you”, and it turned out to be correct. Also, I told him that I was close to someone (without telling bad things about him), but this ENTP guy responded “ah you’re being fooled, go find another guy.” What confuses me more is… he’s actually very easygoing with other women. He has female friends and seems comfortable around them, but with me, he gets awkward and sometimes even avoids eye contact. (Haha yeah yeah I am full of myself) We’ve been circling around each other for 2 years now. Sometimes he feels warm and attentive, other times distant or joking things off. Meanwhile, I can’t shake off this intuition that he’s… special. So, ENTPs… why do you act like this when you actually care? Is it nervousness, testing, or just your way of showing affection? And above all, does this ENTP really like me?",

      "content_preview": "I’ve lately realised that even though we’re meant to be a percent match with say INFJs and defintely are supposed to find more comfort in other Fe people - I honestly can’t deal with most of them. Especially Fe dominants like ENFJ and INFJ, I’ve just realised that they are great but literally are so sensitive to everything, especially criticism. They can never just say I’m sorry, I messed up, without wanting you to take 50% of the blame, abusing their inferior Ti to debate syntax and semantics instead of just admitting to being wrong. A lot of them have massive ego issues and are ruled by their emotions. And ENTPs, as soon as they developed and matured and have a grip on their Fe, actually develop past them. The older they get, I most ENTPs I’ve met have no problem just saying: yah sorry I’ve messed up, I didn’t show up, etc… I much prefer T people these days OR introverted Feelers, because they’re usually aware of being inconsistent in their behaviour and can actually handle themselves and apologising. Te dominant or inferior also are much more consistent in work setting etc. The most manipulative people I’ve met were unhealthy ENFJs, although I believe most ENFJs, even healthy ones, have nasty tendencies to gaslight, manipulate and playing the victim. They remind me of little children. Pick me. They want to be babied and be seen as babies, but are SO greedy for validation. Like Lena Dunham in girls.",

I love how vibrant and endless his thoughts are and he certainly matches well with my intellectual curiosity. Thing is I've been thinking a lot about how well we could jive based on our functions. Now I know MBTIs are just a guide on how the relationship could go based on how we perceive the world and interact with it but I was just wondering what it could be like from an ENTP M x INTJ F combination. I've read that it's more common to have it reversed in genders so most of the annotations I've come across are ENTP F x INTJ Ms. If you've been in a romantic relationship with an INTJ, what was it like? What did you enjoy most & least? EDIT: I also want to ask the general consensus of ENTPs (especially males), how are most of you when it comes to a more aloof passive female in a relationship? I've noticed that most males (even regardless of MBTI, I guess), enjoy getting doted on by their female partners. I'm not trying to stereotype INTJs but I have that tendency to not be very vocal or active about expressing things directly. I try as I work on becoming a more healthy social being but my default is just that.",

      "content_preview": "I’m interested to know what MBTIs your parents have/had, (or your best guess on their typings) how this impacted you and what the dynamics of your childhood and current relationship with them is like. My mum is ESTJ and dad ENTJ, both quite unhealthy varieties of their respective types. It was quite difficult growing up with two maladjusted parents leading with Te. Their own relationship was terrible though they never divorced. My dad was a tyrant who tried to mould me into a miniature version of himself. He was also very religious and a bigot and attempted to impose these values on me, which made me fight against him and rebel all the harder. He was very intimidating so I would only push so far, but as a child/teen I took delight in tearing down his dogma and hypocrisy. My mum’s control manifested as emotional abuse and coercion, but she has never been as intimidating as my dad and doesn’t have his gravitas. I think she carries a lot of trauma herself and didn’t know how to handle a kid with his own opinions and identity separate from her. She is still alive and we’ve always had a fractious relationship. She respects my forthrightness but also is so emotionally fragile that she can’t handle it. I try to humor her (which my INFP brother does very well), but I just don’t have it in me. I maintain a relationship with her, however dysfunctional, though it would be easier not to. Overall, I think growing up in this environment reinforced core ENTP attributes: my desire for autonomy and antipathy toward arbitrary rules and enforced structure and hierarchy. It underlines my desire to challenge and question everything, though I’ve learned to do it in a more constructive way the older I get. Less helpfully it has made me almost allergic to any structure or practical/domestic matters that always felt imposed upon me. I have very weak Si; though I understand the benefits of routine, I can’t translate that into practice and need that from xxFJs who can offer it in a collaborative, gentle manner. In other words, I’m still rebelling!",

In general, I’d say I’m the opposite of someone who just follows the crowd. Still, since my Fi is relatively low, I started wondering if maybe my upbringing or society made me unconsciously adopt certain ideas. When I first realized that I wasn’t fully in tune with my feelings, I began questioning whether what I experience is truly my own, or just an expression of my Fe. So the real question is: do I act because I believe something is genuinely good, or because I think I’m supposed to believe it’s good?",

      "content_preview": "I’m a female ENTP, and I’m curious to see what you guys have noticed about the other MBTI types. I’ve met a few different types, and have seen a pattern in people who have the same type. Here’s my observations so far; good and bad: INTJ - they think they’re the most aware people in the room to the point they think it’s impossible that anyone could see through them. It’s a paradox because they also seem to resent the fact that they’re misunderstood or seen as cold, yet they know exactly why that is. They are exceptionally emotionally awkward but the times I’ve been on the receiving end of them trying to show their ‘care’, it was deeply meaningful to me despite how ‘weird’ and unorthodox it is for them/to others. They also seem completely unaware of how impactful they can be. Regardless, one of my favorite types to ‘rage bait’. ISTP - somehow a ‘no bullshit’ type of person who will rarely ever say it. They are exceptionally observational but keep it to themselves. They have the best comebacks when I try to mess with them. One of my favorite types to rant to because they already know exactly what I’m talking about; they just haven’t said anything about it yet. I do think they need to speak up a bit more especially if they know there is an injustice happening. ISTJ - the only personality type I’ve ever fully 100% trusted, which I think has to do with how stubborn yet loyal they are. It’s a personal paradox for me because this is the only type of person who gets to see the ‘real’ me to the point they don’t believe the ‘goofy, snarky debater’ side exists as strongly as it does. They are very strong people but are willfully ignorant to how negative their judgmental side can be because they don’t care. There is no changing their mind. I’d say this type is very under appreciated. INFJ - overall, just… strange in a good way. The most privately emotional people I’ve ever met. If you see one flare of an emotion, they will disappear for a while. They’re also not as nice as they think they are; that ‘J’ is there for a reason. Their facial expressions are exceptionally obvious and they simply can’t believe how you ‘just knew’ what they were thinking. I do enjoy their fun and humorous side when it shows. ESTP - all they want to do is have a good time but can’t seem to recognize when it’s time to walk away, so then everyone’s going to have a bad time. Fun person to laugh with, not the type of person to talk about your problems with. The ones I’ve met are quick to explode in anger as well. ESTJ - They’re your best friend as long as you agree with them. Very funny, fun to banter with, but if you’re close with one — they will break your heart themselves as a way to ‘protect’ you if they think you’re being delusional or caring too much. They will hold onto a grudge forever but act like they don’t care. Their inability to analyze their emotions or process them sets them back. ENFP - I honestly could not say a single negative thing about these people. I do think that they should be more careful with what they say around who because sometimes, it can be perceived as ‘talking shit’ and cause issues that an ENFP isn’t equipped to handle. Along that line, almost impossible to silently communicate with — especially if you’re trying to tell them ‘stop talking’ — because they’ll straight up say, “what? Why are you doing that?” I also have noticed ENFP’s come off as not being that bright but the ones I’ve met are pretty smart about whatever they’re passionate with. ENFJ - aka the “INTJ” cosplayer. I mean no hate to ENFJ’s, but I’ve met enough and gotten close with a few and they share a very similar pattern of behavior that cannot be ignored. Even the ‘healthiest’ ENFJ I’ve met became an absolute train wreck once they were emotionally compromised; completely reckless, self destructive, and obsessive over the most simplest of issues because they have zero patience as well. For people who have the ‘intuitive’ trait, they absolutely do not trust it which causes them to spiral. I deeply loved the ENFJ’s in my past and a part of my life now, but they really can be exhausting. ENTP - the absolute worst. For real though, I do think we can take it too far sometimes to where it does negatively affect us. Personally, I’m apparently emotionally intelligent but emotionally unavailable which can cause intimacy issues. I also need to learn when to just let go and stop trying to understand everything. Also, since I have trouble showing my emotional depth — if I ever do so, I’m not taken seriously a majority of the time. Those are just my opinions on the MBTI types I’ve been able to experience in depth. What do you guys think? Agree or disagree?",

      "content_preview": "I've been content with being typed as an ENTP for 2 years now, but there's always been this sense of uncertainty on whether I am a \"Thinker\" or \"Feeler\". I've done research, and honestly, I've only become more unsure on which one I am. One of the most basic ways to know if you are a \"Thinker\" or \"Feeler\" is based on how you make decision. \"Thinkers\" generally choose what the most logical and beneficial choice is, while \"Feelers\" choose what aligns with their personal values. And honestly, I see myself as a mix of both. When making a decision, I always think of what the best option would be first. I always wheigh the pros and cons of each option, and think of possible outcomes if I were to choose them. And although I always end up knowing which option is best , it's not always the option I choose. There are times where I choose the option I want rather than the option I know is correct. Of course, I'm fully aware of the consequences of what option I end up choosing, I always find a way to rationalize why I end up choosing the \"incorrect\" option. (Even though I'm fully aware that I'm only choosing it cause it's the option I know will satisfy me.) So, while I certainly think like a \"Thinker\", in the end, there are still times I choose like a \"Feeler\". Honestly, I just really want some help in clarifying on whether I am an ENTP or an ENFP.",

I'll be energetic and motivated to connect with people, studying or planning things in my life, the next week you'll find me drained and not wanna respond to texts/ not having the energy to study and not doing anything except to doomscroll which worsen that guilt feeling. Going in these cycles made all my friendships being not close, I'm single for 3 yrs, and I can't progress in my career/studies because I'm not consistent. I've learned that this is a behavioral pattern and i have to break it by being consistent a bit by bit but when I'm low i just can't help it.

A month ago I was talking to this one friend who's also into working out, we started talking about our schedules and he was asking me why did I prefer doing south-jamaican super pec extensions rather than a normal bench press and I legit had no clue why, so I had to agree with him and do my reserach all over again when I got home Am I the only one?",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys my entire life I’ve been sure I’m an ENTP. I’ve read tons about ENTPs, cognitive functions, the whole thing, and I really identified with it. But recently I started questioning myself... what if I’m actually a mistyped INFP? Like, I get deep in my feelings, romanticize relationships, sometimes get stuck in loops of “am I loved or not?” and then obsess. At the same time, I still have the chaotic, curious, debate-for-fun ENTP vibe. How do you stop questioning your type once you’ve been so sure? Has anyone else gone through the ENTP → INFP crisis (or the other way around)?",

      "content_preview": "I think I once met a retired Ne-dom. I didn't know him for long, but he seemed like an Ne-dom. Look: He was a relative of my neighbour. I came over while they were discussing something in the kitchen. He said something weird. I thought it was strange and asked him about it. Everyone instantly looked at me and said, \"That's it! Now he has another person to talk his ear off.\" I doubted it would be that bad. They said, \"You asked him - so now he's your problem,\" and then they ran out of the kitchen, saying this was a rare opportunity to escape the conversation. That was also weird. I turned back to the old man, and he said, \"Let me show you what real coffee is. Let's go!\" I don't know why I went; I don't even drink coffee. So that was a long day filled with: \"You put a small cup of water next to the coffee cup and take little sips after tasting the coffee to clean your receptors. This is the only place that does that correctly...\" (One hour later) \"That's why the military doesn't use that type of bag. It's all uncomfortable.\" (Two hours later) \"And then I told her: 'How is it that you, just a seller, can understand what I want, but your boss doesn't get a word of it, and she's the boss?'\" (Even later) \"I've lived in three countries, but I can't call any of them my home. I'm not fully accepted anywhere.\" In his hometown, people judged him for working on Sundays. In the next country, he was teased as \"the guy from that strict town\". In the third country, he was too old to fully adapt, and people never saw him as one of them. And what I got from all of that is that people don't develop their functions as much as I expected. He was still clearly an extrovert, still chaotically Ne. Developed functions only mean that you cover your weak spots, but you still don't actually like using Si. I mean, when you're older, it won't be so easy to offend your feelings, and you won't run away crying. Or maybe you won't be as easy to provoke Sensing function (I don't know; I'm bad at Sensing myself). But that's pretty much it. So if you’re waiting for a miracle - to wake up one day neat like an SJ, or smooth and polite like an FJ - it won’t happen. You’ll always think and live through your dominant function. Play around it. :)",

Based on my recent discoveries that doesn't seem to be the case. It's actually the complete opposite & in many cases have taken a terrible turn but I want to see if it's just a coincidence or actually an INTP thing. My question is what's your consistent sleep pattern like? Monophasic, biphasic, or polyphasic, or other? Thank you.",
