On Apple Music, there are three studio albums and a Live at the Blue Door album, which I just listened to. I enjoyed all of them. He has a very similar vibe to Isbell. The live album is just him and immediately after, Apple Music queued up similar music and the first song was Bury Me. Vocally, they’re similar but Isbell is on a completely different level on the guitar. Just a thought I had. I’m now a John Fullbright fan, but Isbell is still the benchmark.",

      "content_preview": "https://youtu.be/TIxDZlZ1d4E?si=dpvMwo2E75RP0aMR https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonisbell/theassassin.html Hello everyone, I hope all is well. Today we are going to be talking about “The Assassin” which is one of the bonus tracks from the deluxe version of Jason’s first album Sirens of the Ditch which was released originally released in 2007 and then re released in 2018. Although fans don’t love how Jason’s first few albums were remixed/remastered, I think most people would say they enjoyed the fact that we got some extra songs left off these albums. And one of those is “The Assassin” which I’m curious what fan’s thoughts are on this song. But one thing I was unaware of is that this song is m a cover and was actually written by fellow Drive-By Truckers member Patterson Hood. His version of the song is was originally released on his first solo album Killers and Stars released in 2004: https://youtu.be/XHzCTvEo5P0?si=-skD_mYphJ0aXOdN Now if you’ve listen to both versions you’ll know that the Patterson’s version is a fairly stark comparison to Jason’s version. Unlike Jason’s, Patterson’s performance is just himself with an acoustic guitar. It sounds darker and more raw which lends itself well to story telling nature of the lyrics. Where’s Jason take has that full rock band sound that reminds me more of Warren Zevon’s classic song “Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner.” His version begins with these dramatic four chord strums with electric guitars, bass, syncopated drums and a fuzzy synth that is heard when the other instruments start to decay. When Jason starts singing we get a steady drum beat and some palm muting guitars which is great because you can hear Jason delivery these fantastic story telling lyrics. Lyrics that reminds me of Stephen King (a mix between Billy Summers and his Dark Tower series) and of course Warren Zevon which I already mentioned. The first verse sees the song’s protagonist who is an assassin (the best one around) talking about how he’s killed many people including women and even children. In fact killing children was just as easy as killing men as it seems that this assassin sees killing as a job and not a personal vendetta. He describes removing their “mangled  bodies” in a pretty gruesome but nonchalant way before acknowledging that he’s lost his taste for killing. As the music returns to those hard hitting chords from the intro, with some addition of some piano, we learn more about T his assassin. We learn he made quite the payload on killing people and again he reassures us that he was the best. Thus he never had a reason for a nine to five job. But now he claims that he doesn’t “have the stomach for killing anymore.” To me this almost insinuates that maybe after all this time he’s feeling regret or even guilt for killing people. The music transitions into a surprisingly laid back country chorus with some tasteful pedal steel, backing vocals and a more reeled in drum beat. The assassin admits that he’s done all he can do which leads him in a tough situation because “what good is an assassin who just can’t follow through?” It’s not a job for the faint of heart and for some reason he doesn’t have it in him anymore. We get some quick hits of guitar chords and cymbal crashes that leads us quickly to the next verse, keeping in the pedal steel. This verse we start learning why the assassin had a change of heart. He meets a woman who he starts to fall for because she took him in when no one else would. She also showed him how to throw a blade and how to shoot without a moment of guilt. He mentions how she protected him which probably also drew him closer to her. But then we get the plot twist with the last lyric “she was the most beautiful thing that I have ever killed.” Now unfortunately those are basically the  last lyrics as the song just has two more repeating choruses. So we never learn why the assassin killed this lady who he seemed to love. But my theory is that after she taught him how to be a killer again he realized that no one is truly safe from him. I mean he specifically tells us in the chorus that an assassin who can’t follow through is useless. So once he realized that being a killer runs through blood, he couldn’t keep her around. But maybe he was also fearful of her as it sounded like she was a killer herself. Either way this sounds like it would make a pretty fantastic western film. Following the second chorus we get a brief instrumental that features a pretty killer guitar solo. This one is less showy and impressive and more about feel. There’s some great bends and moments that fit perfectly with the vibe of the track. Now unfortunately my vinyl copy of this deluxe version of the album does not have band credits for the bonus tracks. But seeing how Patterson helped Jason produce this album, how he played on other songs from it and how he actually wrote this song, there’s a big chance he’s also playing on this version as well. With another chorus, which feels more haunting after the cliffhanger of last verse, we get a pretty cool outro. The band returns to those great one-two hits on the guitars and drums that’s followed by some atmospheric keys and that fuzzy synth lead. The band stay on this tension filled instrumental before finally resolving and ending the song on a darker note. As someone who’s unfamiliar with not only the Drive-By Truckers’ music and especially Patterson Hood’s work, this song has made me far more interested in both. Jason’s version is great because the band’s playing elevates the song by giving it a cinematic feel with a more full sound and a great solo. But Patterson’s version feels almost more gritty and haunting as it feels like a murder ballad. I can see why this song wouldn’t fit on Jason’s debut album but I’m glad we got a studio version of it as it was occasionally  played during the band’s first couple of tours. But what do you think of this tune? Which version do you prefer? What do you think the song is about? Favorite lyrical or musical moments? And did you ever get to see it live?",

      "content_preview": "The popular narrative that surrounds Jason Isbell is tidy: kicked out of the Drive-By Truckers in 2007, struggled with alcoholism for the next five years,  quit drinking, married Amanda Shires, and reemerged with the showstopping Americana classic Southeastern in 2013. It’s a compelling story, but it elides important details and a handful of essential songs. Southeastern deserves its reputation as the definitive Isbell album, but it didn’t come out of nowhere. I am especially fond of “Codeine,” from the 2011 project Here We Rest, which holds up nearly fifteen years later as a creative peak. “Codeine” is a country waltz, and Isbell on lead guitar and vocals is backed up by a second guitar, bass, piano, fiddle, and some dude absolutely tearing the room up on accordion. The song has a real upbeat, honky-tonk vibe to it, a change of pace from Isbell’s typical tendency to somber acoustic folk or straight-up Southern rock. If there's one thing I can't stand / It's this bar and this cover band / Trying to fake their way through 'Castles Made of Sand' / That's one thing I can't stand If there's one thing I can't take / It's the sound that a woman makes / About five seconds after her heart begins to break / That's one thing I can't take She should be home by now but she ain't / I should've gone by now but I cain't / One of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine / One of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine In the first verse, Isbell establishes his narrator as a barfly—a standard framework for his songwriting of this era (see “Streetlights,” “Elephant”). The song takes place post-breakup, but the narrator’s role in the split is ambiguous. He found himself dreading her moment of heartbreak, which suggests some control over the situation. His line about \"the sound that a woman makes\" is one of the finest he ever wrote; it conjures a heartbroken whimper, or an initial sob, or whatever the listener's memory bank supplies. Darlin' I'm not one to judge / But if I was then I'd say you don't look so good / Got no answers of my own / But with you gone, this place looks bigger than it should If I call when I ain't drunk / This old boat'll still be sunk / 'Cause one of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine' / Cause one of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine In “Codeine,” Isbell gives us a funny, bracing look at the whirlwind of life in active addiction, as a drunken barfly pointlessly mourns the end of a trailer-park romance. The story never really goes anywhere; it has no arc, because narrative arcs require main characters with agency. And the narrator here isn’t the type to actually try and fix his life up. He’s more inclined to drink—and complain. Codeine itself, the song’s centerpiece, is elevated to mythical status and framed as the reason that Isbell’s narrator can’t get his girlfriend back. This isn’t true, of course, and doesn’t reflect the reality of codeine, which is a low-grade painkiller unlikely to ruin anyone’s life. Unlike Buffy Sainte-Marie’s melodramatic, D.A.R.E.-style song “Cod’ine,” Isbe’ll’s “Codeine” is deliberately funny. The drug itself is almost beside the point; it’s a stand-in for the narrator’s cuckolding at the hands of his supposed friend. Despite the burst of humor for an oft-serious songwriter, \"Codeine\" still offers some real insight into the life and mind of someone who is, to put it mildly, not doing so well. https://tigerbeat.substack.com/p/part-2-codeine-in-folk-and-country?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=2u1zlj&triedRedirect=true",

      "content_preview": "https://youtu.be/IhRWogr9JlQ?si=g_aOvNc_StHD-xq6 https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonisbell/deathwish.html Hello everyone, I hope all is well. Today we are going to be tackling “Death Wish” which was the first single and opener for the band’s 2023 album Weathervanes. This is one of those lead singles that didn’t seem to get a lot of people excited for this album. It was a bit of a challenging listening due to the fact that it’s about some pretty dark but realistic subject matters. That and this is Jason’s first album that was fully produced by himself and it seems like some fans were less than happy with this specific song’s production. But once the album was released I think it was easier to see how this song fit the album’s narrative and it showed that it could be a grower. The song doesn’t give you a warning as it begins immediately with its abrasive chorus. It’s not abrasive in a bad way but it is a lot with Jason’s upfront vocals, a somber but single one strum chord progression and some percussion that sounds almost industrial with its heavy hits. Jason’s Bandcamp lists this fact when it comes to how the band came up with this particular drum sound: “Matt Pence, the drummer and engineer, came into the studio to help with the drum sound. He got a bunch of kits set up and they arrived on structure for “Death Wish.” The kick drum hits on the two, which was weird and disconcerting, even upsetting, until it clicked. Now it feels complicated and intricate, yet never fragile, like the subject of the song itself.” Lyrically this song deals with watching your loved one in a deep state of depression and trying to figure out how to help them. Having a “death wish” means to that you might engage in risky behavior; unconcerned for your own safety or life. In this case Jason sings about how you can see a switch flip in your own partners eyes and see how they have their own death wish. He even mentions how you might see your partner on the top of a building in just a tank top in the dead of winter possibly contemplating suicide. And maybe this was triggered by the death of a loved one but regardless you have to find a reason to “carry on.” You don’t want to fight with them but you also won’t leave them alone in this state either. Once the verse kicks in the guitars get a chance to shine a bit more with some beautiful but dark sounding arpeggios. Jason, in a more melodic but still gritty tone, sings about a time where him and his partner (Amanda at the time) were young and wild. They didn’t have to focus on the dark and more violent side of the world. But as you grow up you realize you might want different things in your life than your partner; “I wanted action, she wanted answers.” And then Jason ends the verse with the line “it takes a whole lot do medicine to feel like a little kid” which he’s mentioned in an interview that it was a reference to the Randy Newman song “Guilty.” You start realizing you want to go back to the carefree days of your youth but yet it gets harder to do that as the years go by. We go back to another chorus next which may be a reason this song isn’t high on a lot of people’s list. We do get some additional instrumentation like some light piano notes, extra guitar lead and some harmonies. But it’s a still a fairly long chorus where the lyrics never change. The next verse, which again starts with some almost distorted vocals, also see’s the additional of Amanda’s atmospheric fiddle halfway through. Jason asks some important questions like; “who’s gonna save you? Who’s left to pray to? What’s the difference between a breakdown and a breakthrough?” It’s questions that either person in a relationship can ask. Sometimes you feel like there’s no point anymore because there’s no one left to help you or listen to you. And although that may seem like a breakthrough in your own mental health, it could also appear like your foundation is crumbling. When Amanda’s verse enters the mix Jason sings this catchy melody that will return later on in the song. There’s pleads to help this person you love by holding and consoling them. But sometimes it feels pointless but you’ve said everything you’ve already said. No matter how much unconditional love you show someone it’s sometimes not enough. After another chorus we get a much needed bridge which feels like a fresh breath of air. We get some new chords as well as a more straightforward drum beat that sounds doubled timed which adds some more tension. We get the creative lyrics ”when the world turns to monochrome” and also how you can sometimes sense when someone is on the edge. This bridges transitions to an extremely brief instrumentation section which makes me wish this song had more prominent guitar sections like this one. We get one last chorus which is a little tiring at this point but at least it segues into an outro. There’s additional backing vocals giving some great call and response as Jason returns to this line from the second verse; “I wanna hold her until it’s over.” And the song comes to a close with some strings which is fitting. Overall I feel like this song suffers from the same issues that people had with “What’ve I Done to Help” even though I love that song and think it’s extremely overhated. For me it’s the song’s multiple choruses that holds it back. Because lyrically this song is fantastic, even if you can relate to it too much (like knowing someone in your life who’s had moments described in this song). And it’s a good album opener because it’s fairy indicative of the album’s sound. So if you take away the first chorus that starts this song I think it becomes better. Especially since this song’s more harsh production takes awhile to grow on you. Which is why I think this song works much better live or in an acoustic setting like Jack White’s cover. Speaking of which, here’s what Jason had to say about Jack’s cover as well as the production: “This is the kind of song that I have wanted to write for a long time. It’s expansive from the production, but also you can tell from Jack White doing the acoustic cover that he did, it still feels like a broad, expansive sort of thing. That’s a modern type of songwriting that I’m really drawn to, but it’s also antithetical to the roots-music ideal. And after ‘Death Wish’ is over, I feel like, you’ve hung in there with me through this sort of experimental thing. Now I can give you something that is a little bit more comfortable for your palate, something you’re a little more used to from me.” And here’s Jack’s cover of the song: https://youtu.be/wY-mdGk6k70?si=7yHAqMFtNtMFAnI6 But what do you think of this song?

Beats King of Oklahoma any day in my book and reveals so much about the inner workings of the final days of the relationship with Amanda. Also, just such beautiful lyrics. Feels like a foggy morning listen to me.
