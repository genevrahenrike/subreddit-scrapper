For example in an interview the CEO of Nanoleaf talked about the skylight not supporting matter due to its lack of scene support which HomeKit already has. Why not support Matter and HomeKit? It would allow customers to choose and future proof products without hamstringing them to an underdeveloped standard. On the flip side the multicolor lightstrips only support matter so there is no support for syncing dynamic group scenes to HK. It’s all super inconsistent. Same goes for Thread and WiFi, the whole shapes line has had both for a long time. Why not just have all products support both? The flip flop of recently releasing both WiFi and thread products is confusing and inconsistent. Instead of making customers figure if they need Thread or WiFi, just make one product that covers all needs. I would love to be able to add all products to HK over Thread and have to option to “upgrade” to matter later on.",

      "content_preview": "dear Community. i have started to created some smart zone and put GU10 bulbs in all halls of the apt and will put 3 or 4 sensors to operate. All bulbs are upgraded to Matter, connected via Thread and connected to my Apple home. Ideally I wanted to created some automations and to understand the work of the motion sensor. So, some questions are below and will highly appreciate your answers based on your experience. - if the motion sensor is switched on on Switcher  and I switch on light by app or Siri - will it switch off automatically when the set time of sensor will come? for e.g I put 5 mins now (to switch off after 5 min if no motion)  i am telling to Siri to switch my Hall on  will it go off in 5 mins if no motions there? - what is the ideal time for the halls - 3, 5, 7 mins? or what? - can i make automation to switch off motion sensor at certain time? for e g after 01 am it should switch off motion sensor? - can i make automation which will change the contrast after certain time? for eg after 17.00 it should be 50%, after 23.00 it should be already 25% and at the night - only 5%? (here what I see, if sensor can switch off the light after it is switched on by automation in app, then, it is easy to make automation to switch on lights at certain time with certain lightness and it will go down in 5 mins till detection of movement, but may be i am wrong and may be there are other easier solutions)? thanks a lot for help and answers",

The option shows in HomeKit, and I'm able to select it, but the colour doesn't change. It just stays on the last colour selected before switching to Adaptive. Is this a known issue? Note: my lights are all Thread over HomeKit which do still support Adaptive Lighting. Add data point: Lights that were updated to 3.0.2 and on Adaptive Lighting from before the update, still work with Adaptive Lighting. But as soon as I choose a different colour, I then can't get it back (again, I can click it, but the colour doesn't change to Adaptive).",

      "content_preview": "Hey! I recently put together a small terminal app to control Nanoleaf panels using Go. It’s called nanoleaf-go , and it uses the local OpenAPI to do basic stuff like: Scanning your local network by sweeping the 192.168.X.* subnet for open Nanoleaf ports ( 16021 ) Pairing with the controller (using the power button), and saving the device config for later Toggling power on/off Changing brightness All through a simple TUI (built with Bubble Tea) I mainly built it to avoid opening the mobile app just to dim the lights while working or gaming. It’s nothing too fancy yet, but it works well for the basics. If you're into terminal tools, Go, or just want a quick way to mess with your panels, feel free to check it out or open an issue. Repo: https://github.com/imedgar/nanoleaf-go Would love to hear any feedback or ideas for improvements. Cheers,",

After over a year of leaving it alone and it working... out of no where the power LED started flashing blue All the panels having a dim white light...

At time of 4D purchase I did try looking around and it was suggested this couldn’t be done but may happen. Now a quick search (AI generated result) suggests that it can. Problem is when I go to scenes which appears to be how you get Sync+ working nothing shows up or, possibly the 4D does as that’s how I get to that screen, but there’s nothing showing to sync it to. I can see they’re on different connection types. One is WIFI and the other threads which I assume is the likely issue? So … Can it be done? It so … how? Thank you.",

This is what the back looks like: https://www.sony.ie/image/79219c8351f745e7dc7746a282a81921?fmt=png-alpha&wid=1024&hei=768 / https://images.webfronts.com/cache/frodbrmcwkiv.webp?imgeng=/w_500/h_500/m_letterbox_ffffff_100 So basically the top is just the panel / flat, the sides are beveled outwards at about 45 degrees, the bottom is raised but flat, and of course all the plugs are on the bottom. Anyone had a similar TV / back cover? I'm thinking on finding raised plastic \"corners\" for the top, not too worried about the bottom. Alternatively, am I just overthinking this and just \"stretch\" the step between the back cover and panel and not care about the different angle on most of the sides?",
