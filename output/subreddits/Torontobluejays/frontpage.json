      "content_preview": "The bullpen struggles the Jays are having lately are obviously having an effect on their W-L record, and it occurs to me that we've also seen such stretches from other AL teams in the last little while. The Mariners looked like not just a postseason lock a couple of weeks ago, as well as a threat to Houston at the top of the division - now they're only 1.5 games up on the Rangers. The Yankees nearly fell off the cliff in July, and now they're doing well again (sadly). My point is, such is the nature of baseball. It's a fickle beast. In other sports, one guy getting hot or having a great year can be enough to make a mediocre team good all year, whereas the same generally doesn't apply to baseball. Frustration with the current situation is understandable for sure - but hopefully they'll get right again and the bullpen will once again be as reliable as they were for much of the summer. That's all. Go Jays!",

I’m trying to pin down the exact date of a special kids’ event I went to at Exhibition Stadium, likely in the mid to late 1980s (1985–1988). Here’s what I remember: •\tWe were all sitting out on the field before a game (hundreds of kids). •\tBuck Martinez was there as well as I believe Manny Lee and Ernie Whitt (and others). •\tIt felt like a Junior Jays / Kids Day / Fan Club Day, but more of a “Play Ball” / skills type of event where kids got to interact with the team. Does anyone else remember this? Maybe you were there too, or you have an old program, ad, or ticket stub that lists the event. Any help nailing down the exact game date would be awesome! Or maybe I’m completely imaging I went to this event.",
