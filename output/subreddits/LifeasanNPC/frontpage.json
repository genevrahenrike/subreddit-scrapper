      "content_preview": "Me and Kai were trekking through the woods yesterday, following the Envoy to god knows where. He never tells us anything. We don’t even know his real name, or how he is able to talk to us or see where he is going when nearly his entire face is covered in mushrooms. I honestly wish he couldn’t talk. He never says anything nice anyway. I didn’t know about Kai- the only time we talked was when we awkwardly argued about flies and hygiene at our camp- but I had to imagine he was questioning his life choices as much as I was. I had almost forgotten why I was even following the Envoy at all. Most of what we do do is collect bounties, except me and Kai never even get a cut of the reward, even though we risk our lives more than the Envoy ever does. The Envoy spends a lot of time cooking too, but never for us- he’ll cram bootleg bottles of alcohol into his pack and bowls of fish stew, which he spills everywhere, cursing. He reeks of fish all the time. Before this, the last bit of our adventure was spent helping some hairy goblin who implied me and Kai loved to have buttsex with each other, and the envoy suggested making this fantasy a reality, to our disgust. We nearly died to get some kind of stupid artifact for her, and she never even bothered to pay us. We were still wandering through the woods while the Envoy collected twigs and random plants, when all of the sudden, he motioned for us to stop. He dropped to his knees and pulled out a bottle of mysterious liquid. I groaned. Me and Kai exchanged disappointed glances. Whenever the Envoy does this we know we are in for a painful time. He’ll consume all kinds of meats and alcohols and random potions or stews in hopes of getting “buffed up” before a difficult battle. This always means we’re completely screwed and are definitely going to lose. I winced, remembering how bruised and bloodied we were from the last failed fight. The Envoy guided us towards a pack of bears and then hung back, taking potshots with his rifle and of course, missing. Me and Kai took on the brunt of the battle, knowing our best hope of a reward was some bear pelts that the Envoy would sell, giving us none of the profit. “Marius, look!” Kai shouted to me, desperately holding off a grizzly bear as best he could. I looked ahead and saw the Envoy was sprinting past hoards of enemies, taking advantage of our distraction to open a chest in the distance. He gleefully strode back a while later, carrying a greatsword that he didn’t bother to use to help us. Me and Kai nursed our wounds that night, struggling to breathe with our cracked ribs, feeling the sting of our bites and claw marks, while the Envoy, unscathed, cozily slept on piles of potions and healing spells that he refused to share with us. Today we went into town, and me and Kai struggled not to fall asleep as the Envoy spent hours listening to people depressingly talk about all the people dying everywhere. Occasionally the Envoy would interrupt to call them fools for not doing enough to save their loved ones. Or for wanting to actually give them funerals. If it’s not clear by this point, the Envoy doesn’t really have any actual convictions of any kind. Any conversation with him is pretty much completely unpredictable. Sometimes he’ll mutter some cryptic nonsense about souls, and I’m pretty sure he worships demons in his spare time. He had a really great time recently arguing with some old lady who acted like she could read our auras. I’m not sure if we learned anything useful from her; I don’t think literally any of us were actually paying attention. Kai mentioned something about the Dreamscourge today and I realized I had forgotten it was even a thing. I really hope something reminds me why I’m even with these two- I mean, last I checked I have a pretty well-paying job to do. It used to be that when I went hunting I could actually sell the pelts myself. I’m not a mercenary like Kai. Except Kai’s not much of a mercenary either, considering HE’S NOT EVEN BEING PAID.",

      "content_preview": "“Alarm! Zer is an intruder on ze base!” I was a newly enlisted private, cleaning my gun in the armory, when me and my squad heard the noise. Our captain gave us all a look, nodded sternly, and we all took off towards the noise. We arrived outside the warehouse where a guard was laying on the ground, with a huge welt on the back of his head. He groaned as we turned him over and saw that his submachine gun was literally smashed in pieces. Someone had somehow, with inhuman strength, broke his own gun over his head. Inside there were even more bodies. One had fallen over a railing. One was clutching his groin and told us us he’d been hit in the crotch from behind with a shovel. Another soldier had a black eye, and shamefully told us that he’d lost a fist fight with an unarmed Egyptian laborman. The soldier was armed with a pistol, but failed to land any shots as the attacker was blindingly fast and had “eaten a lot of fruit and cookies” giving him enhanced stamina. The soldier had been knocked out in seconds flat. Our captain pinched his brow and sighed, utterly disappointed.  A wounded soldier, with great panic, told him the mysterious assailant was still in a rail car nearby. We approached the entrance, and one of our soldiers, having not received any orders to do so, eagerly ran in armed with nothing but a Billy club. A piercingly loud gunshot rang out only a second later, and the soldier’s body fell limp out of the rail car. Undeterred, two more soldiers sprinted in and both were immediately shot. A stick of lit dynamite was randomly thrown out of the rail car and I was surprisingly the only one who hit the ground. Another man foolishly advanced towards the dynamite and was exploded moments later. I was panicking at this point and looked to my captain for some form of guidance, but he just watched, amused as man after man entered the rail car and was shot dead. After a while the gunshots ceased and all we could hear were bludgeoning noises and guns breaking, and then.. the odd noise of someone ravenously eating fruit. There was surely some better way of handling this situation, one where much less fatalities would be needed, but before I had a chance to speak up I was shoved in line behind a burly man who didn’t even carry a weapon. When I nervously inched in, almost hiding behind the other man, I was finally able to get a good look at our attacker. He was hunched next to some crates just a few feet away, and looked bloodied and exhausted, but was nonetheless casually reading a map. He didn’t look Egyptian at all; he looked like an American actor wearing a cheesy costume. There were piles of bodies in the railcar that we struggled not to trip over. The American saw us and defensively pulled out a bottle of rum, which he crashed over the burly man’s head. The soldier was unaffected and landed a right cross to the American, who immediately slumped to the ground, unconscious. There were no words spoken, and the soldier grunted as he passed by me to exit the rail car. I stared at our captain and squadmates, who all decided to head off for lunch, apparently forgetting that we still had a potential spy laying there in our base. I heard a chuckle behind me and turned around to see that the American was standing up. He had changed into a suit and was putting on a fedora, arrogantly smirking at me. I had no idea what the meaning of this was, but ducked out of the rail car before I would be shot, punched in the groin, or else made to suffer whatever other bizarre and painful fate this unknown attacker had in store for me. Another line of unarmed men attempted to get in the rail car after me, ready to rumble. I tried to explain the situation to one of the higher ups and he just laughed and laughed. He said I couldn’t even get my own story straight, and I had to admit, none of it made sense. When I asked him to please come see for himself, he said he was far too busy eating cookies and prickly pears. Besides, he assured me that taking a few hits from the shovel was a normal part of guard work. He showed me a scar where a man had broken a broom handle over his head. I shook my head and asked to be transferred to another base.",

      "content_preview": "I work catching fish in a settlement deep in the tunnels, Venice. It’s not the worst place to be in the apocalypse, all things considered, but it’s murky and smelly and the people here are shady as hell. Sometimes though, I meet new arrivals who are somehow stranger than the people here. One day a fisherman friend of mine pulled in on his boat while I was on the dock nearby. I heard something flicking over and over. I look over and I see across from him a stranger wearing a cracked gas mask, breathing heavily. He was holding a lighter shaped like a bullet, and he kept flicking it on and off and staring at the flame. Sometimes he would pull out some kind of notepad and squint at it, holding the flame so close it looked like it would catch fire. My friend came up on the dock and introduced this stranger as Artyom, a gunslinger. He’d only gotten a few words in before Artyom sprinted up to him and held the lighter under his nose. My friend coughed and snorted, then swatted the lighter away as it was about to catch his mustache on fire. I commented that it would be nice to have a gunslinger around, and Artyom whipped around suddenly, holding his notepad in front of my face, for a few seconds, then putting it away. Artyom then tore off his gas mask startlingly fast, and stood there for a moment, staring at me with beady eyes and a blank expression. His face was sweaty and covered with soot and blood. I was about to continue congratulating my friend on a safe return when I smelled Artyom’s fishy hand as he held the lighter up to my eye. I turned away before he could melt my eyeball. Artyom went off to harass some others, so I stayed with my friend who needed help with his engine. I kneeled down to inspect it, and as I’m giving him some advice, I felt a slight warmth on my beanie, which quickly spread. Realizing what was happening, I cursed and tore off my beanie, throwing it into the water as it had caught fire. I then turned around and looked at Artyom, who was breathing heavily as he tried to press his lighter against my forehead. I later saw Artyom try to set fire to a few small children, and the parents chased him off. A shopkeeper complained to me later that a customer held up the entire line as he crouched in front of her stall, staring intensely at a notepad with a lighter, and, while wearing a blood stained gas mask, struggled to read the labels on each can of fish she sold (the labels were blank). He refused to respond when she asked him to leave, and the multiple assault rifles on his back prevented anyone from intervening. I commented that this must’ve been Artyom. She raised an eyebrow, and asked who Artyom was, and I admitted that I had no real clue, other than that he was a “gunslinger” who would be the last person I’d want handling a gun. If his firearm safety is anything like his fire safety, it’s no surprise that Artyom has no fellow soldiers to speak of.",

      "content_preview": "“How’s it going up there? Any sign of Reaper?” I squinted over the vast landscape as I swiveled the turret around. Nobody around. I said to the driver in the tank below: “Nope. And nothing on the radio either. Not sure why he even has one. It’s not like he ever uses it. Say, what kind of edgy name is Reaper anyway?” “Hey, be nice. I know the guy is kind of…special, but he can be great in a fight, I promise you.” I grimaced. “I wouldn’t know. I never see him any time we actually fight.” We were silent for a while, watching for enemies as the tank rumbled onward. There were a few foot soldiers we made short work of. Finally we came to a stop, and I heard: “We’re at the enemy base. Now if Reaper could show up…” Like magic, I saw a figure on the horizon. He was struggling to balance on a hoverboard soaring through the air. I sighed. “Goddamnit. I told you we never should’ve given him that thing.” Reaper screamed as he whizzed straight past us. There was an enemy sniper on a nearby balcony that we’d failed to see. The sniper landed an impressive shot, hitting Reaper in the leg. Reaper fell off his hover board and we all winced as he crashed headfirst into a concrete wall at what must’ve been 40 miles per hour. He cried out in pain. I was surprised he wasn’t dead on impact; he must’ve at least been paralyzed. Reaper lay there prone, immobile, crying, his tears soaking the sand below. I scratched my neck awkwardly. We had no medics on our team. It was a really poorly planned operation overall. A thought occurred to me: “Hey, what is it we’re doing out here again?” The driver called back, “Fuck if I know, man. I haven’t been paying any attention to the plot. Something about aliens, I think? Maybe?” At that moment an enemy soldier came out of a nearby bathroom whistling. He saw Reaper on the ground and panicked, pulling out a pistol and shooting him 8 times, putting an end to his misery. The soldier turned his pistol on us, and one round from the tank blew him completely into bits. Reapers corpse was partly destroyed in the explosion. Blood showered everywhere and I think someone’s guts bounced off my head. “Buddy, I am not high enough for this shit,” I said to the driver. “The last thing we need is to be higher than we already are,” he replied. “We’re NPCs in a single player campaign for a multiplayer game. That puts our collective IQ at about 40.” “I was wondering why you kept getting the tank stuck,” I smirked. “I wonder if Reaper was the main character then. Well, I think he’ll like, teleport back in a bit. Hopefully his neck will be ok.”",

      "content_preview": "My craziest story as a bartender? Well, it’s pretty dark. Are you really sure you want to hear it? Alright, but I’m telling you now, you’re not going to believe it. So I was serving at this really nice dance club. Some people could get a little rowdy, but overall, the job was a blast. People were there to have a great time. But one day, this dude strolled up in a suit, looking like the most depressed person I’d ever seen. There were rings around his eyes and I don’t think he’d showered in days. He said his name was Max Payne (I had to stifle a laugh) and he immediately started complaining about being in Brazil and what a terrible job he had and what a stupid American gringo he was. He said this as if it was some deep inner monologue to himself, but the whole thing was out loud. He waved at me to get a drink without specifying anything. I figured he was the type to drink shitty whiskey neat, and he was happy to receive that. I went to help someone else and a few minutes later, my coworker nudged me and pointed back to Max. Apparently he had opened a bottle of pills and was taking them by the handful. I went over and was about to ask him to leave when he told me he wanted to close out. He told me he was an alcoholic, and refused to tip because he was just a dumb gringo who “didn’t deserve it.” I don’t think he understood that I wasn’t offering to tip him. Later I was wondering where an awful smell was coming from when I saw Max dancing with a friend. He had clearly pissed himself and was drooling, struggling not to fall over. Suddenly, gunfire and screams rang out. I knew we had some gang members frequent the club, but I’d never seen any actual violence. I ducked behind the bar, and watched as hundreds of patrons tried to exit the club. Max had been lying on the floor covered in vomit by this point, but he suddenly jolts up as if he’d had an adrenaline shot. I watched him pull two pistols out his suit and leap through the air. He shot five women and two unarmed men near the club exits, before crashing to the hard wood floor on his stomach, his chin bashing off  the surface. I heard him grunt painfully and immediately start gasping for air, completely winded. Gunfire started raining down around him and I heard him panic, blurting out “oh shit oh shit oh shit” as he twisted about like a worm on the floor, firing randomly and hitting three more innocents. He struggled to stand up, then threw himself into a chair, wheezing again as he shot two more times, breaking some stereo systems. I watched him struggle to reload both his pistols at the same time. He kept dropping the magazines over the floor, and picking up the bullets that spilled out. The shooters seemed to be ignoring him at this point, and he’d already been shot twice, aside from probably internal bleeding from throwing himself into objects. Max downed another bottle of pills. Anti psychotics, maybe? My coworker saw a way through one of the exits and whispered to me, grabbing my arm. But for some reason, I couldn’t take my eyes off Max. Who was this guy? Max started to monologue to himself again about all the rich stupid idiots around him who had more liquor in their bodies than brains. He said this as he wandered over to the bar shelf and started chugging a bottle of vodka. Then he went on a rant about how gang members had stolen his expensive watch. His sense of self preservation seemed to have vanished at this point, and he leapt out onto the club floor again, puking as he landed on his back. I think I heard his spine snap. He tried five grueling times to stand up before finally managing it and stumbling off somewhere else. We ended up staying put until the police arrived. It had turned out that the only people hurt were the 10 bystanders Max had fatally shot. I let the police know everything I’d seen, but as far as I know, they never found the guy.",

      "content_preview": "Commodore James Tanner paced the deck of The Royal Sovereign , Flagship of his Flotilla of two First Rate ships of the line, a hundred guns plus each. It was his first posting as Commodore, all he had to do was sink one poxy pirate Brig and it would not be his last. He had dragged himself up the greasy pole of command the hard way, and would not brook failure. \"Ship Sighted sir! Tis the Jackdaw! \" Came the cry from the mainmast. The lookout was a Devon poacher with eyes sharper than the hawks whose nests he raided. Tanner put his telescope to his eye and confirmed the report. The rickety little ship was stupid enough to sail right for them! He'd be Admiral by Christmas. \"Mr Inch, a shilling for that man! Mr Dalby, make signal to Sandford on Fearless , close action! We'll crush this Kenway between us!\" Inch hastened to obey, he was a well loved and effective Captain. Tanner liked him as well as any man he had sailed with. The two ships, pride of His majesty's navy made full sail for the pirate. He almost felt sorry for Kenway. Tanner had had his men heat their heavy shot. Suddenly, the sky lit up. \"They're firing mortars!\" Sure enough, long before Royal Sovereign was in range of the smaller ship, flaming, explosive shells were raining down upon her deck, instantly transforming it from an orderly crew to a butcher's parlour. \"WHAT? Why don't we have mortars? We're twice their size! How can we allow them to outgun us?\" Nonetheless, there was nothing to be done that to continue to make for them. Fearless was positioned just perfectly so that the mortar toting brig would have to face both their broadsides at once, with no room to run. Tanner's morale returned as Jackdaw sailed neatly into the killing zone. He laughed to himself as he could see the ship's guns were made of solid gold. What kind of material was that for a cannon? \"BY THE MARK, FIRE!\" Came the voice of Mr Weigell, the Second Lieutenant, and master of Royal Sovereign's armament. The man was deaf from years in his trade, but his voice carried clear enough. All too clear, it would turn out. Jackdaw turned on the head of a pin, so they could rake it down the stern. This should be a killing blow. Alas, for some reason both Royal Sovereign and Fearless did'nt just fire the guns pointed at Jackdaw , but every gun on the broadside at once, so the two consorts raked each other as badly as the pirate. The decks of the ship filled with the howls of the maimed and dying. \"WHAT THE HELL! WHAT THE BLOODY HELL! WHY WON'T YOU FIRE IN SECTIONS DAMN YOUR EYES! YOU'LL SWING FOR THIS WEIGELL, YOU AND THAT THRICE CURSED FOOL SANDFORD TOO!\"* and worse was to come, for Captain Inch desperately noted that the men on Jackdaw had ducked, meaning of course their ship was barely scratched. \"DUCKED? DUCKED? AM I GOING STARK RAVING MAD? PLEASE, WILL SOMEONE TELL ME WHY IN ALL MY YEARS AT SEA, I WAS NEVER INFORMED THAT CROUCHING BEHIND YOUR WOODEN SHIP PROTECTS IT FROM DAMAGE? CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW THIS ESCAPED ME? AT THE LEAST, CAN OUR MARKSMEN NOT SHOOT FOR THEIR CAPTAIN?\" But the marksmen stood there like lemons. They would not fire their rifles unless boarded for some reason that eluded Tanner. Didn't want to get their uniforms dirty or something? And then Jackdaw struck back. She unleashed Chain shot into the side of fearless, stopping it dead. \"WHAT? THEY HIT THE HULL! THE HULL! WITH CHAIN SHOT! WHY, FOR THE LOVE OF SWEET MARY, DOES THAT PREVENT THAT HANGDOG BASTARD OF A POST CAPTAIN FROM SAILING HIS BLASTED SHIP?\" Tanner's blood pressure was now almost as much a danger as the Jackdaw , as it unloaded shot after shot, and before long, the Fearless was sunk, and Kenway's rogues fished 10,000 Spanish reales from the wreck without even slowing or having to launch boats. Tanner stared aghast. The Fearless had been a perfect example of his craft, the pride of his Majesty's Royal Navy. Placed under his command, and now it was driftwood. Win or lose, Tanner's career was over. \"RIGHT, FUCK IT! LET'S JUST BLOODY WELL RAM THEM SHALL WE? WHY NOT? WHY THE FUCK NOT? BY ALL THE SAINTS, MAKE STRAIGHT FOR THEM!\" The Royal Sovereign , reduced to a medieval battering ram. But Tanner's woes would not end there. The Jackdaw simply tossed kegs of powder into the sea behind them, which for some reason blew up on impact when the first rater plowed into them. \"HOW? BY GOD'S TEETH HOW? THERE WAS NO FUSE! NO FUSE! NO DETONATOR! GUNPOWDER SHOULD NOT BE TRIGGERED BY SIMPLE IMPACT!\" Tanner howled as his ship went to the bottom.",

      "content_preview": "I live in Steelport, which should already tell you I’m a fucking idiot.  I’m nearly hit by cars every day.  I’m lucky if gimps and furries don’t try to murder me on the streets.  Every day living here feels like The Purge on LSD.  But, maybe out of some kind of stubborn arrogance, I wanted to make it work somehow.  So one day, I decided I’d be much safer with a gun, and went to a Friendly Fire. The name of the gun store was already a bit concerning, but I figured it was better than Rim Jobs.  On my way to the store, I saw a man sprinting through traffic, wearing nothing but nipple pasties and a thong.  You know what’s funny?  I thought it was a relatively classy move.  He could’ve just been naked. I entered the store and began browsing.  It was one of those rare moments where everything actually felt normal.  The store looked mostly like a normal gun store.  Nothing was exploding.  Nobody was being lit on fire. But then I heard a scream from outside.  It was a sound I’d heard many times before.  The unmistakable cry of pain someone makes when they’re punched in the dick.  In walks the man in the thong, who I then recognized from the news.  It was the butcher of Stillwater.  Avid collector of blow up dolls and aggressive activist against non-bruised genitalia. Enthusiast of cosmetic surgery that only seemed to make him look uglier and fatter.  He casually strolled up to the counter while holding a rocket launcher.  The store owner, a greasy-looking bald man with a mustache, shook the butcher’s hand eagerly and thanked him for purchasing the store moments ago.  He asked him some business-related questions, which the butcher had absolutely no interest in answering. The butcher had an almost bored look on his face when he asked for a dildo bat.  As in, a giant dildo that could be used as a bat, and was also purple.  I’d never heard of such a thing.  I’d also never heard of dildos being sold in a gun shop. Heavily disassociating, I stared at a wall and looked for whatever computer code might be seeping through the cracks. The owner pulled out a giant dildo bat that was the exact right shade of purple.  I couldn’t tell if he’d been keeping it for a customer, or if it was a personal item.  It was probably both, actually.  The butcher started twerking joyfully.  When the butcher finally took the bat from the owner’s hands, he immediately turned around and swung it at a customer, an old man who collapsed immediately.  Swing after swing, his blood splattered all over the walls of the store.  The store owner grinned, satisfied.  I decided far too late that this was not the right store, or the right planet for me. I tried to tell the police.  Said that I would, in fact, testify that I had genuinely seen someone be killed by a giant dildo.  They laughed it off, and told me that people could be legally murdered on gameshows, so this was a non-issue. I’ve been hearing there’s a new STAG initiative that’s meant to clean these streets up.  I was optimistic at first, until I heard they were using jets with laser beams.  I figure that the butcher will find a way to make one shaped like a dildo, so things are only going to get worse.",

      "content_preview": "So I have a new partner, Cole Phelps. He’s new to the Vice Department. Actually, he’s pretty new to detective work in general. I think it’s a little funny that he’s been promoted about 3 times after working only about 10 cases, when other detectives haven’t been promoted in years, but what can I say, the kid has talent. Most of the time. See, one of Cole’s many flaws, aside from volume control, losing his temper with old ladies, and cheating on his wife with a random broad that he was screaming at only moments earlier- anyway, one of Cole’s flaws is that he lacks common sense. We were on a case having to do with morphine. Right, I know, sounds like all our cases. The real issue was this time, Mickey’s goons were gunning people down. We put some of those thugs down quick, and then get a call about another shooting elsewhere. I go to hop back in the car, when I see Cole running the opposite direction. I think, ‘Okay, maybe the kid found some sort of clue we missed. It better be important.’ So I follow him. Cole then gets into a random dump truck loaded with barrels. He smirks at me and says, “You can drive. I need to go over the case notes.” I stand there for a minute, thinking he must be joking. But Cole doesn’t budge. For the sake of urgency, I get in, and I’m surprised to see some dope had actually left the keys in the ignition. It was almost like Cole had staged this. I start hauling this thing to the shooting, wondering what the hell Cole could know that I didn’t. Was there some sort of point to this? In the meantime, Cole drew penises in his sketchbook and giggled. To be honest, it was better that I drive. Cole is a terrible driver and frankly puts everyone’s lives in danger any time he gets behind a wheel. I can’t even imagine him driving a truck. We pull up to the shooting and many of our men were already there engaged in a firefight; they got there much sooner than us, I’m sure. One of them gave me a funny look as I stepped out the truck. We get through the shitshow no worse for wear, but as we head out, Cole jumps into another patrolman’s car. I walk over to tell him to knock it off, and he leans over the window and- this kid, he seriously tells me: “You can drive. You know the way.” The shit eating grin on his face. I’ll never forget it. I can just picture him getting demoted to Arson soon. I hope he has a wonderful time trying to get evidence from burnt pieces of wood. I guess if anyone could do it, it might just be him, the nutcase that he is.",

      "content_preview": "I was eating fruitcake in my office one day when I got a call.  I was shocked, since basically nobody ever called. Nannies were not in high demand in Simcity. Besides, whenever someone did call, they expected a really mean British lady, and not a bearded middle-aged man. I was in crippling debt. I picked up the phone and was shocked at who was calling- it was Ms. Terrific! The world-famous celebrity and simoleonaire. She told me that my services had come highly recommended by a friend of hers, and that she was willing to hire me for zero dollars. She assured me that this was the standard rate she paid all of her staff- something about a “free services” reward, whatever that meant. I let her know that I was happy to work free of charge- I would basically get to hang out in her celebrity mansion for free! And maybe my business would get some much-needed exposure. And so I arrived the next day, eager to get to work, only to find…Terrific had no kids. She had no children of any kind. I scratched my head, a little confused of what exactly I was being hired to do. Terrific was very kind regardless, introducing me to her girlfriend and fixing me a drink at her fancy bar. The three of us ended up watching a movie on her outdoor projector. There were garlic decorations everywhere for some reason, and the smell started to bother me, so I called it a night and left. I suppose I would’ve felt guilty, but to be fair, I wasn’t actually being paid anything. The next day- when I was supposed to be working- Ms. Terrific invited me to a dinner party at her home. She told me that all the important sims in town would be there and that I was obligated to come. As a starving, um, “nanny”, it wasn’t like I was going to refuse. When I arrived, Terrific welcomed me in like before, but I was surprised to see that her girlfriend was not around. In fact, barely anyone was. There was a seedy-looking, overweight woman with glasses who was wearing a tank top and shorts that were way too small. She had greasy cornrows and seemed like she hadn’t showered in days.  There was only one other guest: a skinny, pale man who wore a red velvet tuxedo. He seemed extremely uncomfortable and was sweating profusely and squinting, as though he couldn’t handle the light. There was also a hired entertainer, but he went off to perform standup in another room. To no one. I was starting to feel like my organs were going to be stolen tonight, when Terrific suddenly called us all to a meal that she’d already prepared. I had to admit, it was delicious. Terrific had made a creamy garlic pasta. We all made awkward conversation as we ate, as none of us had been introduced to each other and had no clue what our relations to Terrific were… uh, if any. The man in the tuxedo wasn’t much for conversation, and seemed like he was going to throw up; he quickly left for the bathroom. I was left alone with the other two, and became a bit uncomfortable as they began, um, winking and blowing kisses at each other. It wasn’t long before they were making out and then discussing that they’d like to have children together. I decided to make myself a drink at the bar while they gave each other foot massages in the other room. I felt bad for the comedian, who was surely questioning his life choices as much as I was. Later, the man in the bathroom came out and complained that he hadn’t had any plasma in hours. He told me this as loud sex noises erupted from upstairs. I looked at him, blinked, shook my head, and walked out the door. I figured Ms. Terrific wouldn’t notice I was gone, and I was correct in that assumption. I didn’t show up again and Ms. Terrific didn’t  say anything at first, but suddenly called me a week later, requesting my services once again. I arrived, worried what might happen if I didn’t, and met Terrific and her original girlfriend, who was apparently now her wife. With a guilty conscience, I considered informing her of her Terrific’s infidelity. That was before Terrific introduced me to her other three girlfriends. I had been expecting a childless home once again, but was brought upstairs to find 4 babies screaming. They sounded like they hadn’t been fed in days. Terrific and her girlfriends started to breastfeed and cradle them, and I once again wondered what my job was supposed to be. I decided to go watch a movie, because apparently that’s all they wanted me to do. When I went back upstairs, the babies looked years older. They were suddenly walking and talking. That was it. I had to be on some kind of celebrity prank show, surely? What the hell was going on? Ms. Terrific entered a rocketship in her front yard and I decided it was time to leave once again. I never came back and never returned the multiple calls that I would get from her at 2AM every Saturday. To this day, I sometimes wonder if the whole thing was some sort of fever dream.",

      "content_preview": "I heard from a friend of mine that there was a new super cool arcade in town, so I decided to stop by. When I parked, it just looked like a laundromat, and I was totally confused. I walked in and the place smelled like ass, and there was garbage everywhere- pizza boxes (who eats pizza at a laundromat?) coffee cups, and even dirty socks. Then on a door in the back, I saw a sketchy sign labeled “arcade”. I walked in, half expecting to be kidnapped. The place was dimly lit and smelled like rotten pizza, and there were a few broken televisions inside. I saw a girl pulling used gum off a table with her bare hands, which was completely disgusting. There were only 3 arcade games in there- one of them was called “racer chaser” and was some shitty knockoff of pac man. I played it for a few minutes before getting bored. When I went to use the bathroom it completely reeked, so I stepped back out. Then I saw the girl from before rush in and slam a plunger into the toilet. The bathroom door was open, and I watched her splash toilet water everywhere as she aggressively plunged like a total maniac. Finally I heard a flush, and she rushed back out without washing her hands. I went back to playing a video table hockey game, which was pretty lame without anyone to play with. It was also pretty uncomfortable as the silent girl dragged a trash bag around, collecting empty bottles that littered the floor. She also rudely pushed me off the game at some point so she could play. I went to go play the only other game, a candy crush knockoff. Out of morbid curiosity, I glanced over to see what the girl was doing now, and she was flicking cockroaches off some kind of motherboard. I wanted to puke. Eventually she played some music on a jukebox nearby that sounded like Nickelback. She kept playing the same song over and over, which I took as my cue to leave. As I was leaving, I watched her sprint into the laundry room to manhandle other people’s laundry, throwing it in all different washing and drying machines.  Again, with her bare hands, she was touching people’s used thongs. She didn’t utter a word as I left, not a “have a nice day”, not even a glance in my direction. It was like I didn’t exist. Safe to say, that was the least radical “arcade paradise” I’ve ever been in. I won’t be coming back.",

      "content_preview": "I was waiting for a friend, and even though it was in the evening, I decided to pop into a nearby coffee shop.  I was a bit surprised the place was open at all, and figured it must be closing soon.  I came in, expecting that it might be a moment before someone would come up to the counter- but as soon as I walked in, a man was already there, wearing an apron, staring at me. I took a seat at the bar and glanced at my phone.  Damn.  No text back yet.  It was then that I heard heavy breathing.  I glanced up, and the barista had a furrowed brow, and looked frustrated. Right.  I guess I hadn’t ordered yet.  I asked for some tea, and this seemed to calm him down.  I watched him pour milk into a cup, and then run it through an espresso machine.  With a beaming smile, he then handed me a cup of boiling hot milk.  I was feeling a little uneasy at this point, and decided it wasn’t worth arguing over.  The drink wasn’t really important anyway.  I just needed to kill some time. I scrolled twitter for a bit until I heard heavy breathing again.  I looked at the barista, and then their name tag, and then the barista again.  I paused.  No way this could be real. “Orville Redenbacher?  Are you actually the Orville Redenbacher?” The barista grinned.  He had the iconic bow tie, the glasses, the curly gray hair.  Only, his eyes were bloodshot.  Maybe he’d had too much coffee.  He explained that he had gotten tired of making popcorn, and decided to open a coffee shop at night. “But aren’t you supposed to be dead?” I asked. Orville’s smile vanished, and he looked away grimly. “We don’t talk about that here.” I had already lost interest and gone back to my phone, when another customer came in, a dark-haired woman. Orville greeted them warmly, and they asked for an espresso.  Orville winked, and made them a hot chocolate “with extra lemon.” The customer didn’t complain, other then to point out that Orville had gone a bit heavy with the lemon.  They insisted that the drink was “not bad.”  This didn’t seem to go over well with Orville.  I could seem him wringing his hands behind the counter, as if he wanted to strangle someone.  Through gritted teeth, he replied, “Noted.” Orville stared at the woman, and then back at me, and back at the woman.  He kept clearing his throat and coughing awkwardly.  It seemed like maybe he wanted us to make conversation.  Since all I had was steamed milk to entertain myself, I decided to ask Orville some questions about his remarkable life, but he would only give vague, mysterious answers.  When I asked why he owned a coffee shop where he apparently refused to sell actual coffee, he was visibly annoyed and answered that it wasn’t important. A third customer came in, a bearded man, and Orville didn’t greet him, possibly expecting that he would strike up a conversation with the other two customers.  He didn’t, and it was awkward.  Orville seemed happy nonetheless, until the customer asked for a latte, and Orville whined that now he would need to check his “Brewpad.” The customer waited about ten minutes while Orville scrolled on his phone, reading instructions out loud like he was trying to build IKEA furniture.  The bearded man looked at me as if to say, “Is this normal?” I shrugged. Orville made a few different lattes, but would dump them out when he realized he hadn’t drawn a perfect penis in the foam art.  Finally, he settled on steamed milk with mint and ginger.  The man took one look at his drink, told Orville to go fuck himself, then walked out without paying.  Orville was unfazed, and explained out loud- to no one in particular- that if he was in it for the money, he would’ve stayed in the popcorn business. I finished my milk and got up to leave.  The calm music that had been playing in the background suddenly stopped.  I could feel Orville’s eyes burning a hole through me as a I reached for the door.  I turned to say goodbye, and Orville’s face was flushed red with rage, his veins jutting out.  He was cutting ginger aggressively.  I decided it was best to just leave.",

Maybe even the first I’d actually heard since then. I looked down at my hands; even with my gloves on, the constant drawing of my bow and nipping of arrows had left them bloody. I looked to my left and right, at my comrades. Gondorians all, but so young. I had heard the gate collapse, seen the orcs flood in. I’d assumed we’d push them back. I suppose I was wrong. The baying of the Mordor horde was getting closer. I checked my quiver and found it empty. In the distance, I heard him; Mithrandir, ‘Gandalf,’ yelling “Fall back! To the second level!” That didn’t really help us first level gate guards, did it? I’d been issued a short sword when I started as an archer. I didn’t really know how to use it. I could hear the snarls of the orcs as they slaughtered their way up the staircase to our position. “Well,” I said to the guys as they drew their own weapons, “Fuck it, I guess.”",

      "content_preview": "I pray this letter makes it back to my homeland, to show the citizens of the empire the truth of this endless war. My name is Olive Oilus. I am one of 15,000 nameless, faceless human cannon fodder of the Southern Empire's great army, currently engaged in a bloody campaign (one might call it a genocide) to conquer the desert lands of the Aserai to the south. I am thousands of miles from my home in Vostrum, where I was dumb enough to join the ranks of the army as an imperial recruit. Rhagae, empress of the Southern empire, had just declared war on 3 different countries at the same time because she is a dumbass and her lords were going form town to town, desperately trying to build the ranks of their armies to prepare for the inevitable invasions. I was 18 years old and wanted to see the world, so I signed up for the army and underwent my rigorous training of hitting a practice dummy with my gardening hoe for an hour. I was given no armor. I was given nothing, except an injured donkey to ride on as my army marched out of the city. My commanding lord is a 7 foot tall, bald headed, scar faced lunatic called Lord Chad Dominus. I insist on this being a fake name but I've been told never to bring that up. He is a cruel, unforgiving bastard. For example, we marched the entire 500 mile journey to the Aserai desert without resting and only subsisting on fish. The only times we stopped in to a town was so Lord Chad could recruit some more troops or to work on his swords at the blacksmith. He makes swords that, for some unknown reason, merchants are willing to pay their entire life's savings for. Apparently, he is the richest man in the entire empire. Anyways, we march and march until we reached the hot unforgiving desert. My first battle should have been my last. We came across a Aserai lord with 100 men in his army. They were highly trained, armored, killing machines who had much more experience than us, and yet, Lord Chad saw fit to line up us infantrymen and charge us straight up the middle. I was so scared I soiled my pants. We ran at the line of men in their shining golden armor and swung our gardening tools as hard as we could, only managing to kill a few of them before they unleashed hell and killed half of the front line in seconds. The few experienced troops we had luckily charged through and pushed them back, while our archers finished them off. At the end of it I found myself covered in blood that wasn't mine, looking at the mangled corpses of my friends mixed with the dead enemy. And on a nearby hilltop I saw the brave Lord Chad, atop his armored horse, never having even moved an inch from when the battle started. We have had almost a dozen battles since then, usually against various lords and some mercenary groups, and despite all our losses, our Lord Chad continues filling the gaps with fresh new recruits from any town he comes across. Our last battle was not against an enemy army, but against an innocent village. Lord Chad said there was a rebellion that started in the nearby city of Razih, and that the rebels keep recruiting their troops from the villages. So he sent us into the village and ordered us to slaughter the farmers and villagers who tried to stop us from burning it to the ground. We burned all of the villages in the area, even taking their fish to sustain our army. I will never forget seeing Lord Chad cutting down those unarmed peasants with his giant two handed sword. Their screams remain with me. Finally we found and captured the leaders of the rebellion, and Lord Chad executed every single one of them. I am told the Empire is making good progress in capturing Aserai cities to the west, and we are now marching that way to assist them. I hope it is a swift victory, I wish to leave this desert and never return. I am sure more battles are to come.",

      "content_preview": "Journal of Alfred Pennyworth Master Bruce had a journal before he unfortunately passed away.  I think I shall do the same, now that he’s no longer around.  Hopefully the records I keep might help us solve some important cases, and help these new vigilantes be the best they can be.  In fact, I’d like to comment on the progress of each of these young heroes. I’m concerned with Timothy Drake.  He hasn’t been as active as the others.  He spends most of his time in his room playing Fortnite.  When I tell him it’s time for dinner, he does that dance he calls the ‘The Floss ’.  I can never keep up with these trends, but I’m glad he’s happy.  He doesn’t seem the least bit affected by Batman’s death, but I know deep down, his heart is surely aching.  Sometimes when Barbara uses the batcomputer, she notices that he’s been watching “hot tub streamers”, a lady named Pokimane (a positive influence, I hope) and “Five Nights at Freddie’s” pornography.  The pornography most concerns me, but young men have their urges, after all.  I just hope that he can find relief, and not distraction, in these vices.  Robin is a bright young man, after all.  He tries to teach me quite a bit about quantum theory, although I admittedly have a hard time listening, old man that I am. Jason Todd has been in much darker spirits, but more about his own death than Bruce’s.  He reminds me and the others that he’s died very often.  Sometimes he seems to forget, and asks me if he’s died, or if he’s still alive.  Other times he’ll curl up in the corner in a fetal position, whisper about Vietnam, and aim his pistols at his head and pretend to pull the trigger, probably for attention.  Thankfully the pistols are non lethal, as I would never trust him with real ones.  When he’s not in these traumatic states, he tries to wrestle and hit me, and I have to remind him that that’s not polite and no way for a young vigilante to behave.  Still, he has grown up to be a big, strong boy, and when I remind him of this, he cracks a smile even when he’s in the foulest of moods.  The biggest concern I have is with his infatuation with knives, whether it be holding and admiring them, or stabbing them into walls and tables.  He’s one of the most active of the vigilantes, and I surely hope he’s doing more good than harm on the streets.  There has been an increase in stabbings and serial killings, after all.  Though he would certainly never have anything to do with these crimes, I hope he doesn’t take inspiration from them. Dick Grayson certainly tries to be the team leader, but just like his mentor, Bruce, he sometimes struggles to relate to others.  However, whereas Batman was often preoccupied with his own thoughts, Nightwing is most preoccupied with his own rear.  He spends far too much time staring at his hindquarters in the mirror, when he should be practicing or motivating the others.  He even came up to me once to receive advice on which yoga pants he should wear, and what color of nipple clamps would match best with his suit.  I simply replied that whatever would help him stop crime would be best, and to this he frowned.  He asked Barbara for advice, and she replied that he should wear the pants that “made his cheeks clap” and Dick readily agreed.  I must give Dick some credit.  The young man’s agility is second to none, and he frequently “twerks” which he insists will help him build core strength.  I never saw Bruce twerking, but then again, perhaps he might’ve lived if he had.  Like Timothy, he hasn’t been much affected by Bruce’s death, and whenever he starts to feel down, he simply scrolls TikTok, munches on avocado toast and sips a pumpkin spice latte.  I won’t comment too much on the lingerie in his laundry basket, other than to say that it’s probably not from a woman. Barbara Gordon doesn’t care much about the death of her father OR Bruce, and hasn’t once spoken to me about it.  I don’t chalk this up to a lack of remorse, but rather her incredible independence and strength of character.  Like the others, I believe she is hurting more on the inside than she would like to let on, and this is why she spends so much time playing that new game the kids must like, Minecraft.  She tells me her favorite thing to do in that game is luring creepers into people’s homes (not the kind of thing I’d like for her to do on the streets) and she also loves to hack people’s “World of Warcraft” accounts.  I asked if she ever hacks into the accounts of real life criminals, and she said that sounded boring.  Cleaning up her jars of urine and empty Mountain Dew bottles can certainly be a chore, and she is always quick to tell me to hurry up with the dinosaur chicken nuggies (she’ll only eat them if they’re dinosaur-shaped).  But I always maintain absolute professionalism, even when it’s time for me to shave her legbeard, surely one of the most difficult of my duties.  Barbara requires quite a bit of care, but that’s only because she has such phenomenal potential as a hero.  Being both a vigilante and a professional hacker is difficult work, so I don’t fault her in the slightest when she asks me to hold her dew after a hard day of “pwning noobs.” While these young heroes have their challenges ahead of them, I think Bruce would be truly proud to see the progress they’ve made.  The gym and sparring equipment are in sterling condition, as if they’ve never even been touched, and all four heroes have now managed to chew with their mouths closed and avoid burping and farting at the table, which was previously a very difficult task for them.  Indeed, crime levels are the highest they’ve ever been in Gotham, and it’s hard for me to sleep between the sounds of screaming and murder outside and the sounds of Robin playing Fortnite inside.  But my rest is not nearly as important as theirs, and they’ve perfected a system where only one of them fights crime once a night, which allows for everyone else to continue the grieving process and heal from their wounds.  Nightwing once complained that he had been the only one fighting crime for seven straight nights, but relented once the others explained that his cheeks were now in perfect shape.  Overall, Batman has much to be proud of, and the fact that people are still frequently asking for Batman’s help and not the help of these young heroes, only tells me that they’ve done such an excellent job of stepping into his shoes.",

      "content_preview": "I was stumbling through a small island town with my crewmate, Dave.  We’d had quite a bit of rum by this point, when Dave turns to me, and says: “Alright, now that we’re out in the open, it’s about time we discuss some highly illegal smuggling business, shouldn’t we?” I eagerly agreed.  “Right, no better time or place to discuss that kind of nasty pirate business, way I see it.  The kind of pirate business could get us quickly and violently hanged, should someone overhear us.  If I were a thinking man, I’d say it’s about time we loudly discuss that right here in this town square.” Dave nodded.  “Bart, you’ve always been the cleverest of us two, so if you agree, then I think we shall proceed.  Anyway-hey, do you see that man there?” A man with an eyepatch, pirate hat, swords and flintlock pistols stood awkwardly nearby.  He coughed and tried to cover his face- his face that looked eerily just like the one on the “wanted” poster right next to him. Dave glared.  “Somethin’ does not seem right with that man.” The stranger then walked over to a few prostitutes, and stood awkwardly in the middle of them as they danced. “You know Dave, I was going to agree with you,” I remarked.  “But now that he’s standing with those prostitutes, he seems dramatically less suspicious.  Just seems like a right proper bloke trying to get his rocks off, you ask me.  Kind of fella I’d like to share a pint with.” Dave stroked his beard, and replied, “If that man steps even a few inches away from those women, I might be inclined to disagree, and walk over there and cut his throat m’self.  But, and maybe this is just the alcohol- but I’m having a hard time telling if there’s a man even standing there at all.  I have just one question.  Why does a fine gentleman like that seem to be staring unwaveringly at us, and not those gorgeous ladies?” “Perhaps he’s not interested in women.  Wouldn’t be proper to assume, innit?  Or maybe he’s actually one of those prostitutes himself.  Just trying to make an honest living.  No different then us, now, really.  We should get moving, s’not polite to stare.” “Right, right.” Me and Dave continued to walk down a few alleys, continuing to discuss how dangerous it would be if someone overheard us. Dave drunkenly burped, then said, “All this talk of being hanged makes me think I should turn around and stare very hard down the street, very paranoid like.” “You know me.  Of course I’ll have your back on this, my good friend.” We both turned and squinted very hard.  It was then that I saw what looked like the same man directly in front us, so close I could smell his cologne.  My face was inches away from his, and I could make out his face entirely.  It looked identical to Edward Kenway’s. “Well well.  Look what we ave here-“ Dave nudged me.  “Now, I know what you’re thinking.  This must be that notorious pirate, Edward Kenway, who killed our mates just the other day.  But how could such a scurvy dog be with such a reputable crew?” I noticed that the man had stepped a few feet towards a gang of mercenaries- many of which I’d actually met over the years.  “Dave, you’re right!  That’s Pete, and Cooper!  They would surely be pounding on this bloke if he were Kenway.  In fact, now that he’s standing next to them, he doesn’t much look like Kenway at all.  Just a very dignified-like warrior, I’ll say.” “I was thinking more of a cosplayer, really,” said Dave.  “Those pistol swords have to be replicas.  No way those things could really work.  Now, if he had sprinted over towards those mercenaries, I probably would’ve thought they were real, and given him a swift ass kicking.  But since he slowly walked in a very gentle way, my primitive, rum-addled brain wasn’t able to register him as a threat.” “I-I don’t know what you mean by that last part, Dave, but let’s keep going, and pretend this never happened.” As me and Dave walked, we could hear wood planks and infrastructure creaking above us.  It sounded like a man was sprinting and leaping across rooftops. “Windy today, innit?” I whistled. “Aye,” Dave nodded.  “If I didn’t know better, I’d think there was a thunderstorm, or someone staring at us creepily from above.  But I’m much too tired to look.” I groaned.  “Now, why would you even say something like that?  Just thinking of looking up made me completely exhausted.  Captain has had us working too hard at all these execution-worthy offenses we’ve been committing lately.  We’re going to get assassinated good and proper one of these days, we keep this up.  It’s about time we walk slowly back to headquarters, so that any prying eyes would have no trouble following us.” “Aye.  Never had a more brilliant idea m’self.”",

      "content_preview": "So hi, I'm Meridia, you probably know of me as the Daedric Prince of Life and Energy and she with a (justified in my opinion) raging hate boner for the undead.  Until recently I had a problem with some asshole deciding to use my temple as a base for some weird necromantic ritual or something.  Why he thought that was a good idea I have no idea. So some guy finds my beacon in a chest somewhere, I forget exactly where.  So I use the connection to get him to place it in it's proper place at the base of my statue.  You know, the giant one West of Solitude.  You can't miss it, that guy had a hell of a crush on me.  He didn't really understand that I'm more of a concept than a person, and I have no desire to fall in love with a creature that dies so quickly.  But anyway, I'm getting sidetracked. So the dude arrives with the beacon, and lo and behold, it's the Dragonborn himself.  I decide to task him with clearing my temple of that asshole so off he goes, spreading my cleansing light as he goes to purify the temple.  Now right at the heart of my temple is the place where I placed Dawnbreaker.  You remember Dawnbreaker right? It was my partially succesful attempt to create a fire that subsisted entirely on exploding undead to speed up clearing out hordes of undead.  Pity it doesn't work all the time.  I'm getting sidetracked again. So anyway, he comes back from clearing my temple and he has two Dawnbreakers in his hands.  I have no idea how he got the second one, and both of them look identical.  They look the same, they feel the same.  I bestowed them with part of my godly powers and that has somehow been duplicated as well! I just don't know what to think.",

      "content_preview": "“You’ve got this, soldier.” The word echoed through my mind.  But I didn’t.  I didn’t got this.  I was a nervous wreck.  My thoughts were racing.  I tried to concentrate, but this sneaker-wearing hedgehog was so damn fast. I was commanding the Bigfoot mech, and struggling to work the controls.  It was pretty new technology designed by someone who insisted he was a “hedgehog assassination expert” in the research division.  Nobody had ever been trained to use this damn thing.  It had never been tested, but then again, when did we ever test anything?  How about the thousands of faulty ass fucking robots we blew money on?  Half of the things exploded on their own, or at the slightest moment a lightweight animal happened to “homing attack” them. I was sweating and gasping.  About the most I could do was fly the mech around in circles and shoot aimlessly at the ground, missing completely as the blue menace crashed violently and repeatedly into the mech with a surprising amount of force.  He told me he was too fast, and I knew in my heart of hearts that he was right.  My trembling hands grasped at the radio and I managed to call for backup.  The radio was silent.  Then I heard a snicker in the background, and a whisper: “Yeah. Yeah, it’s Jared.  He’s getting his ass kicked by a hedgehog.  I know right?” I turned off the radio and chucked it.  What was I thinking?  There wouldn’t be backup.  There was never backup.  We never had a plan B.  All G.U.N. soldiers did was get pathetically hospitalized by small mammals.  What made me think I’d be any different? The mech was beginning to catch fire and its legs gave way.  I think it was actually made mostly of plastic, which explained why it was falling apart so easily and why it smelled like burnt plastic.  I coughed and wheezed.  The cockpit glass was shattering and from outside I could hear the demented laughs of a meth-fueled hedgehog.  I pulled out a picture of my wife and kids.  I remembered telling my kids I was going to fight aliens and terrorists.  That I would see them again one day.  I imagined soldiers at their door, telling them their father had his ass kicked by a hedgehog so hard he died.  Somehow, I didn’t shed a tear. The flames began to engulf me, but I didn’t dare scream.  I watched the blue menace turn away, content with his victory, not even interested enough to watch me die.  He held out an emerald to no one in particular, and posed as if there were cameras around.  None of it mattered.  My fists clenched so hard that they broke off one of the plastic joysticks controlling the mech.  The anxiety I’d felt before vanished, replaced by severe pain and rage, and then a sudden euphoria.  With my last wits, I wondered.  Wondered how a man could build a life, build a family.  How he could work and train and love and fight and learn and pray to the heavens above, how he could go to church every Sunday, how he could go to college and enlist in the pseudo-military and commit war crimes and travel to every end of the earth and commit war crimes at every end of the earth and at the end of it all no matter what he did there would always be a hedgehog waiting for him, waiting to kick his ass, waiting to homing attack him, waiting to knock his dick into the dirt.  Blood dribbled down my chin and I started to laugh.  It was a joke.  It was all a joke.  Mother forgive me.  I mumbled my last words: “What?  For just one hedgehog?”",

      "content_preview": "I was born in the Legion.  It made me who I am today.  I’m not going to pretend I haven’t done some violent things.  I’ve killed a lot of people in lots of different ways.  Sometimes, violence defines us; it reminds us we’re alive.  But then again, sometimes peace is what you remember most.  I remember when one of the higher ups chose peace.  He chose peace because he was a fucking idiot, and then he died.  Here’s the story. So me and the other troops had spent the last few weeks preparing for the battle of Hoover Dam.  We knew this battle might be the toughest we ever fought.  Most of us weren’t going to make it out alive, but we were willing to lay down our lives for Caesar.  The physical and mental conditioning we had gone through was the most rigorous we’d ever faced, but we were ready. We got to the dam with Legate Lanius leading us, an incredible warrior.  Shortly off in the distance, I saw a scruffy man in a dirty, tacky suit and fedora.  He had beady, insect-like eyes with oversized pupils.  He was nervous and shaking, and was carrying an oversized sledgehammer, which seemed far too heavy for his skinny frame.  I’d say he was about 4 feet tall. Legate Lanius approached and his shadow cast entirely over the pathetic excuse for a man.  I thought Lanius might crush him with one hand… but surprisingly, the two struck up a political discussion.  I was just close enough that I could make out some words.  I heard some things about Brexit and Ukraine.  The beady-eyed man would stroke his neck beard thoughtfully at times, and mentioned Confucius at one point.  There were long pauses throughout, and I’d say the conversation went on for about 20 minutes, while we all stood staring at our navels, taking practice swings with our weapons.  After discussing Bosnian tax policy, Lanius seemed very pensive for a while, and just stood quietly, gazing across the sand.  It was disgustingly peaceful.  Finally, Lanius muttered something about being “black-pilled” and turned and walked away from the man. At first, I thought Lanius had suffered a crisis of confidence, and didn’t think he could fight the man.  But how?  He was a legendary fighter… that couldn’t be it.  Perhaps there was some deception, some blackmail at play? Lanius gathered us all together, and explained that sometimes life is hard, and you have to make hard decisions.  Like, sometimes you gather an army for a legendary battle and then someone talks you out of it and you, you know, just need to chill for a bit.  We stared at him blankly.  He scratched his neck awkwardly.  Said something about a vacation he was wanting to take, mumbled that he hadn’t seen his kids in a while.  He kept trying to explain “the East and the West” like it was some kind of complex math equation, and that the two were somehow cancelling each other out.  He mentioned seeing an article that the Legion wasn’t really that great anyway and even though he didn’t agree with it, it was interesting to look at and all.  It was then I realized that for all his martial skill, Lanius was not very bright, and he’d been duped. We all tried to restore Lanius’ faith in our cause, tried to explain to him that this was a massive conquest ripe for the taking, but he was having none of it.  He insisted that he was going to break the news to Caesar himself, and that if he had been here, Caesar would’ve surely agreed with him on this monumental decision.  I had my doubts. And my doubts were confirmed when a few days later, Lanius was executed for being literally the worst Legate we’d ever had, who choked at the most important battle we’d ever had, to the point we didn’t actually have the battle at all.  I was concerned that we might come under fire too, just for going along with Lanius’ ridiculous order to retreat, but Caesar took mercy on us, stating “I wouldn’t fucking argue with that freak of nature either, are you kidding me LOL.” Yes, Caesar is the kind of guy who says LOL out loud. I found out later that the beady-eyed man had actually been the Caesar’s doctor at one point, which didn’t really surprise me.   I thought he seemed familiar, and I could then recall him wandering around our camps before, taking part in fights, complaining that we wouldn’t let his NCR buddy in and trying to do whip-its in front of us.  In summary, he was exactly the kind of person that Caesar would trust to operate on his brain. Before Lanius died, he stated in his final words that he hoped we would all come to understand the wisdom that the “courier” (courier for what, exactly? Do I even want to know?) had taught him, and that the courier was a true wiseman and a gentleman of honor.  Lanius read this from a post-it note scrawled over in crayon.  I had to stop him from eating the crayon.  Maybe we really will encounter this “courier” some day.  If we do, I want absolutely nothing to do with his “black pills”. They sound like witchcraft to me.",

      "content_preview": "Part 1 I wrote over a year ago, and now got inspired to continue a little bit. It's been almost a year that I had seen papa. Thank the divines I get along with my step sister very well, otherwise this would've been a disaster! Papa finally came home after all this time, but he seemed... odd... His skin was so pale it was almost as white as the snow, and his eyes were glowing bright orange, and looked so mean! But he brought me and Sophie some sweetrolls, so it was all good! While me and Sophie were eating our favorite treats, papa broke the big news to us. We were moving. Up north. Like aaaaaaaalll the way north, well almost. To a mountain, just a bit south of Dawnstar. A place called Bloodchill Cavern. I was excited to move out, but that soon changed. The road to our new home was long, and so very cold. Sophie didn't seem to be bothered by the cold, but I guess that's to be expected from someone who's born in Windhelm. Then we had to climb the mountain, and it got even colder to further we went to the top. Yes, we had to go all the way to the top of this mountain! I totally expected to see a house up there, but I was so confused when the road ended at a cave entrance. Surprisingly enough, inside the cave, there were some trees, a waterfall, and a wall, with a door. Me and Sophie couldn't believe our eyes as we walked down the steps, further into our new home. It was like a castle! A castle... without... windows... We still find that odd. Sophie is sad about it because she's sure she could see Windhelm from up here! And then there's the odd bloodstains. Like, everywhere . Mostly in the main hall, the kitchen, and papa's new treasure room. That last room is really cool by the way! Papa has put all his cool armours and weapons on display there, but me and Sophie don't dare touch anything, but it's fun to look and fantasize about how papa got all this stuff. However, the treasure room is the only fun thing about this place. There are no windows, we're all the way up on a mountain with no living soul nearby. The only exit is on the north side of the mountain. There's an old ruined tower very close by, that's infested with bandits, so me and Sophie can't play there. Luckily they don't get close to our cave-castle-home. There's a lighthouse further south, but it seems abandoned as well. And finally there's Elf tooth... I mean, Alftand. Blegh, I hate Dwemer names. It's an old Dwemer ruin but it's also ruined and abandoned. Why is everything ruined and abandoned? Does nobody want to live here?! Well I don't, either! There's literally nothing for me and Sophie to do here, other than to stare at the view in the blistering cold. The castle is cold and dark. There are no friendly people around once again, just like when we lived near Riverwood. Why can't papa just buy a house in a city so that me and Sophie can actually make friends and have fun? I would ask him but he is never home, and mama Taarie still hasn't showed up either in the 3 months we've been stranded here. Please, papa, come home soon, I hate it here!",

      "content_preview": "Journal of the Dragon King, Onaga 2005 I’ve found some young fool named Shujinko who can acquire the Kamidogu relics for me and bring them to my sanctuary, which will allow me to rule all the realms.  He thinks this is a quest for the Elder Gods. I couldn’t acquire the relics myself, because, well, I guess I could but I’m sort of a dragon emperor god thing, and people look at me weird when I go out and it’s kind of awkward… but with Shujinko’s unwitting help, I will soon have total power once again! 2010 Shujinko has spent a few years training with his drunken fatass master, Bo Rai Cho.  I don’t think Shujinko really learned anything useful during this time, but he did need to attend some AA meetings.  I’ve tried to be patient, but I can’t help but wonder if I could’ve just chosen some sorcerer who could travel the realms in minutes instead of choosing a literal child at random.  Oh well.  Shujinko has collected the earthrealm relic and will be heading to the netherrealm soon to collect the next Kamidogu. 2020 I’ve noticed Shujinko has an unfortunate habit of helping everyone he comes across.  I groaned and watched him collect demon teeth for some Black Dragon loser.  It’s already been years now, and we’ve made very little progress because Shujinko is some wannabe Kung fu master, and insists on learning the “martial art techniques” of every derelict he comes across.  For example, he trained with Baraka so he could learn the use of arm blades he doesn’t even have. 2047 Shujinko… I mean I don’t even know what to say about this guy.  He just spent years on some retreat with Nightwolf “cleansing his spirit”.  All they really did was drop acid and smoke weed.  Now I’m sending Shujinko back to the Netherrealm.  I told him he needed to retaint his spirit so he can travel the realms again, but really I just want him to suffer for his insolence. 2077 After years and years of dicking around, Shujinko violated a curfew and got himself locked up in a prison in Orderrealm.  I sent help to free him, and now Shujinko is getting extremely old.  I’m beginning to wonder if he can even finish his quest.  Still, he runs around like the Flash on meth, so I guess he’s got some spirit left in him. 3040 Shujinko has spent more years meditating and wandering the realms, punching people indiscriminately and running errands for strangers.  He seems to have forgotten he has a quest to do.  He’s probably forgotten a lot of things, actually. 4084 I’m not sure how Shujinko is still alive at this point.  Perhaps the kamidogu are sustaining him.  My dreams of becoming king are starting to fade away.  Time and time again I have asked Shujinko to simply bring the relics back to me.  He nods and agrees but never follows through, saying that he needs to get “more coins for the crypt” first, whatever the actual fuck that means.  It’s not like he’s doing anything exciting, anyway.  At 2089 years old, Shujinko has remained a virgin.  He has never taken a shower.  All of the Earthrealmers have ascended reality and are hooked up to VR TikTok machines, but Shujinko continues to run around barren landscapes in search of people to help.  I once watched him meditate for a month straight, only to get up and walk around after like nothing happened, scratching his ass and looking around like he wanted to microwave a hot pocket.  I can’t imagine he had any real catharsis. Of course, I would’ve just killed him long ago, but now he is too dangerous while in possession of all the Kamidogu, and has somehow mastered every martial art in existence on top of that.  There was one relic in possession of Quan Chi that he never attained, but Quan Chi died a long time ago, and now the Relic is somewhere in the Netherrealm.  Needless to say, the situation is hopeless; I have essentially given up, and my interest in ruling the realms has decreased significantly anyway since there is little to rule over anymore.  I only occasionally watch Shujinko now to see what the madman is up to. 6055 I was watching Game of Thrones when I heard whistling.  I looked to see Shujinko casually waltzing into the sanctuary, announcing that he had finally finished his quest.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  He could barely walk as he placed the last Kamidogu in its place.  After all this time, he still thought he was working for the Elder Gods.  I finally revealed my true plans, and he only seemed mildly annoyed.  I didn’t bother chasing him when he ran away into a portal (I was really hooked on my show) but now I’m not sure where the last relic is, and now I need Shujinko to… oh no… 8094 After finally finding Shujinko, I saw that he had passed away after, according to the locals, meditating too hard.  There wasn’t really a funeral, and nobody missed him.  I ended up crying for hours, but I think that had more to do with the shrooms Nightwolf gave me then Shujinko’s death.  Though my dragon lifespan has served me well, I’ve started to rethink a lot of my life decisions.  I got into therapy and realized I had a lot of daddy issues, you know, because I never actually had a dad and just sort of spawned into existence as an immortal dragon king.  That really does a number on your psyche, you know?  And I made fun of Shujinko for being a thousand year old virgin earlier, but really, when was the last time I hit some hot 10000 year old dragon ass?  Anyway, I’ve sort of outgrown this whole being a god emperor thing.  I think I should go back and finish high school, since my Soundcloud rapper career never really worked out before.  Maybe get into Dragon college.  Learn how to read.  You know, that would be nice.  Learning how to read and write.  Since I had to hire someone to write this journal for me.  Because I’m an illiterate mutant dragon freak and all.  Leave that part out, the dragon freak thing.  Why are you still writing?  You know what, just forget it.",

      "content_preview": "I’m not sure what made me fall in love with Nosferatu.  Was it his skinny, freakishly pale body?  His black eyeliner and missing eyebrows?  The way he ate food out of the trash?  His unabashed confidence when he would pee himself? I was just walking through the city one day when I passed this very small house on an oversized lot.  It was basically the size of a single bedroom.  I guess it would be more accurate to just call it a bedroom, really.  Anyway, I was passing by when Nosferatu creeped out of his mancave and introduced himself, then tried to kiss me after about a few seconds of talking, before I’d even said my name.  He grossed me out at first, and I left after a short while… but something brought me back. I came back the next day and he invited me inside.  There were no lights at all, and the walls were bare.  He had a single fridge with a toilet next to it that looked like it hadn’t been flushed in weeks or cleaned ever.  There were pee stains all over the floor, presumably from before he caved in and decided he did, in fact, need a toilet in his house. He had a shower that was broken and spraying water everywhere.  I think he just gave up on that.  There was also a desk, and an expensive computer that probably costed more than the house.  I was surprised to see a very fancy bed as well, that he said cost him 10,000 dollars- he said it would give him more time to “troll teh forums,” whatever that meant. I chatted with him while he “made viruses” on the computer.  He bragged that he was a criminal mastermind, and I rolled my eyes and went to take out his overstuffed trash for him.  He gave me a sad look, as if I just took his candy away.  He ate some garbage on his bed while we talked, and I… I can’t explain what happened next.  He kissed me, and next thing I knew we were having totally unprotected sex.  He’d realized his single bed wasn’t big enough, so we did it on an extremely cheap double bed he placed outside the house in view of everyone.  I realized I was pregnant not long after, and vomited in his dirty toilet while he modded video games.  He left for his job as a “petty thief” not long after. I kept coming back.  I didn’t care when he tried to steal my wallet as he hugged me, or when he’d fart and wave it in my face.  There was something irresistible about him.  He didn’t seem to notice that I was very visibly pregnant, and was usually more focused on “hacking the mainframe.”  Things had been working out alright between us until one awful night. I came over again and Nosferatu invited me to swim in his pool.  He tore out the pool ladder shortly after, then started building a fence.  I didn’t think to question why… I wish I had.  Nosferatu began flirting with another woman passing by.  He was treating her just like he treated me when we first met.  He even did the fart trick.  It wasn’t long before they were heading for the outside bed, placed in clear view of me.  I was helpless to do anything.  I watched, horrified at what he was doing.  When they were done, she vomited, and Nosferatu seemed to think he hadn’t done anything wrong.  We weren’t dating, after all.  He’d never asked me to be his girlfriend.  And so he had two children from two different mothers.  He seemed frustrated that I hadn’t drowned in the pool yet, since he was “trying to complete an aspiration.”  I cried and teleported away. After spending a lot of time alone, taking care of my new baby and attending therapy, I realized that my relationship with Nosferatu had been incredibly toxic.  Still, I called him to let him know that he had a (admittedly horrific-looking) son.  I heard him have a panic attack over the phone, but he never bothered to visit or meet his son- the one he’d almost indirectly killed by trying to drown me.  I figured it was probably better that Nosferatu never come to visit. I happened to pass by the other day and saw his new pregnant girlfriend in the pool.  Nosferatu was nearby, looking bored as he sipped his soda, ignoring a baby crying in a crib nearby.  He’d gotten a bit fat and was clearly trying to do the fence thing again.  I wanted to say something.  I really did.  His girlfriend was grinning ear to ear as she splashed around- she even peed in the pool, loudly letting out a sigh of relief.  But how- how could I tell her?  That the man she thought she loved was trying to kill her?  How could I inflict the same pain on her that he’d inflicted on me? I left.  And I’d like to say that I regretted it. But the truth was, if it wasn’t her, it would just be someone else.  And I was just glad it wasn’t me.  Every moment I spent waking up without Nosferatu or his bloody, urine soaked sheets anywhere near me was a moment I cherished.",

      "content_preview": "So I’m a guard at Zora’s Domain, since I kinda live here and it’s the most exciting job in this boring city. As usual I’m just patrolling the south bridge, which is also one of the entrances into the city. I’m doing my job when suddenly this small little hylian just strolls in, which is very strange seeing as for a hylian he’s pretty small and we don’t get much visitors anyways since the divine beast has been raining all over the region. He doesn’t say anything and I don’t confront him cause I’m to weirded out, and I trust our prince Sidon will deal with him. Though one thing I did notice was he had a strange slate on his hip, though unlike the big ones that told our history it glowed orange. I could tell just by looking at it, that it was ancient. So I go back to my job and just try to forget he exists. About an hour later I hear yelling coming from the center of the city, right by the statue of our princess Mipha, who sadly passed away in the calamity 100 years ago. The yelling was coming from the kings adviser and from the looks of it he was shouting at the strange hylian who our prince Sidon was beaming proudly at. Sidon told the hylian to try on a special piece of Zoro armor, and it was the kind that our women make and give to their lovers. And it fit him perfectly. That stopped Muzu the advisor from yelling and he stormed off. Now that I’m at this point I should probably tell you about the other problem threatening our city, a strange beast started living on shatterback point, which kinda sucks because me and a couple others liked to jump off it. But we can’t cause it attackas anything or anyone who gets near. So this guy, the hylian goes up there and soon after comes back, not a scratch on him while holding its weapons. He shows some shock arrows to Sidon which I think is crazy because those are very dangerous to our kind. Well they’re dangerous to all creatures but more so to us. They set off for the lake which is weird because that’s where the divine beast is. And it also attacks anything that gets close. Soon Sidon comes back alone. But the rain has also stopped so I can only assume and beat the beast somehow. After about a couple days something crazy happened. A strange glowing ball fell right in front of me and then the guy just appeared right there out of nothing. And soon after the beast climbed out of the lake, fearing the worst I prepared to fight but it completely ignored the city and climbed to a tall point and some weird red light started shining in a line. The hylian left and so far I haven’t seen him. Life is strange.",

      "content_preview": "I woke up at first light as always, immediately stepping out of the warrens to get a breath of dust free air. Dust free meant full of coal smoke from the smelter and the smithy directly above it- but in Markarth you took what you could get. Unlike most of the Reach at least Markarth was safe- no Forsworn lunatics in this city, Markarth is a shithole for entirely different reasons. I made five septims shoving an empty shovel in and out of the smelter yesterday, and today I would treat myself by visiting the market and browsing goods I could never afford. Maybe I’d try hitting on Muiri or Ghorza again too, not that it’d work though. Like usual on the way to the market a guard politely reminded me that lollygagging is illegal. I could also overhear the local witch-hunter asking the same person the exact same question about the same abandoned house for the millionth time like he expected a different answer. The people here are really fucking stupid, but that’s why I still live in Markarth, nothing unexpected ever happens. Unlike Helgen which got burned down by a dragon or Windhelm where they’ve been dealing with a string of murders, in Markarth a man can just get on with his life of doing absolutely nothing of note in peace. At least that’s what I thought until I went to the market that day. A stranger walked in, I’d never seen him before, odd but not alarming. But then a woman was murdered right in front of me, the guy who did it was one of my buddies who worked at the smelter. Out of nowhere this dude pulled out a dagger and started screaming about the Forsworn. What the fuck . Weylin seemed normal before, no idea what got into him. It’s like he just snapped. Now you’re probably thinking this is a coincidence. But it’s not. Everytime this guy walks into this city everyone confides their problems with him like he’s a damn therapist. But no, that’s not the end of it. A lot of the times when he walks in there’s a disaster. Vampires, Dragons, Cultists, you name it, it only happens with him around. I’ve had it. I’d been saving up coin for a potion of charisma to up my game with the ladies, but I’ve decided I’m going to spend it on some hitmen instead. Maybe we’ll get some peace when this “Dragonborn” guy is six feet under. It’s not like I’m dumb enough to write my name on the contract or anything.",

      "content_preview": "There I was, making my usual patrol down the hallway, when I heard a strange noise coming from the bathroom.  Well, it was actually a lot of noises.  First, it was a comically absurd amount of whistles.  Then I heard a bottle break and some cans rustling around.  I thought maybe it was some kind of raccoon… maybe one that could whistle. It was pitch black when I walked in, but I did see a pair of very obviously visible glowing night vision goggles.  I played it cool and went to turn the light on, and that’s when someone grabbed me from behind.  He didn’t actually have a gun as far as I knew, because he just held my head with two hands.  Almost tenderly, lovingly.  This mysterious man didn’t say anything, but breathed heavily down my neck.  He gently guided me in circles around the room.  I thought we might bump into something, maybe even trip and fall over each other’s feet- that would’ve surely killed the mood.  But I learned to trust him as we continued to waltz silently, with perfect grace. Once my eyes adjusted to the dark, I noticed that three of my comrades were laying on the ground, arranged carefully near three different toilets.  At first, I was disappointed.  I thought I wasn’t so special after all.  But then it hit me.  This was his way of saying that after dancing with the others, he had chosen only me.  It brought a tear to my eye. After slowly walking together for what seemed like an eternity, we suddenly stopped moving.  My legs were aching, but what ached more was my heart, as it dawned on me that all good things must come to an end, even this.  Though it hurt knowing I would never see him again, it hurt much more, mainly in the physical sense, when he punched me directly on the top of my head, which also seemed like a bizarre place to punch someone. I woke up later near my dead comrades.  Everyone else thought it was some strange, drunken friendly fire incident.  Only I know the truth. “Fisher, have you gotten to the server room yet?” “I’m working on it, Lambert.”",

      "content_preview": "This short story is written from the perspective of a struggling foreign owner of a small apothecary shop in Khuul and sheds light on their daily trials and tribulations. 8:30, your bedroom, Khuul: Waking up from disquieting dreams and with only a vague memory of last night's storm, you slowly lift yourself out of the lice-ridden cot in your one-room shack. Today, you are going to visit your acquaintance Anarenen, a well-known alchemist, in the Ald'Ruhn Mages Guild to discuss the supply of ingredients for your struggling apothecary's shop. Feeling adventurous, you decide to save the Septims for the silt strider and to make the journey on foot. Your backpack filled up with potions from your supply and your belly with Ash Yam and Kwama Eggs, you exit the door... 13:10, the wilderness, several miles from Khuul: Ash. Ash in your eyes. Ash in your loincloth. And ash in your lungs. Squinting through the merciless winds, you cough violently as you tread on. The blight storm hadn't been the worst of your troubles, only the last: fighting off a full seventeen Cliff Racers, twelve Nix Hounds, four Kagouti and a Nord madman, wildly swinging his axe – and his genitals – you had come close to death several times. Your left arm is broken, two teeth are missing, and blood admixed with pus is dripping from the bite-wounds on your hip.You hear the hateful shrieking coming closer from the skies, grit your teeth, and once again draw your dagger. 17:50, the ashlands, close to Ald'Ruhn: \"N'WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Startled and in confusion, you gaze around wildly and half-mad with pain from your injuries, trying to make out where the shout is coming from. Finally, you turn to look upwards and discern a slowly approaching figure gliding through the air towards you. A robe enwrapped in flames, a staff, and a helmet in cephaloid form that could only mean... TELVANNI! Panicking, you try to run towards safety, toward the beige walls of Ald'Ruhn nestled among the hills, but your crippled legs and your strained muscles are no match against the sorcerer's arcanely enhanced speed. The Telvanni gracefully descends and, matching your speed, he mutters the words of mystery with an intricate gesture of his netch-gauntleted hand. The spell paralyzes you in place and, with a soft chuckle, the Telvanni soars above the clouds again as the Nix hounds close in beneath the portentous sunset. 19:20, the Gates of Ald'Ruhn: Alive! Wresting yourself from the paralyzing curse at the last moment, you were able to barely fight off the Nix Hounds with your last remaining strength. The fractured hip and the horrific gash across your chest bearing witness to that struggle do not dampen your high spirits at this moment; soon, you would reach the Mages Guild and find a healer. Walking, limping, and finally crawling, you make your way towards the guild hall. Your euphoria is soon stifled and replaced with a helpless vengefulness as the Dunmer inhabitants start abusing you: \"Scum!\" \"Outlander!\" \"N'wah!\" You try to ignore the shouts and the teardrops rolling down your cheeks and press on... 21:00, Ald'Ruhn Mages Guild: You are interrupted from your discussions with Anarenen by a sudden WHOOOOOSH! right behind you. A tall figure wrapped in  gleaming robes and silhouetted in magical flames appears without warning at the teleportation spot.It is the Nerevarine, pumped full of Sujamma again. Screaming his lungs out, he jumps back and forth across the room in spasmodic leaps, breaking furniture, throwing books and equipment off the tables left and right. No one dares say anything: everyone knows how volatile the Nerevarine gets when on the 'jamma. Ignoring the greetings blurted out in forced and fearful politeness (\"Welcome, friend! You're nearly a legend around here!\"), he empties the contents of the supply chest meant for the inexperienced acolytes and sells them at triple price to the chagrined Anarenen. He jumps across the room, landing next to a rack filled with soul gems, and vanishes into thin air. Everyone watches, gritting their teeth, as the valuable gems are taken, one by one. Again, no one dares say anything. At first. As poor Tanar Llervi, the enchantress robbed of all her livelihood, starts sobbing quietly, Manis Virmaulese cannot contain his anger anymore: \"Monster\", he grunts out through clenched teeth. Nobody saw the fireball. All saw Manis' eyeballs bursting, his face melting away to leave only his charred skull, his boiled intestines leaking out on the floor. \"Hm.\" The Nerevarine turns around with a satisfied grin and deposits seven Septims into the whimpering Teleportation Mage's shaking hands. Without a word, you walk out, off to the tavern. 02:30, a bedroom at Ald Skar Inn, Ald'Ruhn: Finally, you start feeling sleepy. You had spent the last three hours sitting on the bed, drowning your grief in Greef. Now rest, now all-conquering sleep, now forgetfulness! \"You are awakened by a loud noise.\"",

      "content_preview": "My husband was being eaten alive by zombies in front of me.  My blood ran cold, and I would’ve cried if I wasn’t so scared.  His screams were agonizing, and the sounds of his intestines being ripped out and chewed on was grotesque.  All around me I could hear the hungry moans of zombies, when a noise suddenly stood out: “ Nice. ” I turned around and saw a burly man in a dress holding a camera.  His eyes met mine, but his expression was blank.  He had a noticeable erection.  I… wasn’t too concerned about the photo he’d just taken, or why he’d taken it.  I just called out for help, hoping he or someone else would hear. The man didn’t reply, but looked down at his wristwatch.  He shook his head passive-aggressively, as if to say that he didn’t have time for this.  A zombie grabbed him from behind and took a sizeable bite out of his neck.  ‘It’s over,’ I thought.  My last hope was going to turn any moment now.  But the man didn’t seem bothered.  He shook the zombie off, then turned around and sprayed a ketchup bottle at it.  Then he drank an entire carton of milk and walked over to me. The zombies were closing in now, but I wasn’t sure whether I was more scared of them or the milk-guzzling creeper with the camera.  He came uncomfortably close, told me his name was Frank West, and that there was somewhere “safe” he could take me. I was about to turn and run when “Frank” pulled out a dumbbell and swung it at me.  I fell to the ground, stunned, and as I started to get up, I heard the camera flash go off. “Fan-tastic!” My husband was completely dead by this point, and I broke down crying.  Frank took as many pictures as he could, then smacked his lips loudly as he bit into a rotten hot dog sideways like a fucking lunatic.  He talked over a walkie talkie like a child for a while, carrying a sledgehammer in his other hand.  When he was done with his conference call which quickly turned argumentative after he tried to hang up, he dropped the hammer and started using an entire park bench to fight off nearby zombies, which seemed pretty impractical. He was sweaty and exhausted by the time this was finished, and I decided, fuck it- I may as well follow him.  I was already at rock bottom.  What did I have to lose?  Well, the first place he took me to was a men’s restroom.  He stared at me eerily, then entered into one of the stalls.  He crapped loudly for a while, then got out and began to use the urinal, sighing with relief.  He didn’t say a word to me.  I wasn’t sure what the game plan was here, if there was any.  If he was looking for a bathroom partner, I wasn’t interested.  But leaving the way I came in was suicide, so I waited patiently while he stunk up the room, relieving himself multiple times, switching unsettlingly between stall and urinal at his leisure.  I heard his camera flash in the stall. “Nice.” After that, he got in a fight with a clown who juggled chainsaws, and ran away after he gave me a handbag to defend myself.  Then he took a photo of me and the clown.  I’m not going to elaborate.  I’ll just leave it at that. When we finally got to the safehouse- it took two days, by the way.  I had lived off jelly beans and milk for days.  When we got back to the safehouse, a security guard greeted me.  I was shocked out how orderly the place seemed, considering it was ran by a man who immediately puked on the floor after drinking 5 beers and then stripped down to his underwear before collapsing on the couch. There’s other survivors, and I thought we were all safe here, more or less.  I was wrong.  We can’t sleep.  We don’t know when Frank is going to come back wearing a goblin mask and take photos of us.  He never says what it’s for, and I don’t think I want to know.  He probably sells them to the security guard.  Christ.  We’re all just prisoners here.  I miss my husband.  I just want to go home.  And to top it all off, I’ll never be able to look at jelly beans the same way again.",

Since nothing really happens in the town I work in I don’t really have to focus and just talk to my coworkers. I’m in the middle of a chat when this guy in a hood just comes out of no where and kills my coworkers in cold blood. So obviously me and my coworker poise to attack when these random ladies come out of no where and grab our hands to stop us attacking, I’m able to shake them off but it’s to late, he’s kill my coworker and he’s ready to get me. I’m able to get one hit in before he gets me and kills me. Everything goes black. I reawaken just as it was before the guy arrived about two blocks away from where I was. I hear shouting and clashing of swords come from that area so I do my job and check it out, I see two guys being grabbed by ladies before being killed, I have no time to react and just fight before being attacked and blacking out again. When I wake up again I’m running towards a man standing with a pile of dead soldiers around him. Here we go again.",

The moment arrived naturally, but just as I was leaning in closer he jerked his head back, revolted, and sniffed viciously like a wolf scenting prey. \"Can you smell that?\" He demanded. The only thing I could smell was the lightly seared scent of our growing interest in one another, and I told him as much. The answer didn't seem to satisfy him. His unfulfilled expression is permanently burned into my horror-struck memory, along with the intensity in his eyes and the blinding flash of purple light that took him away. The last thing I heard before he was gone forever and I was left alone was his warcry, full-blooded, and filled with violence. \"I SMELL WEAKNESS!\" Oblivion take me.",

      "content_preview": "I hate Morndas. I got through the last of my stocks of venison and rabbit over the weekend so there was a lot of pressure to get out of Riverwood and hunt. I knew these woods pretty well by now but I still hunted in the hills by my house like always, they're ripe with game. Plus, I wouldn't want to go too far or I'll annoy the Embershard mine guys. Those guys seem cool, especially when they sing Stros M'kai or that beer song with all the killing. Sometimes I just walk around close enough to hear them practicing their \"Never should have come here!\". Their lives usually seem pretty exciting compared to mine. But today was different. As I was patrolling my usual hunting route, two men came down the mountain. The first one, a burly white-haired Orc, was running as fast as he could towards the town. I'd never seen him before but he seemed to know the area pretty well. The second was walking much more slowly and having a conversation with himself about the guardian stones just up the road. Weird. He looked a little bit like Hadvar, the Smith's nephew, but I didn't watch him long enough to find out - the first guy had my full attention. The Orc ran into the town, stopped for a moment to chat and exchange something with that empty-headed bard, Sven, and then sprinted over to Lucan's shop. He was in there for all of 30 seconds doing god knows what before he came out wearing nothing but his underwear and headed for the smith. The Orc rudely interrupted Alvor before he could finish his favourite line about his wares being 'simple and strong'. This strange fellow sold Alvor what looked to be a stack of bloody armour and iron axes before turning at lightning speed to look directly at me. Not to brag but I once took down a bear at 300 yards, in a blizzard, so I shouldn't have been afraid. But I was. The naked Orc sprinted over to me and came to a juddering stop only a few inches away from the tip of my nose. He smelled of burned clothes, horse thief, and death and I still didn't know what he wanted. \"Looks like Camilla won't be spending any more time with Sven.\" I must have imagined it but I'm sure I didn't actually hear his voice, I just knew that what he said was true. I had no idea what he was talking about but some inborn ability told me what to say in response. \"I appreciate your help. Please, take this. Some gold I've saved up from working at the mill.\" Spooky. I've never seen this figure before and I'm even more baffled at why I might be giving him my life savings. I'd been saving that 20 gold to buy a potion of glibness to charm Camilla, I guess that will have to wait. The Orc's dead eyes were still boring into me. \"Can you train me to be better at archery?\" He spoke the question like a command, he knew I wouldn't refuse him. I taught him 5 techniques to shoot his bow and that seemed to placate him. Despite my earlier reaction I was starting to feel relieved. Maybe I had given this threatening individual what he wanted. It suited me just fine, I'd just made more money from training him than I'd seen in months of chopping wood for the mill. \"Follow me, I need your help.\" The Orc didn't move his lips and yet I knew this was what he was telling me. Without knowing why I felt compelled to agree. I had no idea where this was going. How would it end?  My fear was threatening to spill over into full-blown panic. The Orc continued, \"I'd like to trade a few things.\" Again I agreed. He took everything I had. My bow, my arrows, and all of the coin I had just made. I just stood there and let him. I was powerless to refuse and even if I had been able to say no I think I would have been frozen in fear. Once he'd taken everything of value in my possession he stood stock still, staring at me, through me. I knew I was nothing to him, not even a blip on the horizon, it was like he didn't even see me. I thought he would kill me for the clothes on my back, they were the only thing he hadn't taken. Seemingly out of nowhere he spoke again. \"It's time for us to part ways.\" I sighed with relief and started to back away. After I'd taken a few steps I told him I would \"head back home if he needed me.\" I don't know why. Now he knows where I live. The last I saw of him he was running full tilt towards Embershard, slaughtering rabbits, elk and wolves along the way. I ran home and locked the door, not that there was any point, that monster took my spare key.",

Good sushi places seem to be few and far between off Earth, and Earth hasn’t exactly been in a good place since, well, Reapers came in and demolished it. Anyway, I’m eating my sushi, and Commander Shepard comes in. I’m not joking. Commander Shepard, first human Spectre, captain of the Normandy, in the flesh, walks in. She’s wearing a dress and everything. Heels, too. She can run in heels, apparently, which makes her infinitely more badass to me. Anyways, Commander fucking Shepard comes in, and she sits down like she isn’t a living legend. She’s sitting with some dude who I previously thought was just a random limping guy, but that I am now realizing is the Normandy’s pilot. I’m sitting in the same restaurant as a legend and her pilot. I wonder if she gives autographs? While I’m considering this, a bunch of mercenaries come in, armored and armed to the teeth. And then they start firing at the ceiling. Everyone books it out of there, myself included. Without my sushi. I suppose I should’ve seen this coming, given that Commander Shepard seems to have a knack for attracting trouble wherever she goes, but I’m still pissed. Also, the mercenaries destroyed the restaurant. So I won’t be able to get any more sushi from there. Anyone know anywhere else to get good sushi on the Citadel?",

      "content_preview": "I was standing outside the VIP’s suite, when I heard a thud and glass breaking.  I ran inside and the VIP had collapsed, his wine glass broken on the floor.  Next to him was a work associate, a supposed eco-terrorist or whatever who… continued to drink his wine, unfazed. I paused.  I’d never seen someone so enraptured in a glass of wine before.  This bald, pale man looked like a monk who worshipped at a 7/11 shrine.  There was a jarring barcode across the back of his head, but somehow, he emanated peace.  The way he slowly brought the wine glass to his lips, taking light sips, then gently spitting it back into the glass as if nobody could tell.  All around him, other security guards were waving around guns, peeking into corners and shouting over their radios, and this man didn’t budge.  He wasn’t going to let anything interrupt his tasting. It became pretty obvious after a while that this was the guy who killed our VIP.  I mean… he was the only one in the room, and the VIP had lethal amounts of rat poison in his glass, so it wasn’t an accident.  But… I couldn’t bring myself to arrest the guy.  It would be like arresting one of the world’s greatest wonders, a spectacle of nature; a man who, upon hearing the sound of a body bag being dragged across the floor, was only even more motivated to sip his wine. I heard him murmur about notes of cherries and black currant.  I wanted nothing more than to join him, to leave my boorish life behind and truly experience nirvana.  But, as I watched the man’s steely eyes gaze across the sun-soaked sky, I knew it wasn’t my time yet.  This was his time.  It would always be his time.  It was his world, after all; his wine.  His turn to drink.  The stains on his suit.  Were they blood, or wine, or both?  Did it really matter?  Of course it didn’t.  The nearby fire extinguishers, apricots and assault rifles scattered on the floor?  To set the ambiance, of course. It felt like many lifetimes had passed when, without thinking, I called off the search.  It was instinctive, the kind of instinct that drives a man to drink his wine in the face of death.  The desire to indulge even when the stench of death is unbearable, because grapes are just so damn good.  I never have, and never will, see anything more beautiful.  That man was a fucking unicorn.  How could I, or anyone else, hold him accountable for his crimes?  What was he guilty of, really?  Enjoying life too much? The man, forever benevolent, was not even remotely disturbed by my presence.  He set down his glass, which appeared just as full as it had always been.  He was no drunkard, after all.  Only a connoisseur.  He turned, and took out a pair of scissors.  He didn’t need a reason.  Why ever would he?  He held them in what some might call an awkward fashion, and bumped into me on the way out the door.  I was flattered. I got a few calls later about some random stabbings.  I asked if they were scissors-related. “Yeah, why?  How’d you know?” I laughed, grinning ear to ear.  “That beautiful, bald son of a bitch.”  I wiped a tear from my eye.  “He did it again.”",

      "content_preview": "Booker, I know we’re about to defeat Comstock.  We’ve gotten so far!  But, I’ve got to tell you something. I can open tears in reality.  So basically, I can travel through space and time.  And I figured out a long time ago that you and Comstock are one and the same.  Over and over, I watched you die.  I hate you, Booker.  You locked me up for years and tried to ruin my life.  What you never knew is that I, Elizabeth, have been ruining your life this entire time.  It was me, Booker. See, I’ve been throwing you extra ammo.  What you never realized is that I’ve been taking your ammo when you weren’t looking and throwing it back to you.  I’ve also teleported everywhere using my tears and made sure there’s barely any ammo for you to pick up. Just enough that you never suspected anything. All those doors you had me unlock? I put the locks on the doors. It was me, Booker.  I set up those locks beforehand so you’d have to waste time waiting for me to unlock them, then I hid lockpicks so you’d have to waste even more time finding them.  All the while, you were getting older and closer to becoming Comstock so you would die that much sooner. The “vigors” I gave you?  It was codeine, Booker.  Codeine with a bit of food coloring, mayonnaise and crushed-up Benadryl.  Sometimes I added a little bleach.  I told you that vigors were supposed to taste that way.  The salts?  Just a little powdered heroin to slow you down. Those extra coins I found for you?  They were counterfeits.  On each one, I engraved the words “It was me, Booker.”  You never noticed, you fool. Every time you missed a shot, it was because I opened a tear to displace the bullet slightly, or to blow a slight gust of wind at you to throw off your aim. Those times you got shot out of the blue, and thought it was a random sniper you hadn’t noticed?  It was me, Booker.  It was always me. The enemies you’ve been fighting?  Didn’t you notice they always looked similar?  It was me, Booker.  Every time you killed them, I revived them with medical syringes and brought them back to fight you when you weren’t looking.  You’ve been fighting the same twenty enemies the entire time.  But I haven’t been using the same syringes on you, Booker.  Those were just filled with toothpaste, paint thinner and a small amount of crack.  Just enough crack to get you back on your feet, none the wiser. That aching in your bladder?  The shit building up in your bowels?  It was all me, Booker.  I’ve followed you around uncomfortably close the entire time, ensuring that you never have a decent chance to use the bathroom, making your life that much more miserable.  I placed hot dogs, sodas, alcohol and cigarettes everywhere, knowing that your gluttony would cause you to overindulge, causing inconvenient blood sugar spikes and an increased risk of cancer.  I even made sure all the wines were Barefoot wines with the labels changed.  This put you off your game that much more.  And every time you touched metal and it gave you a small, annoying static shock?  It was me, Booker.  I used the shock jockey vigor. Maybe you’ve put it together by now that we’re in a kind of time loop that will only end if you die at the right time.  But I haven’t killed you, Booker.  I’ve kept us in this loop for thousands of years.  I needed to watch you suffer the same way I did, but thousands of times worse.  And it’s never going to end.  Even if you die, I’ll find another Booker from another reality and make him lock me up in a tower again just so I can have my revenge.  Again. Anyway, just needed to get that off my chest.  Let’s get moving.  Comstock isn’t going to defeat himself, you know!",

Last night I saw him running around in his underwear.  Actually, he’s always in his underwear.  Anyway, he started stabbing random people on the street.  It wasn’t no gang shit.  None of them were wearing colors.  Half of them were just prostitutes running for their lives.  And there’s CJ, waving his knife around like a crackhead.  He got a couple people downed, and started seriously cutting up their corpses.  It was real sick serial killer shit.  Not even gangsta shit, not at all.  Just fucking gross. Anyway, he comes into my house after that.  It’s 11pm, and this clown just walks into my house.  He’s covered in blood, with this nasty bulge in his underwear.  I just try and play it cool, but he keeps staring at me and acting all weird.  Then he tells me, “Where’s my hug?  Where’s the love?”  He looked like he wanted to fuck me.  Fucking demented. So I gave him his hug, and decided that maybe this dude needed some food.  He looked like a skeleton.  Kinda moved like one too.  I figured, I don’t know, maybe he’s just hangry or somethin, so I brought him to a pizza place. He ordered six fucking pizzas.  It was fucking nasty watching him stuff that shit down.  I tried to rob the place just so he would stop eating.  He had diarrhea in his diaper-underwear in the car on the way home, and I almost got shot when he rolled down the windows.  Oh, and he also hit ten people and then crashed the car. So yeah, CJ’s pretty fucking weird.  He’s getting fat and fit at the same time-he’s always either at the gym or Cluckin Bell.  Or murdering people.  Or sleeping in his house for like, 3 days straight.  We’re getting too much heat out here and nobody respects us anymore, with CJ jerking off in public all the time and riding his trashy bike around, getting hit by cars constantly.  I can’t remember the last time he made a single cent for us.  His idea of taking over hoods is just spraying paint in people’s faces.  Real petty shit. I want him out of the gang but Big Smoke really likes him for some reason.  I think they just like to eat together and hug each other.  They make me sick.  At this point, I’m tempted to join up with the Ballas.",

      "content_preview": "A few days ago, I looked in the mirror and sighed.  I tried to suck in my gut, but it was no use.  I was 50 years old, and the years were catching up to me.  I ate a handful of cake that I’d been keeping in my pocket and gagged.  It was spoiled.  I took another bite anyway.  Worse case scenario, I’d just puke on the floor, maybe piss and shit a little too. It all happened so fast.  One day, I’m in the best shape of my life, looking like an absolute dynamo.  I was just sort of born that way, when I materialized into thin air at the age of 25.   It’s not like I ever worked out or anything.  I absolutely never exercised ever, ate nothing but grilled cheese sandwiches, and usually went to sleep at 5am.  It was honestly a wonder that I even lived to be fifty.  But I tell you, it hit me like a train.  I wake up on my fiftieth birthday- boom, fifty pounds heavier.  I’m as wrinkly as a raisin.  My hairs falling out, I feel like shit, it hurts when I pee… I suddenly sound like I’ve been smoking a pack a day.  And then there’s an entire cake in my pocket.  Who knows how that got there. The whole thing was pretty embarrassing.  My wife wanted to woohoo that same night but I fell asleep on the bathroom floor.  Just brushing my teeth made me tired. My first wife, no way to sugarcoat it, was always a golddigger.  I’m a famous musician, and she was a total cougar and completely unemployed.  I forgot it was her birthday one day- I never even knew her age before, and apparently she was turning 70.  My god, the same thing happened.  She was a gorgeous redhead before, and instantly became a gray-haired old lady.  I just couldn’t even look at her the same way.  She told me she wanted to have a baby.  I told her I wanted a divorce.  I’d already been cheating on her anyway with the lady who catered our wedding, a very sketchy woman with missing teeth who probably stole things from our house when I wasn’t looking. The old lady was obviously pretty sad after that, especially after I took literally all of her money and kicked her out of the house.  What was she gonna do, sue me?  There’s no divorce courts around here.  We did the whole thing over the phone.  Anyway, I politely informed her that she could head back to her family, but that her much younger daughter was welcome to move in with me. I met up with her daughter, and she immediately slept with me after our first date at the gym, where we didn’t work out but sat on a bench and discussed politics.  We married shortly after.  Her mother came by the next day, ringing the doorbell so she could cry and complain and probably physically assault me, but I just didn’t answer.  What was strange is that I was just as depressed as she was, even though I initiated the divorce and didn’t miss her at all.  I was a full blown alcoholic at this point and my woohoos were subpar, and I struggled to do anything but cry in every conversation I had.  Financially, I was doing alright, and I was still getting promoted daily at work, so that was nice. After replacing my sink with a slightly fancier sink, I noticed that my second wife was getting old again, which obviously meant that a divorce was necessary.  I tried to let her down gently, but to be honest, she really should’ve seen it coming.  I got in touch with her sister though, and managed to milk a few days before she turned 60, which was fortunately enough time to get married and divorced for the third time. I wish there was some catharsis.  As I sit here, rapidly aging and dying with cake in my hand, I notice that everyone around me is getting older and there are no young people anymore.  Most of them are dying in swimming pools and housefires, or traps that have mysteriously been placed for them.  Starvation is a pretty major issue in this city for whatever reason, despite there being a high standard of living; bladder failure is another major cause of death, even though some houses own up to 50 toilets.  I’ve managed to set the record at 75, but there have still been a few moments where I got locked out of my house and crapped my pants, so maybe there’s something going on there. My point being, I haven’t learned anything, I wasn’t meant to learn anything.  I’m the same man-child I was when I first spawned into this hellhole.  Sure, I played guitar until my fingers bled, but I never went to school, or paid taxes, or even learned how to read.  I can’t help but feel like I’ve been a total piece of shit my entire life and that I never had a choice.  It’s like I was wired that way through hard set personality traits, or I was magically compelled to do things I didn’t even want to do.  Why else would I drink multiple glasses of milk and then go for a jog? And I think someone is going to punish me for it.  Someday, I’ll take a dip in my ridiculously oversized swimming pool, and what do you know?  The ladder will be missing.  And somewhere up in the clouds someone will be laughing hysterically at me while I hopelessly drown.  Maybe it’s just me, but I’m always getting the feeling something is horribly, awfully wrong about this twisted world I’m living in, and if I were a psychologist, I would guess that’s why I compulsively sleep with my ex-wife’s daughters to relieve the anxiety.  I can’t understand what other people are saying, like, ever.  It’s all gibberish.  I walked by a “city” the other day and there were no buildings at all, just empty lots.  I saw one lot where a wasted, lone “bartender” was serving people with no liquor license.  The crime rate is supposedly zero, but I see grown men beating up women all the time, usually over petty disagreements.  I don’t know who our mayor is and never will. I’m going to eat my rotting spaghetti, and I’m not going to like it.  It’s rotting because I haven’t paid the bills and my fridge doesn’t actually work.  But when I look at the moldy spores growing, it reminds me that there must be some things that make sense in this world.  When I don’t take out the trash and leave it on my living room floor, it attracts flies.  This makes sense to me.  It’s a kind of zen, and I don’t think I could stay sane much longer if I didn’t cling to it.  So yes, I leave the trash, as a reminder.  The buzzing of the flies keeps me grounded, so that when I wash one dish and the rest of the dishes are suddenly washed, I don’t lose my mind and collapse on the bathroom floor again. Sorry, I think I’m about to pee myself.  This ayahuasca is hitting me pretty hard.  You should really just enjoy the party.  I’ve taken up enough of your time already.  Zabba do!",

      "content_preview": "My name is Leiliana.  I serve as a spymaster for the inquisition. Our head inquisitor- by the Maker, I forgot her name.  Well, we usually just call her the inquisitor.  She’s not very competent, and that shouldn’t come as a surprise, since she was really just a noble lady for most of her life, and then briefly, a prisoner.  I guess somewhere along the way she learned how to stab things a lot.  I suspect she might’ve practiced on small animals like rabbits before.  Those do seem to be her favorite targets out in the field, despite our protests.  She also likes to cover herself in “elemental elixirs” that are surely filled with drugs and will probably send her to an early grave. Despite her unorthodox style, she can definitely hold her own in combat.  I think It’s her leadership skills that could use some work.  In reality, me, our general, and our ambassador do nearly all of the administrative work.  When the inquisitor’s not around, the three of us make up fake choices that we will later present to her, so that she feels like she’s doing something important.  Then we just do whatever we want while she spends hours redecorating the castle.  It’s not like she actually pays any attention to what we’re doing anyway.  The main reason she ever stops by is to try and flirt with us.  My god, is she horny. So how is this anonymous noble lady in charge anyway?  Well, she’s gained a religious following as a prophet of sorts.  The whole thing is pretty ambiguous and is most likely extremely blasphemous or completely made up.  The inquisitor herself doesn’t even believe it, and insists quite blatantly that this entire inquisition is merely a ploy to acquire personal power.  Yes, she explicitly said this during a speech that was meant to be inspirational.  A bit disturbing, to say the least. She’s recruited a literal demon, as well as many other miscreants.  Rather than associate with our most respected military personnel, she prefers to keep thieves, mercenaries and random deadbeats that she finds on the streets as company, probably because they’re the only ones who might give in to her desperate pleas and sleep with her.  I’m sure she has quite a lot of fun wandering around in the desert, high on drugs and “collecting shards” with these hooligans while we take care of real business. I wouldn’t mind so much if she just remained as a religious figure, and let us handle the rest.  But she insists on being our leader, which is absolutely hysterical.  She can’t even find the bathroom without our help.  Despite this, she gives unsolicited input frequently.  Recently, we had plans to take over a fortress with the assistance of trebuchets.  The inquisitor, who’d clearly never seen the trebuchets, and had no idea what our plans were until this very moment, exclaimed arrogantly that we’d absolutely destroy them and reduce their fortress to rubble with our trebuchets alone, with this pompous smirk on her face.  She was wearing what looked like pajamas to an important meeting that she’d called herself- you know, so she’d have some clue what was going on.  She also looked very hungover. I let her know that the trebuchets alone would take hours just to breach the castle, and we would need to actually fight.  We’d already made every possible arrangement, but she comes up to let us know that this battle “will get many soldiers killed” (obviously) and then approves of this plan anyway, as if we cared.  All we really need her to do is go from place to place and do her mindless stabby-stabby potion closing-fade-gates stuff, and we should be fine.  But I’m worried that one day she’s going to get too enthusiastic about her new career in politics and start ordering mass executions to please the maker, and then we’ll all be fucked. This whole thing gives me flashbacks to when I helped the “Hero of Ferelden”.  I still have nightmares about how many innocent men I killed by her side.  I thought it was all for a greater purpose, and in some ways, maybe it was.  But when I watched her kill the archdemon, she flashed me a sadistic grin.  It was obvious that the whole thing was a game for her.  She didn’t care about the costs, or the sacrifices.  Not even when it was her own life.  All she wanted was some entertainment, whether it was taking on assassination contracts and stealing from people as a grey warden or trying to become queen. I see a similar attitude in this new hero.  It’s almost like they’re related somehow, or controlled by the same person.  The drug addictions, the senseless slaughter, the rampant inclination to try and solve every dispute with sex, the hypocritical and hypervigilant enforcement of law only when it’s convenient (I once watched the grey warden murder a drug dealer she was about to purchase from, declaring his actions “highly illegal”) -it’s all uncanny.  They even both have convoluted, ridiculous names that nobody bothers remembering, and both wear overly dramatic gothic makeup and also sets of scavenged armor that don’t match, despite having access to massive armories. I suppose I’ve spent a lot time bashing on our inquisitor.  It’s not like she hasn’t done anything good.  But the list of bad could- well, let’s just say that when this war ends, she’s going to have to milk the prophet thing pretty hard if she doesn’t want to end up executed by- who am I kidding.  Alistair will just pardon her of everything anyway.  He doesn’t fucking care.  I don’t even know what he’s been doing this whole time we’ve been saving the world anyway.  Probably hiking with the inquisitor in the desert.",

      "content_preview": "I came here looking for a fun time, maybe enjoy food, talk about my paintings, meet new people, you know, the usual. Then I met him. He cracked joke after joke, giving me the kind of attention I loved, and I knew I wanted to be friends with this guy. I asked about his work, but he said that he didn't have a traditional job and made money selling things. As the party neared its end, he came up to me and asked if I'd move in. Bold, but I couldn't help but accept. I didn't have much stuff back home, so it was very easy to move in. Everything seemed so normal. After a few days of living there, I was told that my bedroom was ready and that they renovated the basement just for me. But I had been there for days, I never saw a basement. It was then revealed to me that one of the bookcases was actually a door! I cheerfully went downstairs and into a hallway, being led to one of four doors. He opened it for me so I could tour the room. Just as I walked in, the lights came on, the door closed, and I realized the lock was on the outside. Seeing my predicament, I searched the room. I discovered a single bed, mini fridge, small oven, toilet, sink, and a lonesome paint easel. While fear came over me, I also felt compelled to paint. My life became sleep, eat, paint, repeat. Every time I finished a painting, they'd sell it and I'd start again. I haven't seen my friends and family in months. I try to get help, but no matter what, my pained yells of \"Sul sul!\" go unnoticed.",
