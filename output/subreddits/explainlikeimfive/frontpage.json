It was basically kids wearing pants low enough that you could see the waistband of their underwear, maybe a bit lower.Lately, I'll see young men (though often seeming older than high school age, like early 20's or so) \"sagging\" with their pants seemingly down mid-thigh. Way way way low, with a long shirt to match.So like...do they have some kind of belt and garter system? How else do their pants even stay up? Are there clothing accessories specifically for this that people buy somewhere, or are they just cobbling something together? Or maybe are there pants designed to be worn this way? I've never seen anything that would answer this but then, I'm not exactly shopping at the same stores as these guys haha and I definitely don't know anybody personally who dresses this way, so I'm stumped.",

To when our bodies start to shoot themselves we get around 15 years maybe out of 80 before everything starts messing up. Bro why so little? Whats even the point I thought evolution is supposed to make us in our prime why are our bodies so useless?!Edit: I'm 24 and healthy at the moment. I'm just anxious about my body. My dad hasn't been able to get up stairs properly since I was a kid (around his mid 30s)Edit 2: so the general consensus I'm getting here is that we were never meant to live as long as we do, and that a lot of people don't take care of their body the way it's supposed to so the average person start to get problems earlier than supposedly!

      "content_preview": "My friend told me that when our body is missing certain vitamins or minerals, we start craving specific foods that contain those nutrients. Like if we're low on some vitamins, we might crave sweet things. Or if we need more salt, we want salty snacks.I've also heard that people crave chocolate when they don't have enough magnesium, but I read somewhere that this might just be a myth.When I tried to look this up, the only real studies I could find were about pica (craving non-food things like ice or starch) being linked to iron deficiency, and people craving salty foods when they're low on sodium. But I couldn't find much solid research on other specific cravings.So how does this actually work? Can our body really send signals to our brain saying \"hey, go eat some red meat because you need iron\"?Or are food cravings mostly just random things based on what we're used to eating or how we're feeling emotionally?I'm really curious about the science behind this and whether there's actual evidence for these claims!",

The AAA guy had a little app he hooked up to it that said \"BAD REPLACE\" and showed that my starter etc were fine.  So basically, why can't my car just have that app and the thingamajig hooked up to the battery to at least give me a few hours warning?EDIT 2: My car tells me when it's time for an oil change, going simply on how many miles I've driven since the last oil change.  Is there something similar a car could track to give my non-organized-brain a reminder?YET ANOTHER EDIT: What can I do to avoid the sudden dead battery?  I assume I should just go by O'Reilly's once a year to have it tested?  More often than that?  If that's the case, why can't the tester just stay in my car and give me a warning similar to when it tells me to change oil soon?  And going through the replies so far, do we just accept that one day a dead battery is going to ruin our day and hope it's not at the worst time?",

Two members of the House of Representatives have said they would likely read the names of people accused of crimes on the house floor because the victims would likely be sued. The reason they gave is because they have greater legal protections. My understanding is that any libel suit brought against the victims would have to prove the supposed criminal was innocent and that the accusers KNEW they were innocent. That would require submitting to depositions that I highly doubt any of them want to go through. Do libel suits really pose a viable threat here or is there something else I'm missing?Before someone comments that they're after anonymity, there are other ways to do that - they could have their lawyer release the information, or a reporter.",
