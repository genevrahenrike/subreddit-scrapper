Two members of the House of Representatives have said they would likely read the names of people accused of crimes on the house floor because the victims would likely be sued. The reason they gave is because they have greater legal protections. My understanding is that any libel suit brought against the victims would have to prove the supposed criminal was innocent and that the accusers KNEW they were innocent. That would require submitting to depositions that I highly doubt any of them want to go through. Do libel suits really pose a viable threat here or is there something else I'm missing?Before someone comments that they're after anonymity, there are other ways to do that - they could have their lawyer release the information, or a reporter.",

To when our bodies start to shoot themselves we get around 15 years maybe out of 80 before everything starts messing up. Bro why so little? Whats even the point I thought evolution is supposed to make us in our prime why are our bodies so useless?!Edit: I'm 24 and healthy at the moment. I'm just anxious about my body. My dad hasn't been able to get up stairs properly since I was a kid (around his mid 30s)Edit 2: so the general consensus I'm getting here is that we were never meant to live as long as we do, and that a lot of people don't take care of their body the way it's supposed to so the average person start to get problems earlier than supposedly!

      "content_preview": "My friend told me that when our body is missing certain vitamins or minerals, we start craving specific foods that contain those nutrients. Like if we're low on some vitamins, we might crave sweet things. Or if we need more salt, we want salty snacks.I've also heard that people crave chocolate when they don't have enough magnesium, but I read somewhere that this might just be a myth.When I tried to look this up, the only real studies I could find were about pica (craving non-food things like ice or starch) being linked to iron deficiency, and people craving salty foods when they're low on sodium. But I couldn't find much solid research on other specific cravings.So how does this actually work? Can our body really send signals to our brain saying \"hey, go eat some red meat because you need iron\"?Or are food cravings mostly just random things based on what we're used to eating or how we're feeling emotionally?I'm really curious about the science behind this and whether there's actual evidence for these claims!",

The AAA guy had a little app he hooked up to it that said \"BAD REPLACE\" and showed that my starter etc were fine.  So basically, why can't my car just have that app and the thingamajig hooked up to the battery to at least give me a few hours warning?EDIT 2: My car tells me when it's time for an oil change, going simply on how many miles I've driven since the last oil change.  Is there something similar a car could track to give my non-organized-brain a reminder?YET ANOTHER EDIT: What can I do to avoid the sudden dead battery?  I assume I should just go by O'Reilly's once a year to have it tested?  More often than that?  If that's the case, why can't the tester just stay in my car and give me a warning similar to when it tells me to change oil soon?  And going through the replies so far, do we just accept that one day a dead battery is going to ruin our day and hope it's not at the worst time?",

      "content_preview": "What I understand:Low strings need to be longer so they don’t get flubby/inharmonic.You can lower the pitch of a string by reducing its tension, but eventually it will become so loose as to be unusable. You can increase tension by making strings thicker, but if you make them too thick they will act less like vibrating strings and more like rigid bars/rods. You can partially get around this by making the strings LONGER, not just thicker. Hence, double bass: BIG. Violin: smol.I know ‘extended range’ guitars (with 7, 8, or more strings) often have multi-scale/fanned frets which makes the bass strings longer than the treble ones.What I don’t understand:Why do grand pianos have that distinct curvy shape?If I were to naively design a grand piano, it would look a lot like a multi-scale guitar. The length of each string would increase linearly, and the resulting shape of the instrument would be a trapezium: all straight lines, no curves.But grand pianos aren’t like that. I’ve looked inside one and it’s pretty wild in there. Strings going off at different angles, crossing over each other… it sort of looks like a poorly generated AI harp. (Come to think of it, harps also a distinct curvy shape. Maybe it would have been simpler to ask about harps instead…)My thoughts are that it’s partly to do with space saving (having strings cross over each other saves on internal real estate) and partly to do with… physics dictating that it’s more natural to increase the length of strings in some non-linear (maybe logarithmic?) fashion.But I don’t put much stock in my thoughts, which is why I’m here asking!Thank you!",

Why is limiting myself to only 60% of the battery capacity better than having a degraded battery after a few years? Even on phones where I noticed a significant drop in battery life after 3-4years the max battery capacity was hown to be in the 70+%I tried the search function and google but all i found was explanations on why and how the battery degrades/how to take better care but now why a degraded battery is worse than an artificially limited healthy battery",

Last year the table we received and used had charges registered for every element, while this year it doesn’t for the non-metals on the far right (oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, etc.)This is causing confusion, as I’m not sure how to balance my formulas and equations properly. When a formula is already given (such as NaCl) I can get the charge from that, but usually that’s not how the questions are askedMy teacher is currently off, and I don’t think my sub is a chemistry teacher normally, so I can’t go and ask her, so is there a better way to get the charges?",
