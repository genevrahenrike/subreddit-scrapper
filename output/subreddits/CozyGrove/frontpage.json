So basically, at the end of my second day playing, I noticed I still had a quest unfulfilled but when I clicked on it it just said “craft hardwood” and was asking me to craft 10 of those (which was already done) but the quest doesn’t have a character attached to it and I don’t remember anyone giving it to me so it looks like I have no way of completing it. Has anyone run into this before and how did you get rid of the quest? At this point, should I just submit a bug report..?",

      "content_preview": "TLDR: skull puzzle disappeared when I was in the middle of solving it, I'm uncertain whether it was a glitch or not, and this game on Switch is laggy as all get out.  And my animals eat entirely too many mushrooms, or things needing mushrooms or tofu.  Which somehow also requires mushrooms.  There is never enough mushrooms in this game. So I have this game on switch and PS5.  Initially got it on switch but....it runs way smoother on PS5. On Switch there are so many lag issues.  It literally freezes the entire game for several seconds every time the game autosaves, and upon unfreezing, I just randomly walk forever in whatever direction I was moving.  Or if I'm navigating inventory, it just autoscrolls to the bottom without me doing anything. I honestly thought it was stick drift until I realized it only ever happened after the weird autosave freeze thing.  Bought a new pro controller and everything. The other thing it does though I'm not sure how to categorize. I will be running around harvesting resources when the game randomly resets all the resource spots.  Just now I was in the middle of solving the imp skull puzzle and as I was scrolling my inventory and had literally just highlighted and selected the skull so I could place it, it disappeared.  Then the entire puzzle disappeared off the ground in front of me. It also does this with dig spots, rocks, trees, leaf piles, etc.  Ones I place are fine.  The randomly appearing ones just occasionally completely reset so I will, say, mine a rock, and then all of a sudden there's a dig spot right beside me and 2 new grass or leaf piles nearby.  It's just so abrupt. It also only really does this on Switch.  PS5 never freezes during an autosave and I have also never noticed the abrupt resetting of resource spots. I do understand that the rocks and leaf piles and such are supposed to gradually respawn throughout the day, so you can gather more stuff (although honestly at this point I have too much of everything except mushrooms which I never have enough of, especially when animal I've placed gets a sudden craving for Bibimbap (needs 4 tofu),  that farmer salad that wants 3 tofu, the fruit salad that wants 10 shroom skewers, and Sautéed shrooms.  All on the same day.  Like geez.  Eat something else for once lol).  But on PS5 it never seems that abrupt. I guess I'm wondering if there is some sort of actual rhythm to how things are supposed to go?  I just kind of thought that the current day starts at some point early in the morning, and at that point the games decides where to generate the scenery, resource spots, etc. That some stuff stays the same all day, but some stuff like resource spots can change. I did actually find another skull puzzle after the first one randomly disappeared on me, elsewhere on the island.  So haven't really lost anything. Guess I'm just wondering if it disappearing was a glitch or not.  It was just after 11am my time so it wasn't part of one day ending and the next one starting. And...I don't really recommend playing on Switch.  I'm trying to finish the badges off but will likely primarily focus on PS5 after that.",
