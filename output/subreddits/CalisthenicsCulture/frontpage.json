I'm not currently doing anything constantly physical but I am interested in calisthenics. My question is, would it be harmful or dangerous to not start off with an overall body workout and instead just trained towards a skill individually? For example, I jump right in towards exercises specifically toward achieving an L sit, then after maybe handstand push-ups or something idk. Im sure it would probably be easier maybe more efficient to do basic overall body workouts first, but was just wondering if its frowned upon to not Thank you in advance also any tips or good pages / content creators to follow to get into it would be appreciated :)",

AMRAP I can do: â€¢ 50 push ups â€¢ 15 pull ups I weigh about 67kg at 171cm. I want to invest in some dips and row bars, potentially a weighted vest. I want to know where to start by way of routines/plans for someone at my numbers (if that makes sense?) My goals are to gain strength but also muscle definition.

      "content_preview": "Hey guys, I'm a 20 yo guy, going to the gym once a week and training  2-3 more times per week (cycling, running and swimming mainly). I weigh 107 kg (1m87 tall) and I am semi-fit : pretty good arms and chest, quite some muscle and strength and strong legs (180 kg on horizontal leg press), but with a good amount of body fat. My cardio is average (or slightly above) without being so great. I have enough discipline to train a few times a week and stick to it, but not enough to do it every day without skipping any training. What's more, I am careful with what I eat, but I don't restraint myself and I hate tracking calories and nutrients, although I know it's a very useful step towards improvement. I started going to the gym 3 years ago and I am not bad at machine exercises, but I suck at body weight exercises : unable to do a pull-up, around 10 pushups max and struggling to hold over 1 minute in plank position. I would like to start calisthenics, and by this I mean master some basic body weight exercises : being able to do a few pushups for example, or some more complicated exercises. I'd love to get some help and advice on how to start with what I have, considering I have little knowledge about training using your own weight, or about planing your training, rest and nutrition. Thanks for the help, I know I'm asking a lot considering where I'm starting from...",
