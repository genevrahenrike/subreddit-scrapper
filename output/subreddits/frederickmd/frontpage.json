      "content_preview": "Hey Everyone, it's me again, Cody, and I come to introduce our friend Morty.  This was something that I had hoped to do when we added scooped Ice Cream, but sometimes,  permitting and just general delays had us holding off on announcing our rebrand to Rare Morsel .  After just over 20 years in business and now 4 years of myself owning the shop, I have decided to rebrand to Rare Morsel. So, what's changing, you ask, and why? Well, I had been adding different food and beverage options to the shop that I think went well with our chocolate, and I felt we were no longer what Perfect Truffle once was.  We have added Swedish gummies, Non-Alcoholic Beverages, Ice Cream/Sorbet/other Frozen Treats over the past 1.5 years.  And now we have added other quality foods and ingredients that I find missing from downtown.  Such as a small curated selection of Cheeses, charcuterie, Olives, Tinned Seafood, Italian Pastas, Olive Oil, and Vinegars. Much like our chocolates, we will focus on carrying a diverse selection, but a curated one.  You won't find 10 different choices of a certain item, but I can say that anything we bring will be of high quality and definitely delicious. What about the chocolate? Nothing will be changing with the chocolate.  They will still be made here in the shop and predominantly featured. When will the name officially change? We have changed our Instagram and Facebook, along with our packaging is slowly changing as we run through our stock.  For signage, we are awaiting approval of our 2nd draft of signage. So once that is approved, our signs will change. Thank you to everyone who has supported Perfect Truffle all these years, and we hope Rare Morsel will be around for the next 20 years and beyond as well. https://preview.redd.it/perfect-truffle-is-rebranding-v0-7gr93za88kmf1.png",

I work from home so need a reliable connection. In the 4 years we’ve lived here comcast has only had one issue. And finally the cost. It’s going to be somewhat of a wash because a lot of the streaming Servixes I have come through comcast so I’ll be paying for those out of pocket. But looking at Internet alone how have you found them to stack up. Looking for any and all insight Thanks!!",

      "content_preview": "I can’t believe I’m posting this here but I figure a review alone wouldn’t be seen by people. But I am blown the hell away. I am a 23 year old girl and my mom is in her 50s. We have been there a few times and even then didn’t really like him because he would tell these elaborate stories that always sounded like lies about how he saved a little girl dying of cancer by making her feel special with a piercing, how he had customers that would come to him to get a new piercing instead of self harming, yadda yadda. That, and I always felt he was kind of mean spirited. But, his work was good and I don’t have any experience getting pierced. I went to him for my ears, and my mom went for her nose and then she went a second time to get her jewelry changed. My first time with him he kept on talking about genital piercings in front of my mom and I just didn’t feel comfortable and it felt like he REALLY wanted me to get one. The time my mom went he got the wrong jewelry for her and made a few creepy comments. When she went back for a jewelry change he was stoned out of his mind and talked about how he could do this job and even pierce as high and plastered as he wanted because he has done it so long. Today we decided it was time to get my nose pierced. I’ve wanted it forever and she was going for a jewelry change anyways so it made sense. We call and schedule an appointment for 4:15 and arrived at 4:10. He was still with a customer and popped out to tell us with a roll of his eyes to just sit down and wait (“take a seat” was the exact words but the TOOONE). So we start looking at jewelry and he comes out with the customer he just finished with. A very polite and pretty girl! She did nothing wrong! But he started asking her when he should schedule her for a septum and she said she needed to wait because swim season was coming up and he continued to pressure her about how she should do it NOW. So my mom pipes up and goes “oh well if you don’t want to get it don’t worry about it!” kind of just trying to help her be a little more comfortable. He flies off the handle IMMEDIETLY calling my mom an old lady and how “there’s always going to be an old lady that thinks you’re cool and one that thinks it’s too much.” My mom isn’t an “old lady”. We were standing there shocked and he started talking about how he was a small business and he had a wife and kids to take care of and we had no right to come in and take away business from him and she needs to get it. We weren’t telling her not! I even said “oh! Well if you’re a swimmer and season is coming up it might be good to get after so you don’t get chlorine and stuff in it while it’s healing if you start in two weeks” which I think is very reasonable. Again, I don’t know. She is talking with us and me and we’re having a cool conversation, she shows us her tattoos and her piercings and she starts saying her mom would kill her if she got a septum and so my mom says “well, if you’re unsure sit with what you have for now and come back to it later” The guy got so angry he turned red and started to put his hands on the counter real heavy like he wanted to slam them but the counter was glass. He calls her an old lady and accuses us of insulting him, being anti body modification, and told us to get out. We start walking out because wow! And he’s still yelling about how he’s going to call the cops and how he could have us trespassed and how he never wants to work with us again and how he rents the space and blah blah blah. And I just know that if we were men it would have gone differently. I know he wouldn’t have been creepy to me about a genital piercing, he would have shown up to my moms appointment sober, and he wouldn’t have targeted my moms age or threatened us. We were scared as hell too! Why wouldn’t we be if a man is coming at us getting in our space and basically pushing us out? This isn’t a personal attack against him or his business - just a testimony of our experience and a warning for other women in the area.",

Or maybe turn the area into a weekly Farmers Fair. I’d love to jam with people in public, and I think it would really energize the area and help out with local businesses if I could walk the canal with more purpose. It gets boring since there’s mostly just couples + old people. I’d love to shop for some artsy decorative stuff, tapestries, furniture, etc. Tired of driving to D.C and Baltimore just to meet people and go to events when there’s so much space, potential, and new things to see here.! How do you guys feel about the Canal area around Frederick? I feel like I’ve been to towns that are consistently more lively than this city, and I really want to meet more people while still being able to afford to go out. Maybe bring back nightlife? The clubs are nonexistent, residential full of couples/families, with not much to do but spend my money tourist shopping or walking a natural park.",

      "content_preview": "[This is a long post, aiming to be thorough in my explanation. Summary towards the top.] Context: One of my favorite food / bev / dining settings in Frederick has been the patio space in the former Thatcher & Rye / Ordinary Hen -- now 7th Sister space [\"a House of Spirit & Flavor,\" per their website tagline). I know it was the former Volt space earlier before that, with maybe something else somewhere in between there (?). At this CURRENT point, all signs point to: they are a hot mess. And I want them to get it together! The staff in former iterations have always been kind, helpful and really profesh, and the food and drinks over the years have been delicious. I'm not sure what's going on now, but the vibe is off, and that's a bummer. Understood it's a huge space to manage, including the quite large indoor space. But the patio really is a *magical* garden space, with multiple seating zones and options: shade, sun, Adirondack armchairs, shared picnic tables, fireside chairs, etc. I know I'm not alone in considering the patio a downtown Frederick gem and go-to -- for a leisurely drink, a small meal or bite, and a perfect space to meet friends and talk, any time of day. It's the perfect mix of great seating, beautiful surroundings, quiet and private, timeless architecture on every side, and this tucked-away-hidden vibe -- on the patio, you can quickly forget you're in the heart of downtown. My partner and I had about an hour before an event nearby, so we stopped there for a drink last Friday night, for the first time since it re-opened a few months ago under the re-brand. TL;DR: It was *such* a disappointing experience that I'm not sure I'll go back. If they could get it even medium right, it's a space that sells itself. Details below for full picture if you want it, because it feels honest to tell the full story. In sum, if they could just get it more right, they'd be able to give local and visiting guests a delightful experience in what's arguably one of the best city spaces in Frederick. People are rooting for you and want to give you their coins: management, get your service model right so you can take (better) care of the people who come visit you :) Full Notes: Again, it was my first time back after the recent re-brand, so we wanted to see how it worked. My partner and I walked inside the restaurant building on a perfect 70 degree recent Friday around 6pm -- to a slow-ish indoor restaurant / bar area but a medium bumpin' patio -- and we asked one of the indoor hosts how patio seating worked. One host took us outside and led us over to an area of open tables outside, towards the back by the fire pits, and said we could choose anywhere in that section. No further instruction provided, no menus or codes provided. \"How does ordering work?\" we asked. \"Someone will be over,\" she replied. We chose a table, sat down, and waited for about 10 minutes. Nothing was on the tables except for a plastic table number. No code to scan, no paper menu, nothing. Maybe we actually needed to head over to the bar area, we wondered? So my partner walked over to the outdoor Shed bar area [outdoor bar adjacent to the restaurant, serving the patio], inquiring about ordering. \"Someone will come by,\" they replied at the bar stand. We waited for an additional 15 minutes (25 min total by now??), at which point no one had still come by, with even a menu or a greeting, let alone a drink order or actual drinks. 8-10 other guests were sprinkled around the fire pit chairs, the nearby 2-tops, etc., and everyone was looking around, eventually verbally asking each other, \"Hey, does anyone know what's going on?\" Nobody had drinks or could track down a server. One harried server was dodging between guests, looking frazzled and unapproachable, not possible to nail down. At some point maybe 15 minutes into our wait, a food runner -- a confused older teenage girl who definitely wasn't there to take a drink order -- was wandering around asking tables if the appetizer she was holding belonged to them. (No.) It seemed cruel to even ask her about ordering a drink, as clearly she was overwhelmed already and not responsible for that. After 25 minutes with the inability to track down how to place an order, we waved the white flag and stood up to leave. No one stopped us. No one noticed. On the way out, staff in various other parts of the outdoor seating space were all avoiding eye contact with guests, whispering huddled in clumps, energy sucked inward -- not outward, welcoming the guests. It was evident, their discomfort. At the whole operation. Confirming the vibe we'd already gotten. Listen, vibes are real. And this was a rough first impression. Verdict: For a place that JUST (re)opened, to an IDEAL, picturesque space, on a perfect summer Fri early evening, with a number of empty tables, they needed to have it a little more together. (Re: the empty tables comment, to clarify, the place *was* bumpin', but, I'm simply indicating -- we got a table right away, so it wasn't fully *at capacity* yet by the time we walked in.) At this launchpad stage in the game, a few months in, you should be humming on your service model. You should expect a fully packed patio on a perfect summer evening. At the very least you should be humming on the non-negotiables: warmth, efficiency, hospitality, product delivery (come TAKE my drink order so I can give you my coins!!). Super disappointed, because I wanna love this place. 7th Sister, you have an ABSOLUTE gem. Get it together and it'll sell itself.",

Has anyone recently built from a builder around here and know what a ballpark price per sqft should actually be?  (Like actual local builders, not Ryan homes and the likes). I'm wondering if the prices have really just gone up that high or if that's just their \"eff you, we don't want this project\" price. If this price seems absurd, can anyone recommend reputable builders? Thanks! Edit: this price is to build on existing land, not to include the price of land.",

Just found out that for TJ and Frederick highs, if you want to support their athletics department by paying for an advertisement to hang on their fences outside the stadium (for instance the State Farm ad on the fence off Motter), you have to go through an Ohio company, who takes 50% of the proceeds. We were quoted around $1k per year, of which the Ohio company, whose reps also all have bible verses in their emails, take half. Outrageous. Edit with streetviews: Frederick High TJ High",

      "content_preview": "I went to college in Philly and lived downtown for a few years. I really like cheesesteaks and became somewhat of an aficionado. I have pretty high standards when it comes to cheese steaks. I know the place at 228 N Market has changed numerous times lately, and its former owner has a… checkered reputation. But it looks like a new chef is running things and it’s pretty good. I have to say the cheesesteak is legit. Like, they put their own spin on it, but it has everything that makes a good cheesesteak - it checks all the boxes. High quality thin shaved steak. Nicely carmelized onions. The cheddar and Gouda melted cheese certainly elevates it. And the sub roll was on point, very good bread. Is it Philly style? Not exactly. Is it a damn good cheesesteak? Absolutely. Honestly the best I’ve had in Maryland in years.",
