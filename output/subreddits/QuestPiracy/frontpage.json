The wiki says not to use it for pirated content (of course there would be no need for that with rookie). And I've seen a variety of comments on these threads suggesting not to use it at all.  I'd really prefer not to even use it. But I've occasionally seen apps that are normally free, such as DeoVR, Duke Nukem VR mod, and other various free games or apps, that always say to install via sidequest.  I tried just finding the apk for these to just download and sideload with rookie instead, but came up empty handed.  What is the best way to go about installing free content?",

If you have been following the progress towards cracking the quest, there seems to have been an update: https://github.com/FreeXR/eureka_panther-adreno-gpu-exploit-1 It's a public root exploit. If you follow the instructions on https://github.com/FreeXR/eureka_panther-adreno-gpu-exploit-1/releases , you can gain root. This means that as long as you can obtain the APK (e.g. VD is freely available from godin's github for VD - https://github.com/guygodin/VirtualDesktop/releases ), by editing the entitlement sqlite DB in /data/data/com.oculus.ocms/databases/entitlement-db on the quest 3, you can trick the quest 3 into thinking that you own the app, and you can use it. Specifically for VD, you would also have to configure your router to block meta servers from your network (or block the quest 3 from accessing the external web is the approach I took) so that your device can have wifi enabled, but anything that doesn't need the internet, as long as you disable wifi on your quest 3, you should have no issues with. I'm sure that since we have root, there's a way to block the entitlement check service from running on its own, but I haven't gotten that far yet.",

I've obviously spent a lot of time on regular PC/VR/PCVR games and I know that unless you have an online fix, multiplayer is not necessarily built right out of the box for repacks and stuff, if you know what I mean. However, we're getting a metaquest 3 for my friend's godson, and so I'm wondering because you know I side load all of mine through rookie on my headset. I don't really care about multiplayer at all. But he's in that age bracket where you know he'll get the most out of gorilla tag and whatnot. So I'm wondering if for the quest 3 if we use rookie, (because ofc I plan on getting all of the games he wants through rookie) if he's going to be able to play multiplayer or how that works specifically for those types of (sideloaded ðŸ˜‰) games?? I'm sure that there's already a thread for this and stuff, but I just don't have time to look cuz we're literally going shopping for it like right now. So if you guys could help me out with an answer that would be great!!",

But there are a lot of exclusives I really want to try (despite my hatred that they are driving all these things to be exclusive), and portability seems nice. I hear they basically subsidize the headsets and don't make money off them, so the thought is maybe I can just buy the headset only (which will hopefully actually be a net loss for them), then use a throwaway account, never buy any games from them, and keep it offline to avoid any possibility of data mining. Will this idea work out well? I've heard mixed things in my research if some games might for example require phoning home to work or not. I also have heard you might need to do a one time setup online. That might be ok, if I can easily use some throwaway email, and briefly connect from an isolated network just to register, and then never go online again.  Hopefully it is easy to just do that setup, then transfer all games/apps/movies/media/etc via usb or similar. Just wondering if there might be some gotchas or things that will give headaches with this idea.",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, I recently broke my quest 2 out of it's box for the first time in around a year and was trying to pirate some games for it. I have mostly been successful in the tutorials and have a multitude of apps that people have in different videos. However, I can't for the life of me enable the developer mode for my quest. Using lighting launcher and going to my settings and about build then repeating clicking the build number is not working for me and I don't know why. Every video has it blurred for correct reasons so it makes it even harder for me to understand if I'm doing something wrong? I have the torrented game and apps, all I am trying to do is move the files to the obb folder but I can't do it without activating developer mode and I just can't activate it! Any help is appreciated and I don't have any external pc to use before anyone suggests.",

I used to download the games on torrents and then move the obb folder on the android folder and install the apk but now it seems to be more complicated. I been trying to use various methods but none of them seem to work like the Shizuku method with zarchiver. I do have a pc but for some reason even using different cables my pc doesn't recognize my quest 2, it used to but idk what happened. So if anyone can help I would be very grateful, a lot of my games became unplayable:(.",

      "content_preview": "Hello, i just downloaded dolphin xr from the sidequest apps page because it just seemed like a slam dunk, being able to play wii games like sports resort again by using the motion controls integrated with my quest 3 controllers, however ive been having issues, ive been able to start up and play games, but i haven't been able to figure out how to open the emulator menu to figure out things like control bindings and best graphics for a smooth performance without having to just quit the emulator, does anyone know how i do that? Also, I'm having difficulty getting the motion input to behave properly, the controller works just fine in menus but its really innacurate when actually playing something like the sword duel, where i want to swing the sword in a fast motion but it doesnt register, maybe there's no proper accelerometer in the quest 3 controller or something else? either way i'm stumped, and the input mapping is confusing, it almost looks like to map it i have to write actual code that works with whatever i need it to work in the headset, Does anyone know how to fix that? Also any performance tips that could help are appreciated, i don't like having the games slowed down/stuttering or with the audio all bad because it's slowed down/stuttering PS: i know this sub is probably not the best for this question but i have very few other places to make it",
