I am so hung up on the what ifs, should things become intimate-I really want to know what men my age and beyond think.  If you become intimate with someone our age, do you understand that time takes its toll on a woman after childbirth, nursing, and menopause?  Am I worrying too much about this?

On the other hand, there are limits to what I can do, so it is hard to have fire in the belly about anything any more.  I really don't want to be a stereotypical lonely old person....but it is beginning to happen. UPDATE: I just want to thank everyone who left a comment. I've gained some insights here.

What’s even worse, is that there is no solution, only very confused doctors letting you deal with it, as if it weren’t a medical problem. I’m 30 and I’m in menopause. The effects of it are starting to take a toll on me and my life, overall. In a matter of months, my face started aging so bad that I look double my age. In one year I went from feeling beyond beautiful and being an athlete, to feeling the need to hide. I lost my muscle mass, my body is sagging and my joints hurt. I haven’t been able to be intimate with my partner since being menopausal. It just sucks. I feel like I’m not having a fair shot at life. I’m angry, bitter and depressed. And unfortunately, there is no solution to it. Edit: many have suggested HRT. I’m aware that HRT+T is the only known treatment for my symptoms, but I’m a bone marrow transplant patient and take TKIs, so I’m not a candidate. This is the reason why I say I have no options or possible solutions.",

If you want to go about the day, you have to turn off your emotions.  Cut off in traffic? No problem. Insulted by random strangers? Water off my back. Insulted by not-so-random not-so-strangers? Why, I’ve paid good money and take good drugs for this not to bother me (I’m not writing autobiographically). And I’m a Christian (this part is true). I’l turn the other cheek. And the other. And the other…… This stuff hurts. When you live to 73, it hurts a lot. “Well toughen up, buttercup. You’re not in charge of the Universe. Become a Stoic. Amor fati and all that”. So we insulate, and in doing so, it seems to rob us of joy. I love classical music. A new hobby of mine is trying to make sense of Mahler. That ain’t easy. I love fishing. I was sidelined from kayaking but extensive modifications have got me back out on the water. I’m trying to walk more, eat less; inertia is a big problem. There are people I truly enjoy being around, but the number dwindles. Anyone figure this out? Over the last three years I’ve worked my butt off as a 1099. It used to give me joy and purpose, but now the interactions/negativity have worn me down, so now I’m almost completely retired (I have one more week on my contract; I’m not renewing it). When I ‘go back home’ to SoFlo, I’ll stay put for 8 months, Lord willing, and maybe I’ll find a good men’s group. But there are things in my life I simply cannot fix. Maybe Buddhism (as I understand it) is correct. To be is to suffer. To not to be is not to suffer. Everything else is just illusion. And no, I’m not into unaliving. I’m melancholic and I overthink life, but I’m seeking a better way, not extinction. Thanks for listening.",

I do two hours of walking, spaced out through the day, and my body feels worn out—whereas when I was young, I could do so much more. Honestly, I feel like I’m 70! What about you?

Muscles on both sides of neck and shoulders are affected. Mobility is largely reduced though I stretch daily. What began a couple of years ago has increased to the point of no comfortable sleep positions and the triggering of migraines many days of the week. Two surgeons have said they can do nothing (since I do not have pain radiating to finger tips). I have been told the degeneration is only moderate and medical professionals do not know why some feel extreme pain with this while others with the same levels of degeneration remain unaware! Every day I stretch, use ice and heat, apply red light therapy, use a TENS unit and try to maintain regular activities. It’s getting much harder with reduced sleep and increased migraines. I have tried nerve blocks and tigger point injections, acupuncture, chiropractic care and lots of PT.  No OTC meds help. It seems like I have run out of options but continue to hope someone “out there” may still have some relief options. Anyone have experience with this and found a way to manage pain and sleep?",

The study explores the emotional and social impacts of divorce in later life, and how culture and society shape those experiences. If you're eligible and willing, participation involves a short one-on-one online interview (approx. 45–60 mins), scheduled at your convenience. Participation is voluntary, and all shared information will remain strictly confidential . Data will be pseudonymised during transcription and fully anonymised before analysis or publication. The study has been approved by the University of Aberdeen's Research Ethics Committee (July 2025) . If you’re interested or would like to learn more, please feel free to DM me . I can share the full information sheet and consent form, and answer any questions. Thank you so much for considering this!",

There were hard years,stretching food, skipping new clothes, working overtime so they could join extracurriculars. I never asked for much in return, just to be part of their lives. Lately, though, I’ve felt like an afterthought. I tried sharing how lonely I’ve been feeling lately, how the silence in the house is getting louder, how even grocery shopping feels pointless sometimes. I wasn’t trying to guilt anyone. I just… needed to be heard. Instead, my daughter said, “You’re just being dramatic.” She laughed when she said it, like I should shake it off. But it hit me in the gut. I haven’t brought it up again. I’ve been walking around with this heaviness since. It’s not the first time, either. There have been other phrases. Other stings disguised as casual conversation. And I started wondering— at what point does love turn into something that hurts? I stumbled on something recently that put words to what I was feeling. It talked about the exact phrases grown children say that quietly cut their parents down. I recognized almost every one. It wasn’t just me. If any of you have ever felt invisible, dismissed, or emotionally exhausted by your own children, it’s worth watching. It made me feel less crazy and more like my feelings actually matter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwk4o8syRDs Not saying this is everyone’s story. But it might be someone’s.

      "content_preview": "I don’t want to offend anyone, but it’s just an observation I found interesting while living in both Europe and Asia. I’ve seen childhood pictures of many of my European & Asian friends and noticed that Europeans’ (or white people’s) faces change more dramatically, say from age 10 to 25, than Asians’ faces. So if you have current pictures and childhood pictures of some people and guess which kid becomes who, it’s much easier to guess for Asians than for Europeans. Another observation: I noticed with Hollywood child actors that many white people who were good-looking as a child are not so good-looking as an adult (e.g. Macaulay Culkin, Haley Joel Osment). On the other hand, in case of actors/models who became famous as an adult, many of them were not so good-looking as a child but good-looking as an adult (e.g. Sean O’Pry). That’s the case for white people. For Asians, however, people who were good-looking as a child remain good-looking as an adult and not good-looking as a child remain not good-looking as an adult, as their face changes less compared to white people. Again, I have no intentions to offend anyone, but I’m just into learning about aging and beauty. Okay, so that’s my anecdote. Anybody noticed something similar? What would be the reason? Edit: many people are talking about melanin and sun protection, but that’s not what my question is about. I never asked why Europeans look older or age faster. I’m asking why Europeans look more different as an adult vs. as a child compared to Asians. Edit 2: what I mean by “Asians” here is East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc). u/candokidrt mentioned the EDAR gene, so I looked it up and found that a mutation in the EDAR gene found in East Asians cause neotenous appearance. I guess this answers the question.",

Curious how many woman do and don’t go this route. I’m ready to go for it and have been but I feel I have to beg for the damn patch! About to try again soon.

Questions for this community: Do you (or seniors you know) use any budgeting/expense tracking apps? What specific challenges do older adults face with current finance apps? What features would actually be helpful vs. just \"trendy tech\"? Is voice control something seniors would actually want, or is it overhyped? I'm genuinely curious if this is a real problem that affects many people, or if most seniors are doing fine with existing solutions. Thanks for any insights! 🙏",

      "content_preview": "I think the human condition is so unfortunate. Aging is a horrible, undignifying, and humiliating experience. Its onset is so slow too. It typically starts showing late 30s or early 40s. And then, your options get more and more limited. Doors begin to close. Trust me, I know all about the positivity about it these days. Countless people saying they think life just got started as late as 40, 50, even some people said their best years were early 60s. I also know countless people aging exceptionally well. Not enough people are talking about it. I always felt like I had unlimited time in my head. We need to somehow improve aging and our attitude about it. I shouldn’t look “older” at 40 and then still have half my life to live. That’s bullshit. We’re supposed to live it up in our 20s and then just “settle” with someone and still have 50 years left? Most people don’t marry these days. Most people don’t see their life in their 20s as their high point of their life. Youth is truly wasted on the young. They spent most of it not that happy and still crippled by trauma, life’s challenges. This life just ain’t real honestly. I don’t see people having a good time all that much or “living it up”. Not saying they’re miserable necessarily. We’re at our sexual prime when we’re young, those intense butterfly feelings and lust.. and then it fades…I know old people can still fall in love, even be pretty sexually active. It won’t be as good. We don’t “grow”. We slowly deteriorate. It’s not beautiful at all. Trees stop growing eventually. They decay. Branches fall. I think humans should aspire to improve this. If I were the creator, I wouldn’t make it that way. Life should be extended. What would be wrong with looking young until death? I think most people would prefer that, wouldn’t they? Wouldn’t you rather look young than old? By the way, I am 35 years old. I know I’m not old yet, but it’s going to be here so fucking fast. I still feel young. Maybe I can remain young in spirit forever. But I can’t imagine having gray hair on my face and the negative psychological effect that is going to have on me.",

It was the best years of my life. It’s the freedom, the youth, the bliss, the ignorance. How do I accept that I am now 45 and jaded?",

      "content_preview": "It really is a phobia... Leaving the world of young people is almost torture. When you get old you no longer exist in society. And I've already seen testimonials here saying that. You become invisible, because the whole society is superficial and is only made for young people When you are young, you are the future of the country. We talk to you, we are interested in your projects. And men since they are obsessed with young women, they grant you lots of advantages. You have the future ahead of you, everything is possible. You dream big. Then, when you reach 40, the future is nothing but progressive old age and ugliness. You have reached the maximum of your abilities and you will gradually decline. For women in addition, when I read about the effects of menopause... It seems that as soon as you go through menopause, your whole body gives up on you. Even sagging skin I no longer have any pleasure in moving forward in life only to lose my beauty (well, I'm not a great beauty, eh, but I like myself), my vitality, and perhaps part of my health. How do you keep the morale of those who are over 50 years old? I feel like I'm entering a long dark tunnel and I can't see life any differently now. I lost what gave me the motivation to live: hope. The hope of an even better life, the hope of being stronger, etc. Now what hope with a body that will age? Knowing that I am living my last years as a physically top depresses me. I never thought I would turn 40 so quickly (in 2 years). I still see myself at 15 as if it were yesterday. I'm not ready to be an old woman. It's not in my software. But I have no choice. Plus time passes faster and faster, I have the impression that tomorrow I will wake up being 65 years old. Creepy. I'm having a mid-life crisis and I feel like I'll never come out of it...",
