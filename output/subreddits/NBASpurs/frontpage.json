Still‚Ä¶ his EuroBasket play might force the conversation: üìä In 3 games: 32.3 PPG 7.0 RPG 3.0 SPG Just 29 minutes per game ü§Ø That kind of dominance is impossible to ignore. And here‚Äôs the wild stat: Markkanen has never made the playoffs. 450 games. 8 seasons. The NBA‚Äôs longest active playoff drought. He‚Äôs not a stat-padder. He‚Äôs a difference-maker. The mock-up has him in a Spurs jersey. Imagine Lauri next to Wemby‚Ä¶ üò≤ What do you think ‚Äî should San Antonio go for him? And what would the price tag look like to land Lauri? \"",

He just played, and the Spurs kept winning. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the whole story. What blows my mind is he took pay cuts just so San Antonio could stay stacked. No ego, no headlines, just banners. Compare that to today, where every superstar has some kind of saga attached to them. Duncan showed you can dominate without being messy. How many guys in today‚Äôs NBA could actually pull that off?

      "content_preview": "I dont know if im trippin or maybe just dont remember, but I think it was back in the 2013 playoffs semifinals the spurs and warriors were playing and their was a play towards the end of the game were Timmy closedout on Steph and blocked a crucial 3 point attempt that pretty much sealed the game. Any other hardcore spurs fans remember this play? I tried looking for the highlight but just can not find it. I asked google and AI says that Duncan has never blocked a steph curry 3 point attempt! I am losing my mind? Did this play never happen?",
