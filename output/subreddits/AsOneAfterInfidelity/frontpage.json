It‚Äôs weird, I‚Äôm not like attaching my value to what happened, but I‚Äôm attaching his attraction and desire for me to what happened. It frustrates me so much and I feel so inadequate in his eyes. He keeps saying that‚Äôs not true but obviously I don‚Äôt believe a single word he says. It happened 5 years ago and he says he was young and yada yada but why did he have to hide it for so long. He said it wasn‚Äôt about looks (he cheated with his ex twice from what he‚Äôs told me) and that they were texting about what he missed from having sex with her. And he also said he was debating on getting back with her so that‚Äôs why he did it. He always says he wasn‚Äôt comparing but is that not what you‚Äôre doing when you‚Äôre having sex with someone to debate getting back with them? I know everything is subjective but I think in general I‚Äôm more attractive than her other than the fact that she has a bigger ass. And I just feel so stupid that I‚Äôm being compared to her. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I have moments where I think he‚Äôs completely stupid for wanting her over me. Moments where I have some clarity and think ‚Äúmaybe he‚Äôs right maybe he does find me attractive‚Äù. And then moments where I‚Äôm so disgusted that he was comparing me to her that I dint want to be married to him. I feel like he doesn‚Äôt realize what a catch I am. He told me this almost 3 weeks ago after doing trickle truth for years. And we got married 2 months ago. I just feel like he thinks I‚Äôm so stupid that he knew I‚Äôm not going to leave over it even though he says that‚Äôs why he hid it so long. I‚Äôve been trying to be sexier in bed like dressing up and stuff but it feels so performative and fake. Like his desire is fake. Which pisses me off and makes me feel heartbroken because I know I‚Äôm not chopped liver. I‚Äôve been arguing with him about this and he says I shouldn‚Äôt tie how I feel about myself to him but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm doing. Saying that Im being vain. I‚Äôm tying how he views me from his actions! I don‚Äôt feel ugly, I feel like he thinks I‚Äôm ugly. Get what I‚Äôm saying? Any help or advice plssss",

      "content_preview": "Forgive me if I‚Äôm all over the place, I‚Äôve never really told anyone who‚Äôs not my therapist this and I‚Äôm just trying my best to get it out. I found in mid March my wife was having an affair for 6 weeks with a friend of mine (or so I thought he was). Shortly thereafter I was asked to leave our home and our marriage was in limbo. She had ended the affair almost immediately and we started dating each other again‚Ä¶it‚Äôs weird to say that but I have no other way to describe it. From April to around mid May, things were on an upswing, but also she was very much not wanting to put labels or make decisions. In this time, she was diagnosed with Bipolar I and mild psychosis, on top of the already known OCD. Then late one night at my place, mid coitus, she suffered a T.I.A. also known as a mini stroke. She was in the hospital for four days, where she cried that she was sorry, didn‚Äôt want to be without me, and didn‚Äôt want to lose her family. She begged for me to come home. From that point on I spent every night there, still keeping my things at my place, only showing up at ‚Äúhome‚Äù after I got out of work and showered. Due to the aforementioned diagnoses, and other physical ailments, she‚Äôs also developed agoraphobia and constantly in fear of dying. With all these ailments, I still choose her. There is no one I would rather grow old with and I knew that right from the start. The problem I‚Äôm having is, I‚Äôm having a hard time in moving on from all this, and it‚Äôs hard when I‚Äôm so focused on taking care of her. It‚Äôs taxing on me to talk out all her problems and hear about details of the affair while I feel I have to tread lightly out of fear it‚Äôll send her back to the hospital. We can‚Äôt even have sex because of the stroke happening at that time, she‚Äôs now afraid that any type of intimacy will cause it to happen again. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest and see if there‚Äôs anyone who faced a similar situation? I know it won‚Äôt be exact (what are the odds? haha) But thanks for reading.",

      "content_preview": "So my (43M) wife (40F) had an affair with a coworker. All the standard parts of this scenario. We had 3 kids at the time and had sex about 11/yr (always missed December). We worked opposite shifts which contributed to our disconnection but one night she said she was meeting work friends at a bar afterwards and asked If I wanted to meet them up there. I said sure so I got a sitter, met them at the bar and got introduced to her future AP. I think this was right around the day she decided to go forward with the affair. At one point we were all playing pool and she slapped him on the ass to make him miss a shot. I froze. Dead stop. Her other coworkers also froze and AP said it's a good thing she didn't have a jealous husband or they would be in trouble. I didn't want to make a scene in front of her coworkers and embarrass her, so I quietly told her to stop and planned on a deep dive when we got home. Instead, when we got home she was all over me like when we first started dating. She was kissing me so strongly, grinding against me like our bodies were a magnet and iron. There was all the passion that we were missing. I was so happy, I felt desired, needed, and that we had somehow managed to finally reach full connection again. Concern over ass slap gone. Then over the course of the next week she was waking me up at all hours of the night when she got home. she was so hungry for me and I had never felt better about us, absolute top of the mountain. It was like she wanted me so strongly. She was so aggressive with her need for me. For three nights in a row it went on like this. I was getting exhausted and was trying to figure out how to say I needed sleep without breaking any of this wonderful connection. On the 4th night she confessed to cheating and the strong hungry passion went away. That's why I'm upset by it. The passionate sex wasn't for me. I was just a surrogate. I felt so desired, I felt like all the pent up sexual frustrations I had been suffering through had just been validated and all of a sudden she wanted me just like I had been wanting her. Then the rug gets pulled out. That passion wasn't for you. Back to irritated sex with questions like \"is this going to take a long time?,  Is this all you think about? I've got laundry that isn't done. I'd rather empty the dishwasher. Not now the TV is on.\" We moved passed the affair, she took a day job so we could be more in sync (no \"bye, bye, bye\"). I eventually truly forgave her. But our sex life stayed at the pre-affair quality and frequency. In last year we've developed an amazingly strong emotional connection, a lot of our stress levels are down and our relationship feels solid, warm, and effortless. A few weeks ago I told her I had a dream out of nowhere, vivid replay of the night she woke me up to tell me about the affair. It happens every once in a while but this one hit harder than normal because we've been doing so good. She cried, I cried, the dog farted and we all went to bed. What I didn't tell her, because the shame is so unbelievably crushing, is that sometimes I would go through the whole thing again if it meant I could feel that desired and hungered for again. Trading pain for pain. That affair brought me high enough to feel everything I ever wanted just to realize it was all for someone else. Sorry for the TMI guys, having a rough week and needed to vent to people I don't have to look in the eyes. Edit- I made a statement in a DM I found worth sharing. Sometimes I can go years without these feelings bubbling up, then I have a bad run. This man put in no effort, no commitment, no obligation, carried none of her weight and he got the best sex of my life. Update #1 - thank you all for you comments and support. Through this post I've found a lot of very helpful information, comradere, and perspective. Im reevaluating several things and plan to have a clear discussion with her once I have myself figured out. Update #2 I talked with her last night about all of this. I read her my journal entry complete with my new thoughts and perspective. She said she felt bad that her actions are still causing me pain. I laid out all my pain on this one and told her I knew this would affect her, which Is why I had been bottling it up whenever they arose. She asked if I needed anything from her or if I wanted her to go to counseling with me. As I've said, she's a wonderful partner that made a bad choice. I think we are going to try virtual couple therapy. Here's to hope, a future better than the past and the ability to let things go.",

      "content_preview": "So my WH and I are physically separated, sort of doing a long distance thing. We talk every day. We visit sometimes. I'm trying to give him space to work on himself without me around to trigger him, and vice versa. Historically he blamed me for everything. Even when he made statements such as, \"I take full responsibility,\" the rest of what he said didn''t back that up. That seemed to change a couple weeks ago though, he seemed to be actually remorseful, was agreeing to boundaries, stopped making comments about it being my fault, sees now how his friendships with women have been inappropriate and he is trying to set boundaries. He is in IC. We have agreed to share location. He has agreed to no one on one meetings with female friends. That is a big one because he used to claim I was trying to make sure he doesn't have any friends üôÑ because I don't like him spending one on one time. He has agreed but he has also been clear that he is depressed and lonely, and it's hard to do things with friends with these restrictions. Last few days he's been withdrawn, not reaching out to me as much, not acting lovey like he was the last couple weeks, and is back to being assertive about the fact that he isn't the only one to blame here. He said his therapist thinks I moved away to punish him and I'm probably not interested in working on our marriage. Okay sorry for the rambling, HERE IS THE ISSUE AT HAND: He went for a long drive today since he was off work. Yesterday he told me where he was planning on going, said he was going by himself. Today I got a text saying that he was going to turn his phone off because it was almost dead and he didn't bring a charger, and he didn't want me to worry in case I called and it went straight to voicemail. At first I was impressed, like wow this is exactly the kind of communication I need to help me feel secure, thank you for that foresight. Then I checked his location. He must not remember that Google shows your battery level. It was at 60%, hardly almost dead. I didn't say anything... later he video calls me from home to say hi. He said he just got back, and is going to go out for dinner because there is not food in the house. But, he's going to leave his phone at home because it needs to charge. Again he doesn't want me to worry. I check his location again, his phone is plugged in at 60%. I haven't confronted him. I usually confront immediately because I have no self control. But I am so beyond this. I'm realizing that confrontation just gives him a chance to make excuses and convince me that I'm being crazy. How many chances should I give? I'm tired. So, should I mention that Google shows battery level to see what he says? Or should I let it go and work on legalities... because I don't think he is going to change.",

      "content_preview": "basically 1 year since dday and ive been thinking about everything a lot lately. Ive asked the questions and ive read posts here, and read books and listened to podcasts but still dont truly understand what happened and why. I obviously know what happened and my WH has told me why but I dont understand. He lied so easily. he broke my heart so easily. he ruined our marriage so easily. he broke our family so easily. he did everything he did so easily without caring what it would do to me, our kids or our family. His AP knew about me and still so easily decided to pursue a married man. I dont understand how he could hurt me like this. i dont understand anything. Will I ever understand? Will I ever get to a point of being content with what I know and be able to fully move on? I hate sitting here wondering how someone could cheat on their wife the whole time they've been married and continue to live their life daily like nothing was happening. How the hell do you look at your spouse and tell them you love them all while telling someone else the exact same thing and send them some nasty pictures. It's the not understanding thats still holding me back in R. I feel like I got the truth from my WH, but I dont understand. Idk how to move on and trust again when idk how you can hurt someone like this. I just dont understand any of this.",

      "content_preview": "I (24F) am the B. My WW is currently in the military. We are both Christian. I had three D-days, back to back which wrecked me all differently and each felt like they were chipping away at my heart, soul, and mind. For context, my husband and I were apart for about a month when the infidelity took place. He was at his duty station, and I was planning on moving out to be with him. During this time, many things took place, and I had zero clue. We have been married for 3 years, together for 6. He just joined the military a few months ago. We knew it was going to be a change, and had heard of the stories of military couples being unfaithful to one another. We had a conversation, stating if one of us was going to cheat, to let the other know ahead of time, and we can get a divorce so they can go be stupid without hurting the other. He finished boot camp, graduated, and headed to his new station where he would be training for his job. We planned on waiting for the military to move me out, but we decided it was better for us to be together so instead i‚Äôd be coming out sooner than anticipated. Cue to, the infidelity. The first one, was with a young woman, thinking and being convinced by my husband he was interested in her, and that he was single even though most knew he had a wife. I just don‚Äôt think they cared. She had never been with anyone, and she asked him, if this was just a one time thing, or if they would actually develop into something more. He lies, and they have sex. Unprotected. She takes a plan b. They don‚Äôt talk anymore. Second one, was with another young woman, who knew he had a wife, but wanted to hook up. One hook up led to multiple, to them saying I love you, to them pretty much dating, ‚Äúmaking love‚Äù, talking of him divorcing me and marrying her, again, having sex unprotected, and talking of a future together. This is all in a month span. Cue to my first D-day. We had been apart just a little over a month. He mentions a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who he is helping, and they have been texting. Keep in mind, I don‚Äôt text males, and he doesn‚Äôt text females. We just don‚Äôt do this. I ask him how long this has been going on, he says a week. I ask if there is anything going on, because this was out of character for him, and he says, ‚Äúshe told me she has feelings for me.‚Äù I immediately shut it down, and tell him to stop texting her and to let her know they wouldn‚Äôt be able to text anymore, as well as blocking her number. He tells me he does it. I have this feeling of, if she feels comfortable saying that, then other stuff must have happened because you don‚Äôt just have feelings and tell them that unless that door is opened for you to do that, especially someone married. I‚Äôm upset, and tell him i feel disrespected, that he doesn‚Äôt care about me as much as her seeing as he didn‚Äôt block her or shut it down until i said so, and that I wouldn‚Äôt let this happen again. We reconcile, and I move my whole life across the country for him. Move into our new place. Great right? Second D-Day. A few days after I moved out, I can tell there is a disconnect between us. We get into an argument about me not doing enough for him. How I need to be spontaneous, be there more for him, he‚Äôs not happy in our marriage, etc. A huge blow to me, but whatever. He‚Äôs barely touching me, is acting weird, all the stuff. One night we have a talk. Apparently they‚Äôve been texting and talking for a few weeks. She feels horrible about being the other woman, she‚Äôs been getting him food and coffee, they‚Äôve been hanging out, she ‚Äúcares‚Äù, she‚Äôs interesting, she‚Äôs just this amazing girl who other men have tried to take advantage of, and he‚Äôs been there for her to help and look out for. He says he‚Äôs been considering divorce, and isn‚Äôt sure if he loves me or wants to be with me, and struggles to be intimate and touch me. I‚Äôm obviously broken, seeing the man who is supposed to care for me, love and speak so highly of another woman in a way he never has treated me. I break down, cry, tell him I want to try and stay together, we have sex, and go to bed. I‚Äôm hollow. A shell. And then the dam breaks. His phone pings, and he‚Äôs asleep. I get up, check it, and i decide to check his text messages. In the recently deleted, there is a massive text thread with this number. I click on it, and boom, there it is. The sex. What they did while hooking up. I love yous. Talking about me, and how they were going to get married. Being able to never forget her. I mean you name it, it was there. And what I thought, was just an emotional affair, turned out to be worse. Time and time again, he disregarded me, and chose her. I wake him up, we fight, he says i‚Äôm being crazy, and I‚Äôm made to feel bad for his infidelity. He asks me what I want to do, and I don‚Äôt even know. I‚Äôm just exhausted and tired. Third D-day. After about a month of us struggling to put the pieces back together, him defending her when I brought it up, and us just struggling to reconnect, or even know if we wanted to stay together, me thinking they haven‚Äôt seen each other, her being blocked on his phone, and him having been gone for a month for a job for the military, he returns home. Declares he‚Äôs in love with me, and only me. Is ready to move forward. Sounds good. I‚Äôm still struggling, and don‚Äôt know if I can trust him. I have no peace. And a couple days later, I check his phone again. Instead I go on his messaging app where his military stuff is texted, and there it is. Messages between them. While him and I were together. Messages from the beginning of their interactions all the way until she left to another state. Times they met up behind my back, while i slept alone in our apartment. Times they had sex while he couldn‚Äôt stomach touching me. Another blow. Evidence from not just this affair, but the evidence of the other woman he had a one night stand with, and lied about when I asked. I text his AP, and she offers to answer any questions, tries to put the blame all on him, and gets short when I call her out on her behavior. I drop the bomb that he hooked up with another woman before her, who just so happened to be her best friend and roommate, and that pretty much finishes that conversation. I again, wake him up, we have a big blow out, i‚Äôm being made to seem as though I can‚Äôt let stuff go, and again, he won‚Äôt admit to anything. I just grow tired, and go to sleep. It‚Äôs been about 3 months. I am a shell of who I used to be. I care about him, but i‚Äôm not in love with him anymore. I don‚Äôt know where he begins and I end. I don‚Äôt recognize myself when I look in the mirror, and I am drowning. My faith, my identity, and my self, seemed to all disappeared, and I am just there, numb. If I sit for too long, I hurt. And I can only distract myself so much before I‚Äôm hit in the face with all of the things that happened. Truth is, I struggle with the what if‚Äôs, and the truth of the matter. Truth is, he didn‚Äôt come out with any of it. I found out. Truth is, he didn‚Äôt put a stop to it and neither did she, she just moved away. Truth is, he chose me because she left. Truth is, anything I asked him to do concerning her, he never did. What if she was still here? What if I never read the messages or confronted him? What if I hadn‚Äôt come out sooner? These are what I struggle with, and I won‚Äôt ever have closure on them. I struggle with suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, not wanting to eat, struggling to sleep, numbness. I can do my best when we are together to try and love him, but i can‚Äôt say I love you first. I can‚Äôt honestly say I am in love with him. I can‚Äôt kiss him without aching. I can‚Äôt be intimate without thinking of all they did, and how she is better. I can‚Äôt walk or think or see the world without hearing all the things he spoke to me and told her. I don‚Äôt feel I am enough. I don‚Äôt feel wanted. I don‚Äôt feel safe in sharing my emotions with him. I don‚Äôt want children with him. I hate what happened, and how it has utterly destroyed me. I hate that even through all of this, i‚Äôm dependent upon him. I hate that I don‚Äôt want to leave him, even though I can‚Äôt stand to see him sometimes, or think of him, or look at memories of us before. Everything feels tainted, and I feel like every single piece of me that had value, has been murdered by this action. I share all of this, to say, adultery sucks. I don‚Äôt know how to begin to have joy again, or smile without aches, or be a wife after this. I want reconciliation, and I know it takes effort and work. But when I think of it all, I am wrecked, and my body shakes, and my heart feels like it will collapse. I know every position, every word shared, every thing that happened. And I can‚Äôt share this with family or friends because I don‚Äôt want them to view him in a bad light, especially because we are in a new place, and it‚Äôs just embarrassing. I really do care about him, and he has been trying. But, I don‚Äôt know how to live. Or even want to live. I hurt myself while we were apart, and he doesn‚Äôt know. He doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôve had dreams of this. He doesn‚Äôt know I want to die. And as crazy as it is, I can‚Äôt leave him. He‚Äôs my best friend, and he really is a great guy. And even though when I am alone, and think of all this, when I get around others, i talk about him, and our memories. I talk highly of him, and he‚Äôs always on my tongue. He‚Äôs put the effort forth, and he has tried, and is continuing to try. And that‚Ä¶. makes me feel like I again am the problem. I so badly want to disappear, and just fade away as far as possible so he can be happy, and just have a full life. Like this song says i‚Äôve been listening to, ‚ÄúI have a feeling you got everything you wanted, and you‚Äôre not wasting time stuck here like me. You‚Äôre just thinking it‚Äôs a small thing that happened, The world ended when it happened to me.‚Äù Thank you for listening to me. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",

After years of feeling like my thoughts and feelings didn‚Äôt matter, multiple lies/betrayals (not infidelity related) and then finally the EA, I stopped investing so much into the relationship and started investing in myself. These past 2 months I: -Started therapy and new meds -Went out with friends and started going to more social events to meet new people (book club, things like that) -New haircut -New clothes -Dressing nicer and putting on makeup more often -Working out more + signed up for personal training -Started volunteering -Got a raise at work üî• -Stopped overfunctioning emotionally and just put up boundaries instead when he did/said something that bothered me It sounds like a lot but it‚Äôs actually way less energy than crying and explaining my pain for the 1000th time. üò¨ Does he tell me I look nice? Does he say oh wow good for you for putting your health first? Or our kids are so lucky to have a mom that volunteers at their school? Glad to see you had fun with your friends? No, he mopes around looking sad half the time. Looks shocked when I come out with my nice clothes and makeup on. When I come back from something, he doesn‚Äôt ask how it went, just says oh you didn‚Äôt tell me how it went or some other woe is me comment alluding to how I don‚Äôt just share everything immediately with him anymore (used to wear my heart on my sleeve). He‚Äôs torn up by me putting my own needs first when usually I would just go along with everything he wanted to keep the peace. It‚Äôs giving breakup energy to him probably, but really it‚Äôs me just thriving and healing. He should be happy. We should be able to thrive and overcome together. Instead I‚Äôm just left feeling annoyed. Like he‚Äôs trying to pull me back down. Anyone else go through something similar?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all. I have been quietly observing for a while but I actually want to join the conversation even though I don't if we are still going to be reconciling. My dd was on November 14th 2024. My WH and I have been together since 2014. I filed for divorce at the end on 2021 but then we reconciled and got together again (he came back and apologized for the things he did before, he had a gambling addiction and financially it made a lot of sense for me to divorce him). We have been together essentially through our 20s. We have always been a fun couple, traveled together and did everything together and had lots of fun doing it. When we got back together in 2022, everything went very fast and I got pregnant so now we have an adorable son who is 1 years old. When our son was 4 months old, my WH didn't come back home on November 14th 2024 which was my DD. Ever since then we have been in a constant circlar fighting argument over and over about everything (finances, family members, who is taking care of the baby, etc) and all of that always comes with an underliment of his infidelity. He is still maintaining that he didn't actually have sex with her but my gut feeling, how the situation unfolded and the messages I read all point out to them being intimate. He broke off the relationship with her, deleted the Snapchat where they were talking, showed me all the messages on his phone etc. we have been doing therapy both MC and IC (even though I don't think he has been doing IC). And we had a few very good months until this Friday. On Friday I had to leave to go do a few errands by myself, when I left he sent me a message that reads \"So the beers that we bought yesterday, your mom hid those too I see\". This set off a huge fight between us. I have been feeling as though he is trying to protect everything on my parents. He doesn't like when my dad picks the baby up, he doesn't like when my mom makes a comment or something (and I have to admit she does make zesty comments, I always try to go and talk to her and explain to her how it hurts everyone and ask her not to do it but it's not always successful), etc. So I went on and wrote a whole paragraph about how I felt truly and I decided to show it to him because I thought that he would understand where I am coming from and how it hurts me that he is creating a toxic environment in my house. I don't want this post to be crazy long but it's so hard to explain everything in a small number of words and I feel like our situation is so much more complicated because of the baby, living with my parents and because of a past betrayal (financially through gambling), that I almost always think I am crazy for keep try to reconcile. Anyway, we have been going back and forth and we got to a point where he keeps saying \"it takes two to tango\", \"I wouldn't have done it if you have been meeting my needs\", \"it was just a conversation\" etc etc etc. I told him that he is deflecting and minimizing the issue and that he hasn't been very accountable and he is shifting the blame for the affair onto me. I need advice. I have been searching and reading everyone's posts on here and I saw some positive some negative but I just don't know what to do at this point. I feel like he was taking responsibility before but now he is not and he is saying that even in the book it says that it's a dynamic of both people that created the affair. I don't think so and I refuse to let him keep this narrative but I don't know what to do. Just stop talking with him? Or tell him that reconciliation is out? I don't understand why he is doing it and I feel betrayed all over again.",

My wife (32f) told me (31m) she had cheated on me with a coworker two times in/around August to October in 2021. Obviously I was heartbroken. My wife and I were each other‚Äôs firsts and had never done anything sexual with anybody else outside of each other. (We‚Äôve been married ten years together thirteen. Liked each other since elementary school) Two days after she told me of this she then told me she had another affair with a coworker who is twice her age and married with adult children. This obviously cut even more. Fast forward to now and I am now at a place mentally where I am still angry and heartbroken and also apathetic. Anymore I just want to keep the peace because of our two children but still hold animosity and disgust. Lately I have gotten to the point where having sex with her disgusts me. All I think of is the affairs and it‚Äôs hard for me to even finish and she questions now whether I still love her or find her attractive which I do but I am so disgusted anymore by everything that‚Äôs it‚Äôs hard to engage in sexual acts. How am I supposed to feel when something that was exclusive and special for us has been violated by two other pieces of garbage?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all. I have an important question for all that are working on recovery/reconciliation. For context. I‚Äôm 9 months out from discovery. My husband is doing the work on paper.... therapy every week, SA meetings, IFS group. He‚Äôs been consistent for about a month now, on his own, which is better than before. (He a PA who acted out online and IRL for years) But what‚Äôs still missing is the most basic part. In real time, when I‚Äôm hurting or spiraling, he doesn‚Äôt show up. This happens often when he's out. He either freezes, delays, or spirals into shame about himself nit being good enough to offer the support I need. Later he apologizes and tries to repair, but by then I‚Äôve already felt erased and unsafe. I‚Äôve repeated this dynamic over and over, and it‚Äôs exhausting. It feels like I‚Äôm still at step one, teaching him the basics of what love looks like. That when I tell him I'm spiraling, I need his presence and I need him to make me feel like the priority. I‚Äôm not asking for perfection, I just want to know if empathy and presence can actually be learned in recovery. Has anyone seen their partner go from this kind of selfishness to being able to consistently show up? How long did it take, and what specifically helped? This is really the only missing piece for me. If there‚Äôs no hope of it changing, then I don‚Äôt see how I can keep going in this marriage. I feel like I've poured my entire self into trying to save our marriage, but I still feel unseen and exhausted.",

      "content_preview": "My D -Day was 3 days back. Caught her insta messages to her co- worker. From her messages it was evident that it was a full blown affair. I broke down so much that I never thought I would react this way. I always thought I will be angry. I was crying my lungs out imagining them having sex all the time and when she has been rejecting me for lately for atleast 3 months. From her messages it has been going on at least since April and explicitly said they‚Äôve made out in the parking lots and has been sexting a lot. From her google timeline I can see that she has been to his house. I had imagined them having sex all the time but my WW says it was just kissing and sexting. She said she was sexting with him but never was that comfortable to have sex. I find it very difficult to believe that, when she has gone to his house multiple times. Initially I was spiraling thinking all the sordid details but felt better knowing they didn‚Äôt have sex. However I am finding it very difficult to believe  that they never had sex. All I can think now is if she is telling the truth. She swears it on her dead mother and our kids. After sexting typically you are bursting to do it. Here they had opportunity and space. I know she loves me and she says she doesn‚Äôt care much for this guy and that I possibly believe based on their chats. Is she telling the truth or minimizing the impact.",

That really opened my eyes to how tightly I was hanging onto my evidence for leaving. And finally I just had the breakthrough that I didn't want to be married anymore. And from there it still took about a month of checking I was for sure and slowly communicating to him that I didn't see a way forward. I am thankful that he is accepting and also finding hope in the possibility of a new way to relate. I am so thankful for this community and I wish you all the best in your own journeys.",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm having a bad day which nearly all days feel like bad days now. Over 12 years I gave up, walked away from and ‚Äòreprioritised‚Äô for us so many times.  Each and every time those we were my choices. I own that but I feel like I‚Äôve wasted so much of my life. I thought it was just a part of growing up that not all your plans work out, that if you want something, -really- want something you need to give it everything or it‚Äôs most likely going to fail. I missed the mark on so many things growing up because I spent the entire time firefighting my family situation and by the time I realised what was happening and what I was doing, a lot of those doors were closed to me and then I closed the last ones because I had ‚Äúher.‚Äù I was at that point in my life where I knew I had to accept somethings just aren‚Äôt going to work out but if you can find happiness in one thing then that‚Äôs enough and I thought she‚Äôs it. She‚Äôs everything. No she was not perfect, I‚Äôm definitely not but we could carve out a small life for us in all of this. Not small in love but just - we both didn‚Äôt want kids, we‚Äôd get a house, a couple pets, we‚Äôd both do the ‚Äústill trying to find my dream job dance‚Äù but our lives would be filled with making each others happy. If my life didn‚Äôt amount to anything else, I was happy with that. Our life until now definitely wasn‚Äôt perfect. We‚Äôve fought over small things and some serious stuff too but I always thought ‚Äúthis is worth it. She‚Äôs worth it. I need to be worthy of her.‚Äù Honestly the most damage done has been caused by Disney‚Äôs Robin Hood. ‚ÄúFaint heart never won fair lady.‚Äù Might of well have carved that into my brain. I‚Äôd reconnect after every fight, I took down all my walls, I made sure we never went without, that I loved her would never be in question, that in this world where we‚Äôd both been hurt by our families and ‚Äúeverything else‚Äù, -I- would always be there. ‚ÄúUs before all else‚Äù. And now everything is burning. She‚Äôs taken time and did more damage before getting to here but now she‚Äôs ‚Äúdoing what you‚Äôd want an WP to do‚Äù but.. Christ. What was ‚Äòours‚Äô I now share with the ghosts of who she chose over me. That with no matter how much I carved out of myself for her, it was irrelevant because she‚Äôd always find a way to excuse herself, that I wasn‚Äôt enough. That I was deserving of such little love and respect that it took it happening to a friend before I was even told and I had to find the rest out myself and even now I highly doubt I have the whole picture. That at my most vulnerable she threw me to her own abusers growing up because she had to protect herself. That all my family and friends see me as broken as I am because even despite all of this I‚Äôm still here going ‚Äúmaybe it can saved?‚Äù. That every medical professional I‚Äôve seen has the same wide response when I talk about where I‚Äôm at and what‚Äôs happened. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your choice now, you need to get to a place you can decide‚Äù. The only thing I want is to unplug how I feel and break the port. I wanted that life so badly and now it‚Äôs gone, it can‚Äôt exist with everything that‚Äôs happened. I have to find something else, something even less than what I have already gave so much for. It‚Äôs not fair. I don‚Äôt sleep anymore. I talk to my GP, my therapist, my friends and family where I can but I can see how much it hurts them to see me like this. I don‚Äôt want to cause anyone any pain. I hate who I‚Äôve become and the only answer I have is ‚Äúgive it time.‚Äù",

However, I get so triggered when he gets these cold sores. Today, he accidentally shared a drink with our daughter and I about lost it. I‚Äôm so sick to my stomach. The thought of her possibly getting something from her dad‚Äôs mistake, shatters me. I know it was an accident and I have to move forward, but how freaking careless? I know you could say ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a cold sore, people get them.‚Äù But to me, it is so much more than that. I‚Äôm worried and hurting for my daughter, or any of my kids if they get it from him.

I handed my heart over to you trusting that you‚Äôd protect it, that you‚Äôd be incapable of hurting me like this, my trust reinforced by our shared understanding of how much cheating experienced in our previous relationships hurt us both. Your own heart knew that pain and yet you chose it for me anyway. For some validation and attention from someone you say you don‚Äôt even like, don‚Äôt even fancy, for someone who was already married themselves and who you must have realised had questionable morals and was insecure and selfish, you gambled my heart and my mental health, my security and safety, my emotional investment of 15 years, my future hopes, and decided it was worth the risk. And you lost. My wellbeing was hanging on a thread at the mercy of your choices all year and I never even knew. I had no say in any of it and now you‚Äôve damaged all those things for the rest of my life just to fill your own needs-needs I was trying my hardest to meet despite your lack of communication. I feel I‚Äôve been handed a life sentence of anxiety, of mistrust, of being asssulted by images I don‚Äôt want to see, of my first thought every morning being one of utter disbelief and disappointment. The crushing reminder hits within seconds of waking that this is my life now. Without something to distract my thoughts, my mind forces me to replay images of you being intimate with someone else in every way you were with me-images of moments you say you can‚Äôt even remember but I‚Äôll never be able to forget.I get to imagine all the things you said and did to each other over and over every day. Things you said and did before coming straight back to me as though nothing had happened and telling me you love me and that I‚Äôm your whole world. How is that love? And now I get to feel guilty for not being able to get over it like so many others seem to do. Guilty for asking you to leave the home we‚Äôve built if I can‚Äôt move past it. Guilty that I can see you now making so much effort but it all feels too little, too late. Guilty for not being able to see in you the man I once did-the one who could never do this. Guilty that my attraction for you has been extinguished by your actions and disgust has taken its place. Guilty for reducing the time our children get to spend with you if we separate. Guilty that I can see written all over your face, your fears about your own future and that you‚Äôre crushed by what you‚Äôve done and the sheer pointlessness of it all. You‚Äôve transferred all the weight of your own insecurities on to my shoulders and made life so unbearably heavy. It‚Äôs beyond unfair. What a gamble!",

      "content_preview": "edited and reposted because it was taken down by mods You can read my post history for some background. TLDR - caught WH having A with long time friend when I was 5 months pregnant. AP befriended me during A and was also married. She lived across the country and all contact stopped after DDay. I told OBS and we had trickle truth and other DDays for the last 2 years. Recently we‚Äôve been with a new marriage counselor making progress. He‚Äôs been in individual therapy discovering his why and unpacking childhood stuff. Well on my birthday at the beginning of August he slipped up about talking to a female we both work with. I was 37 weeks pregnant. I confronted them both about boundary crossing and how it was inappropriate what they talked about and how much they talked. I could tell messages were missing. WH proceeded to yell at me. Told me I was annoying and to fuck off. AP said she hated me and was horrible. He took her side and let the opinion of someone he had known for 21 days erase years of knowing me. I started to bleed from the stress and she told him I was manipulating him and controlling him into talking to me. I was left alone for 2 weeks, 9 months pregnant with our toddler while he continued to fuck around. After 2 weeks he agreed to sit down and tell me everything. Ended up deciding he wasn‚Äôt ready and left to go meet up with AP. Told her he was gonna come clean and she got mad saying she only had sex with him so he would protect her. She said she was going to kill herself. He ended up bailing on spending the afternoon with our toddler and went to her therapy appt with her‚Ä¶ The next day (8/15) finally came clean. On DDay they had only sexted and exchanged photos. But after I found out he spent the two weeks he ‚Äúneeded time and space to think‚Äù getting blow jobs and having sex in our car. Again, while I‚Äôm now 38 weeks pregnant and have our toddler. Basically he was ready to call it off with her. Said he would do whatever it takes to fix this. Would tell her husband and sell the car. Well they met up to talk two days ago and she told him she loves him (after 21 days of knowing each other) and she wants to leave her marriage. Said she is taking a month ‚Äúoff‚Äù from her marriage to fool around and wants to do it with him. He admitted in his perfect world he gets his month with her and then comes back to work on us. I‚Äôm not naive. It won‚Äôt end after a month and I can‚Äôt wait around for a month while he continues to cake eat. I have proven she is a liar. She has manipulated him and lied and he knows this. He gets angry when we talk about it and he feels used, but he still misses her and their connection? Likes that she is at his beck and call for sex because she cares more for him than he does her. And he‚Äôs curious what it would be like with her. So I guess I‚Äôm asking for any and all advice. What do I do?? I think he‚Äôs in affair fog and not thinking clearly, but we didn‚Äôt have that with the first A, so I don‚Äôt know. Logically I think he‚Äôs knows this isn‚Äôt sustainable and there is no future with her. But he wants to have fun and wants me to be there when it‚Äôs all said and done. When I say I won‚Äôt be there he is still choosing to go have fun knowing he will lose friendships, family and his family. I guess I don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs short sighted. I don‚Äôt think I can help lift the fog and this just has to play out at the expense of our marriage and everything.",

      "content_preview": "This is the fourth time I‚Äôm posting this over the last couple of years. The sad reality is that there are a lot of new people on here all the time and many who were not on here when I last posted this in November. The reason I put this up from time to time is because it‚Äôs one of the few things I‚Äôve posted on here that many people have found to be helpful. If my reflections do not ring true for you, feel free to just move on to the next. My hope is that there is at least something in here that might be helpful to at least one person who is out there struggling today: Things that have helped‚Ä¶ I want to preface this by saying that I know everyone‚Äôs situation is different and I don‚Äôt want to come across as pretending that I have all the answers, because I know I don‚Äôt. I do consider my reconciliation with my WW to be very successful and I do want to share my reflections in case in can be of help to anyone out there. First, a lot depends on the WS. My wife did everything right post d-day. She was remorseful, we talked often and extensively in the weeks following D day and she answered all of my questions and took responsibility for her actions. There was a lot of pain and my head was running in a loop, but the most important thing that happened right after D-day is that we turned back towards each other. I think an important habit, if you‚Äôve both fully decided that you want R, is to judge them based on how they‚Äôve been from the point in time when you decided you wanted to reconcile. We know that they did shitty things that really hurt you, but you‚Äôve decided to try and make it work. D-day was fair grounds to call it quits. If you decided you don‚Äôt want to end things, you have to treat it like a fresh start. I made a habit of loving as a verb. Something that I‚Äôm choosing to do every day. It‚Äôs not about feelings all the time‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs a decision that you want to put the work in and make something better out of a relationship that derailed. Like I mentioned, my wife answered all of the questions I had. Once you know the most important things you inevitably want to know after D-day‚Ä¶‚Äùdid you have sex? How many times? Do you love them? Do you want to be with them? How long did it go on for? Where did you go?‚Äù‚Ä¶.., eventually you got a cut it out when it comes to searching out all the details. It isn‚Äôt important. You already know what you need to know about what happened. Seriously, cut it out. You‚Äôre just torturing yourself and it‚Äôs not contributing anything positive to R. Acknowledge and talk about your pain, your anger, your sadness and how it affects you, but do not resort to lashing out, passive aggressive behavior like comments and digs about what they did. Be adults. Forgiveness is not being in denial about what happened, but additional drama and cruelty will not help you repair your relationship. Revenge, or trying to make them experience some measure of what you had to endure is self-defeating. You really do have to take the high road, be the bigger person‚Äîall that shit. This is tough‚Ä¶ because you are NOT responsible for the choices they ultimately made. However, I do think it‚Äôs important to recognize and acknowledge your own role in where the relationship was when this happened. Not to excuse the behavior, but it‚Äôs helpful to understand and empathize with your partner‚Äôs state of mind. What led to this? What needs weren‚Äôt being met. Being able to communicate about this now can bring you closer. This is never the way you wanted to be brought closer in your relationship, but this can be an opportunity to do just that. I think we needed a seismic event in our relationship in order to rebuild and get stronger. We really are closer and stronger than we were before this all happened. It came with a cost‚Ä¶it was painful and challenging to overcome, but it‚Äôs true. We‚Äôre better together now, three years after d- day than we were for many years preceding it. Although that‚Äôs all true‚Ä¶because yes, I do believe in second chances, my wife knows that we could not survive if something like this happened again. It would be too much. So as forgiving as I may seem in this post, I reached my limit on overcoming this particular challenge. We have to have each other‚Äôs backs from here on out. Last‚Ä¶ the kids, our house, not wanting to blow our lives up‚Ä¶those are valid reasons to want to stay together, but it‚Äôs not quite enough. I insisted that our marriage cannot be a sham. Our love and our relationship has to be a top priority. I want love, respect, affection, desire and intimacy, time together‚Ä¶ everything. The reshuffling of our priorities was key. So‚Ä¶I rambled forever and part of me is hesitant to post. I‚Äôm afraid that many might shit on what I‚Äôve had to say. However, I‚Äôm proud of our reconciliation and our relationship. Infidelity sucks, and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone. However a lot of relationships are a mess out there and it‚Äôs not uncommon for couples to struggle. This shit happens but couples can survive and go on to be happier and stronger together. Since this sub is about reconciliation, I wanted to share what I view as a triumph after teetering on the brink of losing each other. We found each other again and it hasn‚Äôt been easy, but it‚Äôs been worth it to stick together.",

I feel like I need to do it so there can be balance but I also have read some people did it back and did not make things better. Comments on social media always say ‚Äú i did it and i felt better‚Äù but idk. Also, I am the main financial source and never asked or demanded for him to be the provider. Things have obviously changed and I expect him to be the provider, take care of finances etc. I have also felt its unfair for me, again, to pay my therapy myself when he is the one who sent me to this specific therapy so I am planning on billing him ever therapy since. He agreed. Idk how he will do it but i don‚Äôt care. He found a way to cheat on me and lie to me while married so im sure he can find a way to pay me back. I dont tolerate excuses from him anymore since I saw that to have sex with someone improvised at work he had no problem planning it in 10 min doing this huge ‚Äú fake coaching in a private office for his 10 employees ‚Äú so I know he is creative enough to pay me back. Whenever I ask him for something to do and hes like im trying idk how, my mind goes back to yeah he planned everything for that person but has an excuse for me? So I spiral. Idk if anyone has gone thru something similar as a wayward and/or betrayed. How can you move on from he humiliation? From reading the comments online about you are an idiot if you stay and he will do it again? They never change etc.",

      "content_preview": "DDay was 4 months ago. We are doing MC and  both of us IC. Warning: This feels more like a vent. Before his questionable boundary crossings and affair, he wasn‚Äôt a very good partner. Never was. Closest I felt him putting in the work was when we had our son. I had so much resentment building because he wouldn‚Äôt help share the mental load. He wouldn‚Äôt help around the house. If I asked him he‚Äôd sometimes do it, most of the time didn‚Äôt (‚ÄúI forgot‚Äù). He forced me into this ‚Äúmother‚Äù role which then he became resentful for. I always thought he never left the ‚Äúbachelor‚Äù lifestyle. He‚Äôs very immature and selfish. His own sister describes him with emotional immaturity of a toddler. His mom constantly making apologies to me. Naturally, my resentment grew. But I still loved him and did my best to express gratitude when he did anything at all especially if unasked. Hoping one day he just grows up. I made conditions of him needing IC before we do MC again (first MC went horribly). So he knew, how I felt. Of course a big part of my resentment is feeling like I‚Äôm a constant failure. I‚Äôve hit a wall after returning to work full time, being default parent, and carrying the mental load, feeling not supported and shame for feeling like I need to ask for help at all. And struggling with ADHD When I‚Äôve tried to communicate my feelings in the past he‚Äôs gets upset, belittles what I do, and points at times when I needed to hire a cleaner or ask my mom (who lives close by and loves to clean) for help. I have ADHD and keeping a tidy organized home has always been a major struggle. Because he‚Äôs such a slob, he doesn‚Äôt mind the mess only if he has to participate in cleaning it. He‚Äôs guilty of a lot of weaponized incompetence, avoidance, and convenient ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù. So I just have given up. The house is always a clutter mess. I do clean up, sweep,  do dishes and run laundry but it‚Äôs just bare minimum stuff, and not even consistent. I feel burnt out. I struggle a lot with moving past this resentment. Before, I had at least the perceived safety and belief that he loved me. Now after learning he cheated on me, even knowing the why behind it and his own trauma, I cant help but sometimes think- what is he good for? Why am I married at all? For R, he has to show me he can not only face himself and his emotions and trauma, but learn to become a good partner. He has to learn to put his family first, not his own pleasures. Learn to stop avoiding and take accountability. And I struggle to have hope for this.",

WP and I started doing activities and going on low-pressure dates since mid-August. I want to create some new good memories so one day they can outnumber the bad ones. We have a great time, and for a little while, I see the chemistry and love that initially brought us together. But eventually a gray cloud casts itself over me. I look at her face as she smiles at me, then I remember, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs choosing me now, but she didn‚Äôt before.‚Äù That‚Äôs really what hurts me the most: she chose a moment of drunk ego stroking over the life we built together. She chose herself. And god knows the shoe would never be on the other foot. I‚Äôd choose her every time over anyone. I was totally ride or die for her, and it feels like the sentiment wasn‚Äôt returned. I think about how I had to rewrite our long-term plans and reevaluate my whole future after she threw it all away and it feels like I got punched in the gut. She constantly says it was an ‚Äúincredibly stupid, split-second decision,‚Äù but now I am carrying the consequences of that decision for a long time. It feels like I‚Äôm on the front lines of a war I didn‚Äôt even know was going on. Is there a light at the end of this deep, dark tunnel?",

      "content_preview": "I (35F) and five years ago, I had an affair. My husband (39). We have two kids who were just 4 and 6 at the time. I was a bad partner, and I wasn‚Äôt the kind of mother I should have been either. The affair happened while my husband was away on work trips. He found out by reading messages on my phone. When he confronted me, I made everything worse by trying to minimize what I had done. I even tried to blame him, and I will always regret that. My affair lasted about two months. Once it was out in the open, I ended all contact with the other person. My husband set clear boundaries. He had full access to my phone, email, and social media. He asked me a lot of painful and difficult questions, and I answered them honestly, even when it was hard to admit the truth. The time that followed was full of heavy emotions. He cried more than I had ever seen. There was a lot of confusion, closeness, and pain. For almost two years, we went through intense periods of what I now know is called hysterical bonding. I started therapy and began working on the parts of myself that led me to make such selfish and damaging choices. I wanted to be a better person. Not just for him, but for our kids and for myself too. At one point, he told me he felt safe with me again. That meant everything to me. I knew things would never go back to how they were before, but I thought we were doing okay. Recently, though, he told me he doesn‚Äôt think he can keep doing this. He said he‚Äôs thinking about divorce. I didn‚Äôt see it coming. I really thought we were doing okay. I was holding on to the hope that we were still healing, still moving forward in some way. I know I caused so much pain. I know I shattered something in us that may never fully be put back together. I carry that every day. I love him so much. I still want this marriage. But now I‚Äôm starting to realize that love and effort might not be enough.",

I didn‚Äôt have the energy to snap I guess but MAN a little part of me wishes I had confronted AP more than just texts (and even then I wasn‚Äôt rude, I never wanted anything to be able to be flipped on me or screenshot taken). I wish I took a baseball bat to my WH car, but instead I went to a rage room. I wish I slapped her and him, something, burned his clothes, anything. But I didn‚Äôt. I just cried and asked him if he was leaving me for her (no, bc he could never be with someone who cheats LOL the irony) No point to this post, I just sometimes wish I had lost it on them to get the anger out of my system.

      "content_preview": "Hey all, DDay 1 was three months ago when I found out that my husband had lied to me about why we weren‚Äôt having sex (surprise, it‚Äòs porn, and him resenting me and making me responsible for his own problems). I also found out that he‚Äòd been hiding the extent of his female friendships from me, had photos of his female friends in underwear on his phone. He had an emotional affair while we were long-distance that he didn‚Äôt admit to, I was aware of though and we frequently fought about it. He gaslit me and kept stressing his integrity, that he‚Äòs trustworthy, that he worked so hard his whole life to prove that men and women can totally just be friends. DDay 2 was last week. He doesn‚Äôt know that I know. I found out that he also physically cheated on me 5 years ago, also while we were long distance, with a different colleague he never had mentioned except that he ‚Äûwasn‚Äôt sure if she hated him‚Äú. Shortly after we met 8 years ago, the night I asked him if we wanted to be exclusive, he lied about going to see another woman and instead said Goodbye in our text to shower and sleep (before I asked for exclusivity), then went to her, and then texted me enthusiastically Yes to be exclusive after just having gotten to her place for ‚Äûspooning‚Äú according to their texts. So he knew her. And there was history. And no doubt if she ‚Äûliked‚Äú him. And she knew about me. The night 5 years ago, they seemed to have planned some sort of affair after making out one night. She later asked if he had ever thought about just doing ‚Äûit‚Äú to have the tension gone. He said that in his experience, that didn‚Äôt help. Maybe they ended up having sex afterwards, maybe they haven‚Äôt ‚Äì that I don‚Äôt know. She talked about a boyfriend a few months later, but went on parental leave 9 months after their night of making out‚Ä¶ the timing is very unnerving. We closed the distance a year after he cheated. I am not decided on if I want to continue the relationship or not. I wanted to when it was ‚Äûjust‚Äú the porn etc, but now I know that he also controlled my life, not just fucked up his own. I have asked him to write me a full transparent letter with everything that has happened since we met. I have also prepared some next steps depending on what he‚Äòll end up writing; if he omits things (that I know about), that‚Äôs an easy decision to end things. If he is honest as far as I can tell, I have this set of steps and questions. Do you guys have any suggestions regarding what else should be on there? Contact lawyer. Write a ‚Äûprenup‚Äú that I will not be paying any money to him if we divorce. (Alternatively, we can divorce immediately so that I am not liable if you cheat again.) Paternity test. If not done already via letter, timeline. Access to all bank statements for since we met. (Alimony?) These Questions need answers: Who do you want to be? By what values do you want to live by, personally, with or without me? If he mentions Transparency, trust etc: how does what you did in the past fit into that? Who are now, compared to who you want to be? Who were you when we met? What did you think would happen if you had told me? What made you think you could decide my future for me? How much of your energy, time and resources (percentage) do you urgently want to invest in this (making things better etc)? How many hours are that per week? What are you going to deprioritise instead? How does that (1-2) fit into your definition of love? What is the difference for you between having someone, having access to someone and loving someone? (How does that fit what you did in the past?) Why do you want to be monogamous? Why did you marry me? Why did you not end things with me after cheating? Why did you not at least pump the brakes after cheating, instead of a) get engaged to me 2 months later, b) look for apartments together, c) move in together, d) actually get married, e) would have let me gotten pregnant? Would there have been any milestone that you WOULDN‚ÄòT have let me sacrifice for you, and finally told me? What makes you think that you‚Äòll be in the minority of those who don‚Äòt cheat again, if you already didn‚Äôt even come forward AND progressed the relationship further? What‚Äôs is your exact plan What do you want for your future relationship? How will you personally keep me safe from your control and manipulation?",

On and off with the same woman. Last time was 30th May. I found out by messaging her, pretending to be him on a new number. For reference, we have been engaged since February. He thinks it probably happened 3 times since then. I'm beyond broken. He is a sex addict, actively in specialised therapy as of a few weeks ago when I uncovered his messages to escorts. I consoled myself with the idea that it was just a fantasy. But it wasn't a fantasy, it was another woman's body, pressed up against his. It was him in his real life, coming home to me, lying in bed next to me saying he was too tired for anything sexual with me. My heart is just dust. My legs keep shaking. I just want to disappear. When does this pain stop. UPDATE - found more details and he has been seeing her every 2-4 weeks religiously since November 2022. My heart is somehow more broken than before. How is this my life?",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm about a year out from D Day. My husband (46M) had an affair that lasted roughly a year with a married woman. They were physical about five times, and while they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdate,‚Äù she‚Äôd meet him at the gym regularly during the early months of the affair. I found out on my own. Neither of them came clean. The affair ended the night I discovered it. I‚Äôm confident it hasn‚Äôt continued. Since then, we‚Äôve had our share of ups and downs, and we‚Äôre trying to reconcile. There are a lot of reasons I‚Äôve chosen to stay, and I‚Äôm not here to rehash the affair or ask whether I should leave. But here‚Äôs what I am struggling with. I just don‚Äôt see marriage the same way anymore. Blind loyalty? Gone. Belief that total honesty is always a given in relationships? Also gone. I no longer believe in ‚Äúforever‚Äù the same way I used to. I still love him, but something has fundamentally shifted in me and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a sign of healing or a warning light. When I get down or distant and he asks what‚Äôs wrong, I don‚Äôt even know how to respond. Talking about it doesn‚Äôt help. It just leads to arguments or dead ends, because there‚Äôs nothing he can say or do that erases it. So I find myself bottling things up. Did your view of marriage ever recover after infidelity? Or did you land in a more detached or realistic version of love? Is it okay, maybe even healthy, that I now see marriage as fragile? That I‚Äôve let go of the idea that a spouse can be your forever source of happiness? Does this phase pass or is this just the new normal? I feel like I‚Äôm at a strange in between place. Not bitter, but not idealistic anymore either. Maybe this is maturity. Maybe it‚Äôs trauma. But it‚Äôs definitely unsettling. Would love to hear how others got through this stage or if you‚Äôre still in it. TL;DR One year post-affair. Trying to reconcile with my husband, but my view of marriage has completely changed. No longer believe in forever, blind loyalty, or that a spouse can be your everything. Is this a normal part of healing or a sign that the damage is permanent? Curious how others moved forward after infidelity and if their view of love and marriage ever recovered.",

      "content_preview": "I caught my husband of 6 months cheating on me today about the coworker he told me not to worry about. It has been going on for 5 months. Shortly after we got married I became insanely jealous of a seemingly innocent text from a coworker. We got into a huge fight. A few weeks later my WH told me he did not know if he wanted to be with me as his emotional needs were unmet. He said he had feelings for that coworker. Those 3 months were tough for me and for us. He would spend more time working late. He would go out to get space when he never did that before. He claimed he was going through it and just needed to be alone, all the while I worked to change the behaviors that caused him to feel not good enough in our relationship. Also while working through the anxiety and panic attacks that started with his changed behavior. Many times we talked about divorce. Then at the beginning of July he didn't work late as much. He didn't go out to take space anymore. He told me he was even more in love with me then the day we got married. I could finally feel like I could trust him again. Today I went to a BBQ at a friend's. When I came home he wasn't there. I had a feeling. So I logged into life360 because he did not realize that when he reinstalled it (because he had a long drive a few weeks back for work and wanted it on for safety reasons) that it showed his tiles for his keys even when his permission settings were turned off. He was at her house. I went there and waited until he left and confronted him. It all came out. He said he wanted to end it with her, but didn't want to hurt her feelings. When it first began it was because he truly thought we were going to divorce. That he started to feel guilty a couple months ago and had planned to end it. He said his ex who cheated on him changed him in a fundamental way and he never thought he would cheat, but decided to because he had a negative view of relationships. Specifically that he'll never be able to have a good one. That at the time we wanted to experience what it was like to cheat. He says that now that he's experienced it he never wants to do it again. That he wants to be with me. I just don't know if I should walk away. I want to, but I don't. I have walked away from cheaters in the past. My love for my ex's literally left the moment I found out about their infidelity, but not for him. I love the life we have built. I love our home. I love him. I have never loved someone as deeply as him. We have couples counseling on Monday. I see my personal therapist on Tuesday. I don't know what I want. Those who chose to reconcile with their WS, why? Has it been worth it?",

      "content_preview": "Sept 2 will be a year since Dday. I‚Äôm the WS. I had engaged in an EA with a younger female coworker. My wife and I have been through some attempted reconciliation but it looks to be falling apart. I was diagnosed several months ago with borderline personality disorder and ADHD. I admit that I have had a porn addiction most of my life. I have been sober from ‚Äúactual‚Äù porn since June 2020 but this recent bout involved me seeking out ‚Äúsofter‚Äù options by way of TikTok and instagram. Facebook to an extent as well as I had disclosed to my wife that I had used pictures of old flings. As far as my EA went, it was relegated to flirting and getting close. There was never any sexting, physical contact, divorce talk. I went complete NC with my AP in December 24‚Äô and have diligently maintained that. There has been an office move and I have even changed counties that I work in to near fully eliminate any chances of contact with her. I have been seeing a CSAT since approximately December or January 25‚Äô and got a better psychiatrist in April and also have taken on a second therapist to concentrate on DBT work. However, there‚Äôs been some immense struggles for us to reconnect. My wife still worries I have contact with AP and also believes that I‚Äôm not fully committed to R. I admit that I do things somewhat haphazardly by starting things and falling off with them when it feels like things are better or that something else is needed. I‚Äôm at a complete loss. My wife has threatened to leave and that she still is not happy. I‚Äôve given disclosures as best as humanly possible trying to cover and explore any and all details. I desperately want to support my wife and provide her with the safety, security, and happiness she so greatly deserves. She is a wonderful mother to our little girl and overall we have a good life. I‚Äôm worried that nothing is going to work. I know consistency is a big factor. Any help here would be greatly welcomed. I don‚Äôt want to lose everything that matters most to me.",

      "content_preview": "I made the biggest mistake of my life, and I think my life will end soon. I am not a native English speaker I had a beautiful relationship for about six years with a tender and loving woman who, in my eyes, could have been perfect. At first, she told me that her ex and best friend from her youth had ruined her life and that she would never speak to him again, and that he was possibly the most important man in her life before me. It turned out that years later, the guy sought her out, and she replied that it would be disrespectful to rekindle their friendship. On a trip with friends, I discovered that after that conversation, they had resumed their friendship and were very familiar with each other. I felt that she had betrayed me in a way that hurt me deeply, and I knew in the depths of my heart that perhaps, if I hadn't found out, she might have cheated on me‚ÄîI don't know if sexually, but emotionally for sure. Time passed, we recovered, but she never gave any importance to how I felt that day. We started our own business, but the stress she couldn't handle from taking on most of the work in our company and my inability to contribute enough to the business, since I had to have another job to pay off the debts the company left us with, caused her to start treating me coldly and distantly, even cruelly, to the point where I couldn't talk to her without her getting angry. She refused to have sex with me, and that led to our estrangement and breakup. A month passed, and a coworker was a great support to me during those dark days and gave me what, sadly, I had not been given in my relationship. Then, time brought me closer to my ex-partner, who was once again becoming the tender and sweet woman I had fallen in love with. The problem is that I could never let go of the bond with my ex-colleague and the sex she gave me. I must say that for seven or eight months, I only had sex with my ex-colleague, but I maintained the tenderness and relationship with my ex-wife, although without sex. Those were the worst days of my life, torn between the indecision of leaving my ex-partner for my wife and the guilt I felt for what I was doing, which was betrayal. This week, everything came to light and my ex-partner contacted my ex-wife after I had broken up with her to tell her about my parallel relationship. I feel terrible guilt and I have already tried to commit suicide once, but at that moment I felt weak just as I was about to put the noose around my neck. I have had a session with the therapist and I am waiting for my session with the psychiatrist to start trying to save my life somehow. I know that sex, loneliness, and my ex-wife's emotional betrayal (for me) led me to make the wrong decisions. This in no way justifies my mistakes, but according to my therapist, they are a context that led me to act this way. I have read a lot on this forum about people who try to forgive their partners, but their partners do not reciprocate that opportunity and do nothing. I would give my soul, my eyes, or anything in my power for that sweet woman I am still in love with to give me a chance. Espero se entienda mi ingl√©s y mis palabras puedan reflejar la culpa asquerosa y arrepentimiento qu√© siento",

I don't want to take away all of the things that he loves doing.  I just want him to do them less. I actually like those things because they remind me of him and I really love him.  But he got so engulfed up in this fantasy world that he totally compartmentalized our life together.  I feel like he thought that he was really married to these women in this game that he played.  He would treat them like they were his wife and totally ignore me.  His life was 1)his job and our Daughters ( ONLY WHEN NESSISARY)  And Then the rest of the time was for his Fantasy world. Since Dday, he has not played any games where he interacts with real people,  but he's still playing single player games a lot.  Every time that he picks up his phone I start to panic.  I'm even trying to learn to play one of these games with him. ( I'm not very good at it though) but.. in conversation,  he told me that the main reason that he was attracted to these APs was that they knew a lot about Gaming.  Am I feeding into his gaming addiction by trying to learn more? Or do you think that I'm working on a bond so we can be closer? I don't really know.  Because If I'm the person who takes away everything that he gets enjoyment from,  he might start resenting me. I know that I'm all over the place with this but any advice will help because I'm confused on the subject.",

      "content_preview": "2 weeks ago I learned my husband of 10 years and father of our two beautiful girls, has been cheating on me for at least 4 years. Regularly, with one night stands, random hookups, and some creepy swingers shit. To say I have been devastated is the understatement of the decade. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't concentrate. I had to take this week off work so I wouldn't fuck everything up. He has been trickling truthing me this entire week, but I've gotten quite good at interrogation. I keep catching him at lies and then he will go back on himself and admit he was lying. After a particularly rough back and forth last night where i said i was done, i cant be lied to like this anymore and hes killing me, this morning he now says he's ready to tell me the whole truth. He wrote it all down for me and tried to give it to me. I told him it was too late, I didn't care anymore, and he cluld keep his long list of sins. He is a liar and I can't trust anything he has to say to me about this. I can't build anything on a foundation of rubble. I can't try to save this. But we are married. We have 2 small kids (3 and 5). We've been together for a total of 23 years. He's a good dad- he just took our littlest to the pediatrician \"just in case\" this rash on her leg was something serious. He helps keep house. He fixes things. He is polite and courteous to me (in words, not in deed behind my back), my friends, and my family. It feels like he and I are bound. We grew up together. Despite all this hell, I still love him. Or a part of him. We happen to get super lucky and we already have a pretty great marriage counselor. We've been to 2 sessions in these 2 weeks, and he's lied through his teeth through all of them. He's minimizing what he's done- not the effect on me, he seems to pretty well grasp that- by lying about how many, where, if he's paid for sex, ect ect. I can't make someone tell the truth to me, or to themselves. So I told him he could move into the basement (he's been staying at his brother's house and we have been switching taking care of the kids after school), and we can live as roommates. We make a good team- the house gets taken care of, the kids do too. We can live how we have been for the last 4 years, unbeknownst to me - separate lives under one roof. He says he wants a real marriage and he wants to change. He's not pressuring me to let him back into the house- this was my invitation because after 2 weeks I am just drained. I have nothing left. I just want to curl into a ball and lick my wounds, and it's very hard to do that with 2 kids around. Very hard and not right for them. They deserve a home that doesn't feel like a tomb. So I'm letting him back in. What the hell and I doing here? Which way is up? Am I crazy? I KNOW he's crazy. Am I too? Am I pathetic and weak and not strong enough to do this alone? I want to think he can change and be the man I always thought he was, but that feels like a fairy tale in a children's book. What is a marriage, anyways? Is it interdependence, co-dependence, always showing up when you need them? Friendship, fidelity, love? What the fuck is love anyways. This is turning now into a mess of gibberish. But this is the only place I know where people might be able to understand me.",

Today marks one year since I engaged in the worst torment I could have ever placed upon my wife who deserved none of the pain and anguish that my EA with a coworker I concealed along with my continued porn addiction followed by immense lying of all forms. Concealing, half truths, trickle truths and even two false confessions I made that were basically a nuke to my wife‚Äôs complete psyche and as I‚Äôve recently learned, has harmed her in physical ways that I regret so much. I‚Äôve changed a lot from who I was for the better, came closer to God than I ever have in my Christian walk, read books, continuing through therapy, adhered to brutal and strict honesty but I know the work may not ever be done. I‚Äôm beyond thankful to have my wife still here with me. God bless her strength, patience and grace. I also thank this community as I‚Äôve lurked and read posts from BP‚Äôs and I am so sorry for the pain you are in and wrongs that have happened to you. I would like to ask from anyone if there are any books/resources anyone can recommend other than ‚Äúnot just friends‚Äù or the help her heal workbook? I‚Äôve been through both and I‚Äôm currently reading cheating in a nutshell. Thanks everyone. As for any WP reading this, straighten yourself up, don‚Äôt blame your BP for anything. If you would listen and be observant you might realize just how bad the effects of your actions are. You have no idea just how grave the effects of those decisions are, no amount of small pleasure you could get from your AP can last or measure up to what you‚Äôve forsaken and trampled on.",

I think she is still minimizing it but at this point I don‚Äôt care. I was destroyed knowing about the affair but knowing this??? She initially lied that it was only months and never led to sex. But catching her on that lie she opened up and it feels like she is remorseful but freaking 7 YEARS!! I want to just kill myself but I won‚Äôt do that because of kids. I am hugely surprised in how I am reacting. I thought I will be angry but here I am destroyed but still yearns for her touch, to hold me, to tell me it will be fine but then I feel it‚Äôs the same person who made me feel like an idiot, less of a man, as an ATM machine and an imbecile. I still can‚Äôt get to hate her!!! Do I have hope? Is she going to take advantage of me? I want to wake up from this nightmare!!",

Today was interesting in that we went back into some of the old pains I inflicted on her. I allowed for a bit but eventually had enough and realized exactly where I went wrong in the relationship. I had allowed my desire for peace to erode her understanding of who I am. I am very soft with her and will allow her to have her way for peace. No more of that. It was shocking for me when I stopped her mid rant. Looked in her eyes and said ‚Äúdone‚Äù. You have said that before move on, so we can move on.",

      "content_preview": "This is a long one. I know I'm the asshole but I want to put it out there anyway. Me (24), my girlfriend (24), my ex girlfriend (26) Me and my ex started dating back in July 2022, it lasted for 1¬Ω years. On January 2024, someone very dear to her passed away and she lost herself in grief and pain, and she broke up with me. I cannot leave a grieving person, so I stayed back and took care of her months, trying to keep her alive. Around those months I made new friends to stay sane. One day, around July 2024 one of the friends asked if I wanted to go to an art even with her. I said yes. I saw her and I thought she is the prettiest girl ever and wanted to be with her, and we got along really well too, so I didn't see an issue. But, there was an issue; the depressed ex. I couldn't possibly drop her because there's a high chance of her killing herself. I told my girlfriend about this situation on the 2nd date itself but she didn't have a strong opinion at that moment. My ex texted me every day, gave me life updates and pet updates. Her pets were the only things that kept her grounded, knowing this, I sent pictures of my pets as well. Time passed, we stayed friends. We still talked every single day (My current girlfriend knew about this) In the beginning of 2024, my girlfriend got blocked by my ex (they didn't even follow each other before). I was very confused and so was my girlfriend. I put it off as the ex not wanting to be outed and my girlfriend put it as the ex hating her. My girlfriend was very tolerant and I was grateful. Fast forward a few months, it's August, and I found my ex has had a girlfriend since the May of 2024. I felt betrayed and used because if I had known that I wouldn't have been so worried about her dying, thinking she didn't have anybody in her life to vent to and text. I would've passed the responsibility to her gf. I got to know this information and I told my girlfriend. Me and my girlfriend went on a date the next day, and I wanted to show her the proof, the chats. So, I had to open up the chats with my ex... My girlfriend saw the conversations and immediately distanced herself from me physically. She got so sad and asked to read the chats. I let her read the past 3 days conversations and took the phone because I got scared when she didn't have a reaction of any sort. She also went through my call logs. It was mostly outgoing calls to the ex. She said she felt betrayed and disgusted by the way me and the ex were so comfortable with each other. The way we would have our own inside jokes, our own vocabulary, and how we texted everyday. That I told the ex things I never told her before (such as the pets and other similar topics). That I never told her anything about the ex out of respect, which eventually meant that I disrespected her as my girlfriend. She said I tainted the relationship and all the good times because it didn't matter how much I loved her because at the end of the day I talked to the ex. She said she felt silly for letting this happen for so long and could've not been a chill girlfriend. She's disappointed in me and rightfully so. She traced my hand, my face, kissed me and said, \"I would recognise your shape anywhere, even if I was blind, but I don't know who you are anymore.\" I felt that to my core. I lost the best person in my life... but she didn't leave me yet. It's been 3 days and I don't understand why she hasn't left. I would leave me if I was her. She said she can't come to a conclusion because she doesn't have enough data. She wants to read the text messages between me and the ex. I panicked and deleted all the call logs, now I'm panicking more. I don't have anything to hide but I know the messages are going to hurt her. I want to break up but I can't right now because she has exams for the next 1¬Ω months. I don't deserve her and her grace. The guilt of making her feel like that is gnawing at my bones and ripping my organs apart. I really can't take this anymore, I want to end all. I regret my decisions. I should've put a stop to everything when I could've way back then but I didn't, and now I'm facing the consequences. Please I want this to end. I'll forever live with the guilt of this. My biggest sin is being stupid and being too nice. I don't know what to do.",

      "content_preview": "I met my partner when I was 18. He was my first love, my first everything. We had a beautiful, supportive relationship. He is the kindest, most supportive, hard-working, stable, and positive person I have ever known. At 22, while away for studies, I made the biggest mistake of my life. I cheated for 3 weeks. He never suspected ‚Äî but I confessed immediately, because I wanted him to make a choice for his future.I took full accountability because it was 100% my fault. Despite the pain, he forgave me. He chose us. The truth is: I always struggled with myself. I grew up bullied, unsupported, and carrying scars from abuse. On the outside I looked like the ‚Äúperfect girl‚Äù rich family,well educated,beautiful and everyone minimalized my mental health because ‚Äúi had everything‚Äù.After a lot of therapy I understood that inside I felt empty and unloved. That doesn‚Äôt excuse what I did ‚Äî it explains the brokenness I carried into love. Years later, we are still together. I love him more than anything. But guilt still follows me every day, no matter how much good I try to do.I struggle a lot with depression,anxiety,hormonal issues,diabetes,i don‚Äôt have a social life anymore and i am very isolated,my physical and mental health are absolutely destroyed.Once i was a very healthy and full of life.I don‚Äôt want my partner to deal with my problems so i try as much as i can to be happy in front of him.But im getting tired and i am considering su*cide, but I know that it will destroy my family especially my mom. I share this because maybe someone else out there feels the same ‚Äî drowning in regret, even when forgiven.I just want help or any kind advice.How to get over this negativity,I will never forgive myself but i just want to function normally.",
