Normally I run with lulu pace breakers which I'm fine with but wanted to mix it up. Tried the Ciele DLYshorts which I actually like a lot, particularly because I like the longer exposed lining and shorter short , but the phone bounce is insane. It's a bit much in the back zippered pocket, but my phone (13 mini) literally bounced out of the liner pocket twice during one run, compared to the pace breakers where the phone is immobile. I see pace breakers advertised as 'no bounce' and recommended here, but I prefer lined shorts so I'd have to get some half or quarter tights which probably would have a pocket anyway. Was also thinking of just getting some bandit quarter tights and then whatever shorts, but the cost in CAD is a bit much. Any other recommendations?",

We're wanting matching gear, but also want it to be fun - think taco shorts and similar. Everywhere I've looked so far has different sets for men and women. Even if we could just get matching shorts (I love hot pink and all neon colors) and then we could figure out tops later would be cool. Can y'all point me in the right direction??",

Currently I'm using the Kiprun 500 from Decathlon. I like them for the price, length, back zippered pocket, but wish the liner was a little less restrictive. Also looking to see what the other options are in terms of aesthetics. I'm looking for something with: a 2-3\" inseam since I sweat like a cold bottle of soda on a warm benchtop, and the short inseam has such great comfort that I'd never go back. Modesty be damned. a liner that is relatively roomier for comfort. I don't mind a liner styled like a brief or slightly longer for better coverage when I sit down for a rest or do weights. But don't want a long liner and definitely not one with pockets for a phone. a zippered pocket for some cards (eg. Credit card, access card, ID) house key and car remote. relatively slim. I don't have thunder thighs and don't want something loose and billowy. preferably decent aesthetics and looks better than a polyester garbage bag or worse, underwear. Solid muted colours, more angular/sharp edges around the hem (instead of rounded). Side split is great but not super hi-cut. Reflective trim a real plus for night runs. Budget: will be spendy on the right product that lasts, but not so prohibitive that I can't afford two of them. The $135+ that Lulu is asking is eye-watering. Thanks in advance.",

Also check the stickied SALE THREAD Recent and Upcoming District Vision FW 2025 - feeling very luxury athleisure with some technical pieces mixed in. They've always done that so nothing shocking. The Fair Isle is cute. Some of the shorts feel a bit Tracksmith-y but not in a bad way. Cool details on the sweaters Tracksmith's Fall Marathon collection came out. Looks the same as Boston's. Don't love it, but it is here . Museum of Distance Running makes one of my favorite non-technical pieces out there ‚Äì their mesh jersey.¬†That's already been taking heat. Gnuhr restocked a bunch of stuff. Sorry for not gatekeeping! SUVS released some laser cut \"Venticore\" stuff. SUVs is a cool Indonesian running brand ACT Running is a new French brand focused on creating sustainable running apparel. Their shtick is sustainability, advertising the CO2. Their FW line coming soon. They have a corduroy type texture on there that I'm particularly interested in seeing. Vomero Plus + Premium comes August 8th. Premium is quite a beast. Hoka x Supervsn's Inner Space dropped today . Not sold out! I hate being a hater, but premium cycling brand Q36.5 dropped a running capsule and it looks so bad. As in terribly cut. Salomon is releasing the Orava Advanced (below) which is more lifestyle-y.
