      "content_preview": "I've been on TRT for a few years now. I got it prescribed from my PCP. Over time my estrogen levels where just getting higher and higher and he we couldn't get it back down. So he sent out referrals for a endocrinologist and they kept getting rejected. I was tired of wanting so I switched my PCP to someone within Health First hoping to have better luck. Now, I'm in the same boat again with the referrals getting denied. My question is, is there any men on here that are prescribed TRT under an endocrinologist? If so, who is it? For the ladies reading this, let me know if your significant other sees an endocrinologist for TRT. I'm aware of the TRT clinics around town and what ones are trusted, I just wanted to try and endocrinologist first before paying $100 something a month.",

      "content_preview": "Looking back at August, we saw and set some record-breaking sales that highlight what I call the “Tale of Two Markets.” There’s a clear divide between premium properties and ordinary ones. Premium properties (prime location, high-end finishes, something with an X-factor) are still commanding top dollar, even though they represent only a small slice of the market. A few examples from last month: Highest-priced non-waterfront property ever sold beachside – $2.38M 600 Atlantic St Highest $/ft² for a Grand Canal home over 4,000sf on Lansing – $568/ft² 336 Lansing Island Dr Brevard’s highest oceanfront sale ever – $6.125M 610 Mango closed at $527/ft² for a non-waterfront home over 2,000sf (only the 7th time in history that’s happened) 610 Mango Dr Ordinary properties are seeing the opposite: supply is climbing, demand is softening and 51% of active listings last month had price reductions. I had some sellers even pulled their homes from the market when offers didn’t meet expectations. Economists who follow the 18-year real estate cycle suggest that sellers chasing COVID-era highs may be waiting 3–7 years for prices to return. Meanwhile, well-positioned homes are still selling, averaging 47 days on market. For Sellers : Pricing, presentation and your agent’s strategy matter more than ever. Homes that are dialed in are still moving—but don’t expect bidding wars. Ask your agent how many market cycles they've experienced in their career. For Buyers : Inventory is up, rates are easing, and leverage is back on your side. Patience helps, but be ready to move quickly when the right place hits. Curious what everyone else is seeing—are you noticing the same “two-market” split where you are?

Neighbor had 2 guns taken from 2 different trucks. Dude looked right at his security camera, he didn’t care. Cops said they work an area then move on to another, but seem to cycle back through every 4 months or so, and stay fairly close to main roads to facilitate getaways. Seems to be crimes of opportunity, not smash and grab, but I wouldn’t recommend leaving any valuables visible. Just a reminder to lock your vehicles.",

I'm from Kansas now but I was actually born in Orlando and lived there until I was 10, but that was 15 years ago. That being said, what are the best things about the area? The worst? The outlook? I guess I'm just looking to get some genuine opinions from locals on how they feel about the area. Weird request I know, sorry for the ambiguity, but I'm not sure how else to phrase it haha. My current frontrunner is Colorado but I don't want to rule anything out. I love fishing and golf which is appealing in Florida as a whole, but I just don't know enough about the area otherwise.",
