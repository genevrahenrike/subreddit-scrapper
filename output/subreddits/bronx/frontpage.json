The Bronx borough president, only shows up on a blue moon. Probably in Riverdale somewhere in a gated community, just collecting a paycheck.

The female has started to be a lap cat and the male loves attention. They're adoptable through https://www.nycatcoal.org/ . If anyone is interested, please reach out to the organization/me!

Iâ€™ve tried a lot but these three became my go-to escapes when the city feels too loud: Beacon, NY A direct train from Harlem 125th, and in under two hours you're in a calm, artsy town. Time moves slower there. Coffee hits different when you drink it on a quiet street with mountains in the background. The Catskills If you can rent a car or catch a ride, go. Being in those woods makes you feel small in the best way. I hiked for just an hour and forgot Iâ€™d been running on empty all week. Montauk Itâ€™s a bit farther, but absolutely worth it. The beach, the waves, the sky at sunsetâ€¦ like NYC never existed. I came back feeling a little lighter, like something heavy was left behind. Each of these gave me a breath I didnâ€™t know I needed. If youâ€™ve got your own escape spots, please share",

Iâ€™ve reached out to multiple listings on StreetEasy, Zillow, Craigslist, Facebook, etc., but most, if not all havenâ€™t been responsive. My biggest challenge has been finding a dog-friendly building. I have a small dog, and in one case a tenant told me dogs were allowed only for the leasing agent to later clarify that existing tenants with dogs were grandfathered in. For context, I was born and raised in Manhattan and lived in Riverdale before moving out of state. Iâ€™m now looking to return to NYC, specifically the Bronx, since my new job will be there. I have a high credit score and make more than 40x the rent. Iâ€™m open to all Bronx neighborhoods, and since I plan to get a car in the near future, Iâ€™m flexible with location. Iâ€™m searching for a studio or one-bedroom apartment with a budget of up to $2,200 and would like to move in before September 15. If anyone has leads, management contacts, or recommendations for dog-friendly buildings, Iâ€™d greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance!",
