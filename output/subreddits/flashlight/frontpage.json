It seems there is only a small difference in throw (120 vs 102m according to the zeroair review) but the EC150 puts out more lumens (1000 vs 500 lm at start up, 250 vs 200 sustained).  Both lights are otherwise similar (you can even get a usb c 14500 for the M150, giving usb charging to the M150) Interested to hear your thoughts.",

      "content_preview": "So as part of my job I often need to go into dimly lit buildings and attics to lay out mechanical services for my projects. I take photos with my phone but need a flashlight to illuminate. I may carry the flashlight in my pocket while on a job site or maybe on a lanyard; when not in use it'll just be in my backpack. I am also interested in 3D printing a clip-on mount to attach it to my hardhat when I'm writing on my clipboard. From the research that I've done, I do like the idea of the Wurkkos TD04, TS22, or Sofirn SC33. They're all reasonably priced and people seem to like them. Price Range :  I was thinking around $40-$80 CAD. The three I mentioned all fall into that right now from their websites/ali. Amazon is seeming more expensive for them right now surprisingly. Battery Type & Quantity :  The ones I've been looking at seem to have rechargeable battery cells, like a 21700. I prefer USB C charging rather than disposable batteries. I like that they don't use proprietary charging/batteries. Size :  Flexible on sizing. Maybe around 5\" in length, slightly over an inch diameter. Nice to hold in the hand. Metal body. Type :  Handheld Main Use :  I'm never really going to need to be able to throw more than say 50-100m, and would prefer a fairly even and wide fill. I may want to take it camping now and then, but main use will be in buildings as I described earlier. Switch Type :  I really do like the tailswitch+side button of the Wurkkos TD04, but I don't like how it can't tail-stand nor does it have a tail magnet. The TS22 is only side switch which would be fine but I don't really like the auto-lockout \"feature\". I've been able to find much information on the Sofirn SC33 but it's the other one I'm considering; unfortunately no magnetic tail but can tail-stand at least. The TS22 seems to be highly recommended, but I feel its battery-pack functionality seems a little gimicky. Like I might at times use it if needed, but I don't think that's a super useful feature; I also already have a battery pack. I've seen people say that the TD04 is kinda a bad pick compared to these other two, but I do like how its tail button is a simple one-click and goes back to the last used setting, and then the side button changes setting. That's a nice and simple UI; I'm likely just always going to use Med or High.",
