I decided to pop in and ask the people at the counter their thought on Trump's relationship with Epstein. I was not expecting an intelligent conversation but what transpired was legitimately disturbing. One guy who was just hanging out there asked me to talk outside and so I politely obliged and repeated the question. He proceeded to ask me why I support the Clintons? When I suggested I was 8 years old last time one held office I was called a liar. Eventually several other MAGATs showed up with one guy legitimately calling 911 to have me removed. I mocked him as if he was a literal infant at this point and asked why we feels the need to waste resources and tax dollars when he could just admit he supports pedophilia? Needless to say i continued to be threatened with some action by the police before I decided I had seen enough. Cops never showed - no idea what they would get me for if they did? But WOW - between the walz lies signs and the children (yes children) with Trump 2028 flags draped around their shoulders I can't help but be reminded of a similar situation in Europe that transpired in the 1940s. I love my Minnesotans - I'm sad their are so many ready to defend such egregious crimes without one ounce of thought for what it means for our state and country. Have your political debates all you want - pedophilia is wrong, everyone, including the Clintons should be in prison for what they have done on Epstein's island.. Rant.",

      "content_preview": "I always considered myself to be decently informed when it comes to politics and current events, but I saw a few unflattering caricatures of Governor Walz last week at the State Fair that really had a profound effect on me and forced me to reconsider my entire worldview. Did anyone else see the booth with the Governor Walz cartoons? I used to like the guy, but that was before I saw a drawing where they made him look like an ugly pig making a dumb face! Now I‚Äôm all like ‚ÄúShut up, Pigface!‚Äù üòù There was also a cartoon where Walz looked like the puppet from Pinocchio, and his nose was very big! If you are familiar with the story of Pinocchio, then you know what that means‚Ä¶ üòâ There‚Äôs a famous basilica in Barcelona called La Sagrada Familia where some atheists report being so awestruck by the sheer beauty and brilliance of the architecture that they open their hearts to the possibility of a God for the first time in their lives. I found myself similarly transformed by the Walz Lied booth. If there‚Äôs no substance behind the knee-jerk dipshit alt-right ideology, how can it possibly produce artwork so complex, deep, and profoundly moving? Being suddenly forced to confront the reality that my entire life had been a lie was both terrifying and freeing. Tears streamed down my cheeks and I dropped to my knees as the fairgrounds began to spin around me. When I woke up, two of the guys from the booth were giving me first aid. One of them was gently waving a ‚ÄòWalz Lied‚Äô fan over my forehead. The other offered me a sip from a water bottle labeled ‚ÄòLiberal Tears‚Äô. They were asking me questions. Did I know today‚Äôs date? Did I know where I was? I wanted to answer, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come out. Finally, one of them asked, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the current Governor?‚Äù I could feel my strength coming back. ‚Äú Tampon Tim ,‚Äù I whispered meekly. The men looked relieved. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù one of them told me. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to be OK.‚Äù",
