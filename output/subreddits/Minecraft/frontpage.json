      "content_preview": "Hi. Another one of these Minecraft boomer threads. I'm looking back on my early experiences with the game and thinking about what's changed since then.I think one of the biggest changes to survival has been around progression - I mean, no duh, but how that goes with resource management. Back inmyday, all you got from your tool or armour was the uses it started off with. No repairing, no enchanting. no trading with villagers to get more gear for essentially free. 1025 uses was all you got on your diamond tools.And honestly, I kind of feel like the game was better off for it. Modern players, open up your ore/ingot chest. How much iron do you have in there right now? Are you using any of it? If you are, it's probably either for redstone related stuff or decoration, am I right? Probably haven't used iron tools in a long time. But it wasn't always like that. You didn't always have 3 stacks of blocks of ingots/diamonds to fall back on. Sometimes you had to make do with lower tiers of tools or armour if you hadn't been mining for a while. There was arhythmto it that I think has been lost. There's technically more of a gear progression than Alpha/Beta Minecraft, but the early stages are rapidly shortened and at some point, you forget about it altogether, whereas it was again, a constant rhythm, something always in the back of your mind in the early days.I think it's a four-pronged issue:cave spelunking has become a lot easier, especially post-1.18. There's so much ore exposed now with little reason to actually have to dig strip mines or quarries or whatever form of mining that requires you to 'waste' durability on stone.Unbreaking has significantly increased the amount of time it takes to break an item. Mending then basically extends that to infinity; the only time you lose an item is if yousomehowfail to get any XP on it (maybe if it's a shovel or silk touch pick?) or if you die and the item is lost.Fortune significantly increases the quantities of iron, gold and diamond you have access to at any given time. So there's pretty much zero risk of ever running out of a tier of tools/armour and having to go back to the old stuff as a stopgap until you go on another mining expedition.Villager trades give easy access to the above two points, without ever having to waste time to enchanting and rerolling or go spelunking for the rare stuff. This is on top of being able to barter for diamond gear that's already enchanted (usually awful enchantments, but if they are you can still scrape them off and reuse them). They're at least planning it to make itharderto access the powerful enchants, but ultimately you'll still be able to access them infinitely through a safe method. Mending straight up shouldn't be on traders imo, I think it'd at least be preferable to make it a slightly more common enchant to find from treasure chests in the 'hostile' structures, especially End Cities.So, here's the thing. I have no idea what could be done to remedy this in any shape or fashion without pissing off a majority of the newer playerbase who has gotten used to the way things have been for, oh, the past 13 or so years. I've certainly gotten used to the power of enchants in that time, even if I do think they break an aspect of the game that used to be a core part of survival. Is it something Mojang should try to tackle in the modern day? Do any older players agree with me in how they feel about this sort of thing?",

Went back down later and found what looked like a full blown party: creepers in the corners, skeletons fighting each other, even a zombie just chilling by my chest. For a second I thought I had walked into a raid event I didn’t remember starting. It took me 10 minutes of sprinting in and out just to get it under control, and I honestly thought I was about to lose the whole base. By the time it was all cleared, I had to step away and cool off. Ended up checking instagram for a bit and just picturing all those mobs lining up like guests at some underground hotel. My friends still joke about it as the “MobBnB,” and at this point I think the name’s permanent.",
