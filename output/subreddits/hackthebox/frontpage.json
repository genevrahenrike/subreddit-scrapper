Hack The Box is offering 25% off the Silver annual plan , and it also comes with two exam vouchers : CJCA (Certified Junior Cybersecurity Analyst) ‚Üí normally $105 (before tax). Plus one of your choice between: CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist) CBBH (Certified Bug Bounty Hunter) CDSA (Certified Defensive Security Analyst) Each of these normally costs $210 (before tax). Breaking down the numbers: The vouchers alone are worth $315 (105 + 210, before tax). That almost covers the cost of the Silver annual plan with the 25% discount. In practice, you‚Äôre essentially paying for the certs and getting a full year of Hack The Box included. If you were considering certifying in pentesting, bug bounty, or defensive security , this is one of the best deals I‚Äôve seen from HTB. Posting here in case it helps someone before the offer ends today.",

CBBH is mainly web-based, which is obviously what interests me the least... What do you think? Going straight to CTPS without doing CBBH first, or even skipping it entirely?",

Then suddenly it‚Äôs like: ‚ÄúAlright rookie, now you have to perform a super double reverse shell engineering 2.0 with exactly 20 flags, and inject it from your private home lab using this ancient extension last used in 2003.‚Äù I mean, obviously I‚Äôm exaggerating‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs exactly how it feels when you‚Äôre new and completely lost. I‚Äôve been grinding through Hack The Box Academy ‚Äî happily paying for it every month ‚Äî and I am learning the basics. But it‚Äôs soul-crushing when ‚Äúeasy‚Äù boxes turn into ‚Äúplease go cry in the corner‚Äù boxes. Maybe my approach is wrong, maybe I just need more time, or maybe my brain just goes into screensaver mode the second I see anything with ‚Äúreverse shell‚Äù in it. And yeah, I check the writeups. A lot. Probably too much. It‚Äôs either that or just stare at my terminal until it stares back. I do pick up tips and I‚Äôve applied some stuff successfully, but the frustration is real. I‚Äôm not in this for money ‚Äî it‚Äôs a hobby. But with so many tutorials, guides, and ‚Äúdefinitive‚Äù learning paths out there, it feels like being told to pick one random brick out of a warehouse and somehow build a castle with it. If anyone‚Äôs got solid newbie-friendly advice (without the whole ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù energy), I‚Äôm all ears.",

Long story short, purchased on wrong credit card, HTB refunded me, now I can't make any purchases at all, on any card, any computer. I just get a \"Server Error\". HTB support has been responding but only late at night/early morning US hours so it's been a slow process, and the last response I received late Thursday night blamed my computer/credit card despite using multiple of both. The sale expires tomorrow, so I'd like to try to get it resolved before that happens. Since I haven't heard anything since emailing them yesterday morning - I wonder if there's another way to contact them? (Yes, I've tried chat - that turns into an email after a day of waiting. Nobody is manning the chat service right now that I can tell. I'm aware that it's summer vacation for them and that's the likely reason as well.)",

      "content_preview": "This is my first attempt at the exam, as someone with no previous experience working in IT or Cyber Sec I just got the fourteenth flag on day 5! I've seen so many posts since the exam update claiming this version is much harder than the previous one, and to be completely honest this made me very anxious starting the exam. I hear a lot of people saying to stick to the course content - and I can understand that advice, there isn't anything in the exam not covered in the modules but I completely disagree. I would personally recommend getting a VIP subscription to HTB labs and doing as many retired machines as possible, look at writeups if you need to but make sure to make your own writeup as well. Then do the active machines, this is where the real learning happens, don't be scared of Medium/Hard boxes, the exploitation isnt any more difficult in my experience, it's purely the amount of steps it takes to get to each flag. Before sitting the exam I completed 100 machines in total, I also completed all the active machines except Sorcery, which got me the Pro Hacker rank. I think this helped me immensely when taking the exam. It honed my methodology, sharpened my problem solving skills (and my ability to research new technologies, tools and applications), and most importantly gave me the ability to recognise patterns and spot vulnerabilities quickly. You only get this from experience and even though a lot of what I learned was not directly relevant to the exam, it gave me a much deeper understanding of what the learning path teaches. You need to really understand what you are trying to achieve if you hope to get through this exam environment. I also completed Zephyr Pro-Lab, and I would recommend this if you can afford it, but honestly the AEN and Pivoting modules are more than enough for practicing lateral movement and tunneling techniques. Learn Ligolo-ng, this tool is fantastic. Keep up with reporting as well, I updated my report every time I got a flag, I kept a log (not with tmux - just copy paste into Obsidian) of every command that got me somewhere. This made writing up technical details a breeze. Use Sysreptor, and learn how to use it effectively. Use the AEN module to write a practice report and keep it as a reference for the exam. Make sure you have 10 days absolutely free for this, take a holiday, quit your job, whatever. You need to give this your full attention. The last 3 days I've been putting in 15-16 hours. I had a schedule planned where I would get up early and sleep at a set time - but both times I was really stuck I had the breakthrough that got me a flag at 4am... I might still fail on the report but this has honestly been the most fun I've ever had, doing anything. It's been extremely challenging at times but that makes every flag you get feel so much better. Edit: Please stop messaging me asking for information around the exam or how to get flags - I am more than happy to answer questions about preparing for the exam or writing the report (although keep in mind I haven't submitted mine yet). Under no circumstances will I reveal any information on the actual content of the exam. The rules on this are very clear and honestly I think I would be hurting you more than helping you. Don't be afraid to struggle or fail, that's where the learning happens.",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm at the end of day 2 on the CBBH and think I‚Äôll be failing it. I thought I would write up my experience to reflect, share, and admittedly vent. I‚Äôve studied for the CBBH on and off for a year. I work full time and have other responsibilities so I can only commit 2 maybe 3 hours per week. In preparation for the exam, I went through the assessments twice. I took 4 days off of work for the exam. Unfortunately last minute commitments turned that into 3. Day 1: I started at 6AM (I‚Äôm an early riser) and started working away enumerating, taking notes, and identifying everything in scope. By 12pm I achieved 30 out of the 80 points to pass. I was feeling great, thinking I would get the rest knocked out quickly as I felt very confident what the next steps were. This took a turn by the end of day 1. I was completely lost, I tried everything in the modules. I reread my notes, went through the modules again. Nothing seemed to work. I felt sure that the vulnerabilities were not taught in the exam. I tried everything I could but did not make any progress. Day 2: I started at 7AM with new ideas and feeling confident. I performed more enumeration, took my time through the application, and tried to test everything with all vulnerabilities I think would apply. Again by lunch I made no progress and took a short break. After my break, I felt defeated. I wrote up what I have so far in the report just to have something to submit. I again went back through all features of the application, I tried testing more things I didn‚Äôt try prior. Again I made no progress. After dinner I decided to give it a hard push. The main objective was to enumerate and fuzz everything. I feel like I‚Äôm missing something so I was hoping I would discover more areas of the web application. If it was taught in the module, I fuzzed in this manner. I did not discover anything of use. By midnight I felt like I was in a maze and kept hitting dead ends. So I won‚Äôt be able to get back to it until day 4 and will only have a few hours each day for 5,6, and 7. But I‚Äôm not going to give up, I‚Äôll at least go down swinging. My lessons learned: Work on some HTB labs to simulate the black box scenario. I need to develop a methodology for this style of testing. Similarly, I need to develop a methodical approach. I think I‚Äôm approaching the exam too much like a CTF instead of a real world application. -I need to master the vulnerability class, not memorize the module. I think I need to go back through the modules again in their entirety, I think I‚Äôm missing some key points. If you got this far, thanks for reading. I wish you luck in your studies :)",

      "content_preview": "Finally got and passed exam, here is my story of how I did it. Do not follow this, this is just how I did it. Leading up to the exam: I did all skill assessments 3x and all ipsec unofficial list 2x, and wrote some small write-ups on every box to show the overall steps in about 5 sentences. I didn't do any cyber work for the two days before the exam to go in with full energy. I stopped taking my blood pressure medication, giving me high blood pressure to hold my energy during the exam. The same effect can be achived through lots of caffeine, however I did not want to waste time on the toilet so I did not do that. This also allows me to stay up later than normal and sleep less, so this way I could get 12-14h work days. Exam (technical portion): I finished the technical portion in 4.5 days. During this time, I didn't take any breaks, or go outside at all. I was purely locked in. The longest breaks I took were to eat food, and during that time I was only thinking about the exam. I even woke up in the middle of the night and had a breakthrough lol. I also took minimal notes of everything. I really only recorded necessary steps to pick up my spot where I left off after a possible disconnect or lab reset. Each new flag came with so much pride and hapiness, and I got more and more excited each time I got another flag. Exam (writeup) I finally stepped outside for the first time in 5 days once I finished the technical portion. The sunlight felt incredible, I felt like a bear coming out of hibernation entering into a new world. I began by re-reading the whole notetaking module, since honestly I didn't think I would get this far on my first attempt. I then watched tutorials on how to use sysreptor since I never used it before either. I then got bored and setup self hosted sysreptor on my home server, and ended my 5th day. Then I binged the last half of evangelion. I was no longer locked in. On my 6th day I redid every single attack and took screenshots and evidence. I then started watching cyberpunk edgerunners. On the 7th day I then added text and descriptions to all of my section. I also had to figure out why all of my attacks worked, since honestly during the lessons I didn't really comprehend why they worked just how to do each attack. On the 8th day I wrote my findings section and submitted my report. I rewarded myself by watching and finishing cp (cyberpunk) that night. On the 9th day I figured out how to solve the next bonus flag, and begged the mods to let me back in my exam environment. unfortunately, I was not allowed back in. I then hoped I would fail. Unfortunately, I did not fail, and I will never get to figure out how to solve the last flag. While I would not recommend to take or pass the test this way, It's pretty doable if your already able (or used to) hyperfocus on one thing for days at a time.",
