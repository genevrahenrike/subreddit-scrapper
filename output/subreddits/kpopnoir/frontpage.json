      "content_preview": "K-pop demon hunters came out a couple of months ago and not only was it a pretty good movie, the creative decisions were also very nicely done. The cast and crew from voice actors to concept artist clearly wanted to make this a love letter to both Korean tradition and contemporary culture. That being said, I have a few gripes with the unwarranted (and unnecessary) negative feelings ppl have about this movie coming from K-pop Stans. First, the people who are mad that all truths of the K-pop industry need to understand that this is a KIDS movie. Depicting the extreme diet  & plastic surgery culture along with company abuses in this film would set a bad example to set for them. They constantly complain about how unrealistic it would be for the boy group in the film, the Saja boys, to grow that quickly, yet want their irl K-pop groups to get every award under the sun after debut, what’s really unrealistic. Heck, Disney songs grow and contribute to the film’s success a lot of times, and even with this movie. So ofc this movie would pop off from the music alone, which brings me to my last point. People are mad at how well the song “GOLDEN” is doing, especially IVE Stans. I want to make something very apparent, the people behind the music in this film have produced almost over half of the songs that made the K-pop industry popular and successful today, producing for groups like aespa and Nmixx ect. They have the sparks to make music pop off. Ive Stans are mad bc golden sounds similar to “I am” (which I don’t think it entirely does) and ‘feel bad bc I’ve never got the attention that a fake K-pop group did”. Let me be honest, this take is suuuupperr disrespectful to the artistic integrity that the film has and just boils down very much real songs to just “animated movie soundtrack music”. The fact that I’ve doesnt meet that expectation is bc the song is mostly in English with some Korean lines, so it is able to reach a wider audience, thats just an unfortunate fact. Some of them are trying to make the movie sound annoying or undeserving by trying to say how unfunny it is or the animation being bad bc they’re bitter and really have nothing else to critique, so they make up something about the quality being bad, to which isnt true from both a technical animation standpoint and a concept artist standpoint (I would know, this is my industry) For two it’s a song thats designed to be appealing to lots of people, not just Korean exclusive audiences. To be 100 with y’all, I think they’re mad  bc Huntrix (the movie’s K-pop group) proves that all these competing and wasting time on fanwars for the next shiny new movie award never really mattered as long as a group makes good music, but inreality, a lot of these favs have awards bc their fans wanted to see them win, not bc their music was produced well enough to win. K-pop has had an OBSESSION with accolades as of recent, not bc they want their favs tk pay off their debt but to be the biggest and baddest when the group really don’t deserve the label. A consequence of that is now, no new groups have anything to show for themselves bc they know Stan’s that attach their worth to their fav groups’ win is what’s going to get them to the top. But with that movie busting out that entire worldview, it’s awkward for them to confront that truth. The truth that they wasted all that time acting crazy for a group of people who don’t know them. And much deeper, to confront the truth that you can’t be successful off of eating someone else’s nachos & proximity wins are fake. The success of people who put their blood, sweat and tears (no pun intended) should be congratulated without thinking it was a personal slight to idols.",

      "content_preview": "this isn’t hate to the girls, but rather the company. and yes ik katseye isn’t kpop whatever. but this is more so abt hybe x geffen. i posted this in another sub but i think its better to do it here. with more than half of the group still being of asian descent, white passing or just mixed with white altogether. i dont feel like this was a real attempt at shocking diversity from a kpop company but rather a way to get into a global market with people who aren’t from korea (except yoonchae ofc) while still fitting some type of beauty standard. it is tiring to me, because does anyone seriously think there weren’t dark skins / dark skinned black people who auditioned and weren’t extremely talented enough to be in DA, if not the final lineup atleast? the girls themselves are extremely talented though and are deserving of being famous & recognized for their skills, so i don’t wanna take away from that at all. it’s really more about the way the company handpicked the girls & the trainees in DA. as a black woman i do get tired of never seeing people who look like me, and having a light skinned or biracial person as my “representation”. now clearly katseye aren’t dolls made to represent every person of color, but the company DOES want them to be “relatable” to the masses, their race included. or they wouldn’t have made a global group with other races besides EA. yet i feel nothing. obviously the girls are more than just their race/ethnicity and worked hard for their spots & their main focus IS music and dance, but i also can’t feel connected to them as an “idea” nor as a group because it doesn’t feel real to me from the companies side. it’s another attempt to claim diversity while still picking the ones who are more palatable to society. i hope someone atleast understands what im trying to say i can’t really explain things well. again this isn’t to degrade the members but rather how the company/industry is towards certain types of diversity. but im going to assume the company wanted to play it safe since this was their first attempt at going global. it’s fine if i get hate for this, this is just my opinion and i don’t expect everyone to agree or understand my point. at the end of the day this isn’t a significant issue but something i had thought about.",

However I do still love what I pereceive is a “pure kpop” sound — stuff like What is Love by TWICE, Russian Roulette by Red Velvet, Catallena by Orange Caramel, Rollin by Brave Girls. Totally open to be proven wrong on that though^ because I don’t have that much music knowledge and don’t know if these bubblegum sounds are derived from something too 😅 It also got me thinking if there is any such thing as a “pure kpop” sound that doesn’t derive from other cultures.

      "content_preview": "Hello ladies, gents and everybody else in between! This is my first post on here and I’ve been debating whether to make it or not but hey, yolo… ** this is a very LONG post so bear with me ❤️ As a Black American woman 🤠🦅 I really dislike that that everyone even Black people are being dismissive about the CA that Tarzzan is doing. So many people are defending this mess by saying that it’s “not that serious” when reality it is… There are ACTUAL black people who’ve been stereotyped, discriminated against, arrested, and k*lled (RIP Trayvon Martin) for the same exact image that he is portraying himself as. Many black people have gotten fired from jobs, unable to get jobs, suspended from school, and harassed for HAIR THAT GROWS OUT OF OUR OWN SCALPS and hairstyles that have been our community for hundreds of years. During the 1800’s there was a law passed in the Southern states forcing Black women to cover their hair with scarves to “control” social threats posed by free and enslaved Black women called the “Tignon Law.” If “it isn’t that serious” why do we have The CROWN Act which literally prohibits hair discrimination against black people that is signed in 27 out of the 50 states in the US. Do yall really think that those people just decided to pass it as a “law” because they wanted to be nice to us? No, everyone involved in creating this law had to come with concrete evidence that this is a re-accruing issue for black people in the US. I have had my OWN hair cut off as “prank”, milk and food poured into my hair, even spit balls in hair. And being told that I would better with “straight hair” but get called “baldheaded” for WEARING A WIG. Let me EVEN not get started with being compared to Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, every black male rapper. Hell, I’ve been called George Washington 😭 And yall expect for me and the black K-pop community to be happy about this dude making a profit and MOCKERY of the culture that he sees only as a “sense of fashion.” The thing that gets me is. The black Kpop fans who say that this dude is “representing us” and this is cultural appreciation. HOW?? The Black community has always been vocal of the disdain towards Black men who present themselves the same way that Tarzzan presents himself. Saying’s like “Black people aren’t a monolith”, “what about the nerdy, quirky, whimsical Black people, how come “we” never get representation” (Ikyk that growing up Black mama’s always would say “the way you present yourself is how people are going to treat you” or “you’re a representation of me, so you to dress accordingly”) BUT for some reason he gets a pass because he’s “ATTRACTIVE and Korean” like wtf bro. I guarantee if a black man or woman was to debut in a group with the same “aesthetic” there would be so much discourse about this. Knetz sending buses to get that person kicked out the group, tweets/tiktoks “talking about how K-pop needs to stay Korean” to a MAX and let’s not forget ✨racism✨ Let me not get started on “he grew up in America” or “his band mates grew up in America”… okay and… that doesn’t give him an excuse to do what he is doing, also if he did grow up in America. He would know that not all black people are the same culturally, economically, socially, and aesthetically . Clearly, he saw “Crank that Soulja Boy”music video and got inspired 😂 (fr he literally dresses like my brother did back in 2007) I’m not about the talk about the way this man TYPES on insta I would “accept” this if he was giving back to the Black community but he’s not going to so, it’ll always BE UP for me when he’s bought into the conversation… It has ALWAYS been more than about “hair” and “style”. So, yeah it is “that serious” and will always be until changes are made about the societal perceptions of Black people. I’m tired of this, but Thank yall for coming to my TED talk… ❤️🫰🏼😘 Edit: THANK YALL for 1,000 likes ❤️ I didn’t think this post would get that far… and I thought I would’ve gotten a lot of hate 😭 Thank yall again ❤️",

      "content_preview": "Like hair aside why does her outfit not fit with all the others. All the other girls had a cohesive theme and matching elements that tie the outfits together. A funky jacket, legs are covered (either by lace leggings for K and W and leather for N) wierd/jarring colours and a lace element somewhere in the outfit. But Giselle got none of that just plain black top, wierd puffy shorts and a fur coat for like 3 photos. All the other girls had a Rockstar kind of vibe, the outfits are messy and jarring especially with the colour shots so there's contrast. Karina gets these wierd red lace leggings that are highlighted against the bright blue background. Winter gets this Pink almost cape-like coat that draws your eyes in against the bright green background. Ning²  gets this red (i forgot what the material called but its like fuzzy silk) blazer, leather pants, a lace bra and glittery silver boots it's so ugly it rolls back to being cunty and against that bright yellow background it's so overwhelming it makes a statement. Then there's Gisele, black top, black shorts and a black and white fur coat against a red background (and even the background wasnt on theme either because it was not as saturated as the others) it all just looks generic compared to the rest. The concept is Rockstar, it's supposed to be in your face, bright, aggressive, strange even, Rockstars challenge the norm and make you uncomfortable with how over the top they are not black on black on black. It's genuinely so strange how SM continuously sets their own artists up for failure i noticed it with Red Velvet (one of the biggest kpop acts ever and no world tour? Really??) I really hope people actually criticize SM and their stylists instead of attacking the artist whos been getting mistreated",

      "content_preview": "I was looking at a few stats randomly. Started because I was looking into r&b singers and got into kpop by chance. I looked at Katseye unique listeners (I choose unique since fans can bulk stream and it throws off numbers). I noticed that on Spotify their unqiue monthly listeners are similar to many other kpop acts that do tours. Acts like Twice, Stray Kidz, Blackpink etc. In some cases maybe passing them slightly but to their credit they just released sn album. I looked at YouTube and their 90 day is doing well also. So I think while I cant say 100% confidence how their pure sales would look like but I think with a full album they might be able to do arena tours (10-20K) if spread out and maybe stadium if fans see willing to travel to 2-3 locations. Since fans may not be as dedicated yet I would say arena more likely especially since they just sold out last tour. They have way more listeners than a lot of kpop acts that do arenas already. It's likely that like other western acts their strengths maybe in touring rather than pure sales. Outside of USA I think Philipines is the other one they do really well. Before I wasnt so sure about Asia byt I think they might be okay there also. The only place i dont quite see them expanding YET (im a data person) is outside kpop adjacent niche fanbase. I'm not sure YET if they would be able to get to the level of a mainstream artist. Mostly due to marketing. Only time will tell.",

      "content_preview": "Below are some links to fundraisers to donate to in order to help people in Sudan and Congo. A lot of them are very close to reaching their goals. In Sudan, for those who are unaware, Sudan has the largest and fastest displacement crisis in the world and represents the largest humanitarian crisis ever recorded. 12 million people have been displaced and 30.4 million people are in need of humanitarian aid. 24.6 million people are experiencing food insecurity and 2 million or more people are facing catastrophic levels of hunger. Areas in the country have now reached phase 5 famine. This is the result of a civil war that has ruined and taken the lives of many innocent civilians. Explained on rescue.org : “Sudan’s civil war, waged between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), erupted on April 15, 2023, plunging the country into chaos. Civilians bear the brunt of the conflict; sexual violence is widespread, fighters on both sides regularly target civilians and infrastructure, and child soldier recruitment is common. Human rights groups have accused fighters in Darfur of ethnic cleansing.” This is a link to a gofundme for a kitchen aid initiative to feed the hungry in Khartoum, Sudan: https://gofund.me/7b3bef8c A second link is to a gofundme to help a family who were displaced in Sudan who need help with funds in order to move to Egypt: https://gofund.me/af9f9666 These are also links to Sudanese organisations suggested by Sudanese people that are raising money to provide humanitarian aid to those who are displaced or experiencing extreme food shortages: https://sadagaat-usa.org/ https://www.etharrelief.org/sudan-crisis As for the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country is also experiencing a humanitarian crisis that is quickly worsening. As conflict in the eastern part of the country escalates, 7 million or more people have been displaced, thousands have lost their lives due to violence and millions of people are experiencing acute food insecurity. According to rescue.org: “Reports of war crimes, crimes against humanity, sexual violence and human rights violations continue to mount. As fighting escalates millions have been left without food, clean water or medical care. Overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to cope, while the risk of disease outbreaks, including cholera, grows daily. Urgent humanitarian assistance is needed to prevent further loss of life.” Here is a link to donate to an organisation supporting young girls who have been victims of sexual assault in Goma, eastern DRC: https://gofund.me/e357af3e Another link to a gofundme created by an organisation providing access to education, healthcare and essential resources for Congolese communities: https://gofund.me/df210fa7 And lastly, this is a link to the gofundme created by a Congolese organisation to provide humanitarian support to women and children in a displacement camp in Goma, DRC: https://gofund.me/4575ba5a You can also follow the account focuscongo on instagram which shares important information about the ongoing genocide in the DRC and how companies and countries support/are complicit in the suffering of Congolese people by supporting the illegal mining of the mineral cobalt by young children, who are often abused or raped and often die for the benefit of tech companies who use the mineral to create their products: https://www.instagram.com/focuscongo?igsh=bTJ2cnE0anZlenFn Thank you to all those who are supporting! :)",

I first noticed this when she posted a picture and she looked different to me. Her makeup slowly shifted. I first noticed this around the same time she collaborated with Twice and her trip to Korea. I have had friends in the past who have adjusted their appearance due interests. I love Megan, she’s my girl. I love how confident and unapologetic she is. This is not a hate post. In fact this is a post asking if anyone else noticed a difference? I just saw a clip from that show she is doing with Psy and it made me write this post. Idk what to put for the flair so I did chit chat. It’s not really a complaint just an observation.",

      "content_preview": "Edit: I deleted my original post due to formatting issues, and I forgot to repost it earlier until now. Hello everyone, we meet again 😃 (This is kinda long, sorry 🫰🏼) Idk if this subject has already been discussed, but I saw where the channel has resurfaced online again… and it really had me wondering, “why was this a thing to begin with?” I truly believe that this channel/page thrived on the insecurities and low self esteem of many young Black girls and women. (1) Let me explain why. As someone who unfortunately fell into the propaganda. I found that page, during a time where I felt badly about myself. At that time I was just getting into Kpop, and seeing the “attractive Korean guys” interact with girls and women that looked like “me” gave me somewhat a sense of self, a confidence boost (which isn’t a bad thing), but in reality they were just doing what they do with every one, regardless of race and gender, who PAYS to see them. It’s simply just fan service… Now looking back, that page and others alike, they would over exaggerate those interactions most of the time, granted YES some videos used were lowkey giving “do y’all need a room or something 😂” especially those old concerts clips where they would bring the fans on stage… but overall, those vids & pics were made out to be something that they simply weren’t. (2) Social Media rising in the past 5-15 years with the help of TikTok, there has been an increase of Black girls and women facing generalization stereotypes, being the blame for every SINGLE ISSUE in the black community and going through all of the “-ism’s” from non-black people & people from our own community, especially the men online. (Let me not forget at school as well) ( Shoutout to Kevin Samuels & Fresh and Fit 🙄) That also affected the self-esteem of many young Black girls and women. Reiterating myself, that channel kinda became an escape for young Black girls and women to see themselves in “positive light and desirable” even if it was feeding into delusions of these men “liking us” 😭 Now, do I believe that there are male Kpop idols that are physically attracted to Black women, Yes… But, just like in every other racial group, most men and women date and marry within their own. Like we’ll have heard stories of Black women in Korea trying to date, taken seriously, not just someone to check off a bucket list or something like that. Interracial relationships/marriages are still fairly new (1967) and still in the minority with only 12% in the US alone as of 2020, and AMBW marriages being way lower than AMWF marriages. I say that to say, 9 chances out of 10 these male Kpop idols who desire heterosexual relationships will BE WITH OTHER KOREAN WOMEN, then white women. Tbh, I would be VERY surprised if a male Kpop idol were to marry a Black woman based on how a lot of Korean men will only f*ck & fetishize us like we’re some type of foreign species😐 Also Korean men are more conservative as well, so a lot of them aren’t probably open to dating out, including male Kpop idols. (**NO I’m not saying that Black women are not worthy of genuine love and respect or undesirable by saying that **) Also, let’s not forget the casual racism and cultural stereotypes that Black women (and men) face from the Kpop industry & non-Black stans… LORD FORBID a black girl talk about her Kpop biases online without hating ass b*txhes talking ish, THESE MEN DONT LIKE YOU EITHER… Honorable mention: Don’t forget about the random Kpop men that have a large Black women audience, the non-Black Kpop stans be SWEARING UP AND DOWN that they want us and feeding into the delusions as well. cough, cough mingi 🫣 Sometimes, I think that they be setting us up to receive hate online by racists. Anyhoo, I don’t think that it was an entirely bad idea to create a channel showcasing Black women’s experiences being Kpop stans, exposing Black women to something that is sorta a taboo within the Black community, but it was the total opposite. (based on memory, I try to block that out of my head 😷) It would’ve been better and effective for “that person” create a channel where Black Women themselves are the highlight, giving young Black girls inspiration through other Black women who established in their respective fields and/or give Black girls affirmations for those bad moments in life… Not profiting off the vulnerability of young Black girls and women living in a world that isn’t always kind to us or in our favor. And practically being saesang in your 30’s 🚩🚩🚩 GIRL GO FILE YOUR TAXES OR SOMETHING These are my thoughts… Let me know y’all’s thoughts ❤️",

We ended up getting into a small back and forth through the comments and then they insinuated that us wanting idols to respect our culture and indulge in it properly or not do it at all is segregation. Segregation. That’s where we’re at and I have no words. Someone please tell me I’m not going insane.",

In my opinion kpop is a work of jack of all trades master of none. They have the look, can dance and sing but none of those things standout on a way that really makes me go wow. Especially going to see non K-pop acts like Beyoncé or Adele I’ve personally never heard standout vocals from a kpop artist. Can anyone point me in a direction where there is just some good vocals? Like they can really sing. Like Sannng??",
