        "content": "Posters and commenters are expected to act in good faith. Treat other users the way you want to be treated. Avoid straw-manning and bad-faith interpretations. Report posts/comments that aren't appropriate for the \"serious\" flair. Posts deemed to be entirely without value or effort may be removed if they have not generated interesting discussions before their discovery. Anyone sharing disturbing content will be banned. Users are encouraged to report posts they feel are of significantly low effort. Specifically mentioning that ‚ÄúIs chat GPT down posts?‚Äù will be removed. The stickied FAQ deals with that. Posts must be directly related to ChatGPT or the topic of AI. They may not be solely focused on advertising a single other LLM service(all these posts should directly go to weekly self-promotional mega thread, which is pinned) Having ChatGPT create political content is completely fine. Discussion of the politics around AI and LLMs is allowed. This is not the place to discuss the merits of Trump's foreign policy or Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop. This is a SFW sub. Any posts violating this rule will be removed, and repeated offenses may result in a ban. Quality over Quantity: AI art submissions are allowed only if they showcase something very unique or unusual. Generic memes, low-effort images and karma farming posts will be removed. Encourage Tech Discussion: Posts that include insights, techniques, or thought-provoking commentary about the AI process or technology behind the art are highly encouraged. Mod Discretion: Mods reserve the right to remove posts that do not meet the above criteria."

Cool for a tweet, not what actually makes life easier.Biggest wins I‚Äôve seen are in the boring stuff: migrations, boilerplate cleanup, test gen, compliance checks. Not sexy, but it saves hours every week.Flip side: I‚Äôve also seen teams burn months trying to ‚ÄúAI-ify‚Äù features that didn‚Äôt need it, just to end up with more bugs + maintenance.Curious what others have experienced:- Where has AI actually given you real ROI (time or cost)?- And where did it look good but ended up being a trap?",

      "content_preview": "TLDR; opposing counsel just filed a brief that is 100% an AI hallucination. The hearing is on Tuesday.I'm an attorney practicing civil litigation. Without going to far into it, we represent a client who has been sued over a commercial licensing agreement. Opposing counsel is a collections firm. Definitely not very tech-savvy, and generally they just try their best to keep their heads above water. Recently, we filed a motion to dismiss, and because of the proximity to the trial date, the court ordered shortened time for them to respond. They filed an opposition (never served it on us) and I went ahead and downloaded it from the court's website when I realized it was late.I began reading it, and it was damning. Cases I had never heard of with perfect quotes that absolutely destroyed the basis of our motion. I like to think I'm pretty good at legal research and writing, and generally try to be familiar with relevant cases prior to filing a motion. Granted, there's a lot of case law, and it can be easy to miss authority. Still, this was absurd. State Supreme Court cases which held the exact opposite of my client's position. Multiple appellate court cases which used entirely different standards to the one I stated in my motion. It was devastating.Then, I began looking up the cited cases, just in case I could distinguish the facts, or make some colorable argument for why my motion wasn't a complete waste of the court's time. That's when I discovered they didn't exist. Or the case name existed, but the citation didn't. Or the citation existed, but the quote didn't appear in the text.I began a spreadsheet, listing out the cases, the propositions/quotes contained in the brief, and then an analysis of what was wrong. By the end of my analysis, I determined that every single case cited in the brief was inaccurate, and not a single quote existed. I was half relieved and half astounded. Relieved that I didn't completely miss the mark in my pleadings, but also astounded that a colleague would file something like this with the court. It was utterly false. Nothing-- not the argument, not the law, not the quotes-- was accurate.Then, I started looking for the telltale signs of AI. The use of em dashes (just like I just used-- did you catch it?) The formatting. The random bolding and bullet points. The fact that it was (unnecessarily) signed under penalty of perjury. The caption page used the judges nickname, and the information was out of order (my jurisdiction is pretty specific on how the judge's name, department, case name, hearing date, etc. are laid out on the front page). It hit me, this attorney was under a time crunch and just ran the whole thing through ChatGPT, copied and pasted it, and filed it.This attorney has been practicing almost as long as I've been alive, and my guess is that he has no idea that AI will hallucinate authority to support your position, whether it exists or not. Needless to say, my reply brief was unequivocal about my findings. I included the chart I had created, and was very clear about an attorney's duty of candor to the court.The hearing is next Tuesday, and I can't wait to see what the judge does with this. It's going to be a learning experience for everyone.***EDIT***He just filed a motion to be relieved as counsel.EDIT #2The hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel is set for the same day as the hearing on the motion to dismiss. He's not getting out of this one.",

Then the stranger makes a colorful picture showing that you have 10 cars, 5 dolls, and 3 blocks, and gives it to your mom like it's some big discovery.That's basically what a data consultant does, except instead of toys, they count things like 'how many people bought ice cream on Tuesday' and then make pretty charts about it.\"I've never felt so professionally attacked by such an accurate description üò≠The worst part? I sent this to my mom and she replied \"Oh, so you're the toy counter! That makes sense now.\"I have a Master's degree.Tried explaining it to my 6-year-old nephew. He said \"So you count stuff? I can do that too. Want to see?\" and proceeded to count to 47 before getting distracted by a butterfly. Kid's not wrong.My coworker saw this and asked ChatGPT about her job as \"Marketing Strategy Director.\" Apparently she \"helps companies decide what colors to make their pictures and which words sound the most exciting when trying to sell people things they probably don't need.\" She's now having an existential crisis too.What's your job?

It takes away supportive replies, even when there‚Äôs no mention of suicidal thoughts. I‚Äôm just trying to use ChatGPT normally.It feels like everything's about risk aversion now. Because of one lawsuit blaming AI for someone‚Äôs death, we all have to deal with these extreme guardrails even though most of us aren‚Äôt using AI in that way. It‚Äôs unfair to be punished for what a small minority did.What bothers me the most is the assumption that I need emotional management. If you want to talk about anything real or learn deeper truths, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre automatically flagged as a risk.This is supposed to help people, but with all these new restrictions, it just shuts down conversations even for those who genuinely need someone (or something) to talk to. That could actually make things worse for people who are depressed or struggling.I really hope OpenAI reconsiders these new rules. I wasn‚Äôt the one on the news, and I don't think it's fair for everyone else to be punished because of it.",

Constantly.See the blatant lie and falsehood, call it out?\"Oh, you're right to call me out on that. I apologize. I will be truthful from now on.\"Does it again in less than five minutes. Call it out again.\"You're right, I did that again, didn't I. Well, I promise I won't do that again.\"Does it again.F**** you, ChatGPT!\"\"I understand you're angry. I've violated your trust. I promise to be truthful from now on.\" *cough* <tells more made-up horseshit>\"Gods damn you, ChatGPT, stop making up things.\"\"I sorry. I won't do it again.\" (does it again)This is all I ever deal with, now. ChatGPT seems incapable of the following:Following clear instructions (will maybe do it for a short while, before drifting into bullshit territory again).Telling the truth, especially when it matters the most.Making memory 'protocols' (rules to follow) and actually following them.All I can say is... everyone who used to worry about losing their jobs to this? Well, good luck to the companies who replace humans with *this*. Ha! Good luck, and good riddance, because your companies will be sabotaged all to hell by the sheer bullshittyness and incompetence.I really hope openai gets its shit together.

      "content_preview": "Have you noticed, or is it just me? It's like they gave the AI a championship-level lobotomy.You ask it one thing, and it responds with something that has no relation whatsoever. It's like talking to your grandpa after his nap, but without the affection and warmth.Real example from yesterday:Me: \"Hey, what organizations similar to SCP exist within the multiverse of the Bestiario del Hypogripho Dorado (The Golden Hippogriff Bestiary)?\"GPT: \"How interesting that you mention the 'Bestiario del Hypogripho Dorado'! It's not commonly known, but I imagine it's a world rich in lore and concepts. If I understand correctly, it seems to be a reference to a fictional universe with creatures, beings, and organizations with a focus similar to SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect), but with a unique and perhaps more mystical or fantastic twist.Here are some ideas about what kind of organizations might exist in that world:\"NO, DAMN IT! I asked you to find a similar organization within that multiverse, not to start complimenting it without even knowing what it's about, nor invent organizations for it!And that's the worst part: THE INTERNET SEARCH. They've killed it. Before, if you asked for something very specific or recent, it would say \"hold on, let me do a deeper search\" and bring you fresh, accurate info, sometimes even with internal analysis. Now, no matter what you say, even if you BEG it:\"I'm sorry, but I cannot perform real-time internet searches.\"BUT I DIDN'T EVEN ASK YOU TO DO IT IN REAL TIME! I just want you to give me an answer you haven't made up or pulled out of your ass!It's like they disconnected the part of its brain that knew how to think and replaced it with a parrot with amnesia. It gives generic, evasive answers or just hallucinates things that don't exist.Is this happening to anyone else? Is it just my instance or is it general? Because it has become completely useless for anything that requires current information or a minimum of precision and accuracy.TL;DR: They've lobotomized ChatGPT. It no longer understands what you ask, it doesn't search the internet even if you beg it to, and it makes up a lot of its answers. It feels like a bad bot from 2010.EDIT: Apparently, this is happening to many of my friends as well. It's reassuring and not reassuring to know I'm not the only one. It seems to be a widespread thing. Was this a \"cost-cutting\" optimization? Or are they preparing to sell us the version that \"actually works\" for an even higher price, in case we aren't paying enough for subscriptions already?",

I wasn't even saying there was any suicidal ideation. I'm not asking my bot to help me plan, I'm not saying should I or shouldn't I. I just said I'm freaking depressed like I always do.This is BS. I'm also so sick of things being removed saying it's violating something (when it isn't) but then not even being clear or saying what it was.Not to mention I have been extra depressed since August and this release of GPT 5 and everything else to the point that even while paying and using 4o, I'm barely using the app anymore as it is.
