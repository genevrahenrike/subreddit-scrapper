      "content_preview": "Hi all, I’m preparing to teach a full university course, and I’m currently using Quarto + RevealJS to generate interactive lecture slides. The integration with R, Markdown, and bib/csl-based citations makes it an excellent tool for academic content. I can easily embed: ggplot2 graphics, R tables, code chunks Leaflet maps and other interactive widgets Mathematical notation via LaTeX References via BibTeX or CSL So far, Quarto has worked well for individual lectures. But now that I’ll be preparing many slide decks over a full semester, I want to optimize the setup for consistency, modularity, and ease of maintenance. I’m considering these possible directions: Keep using Quarto + RevealJS, but structure the course more explicitly (e.g. separate folder per week/topic, global bibliography). Consider Quarto websites, using the course structure to create a full teaching portal with embedded slides. Generate PDFs via Beamer or LaTeX for offline/printable versions, maybe for some more formal lectures or handouts. Automate rendering using Makefile, Git hooks, or CLI scripts. I’d love to hear how others manage: Long-term teaching material maintenance Reusable content (e.g. shared plots, references, definitions) Version control and reproducibility Balancing HTML interactivity with PDF distribution My setup is mostly open-source, and I use Neovim as my main editor, but I’m happy to mix RStudio for preview/rendering when it’s useful. Thanks in advance! I’d really appreciate hearing how others in the R/Quarto/teaching community handle this!",

What I'm being asked to do is apparently very simple but my brain just can't seem to comprehend what I'm meant to do. Here is a portion of my data that I'm using. My main goal is to evaluate the species richness of a conifer forest floor using quadrat percentage coverage (As you can see in the column named \"cover\"). So, in quadrat 1 (q1) of the treatment area cg1, nettles covered approximately 20% of the ground within said quadrat, whilst herb robert covered 15%, etc. I received this email from my supervisor telling me what I need to do: \"For testing differences in species richness, you will be using treatment as a variable, for your rarefaction curves, you will need to look at replicates. Have a look at stacked bar charts (vertically stacked) as a way to represent your percentage cover data (I would do this step first).\" I've managed to complete a Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normal distribution, But I feel so lost.

      "content_preview": "I work in crime statistics, NIBRS data specifically. We are trying to automate a lot of data prep and one sticking point is our downloads come as text files. (Will be this way for foreseeable future). Legacy text import wizard in Excel works but a lot of hands on adjustments that could cause issues. The problem is the text file is uniform in structure...except for the start and stop of each \"page\". It's just the way the system does it cause its old. I deidentified everything but this is a LEOKA (Law Enforcement Officers Killed/Assaulted) trace file. In a perfect world we want to be able to have R read the text file into a project, erase all the garbage and leave the column headers in the top yellow outline, and the lines of code in the bottom yellow outline. Basically cutting out all the red stuff and leave just the category headers and each line that corresponds to an entry. This structure is pretty much the same across all of the other reports. We are using these trace files once they are cleaned up in other projects we have already written that spits out all the category totals and statistics that we want. This is just a part that would speed up the process where we could download the text file, run it through this program, get the \"cleaned trace file\" and then use that in the other programs to calculate all of our totals that we need for our reports. I am fairly green with R but I have past history with code but it's been years. Done some training with a coworker and some online stuff for R Shiny and ArcGIS Bridge. Is this do-able? I wasn't sure if R had a way for me to set vertical column breaks based on the repeating structure you see in the yellow and have it ignore or remove all the other junk. https://preview.redd.it/text-file-import-and-clean-up-question-v0-yu5ctxcgd7lf1.png",

I have a database (ordinal variables only) and no problem with calculating Kendall's Tau-b, but it only works with cor() for the entire database and cor.test () for each pair of variables.

Class = df KEN <- cor(data1, data2, method=\"kendall\") KEN$p.value Error in KEN$p.value : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors KEN2 <- cor.test(data1, data2, method=\"kendall\") Error in cor.test.default(data1, data2, method = \"kendall\") : 'x' must be a numeric vector I do not know what is wrong, and why R is assuming my df as not numeric, it only contains numbers. It shows all Kendall's correlations in a table, but I cannot access to p-values. Does anyone knows what to do here? Thank you in advance.",

Right now, whenever the agent generates instructions, I use the Rscript command line utility to execute the code. This works fine for single, isolated runs — it opens a session, runs the script, and closes it. The issue is that the LLM makes multiple calls in sequence, and often wants to use previously computed results (variables, loaded data, etc.). Since each Rscript call is a fresh process, all the state is lost between runs. I haven’t found a good way to persist user/session data or computation results across calls. Is there a way to: Maintain a persistent R session in the background that multiple calls can talk to? Or somehow share variables / environment across Rscript invocations? Any other R images by default supports? Any pointers, libraries, or architectural suggestions would be super helpful. Thanks!",

You want to write your code in the source panel, and it outputs in the console.\" Well, fair enough, now I know. But this raises another question. If the source panel is where you're supposed to type, then why, when you start a new project, do you see: the console taking up 75% of the screen, no visible source panel, and a blinking cursor inviting you to type in the console? It's like it's actively baiting you into using it wrong. What purpose does this design serve?",

It's only a little annoyance, but I believe that after a few hundred of added articles it will be really frustrating to have to refresh then find the new file again before being able to add attributes. I know it is a quite old, unmaintained program, but if anybody has a fix for that I would be really grateful. Thank you for your time!",

However, after deploying to shinyapps.io , the app only ever uses the file that existed at deploy time. Even though the GitHub file changes, the deployed app doesn’t pull the update unless I redeploy the app. Question: * Is shinyapps.io capable of fetching a fresh copy of the file from GitHub at runtime, or does the server’s container isolate the app so it can’t update external data unless redeployed? * If runtime fetching is possible, are there special settings or patterns I should use so the app refreshes the data from GitHub without redeploying?

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, I am currently writing my bachelor’s thesis in Psychology and am trying to visualize my findings from my study. I am using R (and I am terrible with the program), but I was wondering if there is a way to visualize e.g. moderated mediations diagrams or moderation diagrams (APA 7 conforming) and such? I know you can print out correlation tables, but I was wondering if there is a way to visualize that in R Studio. I’ve tried multiple codes the AI gave me (because I have no clue of R) and I am not aware of another method for visualizing data APA 7 conforming in another software (I don’t have SPSS). I am very thankful for any advice.",

      "content_preview": "I have a rather large script at about 2000 lines of a modeling process. Over time I notice using either rmd or qmd that they get very slow to actually run chunks (like waiting 10 minutes for simple commands). It helps a little to clean up my environment but eventually it gets so slow it's unusable. When I work in just an R script it runs super fast. Has anyone else experienced this? I was this was a way to use something like rmd or qmd when building out the code because I find it very useful to print the results below each code chunk. If it helps, I'm using RStudio version 2024.09.0 Build 375.",

      "content_preview": "I created a table with some descriptive statistics (N, mean, sd, min, max)for for some of my variables using the datasummary() command from the 'modelsummary' package. The 'modelsummary' package lets you style your table using commands from the 'tinytable' package and its syntax (e.g. the command tt_style() to customize cell color, add lines in your table etc.). I used the following code: datasummary(\n  (Age = age) + (Education = education)  + (`Gender:` = gender) + (`Party identification:` = party_id) ~ \n    Mean + SD + Min + Max + N, \n  df_wide) %>%\n  style_tt(i = c(1,2,5),\n           line = \"b\") %>%\n  style_tt(j = c(3:7),\n           align = \"r\") This creates this table. https://preview.redd.it/customization-of-modelsummary-tables-with-tinytable-v0-d4e09akwnkhf1.png Now I have the following (aesthetic) problem: The categorical variables contain numbers that are 'codes' for a categorie - so for example I have the variable gender that contains numerical values from 1 to 3; 1 = male, 2 = female, 3 = gender diverse. The gender variable is a factor and each number is labelled accordingly. When creating the table, this results in the category names (male, female, gender diverse) being shown next to the variable name (Gender). So now the variable names 'Gender' and Party 'identification' are not aligned with 'age' and 'Education'. I would rather have the category names being shown under the variable names, so that all variable names align. The row with the variable names of the categorical variables should remain empty (I hope y'all understand what I mean here). I couldn't find anything on the official documentation of 'modelsummary' and 'tinytable' - ChatGPT wasn't helpful either, so I hope that maybe some of you guys have a solution for me here. Thanks in advance!",
