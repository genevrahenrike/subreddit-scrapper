      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm a big college basketball fan and wanted to find a better way to predict champions for my bracket this year. So, I decided to build a model using historical season data. Check it out here:https://marchhoopss.vercel.app/(It will take a while to start since I'm currently running the server on a free plan)It essentially ranks the teams most likely to win the tournament.I tested two different approaches:üíªBaselineAs a baseline, this model will simply predict the highest seeds as the most likely champions, so we can identify the accuracy of when we just predict the highest seeds each timeüèÄ Ridge RegressionCaptures general trends, like how a higher seed or lower turnover rate might correlate with going deeper in the tournament.Since it‚Äôs linear regression, it makes the reasoning behind predictions transparent‚Äîyou can see the weight each stat (e.g., seed, pace) contributes.With regularization, it also avoids overvaluing stats that are too closely related (since good teams usually dominate across many categories).üå≤ Random ForestBetter at picking up complex and nonlinear patterns.Can detect subtle interactions, like when a fast, lower-seed team with strong defense matches up well against a slower, higher-seed team.This makes it useful for spotting potential upsets.I‚Äôd love your thoughts!üëâ What product features would you want to see built on top of this? (like bracket simulators, upset alerts, confidence scores, betting-style odds, etc.)üëâ What would make this most useful or fun for fans like you?The goal is to make more open source tools for fans like myself and have people use it!!",

Le Moyne played SUNY Cobleskill twice in the 1948-49 season and won both games. SUNY Cobleskill was a two-year institution at the time, and the NCAA's Bevo Francis rule does not allow these games to be counted. Since Cobleskill was a junior college, it may count the losses in its junior college record. Since that season was only the second year since commencement of classes, Le Moyne's entire team was composed of sophomores.Le Moyne is 1-17 vs current Big East members. They beat Providence in 1952.Le Moyne is 105-100 vs current MAAC members. The 205 games played is the most against the curent collective opponents from any conference, including the NEC.Le Moyne's previous meeting with Lafayette was a home loss in 1970.As a D-II team, Le Moyne played two exhibition games at D-I Monmouth and went 1-1.Texas will be the first of the current SEC members Le Moyne has ever played. They defeated former SEC member Sewanee in 2003.Le Moyne is 1-17 vs current A10 teams. The only win came at home against Saint Joseph's in 1955.Le Moyne is 5-21 vs current ACC members with all the wins coming vs Boston College. Le Moyne beat Boston College four straight seasons between 1953 and 1956. Their other win came in 1977. The teams haven't played since 1979.In their third season in D-I and the NEC, Le Moyne has a history against three current NEC members, since they were in the same D-II conferences at various times. Series records vs NEC members:Central Connecticut 7-6Chicago State 1-1Fairleigh Dickinson 2-3Long Island 2-3Mercyhurst 18-3New Haven 26-18Saint Francis 3-6Stonehill 26-19Wagner 2-3Le Moyne didn't play any D-III opponents during their last 18 years in D-II. They have won 11 straight games vs D-III opponents with the most recent loss in 2002. They did, however, lose to an NAIA Division II opponent in 2004.",

Diving for loose balls, taking charges, rebounding against bigger frontcourts, and hitting clutch shots. Without him, Butler doesn‚Äôt make that 2010‚Äì2011 run, plain and simple.Howard was the Horizon League POY, a three-time Academic All-American, and finished with over 1,800 points and 800 rebounds. Yet he‚Äôs barely mentioned when we talk about the great college players of that era...I personally think he's one of the most underrated players of the 2010s who deserve more lovehttps://preview.redd.it/matt-howard-doesnt-get-talked-about-enough-v0-7rpf9r2h37mf1.png",
