      "content_preview": "Currently being recruited by several D3 programs while trying to maintain academics for admissions. Sharing my system because juggling both nearly broke me. My setup: Google sheets with every school, coach contact, visit dates, application deadlines, academic requirements Color coded by recruitment interest level vs academic fit Separate tab tracking every coach email/call with notes Academic requirements vs my stats (some schools recruiting me hard but I'm barely at their academic threshold) Reality checks: Coaches promise playing time but admissions makes decisions \"Love your game\" doesn't mean they'll support your application Some coaches ghost you after you visit Academic pre-reads are everything for recruited athletes Been using hello college to manage the academic side while handling recruitment myself. They helped identify schools where I'm both athletically and academically viable, and their process for balancing both has been super helpful. Biggest lesson: the school that wants you most athletically might not be where you can get in academically. Have backup plans. Anyone else trying to figure this out? How are you managing both processes?",

He wasn’t flashy but he was the ultimate glue guy. Diving for loose balls, taking charges, rebounding against bigger frontcourts, and hitting clutch shots. Without him, Butler doesn’t make that 2010–2011 run, plain and simple. Howard was the Horizon League POY, a three-time Academic All-American, and finished with over 1,800 points and 800 rebounds. Yet he’s barely mentioned when we talk about the great college players of that era... I personally think he's one of the most underrated players of the 2010s who deserve more love https://preview.redd.it/matt-howard-doesnt-get-talked-about-enough-v0-7rpf9r2h37mf1.png",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone! I do these conference rankings every year so it's finally that time when rosters are more or less set for the upcoming season. I have * next to players who are injured for the start of the 2025-26 season, confirmed to redshirt this season, or out/uncertain for another reason. SEC Breakdown We begin where we ended last season with the reigning national champions.  The Gators return a deeply talented frontcourt led by Alex Condon, Thomas Haugh, and Reuben Chinyelu.  Micah Handlogten will be healthy and ready to rock off the bench.  But while Golden retains his three headed monster in the front court he loses his entire starting backcourt namely the NCAA Tournament's most outstanding player in Walter Clayton Jr. and defensive catalysts Alijah Martin and Will Richard.  To ease the losses, Golden turns to Arkansas transfer Boogie Fland and Princeton transfer Xaivian Lee both of whom can score, pass, and shoot.  Fland and Lee are capable guards but don't expect to see a Walter Clayton-esque season out of either of them.  The two freshmen C.J. Ingram and Alex Lloyd should be ready to play big minutes and I am high on Slovenian guard Urban Klavzar having a sophomore jump.  I think a breakout season for Thomas Haugh is incoming.  Florida has a shot to repeat! Kentucky basketball looked pretty good in year one under Mark Pope and this year's team figures to be even better and extremely deep.  Second team All-SEC player Otega Oweh is back to lead the charge and he's paired with Pitt transfer PG Jaland Lowe.  Lowe can create for his teammates and is a capable operator in the pick and roll.  Kentucky should be an excellent defensive squad led by ASU transfer Jayden Quaintance who averaged 2.5 BPG last season.  Joining him are Bama transfer Mo Dioubate and Florida transfer Denzel Aberdeen both of whom are above average defenders.  Jasper Johnson is a pure shot maker who should bring some instant scoring off the bench and Kam Williams, the Tulane transfer, is a flamethrower 3 point shooter.  Garrison and Moreno round out the front court.  UK is deep, athletic, full of shooters and scorers, and has a pure PG and rim protector.  I'm a believer in this year's Wildcats squad. John Calipari was able to put it together at the end of the last season after getting off to a semi-rocky start.  D.J. Wagner and Karter Knox are your experienced returnees.  But the two gems of the recruiting class, Darius Acuff and Meleek Thomas, are what will propel them to the top of the SEC.  Acuff is an outstanding lead guard who plays with toughness, speed, and craftiness.  He can make tough shots and he's a supremely talented passer.  Thomas plays more with a scoring first mentality.  Malique Ewin and Nick Pringle are both good rim protectors and lob threats who can snatch up rebounds.  We'll see what Calipari gets out of the international guys.  If they aren't ready to rock it will be a short rotation again for the Hogs.  Tennessee loses long time defensive PG Zakai Zeigler and scorer Chaz Lanier.  Rick Barnes nabbed talented guard Ja'Kobi Gillespie from Maryland and will pair him with top freshman wing Nate Ament.  Gillespie is a 40% shooter from distance and is a great passer and a menace in the passing lanes on defense.  Ament can shoot, handle the ball, and is extremely athletic.  Tennessee will go as far as these two take them but the supporting cast is exactly the type of guys you need to surround those two with.  Alabama loses quite a lot from last year but there are a few intriguing pieces in Tuscaloosa.  First and foremost Labaron Philon returns for his sophomore season where he should be the focal point.  Aiden Sherrell should be a monster down low this season and I expect Aden Holloway and Latrell Wrightsell to make tough shots.  Alabama's season depends on how good the transfers and freshmen can be as depth pieces.  Auburn loses their entire team from a Final Four run except Tahaad Pettiford who should be the go to guy on the Plains.  Bruce Pearl has snagged some JUCO and D2 guys who should fit right into his scheme and I expect Keyshawn Hall and KeShawn Murphy to have big seasons too.  Auburn will not be as good as last year but they should be just fine for another March run. The top 6 teams in the SEC are clear cut for me and I think all six of them have a shot at the SEC crown but here's where things start to get murky.  Mark Byington got Vandy to the tournament in Year 1 and I expect this year's team to be even better.  This team has a ton of three point shooting and plenty of experience.  Devin McGlockton has been an unsung star and I love the additions of Tyler Harris, Duke Miles, and Mikes James.  The key I think comes to the health and the post play of Jalen Washington and Mason Nicholson.  If they can step up this team will be a force.  Texas hired Sean Miller and returns a decent amount of talent in Jordan Pope and Tramon Mark.  Dailyn Swain and Lassina Traore join Miller from Xavier.  Can Miller get the most out of transfers Cam Heide and Simeon Wilcher?  If he can I think Texas will be in the thick of it in the SEC race.  Missouri looks like a stout defensive team with Mark Mitchell, Anthony Robinson, and Sebastian Mack in the fold.  Mitchell I expect to be even better as the guy in Columbia.  Jevon Porter and Shawn Mitchell will handle the frontcourt but the key to this team hinges on the improvement of Annor Boateng in his sophomore season.  This team needs scoring and shooting and hopefully Boateng can make that leap.  Buzz Williams left the Aggies for Maryland so in comes Bucky McMillan.  Bucky Ball brings fast tempo and aggressive defense and loads of three point shooting.  Rylan Griffen, Marcus Hill, Pop Isaacs, Jacari Lane, and Ali Dibba are perfect guards for this style of play and Makenzie Mgbako and Federiko Federiko provide some muscle and rim protection.  This team has depth and should be a tourney team here in year one. Ole Miss returns just one starter from last year in Malik Dia but Chris Beard has cobbled together an interesting hodgepodge of players.  The two to watch are French combo guard Ilias Kamardine, who provides shooting and floor spacing for Dia and Louisville transfer James Scott, and top recruit Niko Bundalo who plays with an inside out approach where he can play around the rim with goodwork and can step out and shoot it.  What can Beard get out of A.J. Storr?  If Storr plays like he did last year this past year at Kansas he might find himself riding the pine again.  Oklahoma loses their best player in Jeremiah Fears to the draft but Porter Mioser brings in Miami transfer Nijel Pack and St. Joe's transfer Xzayvier Brown to run the backcourt.  Derrion Reid from Bama and Tae Davis from Notre Dame have great potential but I worry about the 5 spot.  Wague isn't it and the other options are freshmen.  That will be the difference between the bubble and solidly in the tourney.  Chris Jans has been steady if unspectacular so far in Starkville and I expect that to continue this year.  He has solid pieces that should equal a tourney team but don't expect this team to blow your socks off.  Josh Hubbard is an All-SEC guy but most of the transfer pieces Jans brought in have been unremarkable on their previous stops.  Georgia loses Asa Newell to the draft and Silas Demary to UConn.  Blue Cain should be a top piece and Jeremiah Wilkinson showed a lot of promise as a freshman at Cal.  But I don't think Mike White has the tools this year to get it done. The basement is manned by LSU and South Carolina who both figure to be out of the tourney picture.  Dedan Thomas is a great snag by McMahon but I don't think he's the coach to get things done in Baton Rouge.  Lamont Paris has struggled since his first season and now he is without Colin Murray-Boyles.  There just isn't enough talent to compete in a very deep SEC which is easily the best conference in the country going into 2025-26.

Le Moyne played SUNY Cobleskill twice in the 1948-49 season and won both games. SUNY Cobleskill was a two-year institution at the time, and the NCAA's Bevo Francis rule does not allow these games to be counted. Since Cobleskill was a junior college, it may count the losses in its junior college record. Since that season was only the second year since commencement of classes, Le Moyne's entire team was composed of sophomores. Le Moyne is 1-17 vs current Big East members. They beat Providence in 1952. Le Moyne is 105-100 vs current MAAC members. The 205 games played is the most against the curent collective opponents from any conference, including the NEC. Le Moyne's previous meeting with Lafayette was a home loss in 1970. As a D-II team, Le Moyne played two exhibition games at D-I Monmouth and went 1-1. Texas will be the first of the current SEC members Le Moyne has ever played. They defeated former SEC member Sewanee in 2003. Le Moyne is 1-17 vs current A10 teams. The only win came at home against Saint Joseph's in 1955. Le Moyne is 5-21 vs current ACC members with all the wins coming vs Boston College. Le Moyne beat Boston College four straight seasons between 1953 and 1956. Their other win came in 1977. The teams haven't played since 1979. In their third season in D-I and the NEC, Le Moyne has a history against three current NEC members, since they were in the same D-II conferences at various times. Series records vs NEC members: Central Connecticut 7-6 Chicago State 1-1 Fairleigh Dickinson 2-3 Long Island 2-3 Mercyhurst 18-3 New Haven 26-18 Saint Francis 3-6 Stonehill 26-19 Wagner 2-3 Le Moyne didn't play any D-III opponents during their last 18 years in D-II. They have won 11 straight games vs D-III opponents with the most recent loss in 2002. They did, however, lose to an NAIA Division II opponent in 2004.",

      "content_preview": "On January 16, 1917, Texas A&M beat Rice in basketball for the first time in Houston, 21–13. After the game, Aggie students noticed that Rice had left behind their mascot, a 200-pound, man-sized stuffed owl made of canvas and sawdust. J. Percy Street Thompson and Sidney F. Mitchell, Aggies from the Corps of Cadets, saw their chance. They “inducted” the owl into the Corps, promoted him to the rank of General, and carried him out of the auditorium. When questioned by security, the Aggies said they were returning the mascot to Rice. Instead, they packed him up and shipped him to College Station via train. Once there, the Aggies treated the owl like royalty. They housed him in Milner Hall, where he welcomed visitors, attended lectures, and reviewed cadets. The Battalion, A&M’s student newspaper, dared Rice to try to get their bird back: “If Rice wishes to claim their bird… they can find him at 37 Milner Hall.” Rice, embarrassed but determined, denied the owl had been stolen and quickly created an identical copy. The Aggies weren’t having it. They vowed to bring the real mascot back to Houston in the fall parade before the A&M–Rice football game. Thirteen Rice students formed the Owl Protective Association (OPA), dedicated to recovering the kidnapped mascot. On January 19, they hired a detective to search for the owl at College Station. When he failed to send word back, they set out themselves. Disguised in army uniforms, they arrived at College Station at 1:30 a.m. in the rain. They met the detective, he hadn’t found the owl. The students searched buildings across campus, pretending to be freshmen trapped by hazing rituals. Despite clever lies, they found nothing. Two members of the OPA, former A&M students, split the group in half and posed as drill sergeants inspecting dorm rooms. They searched every room on the first floors but again came up empty. They returned to Houston empty-handed. Still undeterred, they hired another detective, this one known only as “Snowball.” On January 29, Snowball pretended to be a reporter and somehow made contact with the only four men who knew where the owl was being kept: the third floor of the U.S. Armory, the most secure building on campus. Snowball sent a coded message back: “Sammy is fairly well and would like to see his parents at 11 o’clock.” This line gave the Rice mascot a name that remains to this day: Sammy. The Break-In at the Armory OPA added four new conspirators to their team. On the night of January 30, two Fords and a Hudson Super Six rolled into College Station. Snowball warned them that the owl was in a near-impenetrable location, but the OPA wasn’t backing down. Four scouts—Fulweiler, Billups, Moore, and Waters—were sent to the armory. Billups stayed outside to signal. The other three climbed three floors but found the door locked. As they tried to cut through it with knives, a night watchman approached. That’s when Jimmie Waters made his legendary move. Seeing the guard, he climbed out a third-story window, scaled the building, and ran off, distracting the guard long enough for his friends to hide. Waters successfully evaded the guard and returned. Soon, the building was swarming with sergeants. Fulweiler was spotted, fled to the train station, and escaped. Moore was also spotted and escaped off-campus. Fulweiler returned but was chased again and repeated his escape trick. The OPA regrouped at Kyle Field. Waters again served as decoy, racing across campus and outrunning two more guards. Deciding stealth had failed, the OPA initiated a full assault. Five football players with crowbars and fire extinguishers filled with ammonia stormed the armory. Cars blocked exits. The door was broken by three players ramming it together, and Sammy was secured. As they fled, a guard fired his .44 pistol into the air, raising the alarm. The OPA painted “20–0” on buildings (Rice had beaten A&M in football that season) and honked horns in celebration. Then disaster struck. The headlights on both Fords failed. One crashed, and the other rear-ended it. The Hudson developed a gas leak. As they scrambled to patch the tank, the night train to Houston passed by, full of angry Aggies who had seen everything. Soon, the roads were crawling with cadets. The Manhunt The OPA stashed the cars and Sammy in the woods. Nine members took the Hudson and Ford into Milliken for repairs. But A&M had mobilized. 800 cadets in cars, wagons, and trains blanketed the area between Bryan and Navasota. All telegraph and telephone lines were seized and being actively monitored They raided Milliken, seized the cars, and captured nine OPA members. Before their capture, the nine managed to get word to the guards still with Sammy. The guards realized they couldn’t transport the full 200-pound mascot, so they burned the sawdust stuffing in a low-smoke fire and hid the owl’s canvas skin. But a search party spotted the flames. The guards handed the skin to their four fastest runners, including the legendary Jimmie Waters, and ran in the opposite direction to mislead pursuers. They were captured. The runners eluded multiple search parties across the woods, but were exhausted, dehydrated, and at their limit. Enter the hunters. Four local hunters stumbled upon the fugitives and, impressed by their daring, decided to help. Two OPA members rode with a hunter into town, one hid in the car toolbox, and one disguised himself as the driver. They were stopped by Aggies but passed inspection. Ironically, an Aggie cadet even hitched a ride by sitting on the toolbox. Meanwhile, the other two OPA runners were hidden by the second hunter. He was arrested and later released. He then called the doctor helping house the first two and said: “Doctor, what shall I do with those capsules you gave me?” “Have you got them with you?” “No.” “I’ll bring you new ones.” That cryptic phrase activated the rescue mission. The doctor stayed behind, and the other two hunters drove full speed to pick up the last two Rice men, blasting past roadblocks. They picked up the “capsules” and returned them to the doctor’s house. At 3:30 a.m., the doctor got another call: “Doctor, my wife is very ill.” “My car’s broken, but come get me.” Thirty minutes later, the OPA members sprinted to the car and were finally driven to Houston. After dodging all patrols and roadblocks, they arrived at Rice at 7:30 a.m. on February 1, with Sammy’s skin safely in hand. The other 13 captured members of the OPA were detained at College Station. While generally treated well, they weren’t released until Rice’s president, Edgar Odell Lovett, petitioned A&M’s president for their safe return. Private investigator Snowball wasn’t so lucky. Aggies paraded him around campus, shaved his head military-style, and handed him over to freshmen for a few days. Eventually, they dumped him at the station, naked, and told him to catch the next train.",
