BMW 7 series: 10,714 sales in 2024.I think it is pretty funny, if a car is absolutely loved on here, it will probably end up not selling well, while cars that are loved sell like crap.https://media.audiusa.com/releases/624https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/article/detail/T0447290EN_US/bmw-of-north-america-reports-q4-2024-u-s-sales-results-sets-new-benchmarks-for-annual-sales-and-bev-sales?language=en_US",

      "content_preview": "Disclaimer: I am not an automotive journalist, just an incredibly lucky friend that got invited to make a cross country roadtrip from Philadelphia to Seattle. This is my foolhardy attempt to put my feelings into words.When a friend mentions that he’s going to buy a B7 RS4, one’s ears perk up. For those not in the euro world, this is a car based on the Audi A4 compact sedan platform. 4.2 raw liters of European gorilla piss. This engine is so rev happy and so civilized in the lower RPMs that it’s incredibly engaging and dynamic. Both the S4 and the RS4 both have a 4.2L V8, but make no mistake mentioning that around an RS4 owner because they’ll be quick to tell you that the timing chain facing the firewall is “no big deal” because “the timing chain guides that came on the S4 were plastic and the RS4 they put metal guides”. The heat imposed on the plastic would give them an early grave and would like to go every 60K miles or so. Then it was a 32 hour book time job to complete as the whole engine has to come out to access it (don’t ask me how I know). Whether that’s true or not, that’s enough to gut check me and remind of me of risk tolerance. My buddy however, did not receive that core human survival instinct. A proposition is made that we travel to Conshohocken Pennsylvania to retrieve said car. A flight from Alaska to Pennsylvania, it must be a special car. And a special car it was, the RS4 had a limited production run from 2007-2008 of where about 1700 units came stateside. Not only that, this car has seen a sole owner for the preceding 17 years and 70 thousand miles. I rest my case.Exterior Impressions: while sharing the same body style with the A4 and S4, at first glance you could be fooled. Audi had to include more attitude in this, to remind you that you’re driving an RS4. They do this by giving the car voluptuous hips. It’s the first thing you notice and you try not to stare. Smooth body lines, incredible proportions and timeless elegance. Daytona Grey is a color special to the RS4, not to be confused with Dolphin Grey. Dolphin Grey is for the poors, you are now an RS4 owner. The color grows on you, seemingly flat and devoid of life at first. The longer you look at it, the more you can appreciate the pearlescent flakes and the way it masterfully plays with the light. Trim pieces are aluminum and are to be cleaned only with aerospace aluminum cleaner. RS4 badging throughout, for those in the know. If you’re looking for a European muscle sleeper, look no further.Interior appearance: audi offered a cream leather in the example I was in. Beautiful grain, hardly any wear and soft to the touch. Everything in this car had real carbon fiber bits as accent pieces. More aluminum treatment in here as well. The cockpit is driver focused and a minimalistic experience. The seats were not as sporty as one would think. The side bolsters left much to be desired, the wings kept you securely fastened. A lot of adjustability with a lack of lumbar support. Even at its max setting it barely provided any support. If I’m going to compromise on performance I would ask the bare minimum is I can be comfortable. While the seat does everything else well, I wish that I didn’t have to use an external lumbar pillow. Build quality is excellent, you can almost feel the tolerances in each part. No squeaks or rattles, everything perfectly where it should be. The cabin is a very nice place to be, one of our favorite features was the ability to engage the automatic rear hatch shade, as if the auto dimming rear view mirror wasn’t enough.Driving impressions: all it takes was one cold start and you knew the pilgrimage to conshohocken was worth it. The engine comes alive with a snarling bark and after about 10 seconds behaves in a more civilized manner.The engine: let’s get this out of the way first, Jeremey Clarkson said about 17 years ago “I might be sitting 4 feet away from the greatest engine ever made”. It’s certainly the greatest engine I have ever driven. But let’s talk about engine placement, Audi engineers decided to place the engine in front of the axle, which is not where you want it for chassis dynamics, it will definitely become important later. This engines dominates the experience coming in at roughly 420 hp and 317ft lbs. each gear begs you to the 8250rpm redline with a frantic ferocity that is immediately intoxicating. The car begs for it and who are you to deny these requests? The torque sits you promptly in your seat and is EVERYWHERE. You physically can’t be in wrong gear. And when you want to cruise on the autobahn (I mean highway) its demeanor changes like a toddler picking on his brother behind their mother’s back. From terror to sweet, this car is a true sour patch kid.Transmission: coming from a Miata, I am truly spoiled by mechanical feel through the shifter. This was not that. The shifter felt light, the throws weren’t short, but not long, no feedback. It felt like you were shifting a ghost and you never felt positive affirmations when you selected gears. The clutch feel was light and linear. Shifting takes a couple days to figure out, primarily downshifting. It felt like it had a relatively heavy flywheel and you had to be in the throttle much longer than a blip to get your 3>2 downshift correct. But boy when you hit that first downshift, you are hooked. The car is incredibly rewarding if you drive it hard, you immediately get punished if you try to be nice to her. It’s almost like having a toxic girlfriend. The highs are high and the lows are low.Steering feel: while not comfortably numb, you aren’t feeling much. There is just enough feedback to tell what’s going on, but you aren’t being delivered the full message. The steering rack is hydraulic and was tuned just about perfect for a luxury rocket ship.Suspension and Chassis: AWD boasting a 35/65 front to rear bias. Remember the engine placement? This rears itself ugly head here. When hustling through corners, it’s apparent you’ve got some nose weight. Audi realized this and did some suspension wizardry I don’t quite understand. I only got this car to understeer one time. The car just wants to rotate around you in the most natural way. Your brain is thinking understeer through the whole corner and you just point and shoot and the front, rear and center differentials work together in perfect harmony to keep you on the road. Traversing over damaged pavement reminds you this is a built on a luxury platform, stiff but cradling. The car hardly exhibits any body roll through cornering and is logic defyingly stable.Final thoughts: this car was built to be an autobahn cruiser, a track day weapon, a canyon carver and a daily driver. This car accomplishes all of those thinugs with little to no compromises. This is a truly special car, that puts a smile on your face every time you drive it. This car does it all and is a true standout in automotive history.",

      "content_preview": "My wife and I ordered a replacement for her Alfa Romeo Giulia back in March of this year and took delivery 6 weeks ago. We’ve since put almost 1500 miles on the car and I wanted to share some of my thoughts as a first time owner of the brand given I know Audi’s most recent direction has been controversial for many.Photos here:https://imgur.com/a/F4EpydaWe spec’d everyone option aside from the dynamic plus package that has the carbon ceramic front brakes given we felt that would be overkill for a daily driver.Coming from the Giulia, the car is a massive step up / advancement in terms of tech and power. Having adjustable interior ambient lighting, 6 different drive modes, a dedicated drift mode, multiple suspension, powertrain, traction settings, race mode, etc really give this car a huge breadth of adjustability to be tailored to anyone’s driving style.The interior materials are nice and I’m personally a big fan of the new steering wheel and the Alcantara feels great though I know it will be tricky to maintain. I don’t like the piano black around the center console but that’s really my only big gripe about the interior.The Giulia’s handling was still better and it’s dynamically one of the best cars I’ve ever driven but the RS3 isn’t too far behind. Audi was able to improve the car’s lap time around the Nurburgring by 8 second without any power adjustment for this 8Y.5 generation to get it the compact car record lap time. I don’t have a prior point of comparison but a friend that has an 8V drove our car and said it’s dynamically a completely different car in terms of feel.I love the quirks of having wider front tires than the rear and the 5 cylinder engine. I think these are unique things that make the car feel even more special than it already is.The weird badging change for the RS to be separated from the red diamond is silly but not a deal breaker by any means and removing the front RS badge I’ve seen as a complaint online but the GTR gets enough attention as is so it’s nice for this one to be more of a sleeper for us.Overall, we’re extremely happy with the car and I’ve found myself spending more time driving it over the GTR which has helped make the GTR feel more special every time I get back inside of it - it’s been a proper win/win and I don’t think there was a better sporty 4 door for the money.It genuinely puts a smile of my face and feels like a go kart around town. We don’t track our cars so these are pavement warriors and both are fantastic on the road. Might end up throwing on an exhaust and some spacers but that’s likely it - love out the spec came out in person and I think Audi set this car up nicely from the factory.",
