      "content_preview": "Alright. I'm losing my mind over here. I have been trying to find a messenger bag for months, but I'm picky as hell. Any recommendations that ANYONE can give would be so greatly appreciated oh my god. Requirements: -I have a 13\" laptop. It needs to fit that. But not just that i need to be able to fit my a3 sketchbook in it and a couple of smaller sketch books plus drawing supplies and my 11 inch iPad. -Sturdy and long lasting. I will be using this daily, as I am a highschool student. I need it to last, I do not want to be buying another bag really soon because money does not grow on trees -Canvas or some other material that isn't leather. I can deal with some leather accents, but not a ton, I don't really like the style. -DARK BROWN this is the thing that is absolutely tripping me up. I love the canvas look but finding quality canvas bags that are dark brown feels impossible. Its about the look and the style for me and dark brown is basically a need at this point. Literally if anyone could help it would be. Greatly appreciated because this has been my hellscape for months now.",

The Router is indeed the safest option, but it is also 30$ more expensive. If anyone could help me confirm if either the Recon or the Surge can fit a 15,6” laptop I would really appreciate it!",

I'm planning to go on a trip to Japan for a couple of weeks and I will be traveling in Japan with the standard one briefcase-one 7 kilos max bag-one personal item layout. In my bag I plan to have one full outfit in an Osprey packing cube, a jacket (probably strapped outside the bag), hygiene items, snacks and beverages and making room to bring souvenirs back to the briefcase in the hotel. Taking all these into consideration, I'm looking for a backpack not too large (about 20-25L should be good), waterproof or at least weatherproof, maybe some compartments for organisation and left and right outside pockets. Would love to hear both affordable and high-end options. Drop your recomendations below! Thank you!",

Je suis actuellement à la recherche d’un sac à dos solide, imperméable et d’au moins 40 L, car je voyage environ 4 jours par semaine pour aller travailler (en train). J’ai besoin d’un sac capable de contenir : Mes vêtements pour plusieurs jours Une paire de chaussures Mon ordinateur portable + chargeur Divers besoins du quotidien Le sac doit être robuste, car je le manipule beaucoup (transports fréquents, gares…). Une bonne résistance à la pluie ou aux intempéries. Si on peut trouver un modèle sobre \"business\" (je suis en costume souvent pour aller travailler), c'est top. J’ai repéré deux modèles : Kapten & Son Lisbon Duffle Backpack Medium (All Black) Lien : https://kapten-son.com/fr/p/lisbon-duffle-backpack-medium-all-black-1528 Gregory Alpaca 40 (Obsidian Black) - moins idéal pour le côté business à mon avis. Lien : https://eu.gregorypacks.com/fr-fr/-alpaca-40--obsidian-black/147897-0413.html Ce que j’aimerais savoir : Expériences perso avec ces marques ? Solidité, confort à l’usage, résistance pluie, capacité réelle, ergonomie, etc. Alternatives à proposer dans la même gamme de volume / robustesse / prix ? (J’estime un budget dans la gamme moyenne-haute, mais rien d’extrême). Conseils pratiques pour bien choisir selon les trajets en train et le transport de ce type de sac. Merci d’avance pour vos retours constructifs ! Toute suggestion est bienvenue.",

      "content_preview": "Hi Everyone! Hoping to get some opinions/recommendations on a new backpack. I need something that will fit a set of clothes and a towel for the gym in it, along with a water bottle. Then have a separate compartment for a laptop, glasses, charger and lunch. Previously I was looking at the Bagsmart Blast Extended (Below). However, I got turned away from some reviews that mentioned it got uncomfortable when full during long walks, the laptop compartment bottom isn't padded and a few other quirks. https://uk.bagsmart.com/products/blast-travel-backpack?variant=48996363337975 I'm now looking at the Kapten and Son Bali (Below), but can't find many reviews on it and am slightly concerned about the general size. https://kapten-son.com/en/p/bali-all-black-by-mariefeandjakesnow-76 My previous backpack below (Can't find the original listing). It worked, but wasn't always the most amazing and got kind of tight. The listing measurements aren't 100% accurate because that thing would stretch out a decent amount to fit everything in (Will fit approximately 1 oodie). I also couldn't fit my lunch and because it was a 1 compartment bag, it wasn't great when I had multiple things in there. https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/286155008546 If anyone has any opinions or recommendations, I'd love to hear! I'm hoping to find something decent that looks sleek for around £150 max (A big ask, I know).",

I’ve narrowed it down to three options: GORUCK GR1 (21L): Love the look and durability, and my packing cubes fit perfectly. Downsides: no bottle holder, a bit heavy, and could maybe run hot on the back. Osprey Daylite 26+6: Super light and seems more comfortable, but feels less sturdy. Zippers seem not as rigid as the other backs. Bag seems a bit more flimsy and I may worry about my laptop/ipad. Aer City Pack Pro 2: Looks like a middle ground. Sleek, good organization, but I’ve heard it’s not the most efficient use of space. I’m happy to pay the price for any of them, I just want the best all-rounder for short trips: protective, comfortable, and easy to travel with. Has anyone here used one or more of these?

Water bottle holders on side Professional looking enough to take into client meetings Good back support!! Women's fit if possible Not top heavy with the pockets (previously had the Thule ascent and the way the sunglasses and easy access pockets were configured made it so annoying to open and close the main compartment and it also cut down a lot of what I could fit into the main compartment) Luggage strap would be a bonus Max $150 but ideally closer to $100 Currently looking at the Osprey proximal 30L but wanted to see if there were any better suggestions.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I am currently a senior in high school and am looking for a durable backpack that will last me through college. I often experience shoulder and lower back pain, so I need something lightweight and has back and shoulder support padding. I prefer a backpack with a padded section that can accommodate my 17.3-inch HP laptop, as well as a spacious area for books and files. Since I like to carry everything I might need, it should have plenty of storage space, including a compartment for a water bottle. Thank you! For reference, I'm 5'4\", and I currently have the North Face Borealis Backpack, but my sister likes it, so I'm giving it to her :) Summary of requirements: Lightweight, Padded laptop section for a 17.3-inch laptop, Ample space for books and files, a Compartment for a water bottle, and Affordable options (if possible) I understand if it seems like a lot, so thank you for being patient with me!",

Are there EU based brands or EU retailers I should look at for these kind of bags. Specs im looking for Capacity 21 to 25 liters Sternum strap External or internal water bottle pocket Simple admin is fine since I carry a sling Padded laptop sleeve for a 14 inch laptop Durable materials that can handle daily use Luggage pass through is a nice to have, not a deal breaker Any recommendations or experiences would be very helpful.
