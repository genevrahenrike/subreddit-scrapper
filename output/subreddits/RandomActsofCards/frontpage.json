Please just fill out my Google form ! Also: don't be shy, I do not mind sending to you again if I have sent to you recently. <3 (I am marking this fulfilled but leaving the form open.

      "content_preview": "Step right up, step right up! The night air shivers with possibilities, the moon hangs low and watchful, and somewhere on the edge of the familiar, a carnival tent pulses with golden light and whispered rumors. You're cordially invited- indeed, summoned- to the Dark Carnival, a spectacle where the boundary between the ordinary and the astonishing dissolves like mist before the nights end. Hi friends! I fell in love with the carnival stamps and had some carnival themed supplies so I went overboard! The carnivals and oddity shows (Freak shows) from back in the early 1900's have always been an interest of mine and I have had so much fun making these cards with extra goodies! As it is now the beginning of fall also pleasantly known as festival and fair season, I thought this to be the most spectacular time to make this offer!  If you are interested please fill out my form and reply with your favorite thing about the season. https://forms.gle/a9cjKLRFgqryKM2o6 Edit: I am all out of WW offers but still taking US!",

Major depression the past 18 months since my meds stopped working, my life is going nowhere, and despite working diligently on myself, I can’t see myself alive in 5 years, much less happy, fulfilled and/or loved. Worse would be being alive 20 more years in my current condition. After much thought about what might make me feel better, I’d love to receive some cards — and, if you’re so inclined, your prayers, good wishes, however you do that. I feel like I need help with a breakthrough. Hope I expressed this sufficiently. If clarification is needed, please ask. Thank you for your consideration. 🙂 EDIT: Thank you for your responses! I will reply individually asap. Please let me know if I missed sending you my address",

      "content_preview": "u/GoldenGioGio - thank you for the fine art postcard! Love all the sticker and washi decorations :) Your 'family bonding moment I guess' comment about the art made me chuckle u/ninajyang - thanks for the lovely Salem Ouija postcard! Is it awful that I don't remember that I signed up for this? I love the strawberry stamp especially, 3c lol. Smallest denomination stamp I've ever seen in Australia is 5c haha. Ahh I had a snoop around your profile and it was the randomness offer you made - that makes total sense now. (Also I might have been reading your username as ninja this whole time hmmm 😅) u/JJsRedditHandle x2 - I think the mail floodgates have opened, your postcards are arriving in quick succession now. Thank you for the Toni Morrison postcard with the June Jordan poem, it was beautiful to read. And thank you for the trading post card - I'll have to find where that wonderful quote comes from u/Laghertis - your postcard finally arrived! Thank you so much - I love the scenery of your city. Those kids sound so sweet, I think if that happened to me it would make my day too. I'm a little worried my postcard might not make it to you - I didn't realise but apparently mail is suspended to your country from Australia 😲 (at least that's what one auspost page says). I'm not sure when that happened, and when I google about it, it says otherwise so I'm not too sure. Anyway, let me know if it doesn't make it there in the next month or so - I'd be happy to at least send you a pic of what should have arrived u/enrasco x2 - thank you for both postcards. Firstly the building bingo card - very interesting scene, I almost can't quite believe that's what the city looked like 30-50 years ago, so picturesque and open! And thank you for the RAoC meta Ditto card. Ditto is my favourite pokemon followed by Sudowoodo haha, I remember I used to be obsessed with hatching eggs from ditto + other pokemon. I did a complete playthrough of Pokemon Emerald again recently (what a throwback lol) and it brought back so much nostalgia playing it as a kid u/craftymonmon - another week, another crafty card! Thank you for the handmade card - I had a lot of fun reading your answers hahaha. I will not get over how nice your handwriting is. I love true crime too!! I'm not sure if I have any super unusual interests but I find that I tend to see something, think it's really cool, and then have to learn how to do it until the obsession fades haha E.g. I taught myself (as in using youtube of course) how to solve a Rubik's cube, how to juggle, learnt how to crochet, and was even into felting/jewellery making/resin art at one point. I also like to hoard things (which is not great for my space lol) and have lots of different collections: stamps, coins, keychains, even paddlepop sticks from all the ice-creams I've eaten! u/nj_mails - thank you for the wonderful Indian scenery postcard. In response to your question, I have never visited India before unfortunately but I like eating Indian food sometimes. My family definitely love eating it because it's a bit similar to our culture's food mystery sender - thank you for the handmade card with all the quotes on the inside, and the bookish stickers! I looked high and low for a username but I can't find one. I'm also not sure whether we chatted before or if I added myself to your mailing list. I feel like I should know but it's not coming to me. It was sent just last week and arrived quickly - I love the opal stamp 😏",

I'll be sending you at least one but maybe more. I would appreciate a thank you post being made so I know you got the card(s) and liked them. If you filled this form out before, feel free to do so again. :) Note though that if you mark the same kind of card as you did before, you might get the same one again so I encourage marking some new ones.

My birthday is September 12 and though this year is not a milestone, I feel like it's been a hell of a year since my last birthday - lots of bad things, and some good things have happened that make me grateful that I've survived another year's trip around the sun. I'd love some card to help encourage me in this next trip, so if you're willing, I'd be grateful. To make it easier, I've put my address on a form where I will ask for your address in return to post a thank you card. Thanks for taking the time to read, and thank you in advance for helping me celebrate!",
