      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, Been using Cursor for a while now, alongside Claude Code. The checkpoint feature is invaluable, but it gets wild with dozens of changes over multi-hour sessions. I recently built something to handle this: - Auto-commits every 15 seconds to a hidden .shadowgit/ folder - GUI showing complete history with file diffs - Completely separate from main git repo (no history pollution) - One-click restore to any point from the last few hours Unexpected bonus: Connected this to Cursor via MCP. Now when debugging, Cursor can run `git diff HEAD~5` to see what just changed, or `git log -S \"function\"` to find working implementations. It actually fixes bugs faster when it can see recent history. The setup is just a file watcher + git commits. Nothing fancy, but it's saved me from several Cursor-induced disasters. Questions for the community: How do you handle long development sessions without committing dozens of times? Is anyone else doing automatic backups beyond checkpoints? Would you want Cursor to have more granular history built-in? Happy to share technical details if anyone's interested. Thank you! Alessandro",

      "content_preview": "So I've been using Cursor quite a lot lately, and honestly it's great. Most of it actually is just for private use, or things where I say \"Why hasn't anyone else done this?\" - it's genuinely fun to do less \"serious\" work with game mods, but which can have a really positive impact on your or others experience. It's almost an addiction even lol, it's a lot of fun seeing something you or others dislike and being able to do something about it. I'd love to pay a developer sometimes, but can't since the game has a strict no monetization rule for example. I'm also not confident enough to ask established modders and beg them to do X. I'm sometimes also a bit ashamed of essentially relying on AI, and always fully disclose my use of it. But it's so rewarding seeing friends and other people use what you worked on and being able to make their experience unique. Just wanted to bring this out here, I'm sure I'm not the only one using this for less \"serious\" tasks. I personally wouldn't trust AI near anything more serious since I personally believe I lack the actual dev knowledge that still plays an important role in making sure everything is OK and there are no vulnerabilities. If I can't check it, I won't do it, is my opinion on that.",

So far, I’ve spent $47 on the PRO plan. Today I actually got a warning that I’ve been using Opus 4.1 a lot - and if I want to keep going at that pace, I’d need to upgrade to PRO+ . What surprised me though is that they didn’t completely cut me off. I can still use other models like O3 , which means I basically get another full day of unlimited use. Overall, I’m pretty happy with this pricing model. It’s enough for my workflow - I’m not a “vibe coder”, I use it consciously and it does the job. Over the past two months, I’ve been experimenting with Cursor as part of my daily workflow. I primarily write code in JetBrains PHPStorm , since my stack is not just PHP but also Node.js, React, and TypeScript . For these technologies, PHPStorm still feels much more convenient than Cursor when it comes to navigation, refactoring, and overall environment support. That said, I’ve set up a plugin in PHPStorm that lets me quickly open any document in Cursor. This has become my “hybrid” setup: I keep coding in JetBrains, but whenever I need help with prompts, ideas, or agent-style tasks, I jump into Cursor. A lot of people praise Cursor for its autocomplete/tap feature — and yes, it’s great. But honestly, it doesn’t always solve my problems. I’m fine without it in PHPStorm, and I prefer to use Cursor more deliberately rather than relying on constant autocomplete. Some might ask: why not try June in PhpStorm ? A few of my friends use it, and maybe I’ll experiment with it at some point. But I genuinely like Cursor’s. For example, this month I paid $20 but ended up using about $50 worth of credits thanks to the PRO plan. That feels like good value. If at some point it balances out (pay $20, get $20), I might rethink and explore alternatives. For now, though, it works in my favor. I also tried going Cursor-only without JetBrains, but I ran into issues — especially with PHP-specific workflows. Even with extensions, Cursor falls short compared to JetBrains when it comes to code understanding, navigation, and finding function usages. So for now, I’ve settled into this combined workflow : PHPStorm for core development, Cursor for AI-powered assistance. It’s not perfect, but it’s efficient, and for the way I work, that’s what matters most. Curious how others are handling this: do you use Cursor as your main IDE, or do you also combine it with JetBrains/VSCode? Would love to hear how you balance things.",

Something I always had trouble with in my setup is remembering what tasks need to be added today, like remembering it has been 3 days since I watered my plants so I need to do it today, or remembering that 2 days ago I said to myself I need to do something today. So here's my weird cursor solution: I created a markdown file scheduler.md which contains a bullet pt list of all tasks I planned for some future date I also created a file crons.md which contains a list of recurring tasks with different schemes of recurrence described by human language, like \"do task X every 3 days\", or \"do task Y every Monday\" I have a cursorrules that tells the agent to read these two files and my current daily todo file, and I just run the agent every morning. Just like that, I never have to deal with the mental overhead of \"when's the last time I did task X? Do I need to do it today?\" No tasks with future deadlines gets forgotten as well. I know other task management apps can probably achieve the same, but I just love the flexibility of plain text file based todo lists. Hope this is helpful!",

Like \"I see the problem...\" and then repeats exact same steps it did5 times prior. Its like its not even aware of chat context at all, just straight up hallucination. I'm pro user, thus keep on auto mode. My projects have extensive documentation and plenty of context. I'm not asking claude to write any code, simple tasks like rebuild the docker stack and run tail 50 on logs to generate a debug document, it shits on itself half way through and just keeps trying same failed commands in a dead-loop consuming tokens.

      "content_preview": "Last week I posted that I quit my job and launched a solo-built startup with Cursor. One week later: 385 users, 6 paid and here’s exactly what happened: If you saw my post last week, I shipped my first startup solo using a vibe-coding stack (Cursor + Next.js + Supabase + Vercel). This is the 7-day follow-up with real numbers and the play-by-play. The numbers (first week): • ~200k Reddit views total (one anchor post ≈140k + a few smaller ones ≈60k) • ~4,000 site visits • 385 signups • ~90% completed the core action (generated a blueprint) • 6 paying users so far — ~$80 MRR What worked: • Wrote one narrative post with my journey, just “here’s what I built and why” • Lived in the comments, turned asks into backlog • Posted a couple of tight follow-ups with new learnings • Classic loop: signals → lean MVP → distribution → feedback → iterate. Where I messed up • Over-engineering. I started with multi-agent graphs and chains. Killed half of it and rewrote the backend in two days. Lighter, faster, more reliable • Scaling/quotas. Token-heavy flows choked under parallel runs. Fixed with queues/batching and raised model limits • Late analytics & email. Launched without them (regret). Added Sentry, GA, Resend, and used Vercel logs. Instantly saw where conversion leaked and what broke Dev flow that felt right: • Start with a landing (using 21stdev): rough concept → borrow a few components → reshape to my style → share → iterate • Backend first (Next.js + Supabase), test in terminal until outputs are sane • Wire the app UI, connect payments (Stripe), domains, logs, instrumentation • Test with real cards and a few brave humans. When error rate felt acceptable, ship and tell the story Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe, Resend, Sentry, Google Analytics. Models: OpenAI + Anthropic mix. Built and steered in Cursor What’s next: v2 based on the flood of feedback. The value is there, but it needs to be sharper to scale. Same loop, just faster",

I started coding on my desktop PC successfully and wanted to continue on my laptop. Using GitHub, I downloaded the latest version of the code to my laptop and tried to work with Cursor there, but it didn't have the same understanding of the code as my PC did. As a result, it removed some essential code needed for the app to function. How can I synchronize both Cursor instances so they share the same knowledge and state?",
