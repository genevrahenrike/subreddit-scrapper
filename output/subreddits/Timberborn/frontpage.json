Why don't beavers take the most they can? Even if that's because there's 29 other beavers also getting water, why doesn't the game assign the 'getting water' task to 1 or 2 beavers and have them carry as much as they can?",

      "content_preview": "This is not a complaint but a request for ideas/discussion. For those who just like the sandbox chill aspects, the game is already perfect. For those who play on Hard and get enjoyment from the feeling of pressure to make the right decisions, it's a common complaint that the game gets stale once you reach stability. Once you can survive 30 day droughts there is no tension left. You can use custom drought settings to delay when that happens, but it still happens. I'm wondering is there some whole additional mechanic that could make things more interesting in the endgame? Could there be a 3rd type of event instead of drought or badtide? Maybe it's not really a solvable problem because there will always be a point where any threats and constraints are overcome?",

A 5 level tree farm, hopefully this is overkill enough that I never need another tree farm. Each level is highly managed by 4 lumberjacks and 2 foresters. Definitely worth the time though, so much less space taken and I'd estimate it doubles the production of my old farm. Going to copy the exact same design for my farming.",

I am 40 years old, started gaming in the 90s and have been playing strategy games basically for decades now. I played the original Anno 1602 right at release. And still remember the handbook and the chart laying out the production chains. Also I still vividly remember Empire Earth with its manual of over 200 pages. Etc.etc. I loved it. It was a huge part of my gaming experience. It was mostly good quality paper (better than most paperback literature nowadays), I used to read the manuals before going to sleep and just randomly. Most importantly, the manual, fold-out-charts etc. was/were amazing to use during gaming, to look stuff up while planning. Not only are wikis tedious to navigate, unless you have a dual screen set-up you straight up cannot use them comfortably during gaming. And now comes Timberborn. Yet another game were I sigh inside because I have to look everything up on the internet without anything to even print out. I want to have the details in front of me. How much grain/farmers do I really need to minmax a bakery? What's the perfect balance of foresters, different trees, woodcutters? How exactly do beavers fulfil their different well-being needs, what do they eat, what do they consume in which order? How many showers do I need per [x] beavers? How fast do teeth go bad? How much energy is needed for different production chains? I realize this is still early access and constantly in flux. But - same as with other games - I doubt that this is even planned. I miss it. And I would spend good, extra money on it. The artwork hast to be there, the data is there, so it cannot be too expensive to outsource it to some production company? Is there really no demand for this nowadays?",

Here’s one of my recent attempts where I’m trying to launch the monument as fast as possible on Hard Mode. Has anyone else tried speedrunning Timberborn? I’d love to trade tips, compare strategies, or even just see how others approach it. I'm running out of ideas on how to improve. Would be great to connect with other players who are trying the same thing.",

      "content_preview": "It goes without saying, that of course that's my personal opinion and I would never assume to possess the ultimate wisdom. And I know that this has been suggested and rejected before in various versions. However, as the game has advanced, I cannot help myself that the lack of a tier system is one of the core reasons why progress feels rather uninspired. What do I mean? Since there is no tier system, you can actually achieve the highest tech of the game with a very basic settlement. Say, 20 beavers, simple lodges, a couple water tanks, carrots, maybe baked potatoes if you want to be fancy. There is literally no \"external\" incentive to (a) have a higher population and (b) to achieve higher well-being. You do it because it's what you want to do intrinsically, the epitome of the sandbox. Maybe the game is not for me; that's entirely possible. But I do think that the game would immensely profit from a tier system that locks certain tech behind certain milestones. Many strategy games have had different versions of this for decades, it would take forever to list all the different options, hence just my favorite two: a) District Center Upgrade: most simple and straight forward; require a District Center Upgrade for certain buildings/tech. A District Center Upgrade would require a certain amount of population at a certain amount of well-being. And of course a bunch of resources. Higher Tier requires more beavers, even higher well-being, even more advanced resources. Etc. EDIT: to make my point more clear, higher population is far less relevant to my point than well-being; you could even forego population completely, well-being is important in my opinion b) Research Tiers (\"Tech Tree\"): lock the advanced tech behind certain research tiers, akin to a true tech tree. Meaning, you cannot simply unlock everything and anything whenever you want, but you need to (i) advance through the tree and (ii) you need to gather a certain amount of experience. What do I mean? E.g. to obtain higher food tech you need beavers working the more basic food tech for some time. You have to do basic farming for a while until you have enough experience to \"unlock\" the next stage. Same with lumber. Let me be clear, that I fully get that the developers were aiming for a more laid back experience, given that there are already many games out there that put a high amount of stress on you (looking especially at you Frostpunk). Still I don't think that a tier system would violate this philosophy, as long as the game makes sure that the most essential buildings are accessible easily (you can survive basically everything with dams, levies and simple floodgates). TL; DR: as of right now I feel that achieving a higher beaver population as well as higher well-being is - more or less - optional and entirely an intrinsic goal; it should be linked, should be made a requirement for certain more advanced tech - all in my opinion",
