Pacifica is there working and when she sees Dipper, she starts to blush and panic and goes into the bathroom to hide. She doesn’t want to be seen by the Pines (especially Dipper) and for them to discover that she’s working in a diner now and most importantly as she keeps talking to herself, she realizes she may actually have feelings for Dipper and blushes harder, making it even more difficult for her to go back out there and face them. Unknowingly to her, Mabel is in a stall in the same bathroom and secretly overheard everything. Stifling as gasp, she squeals and smiles to herself as she comes up with a plan to get Pacifica and her brother together. What do you guys think? Would you want to read this fic?",

      "content_preview": "Dipper: It's been 7 years since Mabel and I were in Gravity Falls, and the truth is that a lot has changed since then. Our parents divorced, something we already feared, as the fights between them were constant. They especially sent us to Gravity Falls because I had many nightmares about a fight they had. Specifically, that fight happened one night when I woke up to go to the kitchen for a glass of water and accidentally overheard them arguing. *Sighs a little heavily* It was painful, but in the end, it was the best for everyone. Mabel and I stayed with our mother, and visits with Dad only happen once a month. To be honest, it's better that way, my relationship with my father has never been very good. On the contrary, Mabel was and always will be \"Dad's spoiled little princess.\" At least whenever Dad scolds me, calling me \"not a man,\" Mabel always defends me. I'd like to say there are no problems at home, but I'd be lying. While I don't have any issues with Mom, Mabel and she butt heads constantly, mostly because of how euphoric and boisterous Mabel can be. The truth is, Dad isn't the only one who makes offensive comments, as Mom has told Mable on more than one occasion, \"You ungrateful brat, you'll never get married like that,\" and things like that. On those occasions, I'm the one who stops Mom and defends Mabel, because the truth is, there are times when Mom goes too far. Of course, I understand that Mabel can be very frustrating and annoying at times, but it's not like we have to say that to her 10 times a week. *Sighs again* Yes, I think you could say our home life is a total mess. Fortunately, not everything is bad. Both Mabel and I have kept in touch with our friends from Gravity Falls and our great-uncles. I know what you're thinking, \"So you're still in love with Wendy,\" and the answer is no. I moved on a long time ago. Plus, I don't talk to her that much either, at most one or two messages a month. *Smiles as her cheeks turn pink* The one I do talk to daily is Pacifica, although Mabel doesn't know this, and I hope it stays that way, or else she'll start teasing me about liking Pacifica. *Laughs a little* It's surprising how much our relationship has changed. We went from hating each other to practically being each other's confidants. Because yes, over the past 7 years we've been talking every day via text, calls, and video calls... Well, over the last 6 years, only via text, but that doesn't matter. The point is that Pacifica and I still keep in touch. There have even been nights when we've stayed up talking until the sun comes up, and every time that happens, I don't regret a thing. I know I'll have a shitty day because I'm tired, but I still don't regret it because I was able to enjoy a pleasant chat with Pacifica. Okay, okay, I think I've talked too much about the blonde I met that long-ago summer. I'd better tell you about some more changes we've had in our lives outside of the home environment. To start with, the last year of school was... Very boring for us. It was inevitable to compare the monotony of school with the emotions experienced that summer. Although that calmer time was also good for us, especially in leaving certain traumas behind with the help of the school psychologist. That year, Mabel stopped looking for a boyfriend and began to focus more on her own personal development, something I'm truly grateful for. I don't want to imagine what it would have been like to endure Mabel going through puberty if she still had that obsession with finding a boyfriend. On the other hand, I began to focus more on the present and let go of my obsession with growing up and overanalyzing the future. It was a somewhat complicated period for both of us, but what we accomplished that year was worth it. The following year we entered high school and... The truth is that it was better than we thought, at least for me it was better than I expected. I still remember that first day was when I met the one who would be and still is my best friend. To put it in context, Mabel and I were in the hallways looking at the class lists, and surprisingly, we were in different classes. I still remember Mabel's face at that moment, her face was completely disfigured as if she had just seen something paranormal... Well, not in our case at least because after what we had experienced the summer of the previous year, nothing paranormal could scare us. What could scare us both was the idea of being separated during class hours. Let's just say that Mabel's fear was mostly for me, because the truth is that I have never been very popular at school. *Sighs heavily* In fact, I was the target of mockery and bullies, you know like the typical \"loser nerd\", so for obvious reasons I was afraid of not having the only person who defended me by my side, even so I calmed my sister and each one went to their respective classrooms. When I got to this one I sat in one of the many free seats, specifically in the third row next to the window, unfortunately the peace did not last long, a boy who went to school with Mabel and me approached with his new group of \"friends\" to bother me. Of course I did not stay silent because come on, after facing literally an all-powerful being of another resignation, simple bullies were nothing, a shame that back then I was still a \"weakling\", yes as you are thinking, when I answered them the leader of the group grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and threatened to hit me in the face. It was at that precise moment that a boy with ash-blond hair entered the class. He approached us and stopped the punch I was about to throw. \"I hate to butt into other people's business, but I think an act of cowardice is taking place here,\" the newcomer said, looking the leader of the bullies in the eye. He gritted his teeth but left muttering something I couldn't hear. After they left, the boy turned to look at me and extended his hand while smiling. \"What's up? I'm Jonathan.\" At that moment, I couldn't help but smile and shook his hand as I introduced myself. That was the day I made my first friend in California. That same day, during recess, Jonathan and I sat together in the cafeteria. It wasn't long before my sister came running with two girls and a boy and sat on the bench in front of me. Yep, Mabel had already made friends, although it didn't surprise me in the least, she's always been much more sociable than me, in the past I was a little jealous of her because of that, but it's something I've already gotten over. Soon we all started chatting, which was really nice. It turned out that the girl with brown skin, amber eyes, and black hair is called Tania, and she's really nice. In fact, now she's not only Mabel's friend but also mine. The other girl who came with Mabel had fair, freckled skin, violet eyes, and brown hair. She stared at me the entire recess... That was really awkward, and things went pretty badly with her. She did something unforgivable to my sister, so yeah, we haven't hung out with her for a long time. Finally, the guy who came with Mabel and them is named Gregory, and... Well, let's just say he's or was completely besotted with the freckled girl, so when we stopped hanging out with her, he was left alone with that chick whose name I don't even remember. Honestly, since we stopped hanging out with that pair, we haven't heard from them. Anyway, let's put that bad memory aside. The truth is that Mabel and I have done pretty well over the years. Of course, we still have some problems and minor complications, but it's nothing we can't overcome. But despite everything, my sister and I still miss that peculiar and strange town in Oregon, although I suppose that's normal. But soon we will return to that wonderful place where we had so many adventures and made so many friends. Soon we will see again those people who marked our lives so much. Dipper: *Finishes zipping his suitcase* And that's it. *Puts his suitcase off the bed and hangs his backpack on it* MABEL! ARE YOU READY? Mabel: *From her room* WAIT! I HAVEN'T FINISHED PUTTING DUCK'S LEASH ON YET! Dipper: HURRY UP! JONATHAN WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE! *Leaves his room and goes down the stairs* Mabel: DON'T PRESSURE ME! I STILL HAVE TO COMB MY BIRD'S NEST FOR HAIR! Dippet: *A little annoyed* I TOLD YOU TO DO THAT FIRST! Mabel: OH OH, DON'T SCOLDING ME! I FORGOT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF MAKING THIS TRIP BACK TO GRAVITY FALLS WITH MY BOYFRIEND! Dipper: *Sighs and rolls eyes* I still don't understand why you care so much about your appearance when Jonathan is around. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention before, my friend Jonathan and Mabel started dating about two months ago, which didn't really surprise me. Well, it didn't surprise me because my friend literally told me he likes my sister and asked my permission to ask Mabel out on a date first of all. Honestly, that didn't bother me at all. I know he's a good guy, plus he's been my best friend for years, so as long as he didn't ditch me for me, everything was fine. Although, of course, I did give him his fair share of threats that if he hurt my sister, things would go badly for him. I think it's obvious that so far everything is fine. Even though Mabel and Jonathan are now dating, he still spends a lot of time with me, and we continue to explore abandoned houses from time to time. It turns out there are more strange things in California than I thought, although of course I discovered that after spending that summer in Oregon. But these phenomena are nothing compared to those in Gravity Falls. It's still fun to explore them and write them down in the journal that Mabel gave me at the end of that summer when we turned 13. Mabel: *Shouts frustratedly from her room* COME ON! GET THE STUPID BRUSH! Dipper: *Sighs and shakes his head* What a mess. *Leaves his backpack on the floor next to his suitcases and goes to his sister's room* Come on, give me that. We'll finish faster if I comb your hair. *Holds out his hand*. Mabel: *Nods and hands the comb to her brother*. Dipper: *Starts combing his sister's hair* Are you finished packing? Mabel: Yep. *Looks up* I also put Duck's leash on and cleaned up. All that was left was to comb my hair. *Thinks about it for a moment* Hmm... Should I put on makeup? Dipper: Mabel. NO! If you start doing that, we'll be here until 4 in the morning, and I don't know about you, but I'd really like to get to Gravity Falls today. Mabel: *Makes a noise of protest* Don't be so exaggerated, bro, it didn't take that long to do my makeup. Dipper: What? Mabel, please, last time it took you 7 hours just to do some shadowing on your left eye. Mabel: *Pouts* It didn't look like the YouTube tutorial. *Closes eyes and raises head* Besides, that only happened... Dipper: *Interrupts* Remember that time you spent 12 hours doing your Halloween costume makeup? Or that other time you spent 9 and a half hours doing that makeup you saw in a magazine? And don't even get me started on how long it took you to get ready for your first date with Jonathan. Mabel: *Crosses her arms and puffs out her cheeks, annoyed, since she has no counterargument to what her brother said* I hate it when you're right. Dipper: *Smiles, proud of his accomplishment* I know. *Finishes combing his sister's hair* And that's it, I think it looks good now. Mabel: *Looks in the mirror, eyes sparkling* It's perfect. *Stands up from her vanity and hugs her brother tightly, lifting him up a little* THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Dipper: *Starts to turn blue* Mabel... No... I can't... I can breathe... Mabel: *Instantly lets go* Oops... Sorry, Bro-Bro, you know I can't control my strength sometimes. Dipper: *Gasps a little to catch his breath* I'm still surprised you still have the same raw strength you had when we were little. Mabel: *Proudly puts her hands on her hips* That's because I'm the Alpha twin. Dipper: Are you still at it? Mabel: Yep. At that moment, the doorbell rang, so Mabel ran toward the entrance, falling down the stairs in the process. I knew this because I heard a loud bang and a moan from my sister. I just chuckled and shook my head. This sister of mine hasn't changed much at all... Well, I haven't changed that much either. Of course, we've both changed, grown, and matured, but our essence remains the same. Anyway, a few minutes later, I left the room and went downstairs, immediately stumbling upon the scene of my sister and my friend sharing a quick kiss. At this point, I sighed and rolled my eyes. By now, I'm used to these kinds of scenes between these two. They don't bother me or anything, but there are times when I feel like the candlestick or the violinist. But hey, I'm not going to complain either. They're not the kind of couples who spend 24/7 together, and like I said before, each of us still spends a lot of time with their friends and family. It's not unusual for Mabel, Jonathan, and I to explore abandoned areas of the city. It's fun, although I find it a little annoying when something goes wrong and Mabel immediately runs to see if Jonathan is okay, or when Jonathan is the one who runs to check on Mabel. I understand that and all, but it's still annoying because sometimes it's like I'm painted on. Just as I was having those thoughts, my phone vibrated, so I took it out of my pants pocket and unlocked it, seeing a message from Paz. That made me smile instantly, and I answered her with a \"Good morning to you too, Paz. We're fine, and we haven't left the house yet, but we're about to go out. Hope to see you soon.\" After that message, I put my phone away again and finished going down the stairs and approached them, being instantly greeted by a handshake from my friend and a hug from him. Jonathan: Hey buddy, good morning, and thanks again for inviting me on this trip. Dipper: *Laughs and moves away from him* It's not a big deal, man. Besides, I wouldn't have invited you, Mabel. Mabel: *Nods* So true. *Jumps excitedly* I CAN'T WAIT TO GO! *Takes her boyfriend's arm and shakes it excitedly* I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU ALL MY FAVORITE PLACES IN TOWN AND INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIENDS FROM AYA! Jonathan: *Laughs softly and runs his free hand around the brunette's waist* I know, I know, starlet, but please calm down a bit or you'll trip again in your excitement. *He brushes back her bangs and kisses her on the forehead* Mabel: *Grins like a kitten and runs up the stairs* WAIT A MINUTE! I HAVE TO GET MY BAGS! *Shouts as she disappears down the stairs*. Dipper and Jonathan: *Laugh at the girl's attitude*. Dipper: *Finishes laughing and goes to get his bags and backpack* Did you bring everything I mentioned that would be necessary? *Slinging his backpack over his shoulder*. Jonathan: Yep. *Shows her his backpack* Mosquito repellent, flashlights, batteries, and a Gualquitalqui. *Adjusts his backpack again* Although he also brought a first aid kit in case we need it. Dipper: *Chuckles* As always, you're a forward-thinking guy. Jonathan: *Gives him a friendly punch in the arm* Hey, don't make fun of me. I'll remind you that thanks to your research, we often put ourselves in danger. Dipper: Okay, there you have a point. *Crosses arms* But you're the one who follows me voluntarily. I've never forced you to accompany Mabel and me on our expeditions. Jonathan: *Points at him* Tuche. *Shrugs* But there's no denying it, I like adventures, and I also enjoy spending time with the Pine twins... *Looks at him with a playful smile on her face* Or should I say the Mystery twins? This time I was the one who gave him a friendly punch in the arm, and we laughed. Yes, despite all that, our friendship is still the same as when we met six years ago. After that laugh, we started talking about other things. When my phone vibrated again, I took it out and saw it was a text from Paz. I smiled and answered it immediately. Jonathan: Is that her? Dipper: *Finishes texting, sends the text, and puts his phone back in the pocket he had it in* Yes. Jonathan: *Crosses his arms and raises an eyebrow* Seriously. When are you going to tell me who your mysterious \"friend\" is? I'm dying to know who she is. Dipper: *Averts his eyes* You'll meet her when we get to Gravity Falls. Jonathan: *Makes a melodramatic gesture* Don't be like that, man. I've been curious ever since I've known you. *Waves his hands exaggeratedly* The only thing I know about her is that you met her in that town in Oregon. Dipper: *Laughs a little loudly at his friend's frustration*. Jonathan: *Attempts to pout, but it doesn't work*. Dipper: *Rolls his eyes* Is that supposed to be a pout? Jonathan: ...Isn't it? Dipper: *Shakes his head* No way, stop trying to imitate Mabel, you can't do it. Jonathan: *Sticks out his tongue in a disgusted grimace* Man. Is it that obvious that was my intention? *Sighs in exhaustion, since he's definitely not going to convince his friend to tell him the information he's so closely guarded* Okay. Can I at least find out how you met? Dipper: I brought her down from her high horse by giving her some documents that proved her family is a fake. *Walks toward the stairs, not giving much thought to what he just said* Jonathan: ...Wait... WHAT THE FUCK? Dipper: *Leaning against the wall of the stairs, he takes a breath and shouts* MABEL! ARE YOU FINISHED? YOU'RE TAKING TOO LONG! Mabel: WAIT! DUCK'S GOT TANGLED IN HIS LEASH! After a few minutes, Mabel finally came down the stairs with her suitcases, and Pato was about two steps ahead of her while my sister held him by the leash. Dipper: Finally, we're coming down. Mabel: *A little annoyed* It's not my fault! Pato had gotten tangled in the leash and couldn't move. It was clearly going to take me a while to untangle it. *Pouts* Plus, I had to change my top because Pato accidentally gave me a run for my money. Dipper: Gee... I didn't need to know the details. *Sighs tiredly* Let's just go now. With any luck, we'll get there before dinnertime. Mabel: *Rolls eyes* Dipper, it's only 7 in the morning. Dipper: That's true, but I'd like to remind you that it's a long trip, and it's also going to be the first time I've driven such a long distance. Mabel: *Shakes head* Am I exaggerating? *Gently nudges his brother in the arm* Looks like someone's more excited than I am to be returning to Gravity Falls. *Smiles widely and starts jumping* Could it be because of a certain redhead by chance? Dipper: *Rolls his eyes* Mabel, please move on a long time ago. *Covers his eyes with a hand* Now I just want to forget that embarrassing crush I had when I was 12. *Removes his hand from his eyes* I admit I still like her, but it's more like a cool older sister than a romantic interest. \"Besides the fact that we've barely spoken these past few years, little by little the idealization I had for her began to crumble. But wow... Pacifica turned out to be so fun, cute, nice, interesting... Did I already say cute? Okay, okay, Dipper, calm down. You're already thinking too much about the blonde, and if I continue with this line of thought, I'm going to end up turning red, and that's the last thing I need.\" *Sighs to calm his pounding heart* Plus, his crush on her has been gone for years. Mabel: *Looking at him intently, pursing her lips* Hmm... Okay, you're telling the truth. *Narrows her eyes* So... If it's not Wendy? Then who have you been texting every day for the past 7 years? Damn, Mabel noticed that. I nervously looked away, trying to avoid the question, even though I knew it was useless. Mabel can be very annoying about these things, but luckily for me, something distracted her... Well, someone, because my sister almost fell over when she tugged on Duck's leash. Mabel: AAAAAAA! NO, DUCK! *Pulls the leash slightly to get Duck away from the green-eyed boy*. Jonathan: *Laughs slightly* I think I've spoiled him by giving him food. *Pulls the animal away and pets its head* I'm sorry, champ, but I didn't bring you anything today. Mabel: *Blushing with embarrassment* Oh, Jonathan, I'm so sorry. *Picks up his pet in his arms and runs toward the door* LET'S GO SOON! Jonathan: *Gets up from the floor and elbows his friend in the arm* You owe me one. Dipper: *Sighs in relief* Thanks, man, you really saved my sister's life. *Starts walking toward the door* I'll return the favor when I can, but let's get out of here or Mabel will do another one of her things. So the three of us left the house, put our suitcases in the trunk of my car, and got in. I think it's obvious that Mabel and Jonathan sat in the back with Pato and me in the driver's seat. After finishing packing everything, I started the car, thus beginning our long journey to Gravity Falls, that wonderful town my sister and I so wanted to return to. After several hours of traveling, which didn't seem so difficult since I was driving, we finally arrived at Gravity Falls, which made me smile. I slammed on the brakes at a stoplight, turned my body slightly, and shook my leg at my sister. Dipper: Mabel, Jonathan, wake up, we're here. Mabel: Mm... *Starts to open her eyes sleepily* What? Dipper: *Laughs softly* We've arrived in Gravity Falls. Mabel: *Opens her eyes suddenly and jumps slightly in her seat, raising her fists, hitting the roof of the car* YES! Dipper: *A little annoyed* MABEL! Mabel: Oops... Sorry, Bro, but don't worry, I didn't dent it. Dipper: You better be, Mabel, remember the conditions Dad set so I could keep this car. Mabel: *Waves her hand, dismissively* Yeah, yeah, I know. *Looks to her side, seeing her boyfriend and Duck cuddled up together, asleep* Awwwwwww... My boyfriend and my baby are adorable. Dipper: I don't understand how they can still sleep with you yelling. *Hears the car honking behind him, so he turns around, starts the car, and continues on his way.* Mabel: *Looks out the window* Wow, the town has barely changed. *Jumps slightly in his seat* I can't wait to see you all! Dipper: *Smiles* I'm looking forward to seeing you again too. I really want to tell Uncle Ford about my discoveries and ask him lots of questions. \"Although I'm more looking forward to seeing Pacifica. What does she look like now? She'll probably be more beautiful than when I first met her.\" *Gently grips the steering wheel as he feels the heat rise to his cheeks.* Mabel: *Makes a bored face* Nerd! *Smiles widely* I'm so looking forward to telling Candy, Grenda, and Pacifica about my boyfriend and introducing him to him. *Eyes sparkle* Oh, oh, I'll also have to ask Grenda how things are going with Marius. *Smiles wider* With any luck, there'll be wedding bells soon. Dipper: *Laughs at his twin sister's comments*. Mabel: I'll also have to ask Candy if she has a boyfriend, or, or, and Pacifica. *Laughs a little* What am I saying? Of course Pacifica will have a boyfriend. Dipper: *Slams the brakes on the car, causing Mabel to hit her seatbelt*. Mabel: AAAAAAA! DIPPER! *Adjusts in her seat* What the hell was that about? Dipper: *Turns around, looking annoyed at his sister* What did you mean by that? Mabel: What? What? Dipper: You know, that thing about Pacifica definitely having a boyfriend. Mabel: Oh... *Sighs and shrugs* Hey, bro, you're so distracted. It's obvious Pacifica is a beautiful girl, and she comes from a good family. With that kind of resume, it wouldn't be surprising if she had thousands of suitors surrounding her. Dipper: *Relaxes a little* Oh... That's true, but Mabel, I think you're forgetting something. Mabel: What? Dipper: I don't know... Maybe she doesn't like those suitors. Mabel: *Opens his mouth to say something, but ultimately falls silent* Hmm... You're right, but Candy and Grenda told me she's constantly talking to a guy and that they've often caught her smiling at her cell phone like a lovesick fool. Dipper: Oh... *Turns around, adjusts his seat, and starts again* Maybe... I do have a chance. *Whispering to himself as he smiles, his cheeks turning crimson* Mabel: What did you say? Dipper: Nothing. Mabel: *Sighs and shakes his head* Anyway, I think what Candy and Grenda told me confirms what I was saying. That guy she keeps talking to is probably her boyfriend. *Eyes sparkle* I HOPE SHE INTRODUCES US TO HIM! O-O! WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'LL LOOK LIKE? Is he a foreign prince? Or maybe a famous actor or singer? O-O! WHAT IF HE'S A FOREIGN VAMPIRE PRINCE WHO'S ALSO A FAMOUS SINGER? Dipper: *Rolls his eyes for a second* I think you've read too many young adult romance novels. Mabel: Maybe so, but you're definitely not going to ruin the excitement of finding out who Pacifica's \"secret\" boyfriend is. Dipper: *Slightly shrugs* Okay, okay, I'm not saying anything. Just don't throw a tantrum if things don't go your way. Mabel: *Sticks her tongue out childishly* Nnnn... Don't be so bitter. *Looks out the window* Do you think they'll be waiting for us? Dipper: *Smiles* I'm sure they will. *Sighs to calm his inner nerves* Okay, now we have to relax. We're almost there. After a few minutes, we arrived at our destination, the Mystery Cabin. I parked, and Mabel and I stood there for a few seconds, staring at the cabin, impressed. They'd added a larger cabin, although the building we'd known as children was still there. It was still surprising to see the changes this place had undergone. Mabel: *Smiles broadly and shakes Jonathan's shoulders* JONATHAN, WAKE UP! WE'RE HERE! Jonathan: *Wakes up a little shaken from the scare, and calms down when he sees Mabel* Baby, you know I love you, but please stop waking me up like that. I almost had a heart attack. Mabel: Oops... Sorry, I'm so excited, you know. Dipper: *Laughs softly and opens the door* Come on, let's go. Let's not keep our friends and family waiting any longer. *Gets out of the car and closes the door while taking a deep breath* I missed the fresh Oregon air. Mabel: *Gets out of the car, followed by Jonathan* Yes. *Raises her fists and shouts at the top of her lungs* WE'RE BACK IN GRAVITY FALLS! Jonathan: *Laughs softly and hugs the brunette from behind and around the waist while resting his chin on her shoulder* Have I ever told you how cute you look when you get this excited? Mabel: *Turns her face, smiling from ear to ear with bright eyes* You're just too darling, Joni. *Turns completely around, hugs him by the neck, and kisses him*. Dipper: *Rolls his eyes while taking the suitcases out of the trunk* And now I'm back to being a candle holder. *Peeks out from behind the trunk and shouts* HEY, YOU TWO! ARE YOU GOING TO STAY IN YOUR LOVE BUBBLE ALL DAY OR ARE YOU GOING TO COME HELP ME WITH THE BAGS? I REMIND YOU THAT POOR PEOPLE DON'T NEED SERVANTS! Mabel: *Turns red and instantly moves away from her boyfriend* DIPPER! YOU DAMN BITTER NERD! YOU RUINED THE MOMENT! Jonathan: *Laughs softly and gently takes Mabel by the shoulders* Come on, sweetheart, don't get so worked up. *Whispers something in her ear that makes her blush instantly* Have you calmed down yet? Mabel: *Nods, her face red, goes to the trunk, grabs her bags, and walks a little away from the car without saying a word*. Dipper: *Looks at his friend* What did you say to make her feel like that? Jonathan: *Waves his hand, dismissively* Nothing, just that we should share a room. Dipper: Oh... Dude, no offense, but that's a terrible idea. *Adjusts his backpack on his shoulder*. Jonathan: *Taking out his bags, he looks at him in disbelief* What? Why? Dipper: Trust me, you'll find out tonight. *Pats him on the shoulder and starts walking toward his sister* Mabel. Do you think our old room is still the same? Mabel: *Snaps out of her little trance and smiles widely remembering that summer they spent here* I hope so. *Sees the freckled boy approach them both and takes his arm, starting to run toward the cabin* LET'S GO! I CAN'T WAIT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO EVERYONE! So my sister dragged my friend away, at which I could only sigh and, grabbing my bags and some that Mabel had left behind, followed them. When I entered the cabin, I instantly noticed everyone was already surrounding Mabel and Jonathan. Yes, as always, my sister is the one who stands out among the two. The truth is, I'm already used to being the \"ghost twin,\" since no one noticed my presence... Or at least that's what I thought until I felt thin arms around my waist, along with small, warm hands on my back, a comforting warmth against my body, especially my chest, and above all, a very clear and pleasant smell of champagne and flowers. It took me a few seconds to process it, but when I did, I dropped my suitcases and hugged her back. I didn't need to look at her to know who it was. Dipper: *Smiles while blushing slightly* I've missed you too, Pacifica. To be continued. ------------------------------------------------------------ And here's the prologue to this new fic. As I said in the disclaimer, this is the first Gravity Falls fanfic I've written, so I hope you like it. I also remind you that several OCs will appear in this fic, the first being Jonathan. https://preview.redd.it/i3l0fbk04agf1.png Here's a picture of his design and a little bit of information about him. Jonathan is a normally laid-back young man who enjoys adventures. He's a few weeks older than Dipper and Mabel. He really enjoys spending time with both twins, feeling that with them, his life is more entertaining and exciting. He lives with his parents and his two younger brothers. Although he often complains about the latter, he actually loves them very much, even though they tend to be little devils, as he calls them. I think this is enough information for now about this boy, who, as you can see, has a very close relationship with the Pines twins. Well, I think that's all for now. I hope you enjoyed this little prologue and that you find the fic interesting. With that said, I say goodbye. See you next time, my dear Lovis. Kisses.

      "content_preview": "Okay, so with that said, I'd better leave you with some character designs, which I made with Gacha Life 2. Hi, well, I just wanted to clarify that this is the first Gravity Falls fanfic I've ever written, so I hope you like it. Also, first of all, let me warn you that it's a Dipcifica fic (DipperxPacifica/PacificaxDipper), but that it will also have mysteries and adventures like the original series... Or well, I'll try. Seven years after that summer the Pines twins, Dipper and Mabel, spent in the mysterious, remote Oregon town whose name they could never forget, the two finally return to the town of Gravity Falls. No longer just kids, they're both 19 and soon to turn 20, so this summer will be very different from the one they spent so long ago. Especially for young Dipper, as it seems fate is determined that he'll reunite with a certain someone who will change his life. What mysteries and experiences await the twins this time around? I also think it's relevant to mention that some OCs will appear in this fic, although they won't be as relevant... At least not most of them. Okay, now that's out of the way, let's get the writing straight. Like this: I speak. Narrator Between *...* Actions. Between -...- thoughts. Okay, these are the Gravity Falls characters I've designed. As the OCs appear, I'll show you what they look like ;3. At first, I thought about adding a brief character description, but I think it'd be better to show how they've changed and evolved throughout the story. Anyway, as I said before, this is the first GF fic I've written, but it most likely won't be the last. I actually have several ideas for other fics, including a couple of these for the Reverse Falls AU, but I'd better not get ahead of myself. Anyway, I hope you liked the designs and that you find this little fic interesting. I was actually inspired by other Dipcifica fics. Without further ado, see you next time ;3.",
