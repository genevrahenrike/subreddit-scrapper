      "content_preview": "Hey guys, first time poster, never lurker but I go where the knowledge is. I have the opportunity to spec a non-woodworking/machining/mechanic workbench for a tech related purpose. The purpose of the bench is to act as a platform for sensor and camera feasibility studies. The specs are below: Storage footprint: W ~48-52\", D 24-26\", H <72\" 4 wheels, 2 swiveling ideally lockable drawers or large doors with internal shelves. Ideally metal with a white or non-wood surface. The edges and the back of the table depth will support extruded aluminum for use with articulation like swivel link or similar hardware. I could make the whole thing out of extruded aluminum but the cost to put locks and draws would drive up price over a standard product that can be adapted once received. I've already looked at the obvious big box solutions got rolling tool chests, etc. and have lazily started an aluminum design as a last ditch. Im wondering if this group of fine people know of a vendor that might have something very similar already that I'm unaware of.",

      "content_preview": "Edit: my first run of trying to use metric live and I fucked it up. 1) it means I described the bench as being 1'x2' instead of 2x3 AND it means the metal plate isn't 5 feet by 10 feet and therefore much more manageable... Hey, I posted this to welding and got crickets. I guess they hate workbenches? I tried to cross post it here and can't find it- so if this shows up twice forgive me. I'll delete the cross post when I find it. The crux is do I bear the massive cost and inefficiency of material and use a thick sheet top, or do a lattice of square stock.  Anyway, post below: Bench - redux I moved from USA to Thailand and woodworking is problematic where I live. Despite this being a hub for hardwood it is very difficult to source, the people with access for making furniture guard it like a national secret and the few people willing to sell it retail confuse it with gold.  I tried building shit from bamboo and it sucked.  So I've been welding. Spent the last six months making shelves and benches and widgets.  It is my favorite thing to do at home.  I'd like to start doing bigger and more complicated utility projects and I've got some art stuff I want to fool with.  Currently I've a tin folding table that I could literally crumple bare handed and a wooden table that is crooked and wobbly that I've laid a sheet of stainless on top of. I want to build a multi function table to facilitate the making of many random things.  Because it will be a non trivial expenditure of money and time I want to do it in such a way that I won't want to redo it in 9 months.  But I don't know what I don't know and I might learn some shit next summer that changes how I think.  But in this group are people who already know everything I will ever learn.  So I am looking for advice.  I don't mind shit talking if it's funny or also helpful. These are the things I am currently thinking about: I am going to do a lot of bending of iron rods.  (See vague reference to art). I've got an idea for a sort of jig I can adjust to do different bends- but the bench needs to be strong enough to handle that force.  It also needs to be heavy, so I thought I'd build a sort of tray in the bottom I could throw cement bags in. My workspace suffers for serious want of surface space.  So this bench also needs to do duty as a space for glue ups or painting.  I don't have a lot of space, I'm thinking 60X90cm (training myself to think in metric). I'd love to use a 10mm plate in that size with lots of holes for clamping, but in my area I'd need to buy a 120x240cm sheet, find someone to cut it (who would want to rob me because of my skin color) arrange transport, commit to some other sizes for the rest of the piece because I can't store or manipulate a chunk like that... The alternative I've thought of is to make a lattice(?) or grid out of 4x4cm square tubing with 1.8mm walls. I chatted a local... Let's call him a machine shop guy (but that is comically generous) using drawings and pantomime and he felt it would've strong enough.  Any thoughts? As much as I want this beast to be a fixture, I know I'm going to need to move it.  And while it will be heavy relative to my world it is nothing compared to various heavy machinery.  I should be able to put something like this on some super beefy castors right? I mean, it's going to weigh in the hundreds of pounds (shit, lost my metric) not in the tonnes (there we go- Shakespearean metric... I think?)... I want the working  surface to be a little over 3 feet (shit)... I still don't really have a grasp of how strong metal and welds are... If the top of the base (tray) area is 30 inches or so (fuck it, I give up) from the bottom of the top rails... Will I need braces for it to be strong enough for me to be twisting bar stock? Or will I need some diagonal supports?  I know I'm looking for some advanced estimation here...  I'm planning that same square stock for the whole frame regardless of what kind of top. Thanks.",

      "content_preview": "So I'm planning to build a pretty faithful version of the Anarchist's workbench and I've got 50 mm x 150 mm boards of locally grown (Norway) scots pine I plan to use for my benchtop. The idea is to glue them together (3-4 boards at a time) to end up with a benchtop that is approx 130-140 mm thick. I bought the timber at a local saw mill and the wood is both coarse and slightly warped. I haven't got a electric jointer or a planer, so my options for getting these boards smooth and straight are my hand planes (stanley no 3-5), a cheap electric hand planer and an electric hand sander. What I'm contemplating now is how smooth and straight the boards will have to be before I start gluing (I've got some pretty solid cast iron clamps) and what the best approach is to reaching this end point. I'm at a beginner level when it comes to hand planes so in a way it would be good practice to use my hand planes and some winding sticks to get all boards perfectly flat - however it would also be nice to have the bench done before christmas. I've seen some examples of making a jig for an electric hand planer for flattening boards that seems smart and efficient. I'm not going for perfect here, I just need a bench top without cracks that won't cause me a headache down the line. How perfect do the boards need to be before gluing? Given the tools at my disposal, how should I approach the project? Any thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "Hello. I'm a beginning woodworking hobbyist. Until now I've mostly done projects using power tools. I'd like to get more into fine woodworking with hand tools. I need a sturdy workbench. I want to build one, but I'm overthinking it. I've gone down the rabbit hole of reddit posts and YouTube videos, and I'm torn between a few styles I like ( Roubo , Shaker , Paul Sellers ) - or maybe designing a hybrid. I'm leaning toward a 180 cm long, 60 cm wide and 96 cm high workbench (about 6' x 24\" x 38\"). I'd love some advice on a few dilemmas I'm stuck on: 1) Tool storage options I'm short on space and prefer keeping tools enclosed when not in use. I really like the idea of drawers under the bench, and/or a wall cabinet above it. I don't think I want to dedicate floor space to a tool chest . Which storage option do you find most convenient: bench drawers, a wall cabinet, or both ? 1.1) Shelf (gap) between drawers and benchtop I've noticed some benches have drawers right up to the benchtop , while others leave a gap instead of a top row . I get that the gap helps with workpiece holding, but it also means losing a drawer and creating a mess-collecting ledge. Is leaving that gap actually worth it? 2) Work holding options I've seen Paul Sellers do almost everything with a cast-iron quick-release face vise and a clamp. I'm thinking of installing a 9\" one myself since they're affordable. I also like the idea of a planing stop and using bench hooks for sawing/shooting. But: should I leave some benchtop overhang for clamping? On which sides? More overhang means less space for drawers. Would the combo of vise + planing stop + bench hooks be enough for comfortable work? Or would I really benefit from bench dogs, holdfasts, tail vise, leg vise, or even a sliding deadman? 3) Tool well trays I love the idea of a tool well and think I'd actually use one. Should I keep it simple (like Paul Sellers' design), or consider multiple trays? Are tool well trays worth it in practice, and what benefits do they add? --- I'd really appreciate any advice, guidelines, or personal experiences. If you've got photos or plans of your own benches, please share!",
