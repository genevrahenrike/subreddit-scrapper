I live in New York now but after Covid my Dad and I started a tradition where we would pick one game a year and I'd fly home, we'd get tickets and go enjoy a game together. It just happened that this year the only weekend that really worked was Halloween weekend which is great because we play BU at home. I knew it would be a fairly in demand game, so I logged on right at 10 AM this morning when individual game tickets went on sale. When I logged in, there was only one set of two tickets together left in the entire arena. I just took them as it was clear I didn't have any other choice. I just logged in again for the heck of it and all 17 home games are completely sold out, and for the BU game on Halloween night, even on SeatGeek, there's only two sets of two tickets together and each ticket is going for $225 each, which I believe is over an 878% markup. Wow.",
