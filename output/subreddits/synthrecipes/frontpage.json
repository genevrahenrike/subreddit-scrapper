I know arca utilizes a lot of sampling, time stretching, izotope iris, and stock ableton processing, and I even tried remaking this sound in iris. I got quite familiar with iris remaking other sounds on her stretch 2 ep. But i don‚Äôt think this can be remade that way. I also know she utilizes lots of korg triton sounds but i don‚Äôt think this could be a preset from there either. It‚Äôs really unlike anything else i‚Äôve ever heard, it sounds sort of phaser-y when heard on headphones and I know she utilizes ableton legacy effects to get crazy textures but I can‚Äôt get a similar effect out of any of these ideas",

      "content_preview": "I have four single cycle samples which capture timbral variations corresponding to quiet and low pitch, quiet and high pitch, loud and low pitch, and loud and high pitch on an acoustic instrument.  I have separate modulation sources appropriate for volume and pitch. I can take any two of the samples, put them in a wavetable, and use one of the modulation sources to interpolate between them.  Works great.  But wavetable interpolation is one dimensional and I want two.  (Ignore other wavetable modifiers like skew for now; I'm investigating what I can do with pure interpolation.) What if I make one wavetable with the quiet samples and one with the loud ones.  Use the pitch modulation source to interpolate within each one.  Assign each to its own oscillator and use the volume modulation source to crossfade between them. Almost like vector synthesis, right?  But crossfading single cycle samples at the same frequency appears to be producing nasty phase cancellation problems.  The more I think about it, I should be seeing those same phase cancellation problems even along the wavetable interpolation axis.  This is my first time building custom wavetables; is careful phase alignment a standard issue there?  Is linear interpolation in a wavetable with two samples in it fundamentally different from crossfading those samples?  Am I completely misdiagnosing this? For what it's worth I'm using Surge XT, but any wavetable synth with a decent mod matrix should be able to reproduce this setup.",

Sounds like a simple filtered sound until I decided to recreate it as close as possible. Orange is the isolated bass note playing E. White is the serum patch I've managed to squash the regular saw with a triangle up an octave, to get the waverorm pattern but can't quite get the phase right. Wondering if this could be done without tweaking both osc phases. The upper noise harmonics in between big peaks are a mistery to me - I tried fm mod on oscilators, it just seems to multiply internal smaller peaks which is not desired. Noise ocs kind of gets the visual result match but I hear no noise layer on top of the bass. Here is what I have in serum https://preview.redd.it/bass-from-mau-p-people-talk-v0-u2kyd644zekf1.png Serum gurus, pls help, I appreciate your time, thank you!",

From research it was programmed on a Korg Poly-61, which I found a free VST for called the Fury68, however I just cannot nail down the sound. I've gotten close with the Fury-68 Organ 1 sound and the default init program on 8' layered but there's a tone of the sound which I can't describe, almost duck like that I can't get. Has anyone managed to get anything close to the original sound. You can hear it best here (timestamped) https://youtu.be/p8y9JH2I_cE?t=18 . Thanks for any assistance.",
