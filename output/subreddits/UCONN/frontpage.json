It says: “If you drop a class and enroll in a different class, the bookstore will “swap” the required textbooks/digital materials so that you have what you need.” I’m just wondering if I have to do anything or if it’s all automatic. When I go to the material selection page it just shows the old class and not the new one with the required material. Any help appreciated.",

Are the tickets being paid to the town of Storrs-Mansfield, to the UConn budget, or to the state of Connecticut budget (seeing as UConn is public)? If they’re being paid to UConn budget, where do ticket appeals occur and is there a judge to rule? If you have received one of these moving violation tickets please DM me!",

Most of his previous aides have come from UConn - the hours are fairly flexible, and pay starts at $22/hr, with increase after 3 months. I am happy to share the full job listing with those who might be interested - just note that: - this entails working at his home with him, and hours range from mornings, afternoons, evenings, as well as Saturdays & Sundays - there is often travel involved to nearby colleges where he does speaking engagements, as well as to his volunteer work - a vehicle is provided, but clean driving record is required - being in solid physical condition is a must for working with him - this job requires being able to lift and move, etc. Please DM if you have any interest!",

The area is all public parking, and the area a few blocks up is residential parking. We have never had any issues. My partner came up to visit me this weekend and he parked his car on the same street I usually park in. He parked in front of my neighbors house (leaving plenty of space for the houses driveway). Today, he found a big scary note on his windshield that says, “Move your park or else we will call the cops” in all capital letters in red. Did we mess up? I have parked in front of people’s house before and had no issues whatsoever so ever. It wasn’t a private parking and we gave room for the driveway. Does anyone who live in Willimantic know what’s up?",

Not really sure how to put all of this out there, but I’ve just started my classes as a Freshman at the Hartford campus doing a psychology major (thinking about switching), and I feel like I don’t have what it takes to be successful academically. I always did good in my humanities but I never got the best grades in sciences no matter how much afterschool help I sought. Because of this, I’m worried that I won’t be able to succeed at the college level, and I’m not really sure how to address this. I don’t have any friends here either so it’s been kind of tough being on my own in a fairly small campus and commuting home every day. I was just wondering if anyone could offer some guidance or personal experiences. While I am of course grateful to have the privilege of attending college, I also worry sometimes that I’ll be stuck in the same habits and same mindset while everyone attending/dorming elsewhere has the chance to broaden their understanding of themselves by getting out of their comfort zones. I hope this all makes some sense 😭😭 please let me know if",

I’m just wondering if I would be able to go to Huskies Restaurant and Bar, Ted’s Restaurant and Bar, Square Peg Pizzeria and Bar, and also Kathmandu Kitchen and Bar (and wherever else around here that’s both a restaurant and bar), just for the food since I’m under 21. I’m not interested in drinking alcohol at all, I just want to go there for the food items. I don’t know if they check IDs right at the door or at the bar section for these places, or if I could only go at a certain time. I don’t want to go there just to be turned away or to be accused of wanting to drink underage (I’m trying to avoid any issues), and I would like to know before I go since it’s different everywhere, so please let me know if I would still be allowed in to eat. Or if it would be takeout only. I’m not sure if the bar part is separate and anyone could eat at the restaurant section, or if it’s all 21+ only for the whole place at these locations. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone! I just have a few questions of things I’ve been wondering. I do have social anxiety and am afraid of embarrassing myself (and I hate it when I do or I would just go figure it out for myself if I didn’t feel too overwhelmed), so it would help me feel more calm if I did get an answer to these. Thanks to anyone who answers, even if it’s just some of them! For the dining hall that closed down a year ago (Buckley Dining Hall), did they turn it into a study space (I’ve heard someone say that but just wanna make sure if it’s true)? If yes, can everyone go to it to use or is it only for residents in Buckley? Also if yes to if everyone can go use it, does anyone know the hours when it’s opened and unlocked? I have a class that’s in a residence hall (Wilson Residence Hall). How does that work? Does the building unlock and lock at normal times like the other academic buildings? Also, is it unlocked on weekends (so I can explore campus and find my classes beforehand) or no? Will all of the buildings be unlocked during move in weekend? If not, what ones will be closed until classes start? I’m thinking of exploring all of the buildings (ones where classes are held, both student health and wellness locations, the library, the recreation center, etc) ahead of time if possible. Also, are there any locations/buildings that I can’t explore (obviously not locked places, but I meant anywhere that I could accidentally walk into or any buildings)? Also what residence halls have classrooms/study spaces/other stuff in them that all students can go to (since in my second question I asked about one) and when are they open and closed? And are they opened on weekends? Where specifically are they located (like for example, use a certain door, or only on a certain floor, etc). I’m thinking of possibly exploring those too if possible incase I have any future classes located at any. This may seem like a silly question but do I need my student ID to enter the recreation center? I never went in to it besides for once back at first year student orientation but I want to start going there possibly. Do I need to scan it or something to enter? If yes, where would I scan it or whatever I have to do with it to get in? Can anyone use the field house? I’ve been thinking of wanting to use the indoor track when it’s too hot or too cold out. If yes, is it always open? If not, would it also be locked if it is reserved for something? What is the Hawley Armory? I heard someone say it’s a fitness center but is that true? Can anyone go there? I was thinking of exploring there too but I’m not sure if I could. Is it busy there usually? When is it open and closed? Could I just walk in or what? Anything else I should know? Could I go explore the student health and wellness buildings (like just walk in if it’s unlocked and walk through the hallways without bothering anyone)? I just don’t want to be walking into a waiting room when I first walk in or someone asking me why I’m there or having to check in. I’m just not sure if I have to tell anyone why I’m there first or have to make an appointment. Not sure how it works and don’t want to risk wasting my time or embarrassing myself lol. I only want to explore there too incase I ever need to go there in the future for something and would want to be more familiar with the buildings. On days that the Benton Museum is not having any events and I just want to visit and go look at the artwork, is it free for students? Would I have to show my student ID or something? If I brought family or friends that don’t go to UConn, would they have to pay to get in to go look at the artwork? Don’t judge me for this one but do people really care what someone is doing? Even if they’re doing something out of the ordinary? As long as someone is not being disruptive or being too loud and just minding their own business doing their own thing. I’m a little bit self conscious and don’t want to look silly or stupid somehow. I’ve been judged and people were rude to me before in the past for no good reason so I’m a bit anxious due to that. However, I also want to be able to do new things and also explore just for fun. Also, are most people nice? I haven’t really got out or did much last semester besides going to class and focusing on schoolwork so I didn’t get to explore campus much or really go out and do things or made many friends. Does anyone really remember you and what you look like (or specific details about you or your stuff) if you kind of stand out? EDIT: Helpful answers only, no rude comments please, don’t waste your time if you’re not gonna answer any of the questions lol. I just want to become more familiar with campus and find new study spots and avoid any awkward conversations or wasting my time",
