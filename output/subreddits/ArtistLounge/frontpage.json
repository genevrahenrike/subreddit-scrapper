      "content_preview": "Yes, I know people have different tastes. I know there is some subjectivity when it comes to the appreciation of art. But there is skilfully made art an unskilfully made art. I'll work inside the idea that art is subjective. I'll assume temporarily that there is no good or bad art. But there are certainly good and poor draftsmen, good and poor painters, good and poor sculptures, good and poor graphic designers, good and poor artisans and artists of all kinds. Saying there is no bad art is like saying there are no bad chairs. Sure, this chair is wobbly and has rusty nails sticking out of the seat, but I think it's an excellent chair. Oh yes, that chair is sturdily handmade with perfect fit and finish. It is divinely comfortable, but it's a poor chair in my opinion. There are people who can capture a likeness, who can draw dynamically posed bodies with a real sense of weight and motion, there are people who understand composition, value, color theory, people who can replicate any style they wish, who are proficient in any medium. And there are people who can do none of these things. People constantly use the subjectivity of taste to excuse lack of ability. I refuse to accept the idea that Michaelangelo's art is of equal merit to crude deviant art anime sonic inflation drawings.",

Now, even if people interact or like art online not much seems to come from it. people used to seem more supportive on certain social medias, now it’s like we constantly have to be entrepreneurs too.

It's something that gives my life purpose and I'm happy that I have something to live for. 😀👍 I am a concept artist for a living, and literally make art all the time, and if it's not art, it's stitching clothing or journaling or making handmade notebook, which are also all art adjacent. So why make art? \"Because 🙂\"",

I was just at Dragoncon (my first con), and the artist area was absolutely amazing. But it made me wonder why there's never that style art in museums. People have been doing that kind of art since the 60s, maybe earlier. And they use many mediums as well. I just think a lot more people like me would visit art museums more if they offered a wider variety of styles, contents, and themes. Edit: I understand that museums show a lot of historical art, but the ones I've been to also show a lot from just the past 50 years. And that's why I mentioned that the art I'm talking about has been made since the 60s or earlier.",

Like if I get a picture of some else it's stealing, but if, I am the one to create it, then is it technically safe.

Besides having a severe lack of creativity, I also have aphantasia (the inability to imagine or picture things in your mind) which doesn't let me understand or visualize how lighting works and how to make textures when trying to properly paint (basic cel shading doesn't count). I found that the best option for me is to just not shade at all. 9 times out of 10, flat colors will look much, much better than wonky shading/lighting attempts. I spent 13 years of digital art since I was 7 years old on and off PRAYING and studying so hard trying to get something semi-realistic, wanting to look like other artists soo bad with all their lovely detail. Eventually I realized that I had to find my own style. Even if I don't like it as much as others, it's what works for me. A lot of people need to understand that their \"style\" isn't what they like, it's what they're good at.",

      "content_preview": "Hello, i want to start by saying that i am posting this on a burner account because I dont want to fish for compliments for my art or anything. I just want to know if anyone else got that bad into a low for this. So a month or so ago I saw that there would be applications open for a zine of my favorite ship as a charity zine, obviously fell in love instantly! I got to work to make a nice portfolio that showcased everything I was capable of, weeks before the applications opened. I was so thrilled, I already had a few ideas. Then the applications opened and a few days later the admins posted if people can share it because they were not getting many applications. Dumb as I am I instantly thought wow okay so i'm gonna get in! Yeah, I did get accepted - but as a backup if anyone dropped out. I do want to say, I am not mad or anything and I know that it's normal to not get in. I know that it's nice that i'm at least the backup! I know that the decision was not easy for the admins and that they are all lovely people. I know that they and the project have nothing to do with my dilemma right now. I know that it's probably just envy and that i am just being stupid about it. But I still want to write it down. Because after I got the email I just stopped drawing. I don't feel joy anymore looking at my art or my two favorite characters. I haven't even tried to pick up my pen again. All I can think about is 'I wasn't good enough', I keep thinking about what is was about my portfolio that wasn't as good as the others. Eventhough I know that it's not that deep! I keep telling myself that it's not that deep and that there is nothing wrong with my art. I feel so so so stupid. How can you lose your passion of 10 years over something absolutely stupid like that?? I don't know it feels different than anything i had before and i've been doing this for a while. I really don't know what to do, has anyone ever had a crashout that bad over a zine rejection? I want to say again, that i dont have the mindset of 'Wow these are really missing out on me!' or the opposite 'I should have never tried because my art is bad anyway' normally I'm actually pretty positive about my art, but i dont know.",

Maybe become friends and make art together. How would you go about finding a small community like this in an online space? What do you have to do to build up these sort of connections? Which is the best place for it? For context, I made an x account and even though I tried interacting with others, leaving encouraging comments, my posts got flagged as spam.

I have told him to feel free to look for someone who may be able to do it faster. He seems to be sure he wants me to do it personally.

I know that the main issue is that I am afraid of messing up again, doing a painting with many mistakes or skill issues that get in my way (like, not getting a specific material right or not improving a part even after several hours of reworking, not getting the likeness of a character) and not living up to my expectations ( I tend to like extremly high quality art, e.g. from Magic the Gathering or Splash Art or traditional artists).

But one day almost two years ago, while trying to think of an online handle (I had just turned 17 and was finally allowed to use very limited søcial media, although it wasn’t until I turned 18 that I got free reign), I got the idea to be Crabmeat. Idk, it just sounded cool and wasn’t being used by any other artists that I could find online. Then my signature became a simple 4-clawed crab, and it’s a lot more recognizable.",

My dream of working in the animation industry never wavered, so I practiced drawing every single day without getting bored of it. I used to be really disciplined. But lately, I’ve been having so much fun reading and writing stories that I’ve started to draw less. I even went as long as a month without drawing (which is shocking for me). Now I’m a third-year college student majoring in animation, and I know I need to keep practicing and creating. My goal is to land an animation job within a year after graduation, so I need to be able to draw at a professional level and build a strong portfolio. The problem is, I really don’t feel motivated right now. I feel like I’m not improving, and every piece I make just looks boring to me.  Any advice would be appreciated...thank you",

      "content_preview": "It’s simultaneously something I beat myself up about yet still lust after, my pieces I’ve posted are just shit post and most of the stuff I don’t post are just me trying my “hand” at hands or just finding random references to work off of or just doodles for fun when I have the extra time. I actually got quite consistent recently as I’ve just been drawing more since I detached myself from posting everything I draw. Although I find myself in occasional moods of rage because I never am where I want to be, but it’s almost always about a hour later I just kinda snap out of it. I mean I’m only really drawing to fulfill my own standards and got motivated into starting a to do more fundamental stuff ever since someone say one drawing I made in class and said I need to study anatomy more, which you know is part of why I’m not posting a lot of my drawings since there’s been this inadequacy gap between me and where I want to be that kinda bubbled up on that remark making me wanna try harder on something specific. But the weird part is that my art style is, just downright weird, it’s so different it’s hard for me to even measure where I actually am since my art-style is really not like any other I’ve seen, it originally was supposed to be cartoony like pizza tower, ren & Stimpy, and bob clampett looney toons. Then I got into one piece so that got mixed in their, now the art-style is just kinda a pie of every single piece of art I see, getting slowly capitulated into this mass of a artstyle, most recent is fnf since I started studying hands which fnf inspired me too do. TLDR: I’m half enjoying half hating art and just rolling along with a weird artstyle that personally just feels me, I haven’t seen anyone else draw like it and I can’t tell if that’s a bad thing or a good thing. If you wanna see my older posted art it’s in my account history, although I haven’t really been that active so my art back then may not match one to one with my art currently (which isn’t posted anyways) but it’s pretty damn similar to now, just now I’m practicing more",

Liquitex has also been available for as long as I remember (I remember back to the 1980s). The other main brand I see is Golden but that's new here, I don't remember seeing it until a few years ago when I took up art again. The other brand I see a lot of is Pebeo, the French budget brand (good quality though). Golden products are really expensive here, especially the mediums, literally double the price of Liquitex.

The artists that I most admire, like Wayne Thiebaud and Edward Hopper, got a lot of that kind of criticism in their day. So I know I’m in good company. But still, to get that from a supposed friend is really annoying. Maybe she’s coming from a place where she doesn’t know how to talk about art and thinks it’s a compliment. Although I think it’s pretty universally understood that “banal” is not a compliment. I’ve spoken to her about my struggles with the pretentiousness of the art world, especially here in San Francisco in the 90s when we were in college, and conceptual art world and my rejection of such. Pretty sure she’s not meaning to come at me, but what do you say to friends and family who inadvertently say kinda rude things about our art?",

Is this enough to make a piece original enough to sell? Because I thought if it looks like a study of an image you cant sell it.

I've done 3 juried shows so far. My art gets good comments and sales and I get a good crowd drawn to my booth so far. I am fine with my interactions with potential customers. What I need help understanding is what I am supposed to do for other artists at the show who drop by my booth and compliment me or discuss my art or commiserate or whatever. They tell me what they make and where they are, etc. Later, when I am walking around, stretching my legs, am I supposed to do more than wave if I see them? Am I supposed to go to their booth and compliment their work as well? Or is a wave okay? I generally am really just stretching my legs, I walk through the grounds at a good clip. I am looking at the art but I am not a shopper/buyer. I am admittedly not good at networking but I am friendly to anyone that comes to my booth. Am I supposed to be doing more? I am also curious about booths near me. We all generally say hi, watch each other's booths if needed, etc. But I notice by the end of the show it seems that the booth owners nearby have all sort of bonded with each other and I don't know how or when that happens and wonder if I am supposed to be doing more than manning my own booth and generally watching out for others as needed? Just what are the social obligations to other artists at an art show? Any guidance is appreciated and it's totally okay to explain it like I'm 5 because I truly want to understand.",

      "content_preview": "I’ve probably spent around $500+ on art courses. Coloso, Class101+, online bundles, art books, and I can honestly say none of them ever actually helped me as an artist. The tools that progressed my art skills were a lot cheaper. A $9 app (Magic Poser) has helped my anatomy more than any course. The free art program I use has a $2.99 subscription for prime membership. And there’s another anatomy app I pay like $23 a year for when I need help with facial expressions. Add free YouTube videos and some reference searching to that, and the price-to-value ratio doesn’t even compare. I get that paid courses work for some people, and I’m not saying they’re all bad! But man, when all the info is right there basically free, it’s hard not to feel like I bought into the hype that’d I’d be drawing like these pro-level artists. Not to mention, a lot of these art courses are just mid at best. It’s all the same rebranded advice I can find online for free: “study the fundamentals, do practice studies, draw daily!” And most of them feel geared toward beginners. It’s rare to find paid resources that are actually helpful to intermediate+ artists like myself! I’m curious if anyone else feels the same?",

      "content_preview": "When I was in high school I made a 3.5 hour long spider-man fan film with a friend of mine. It was very bad and nothing particularly good was in it, but it represented a large portion of my life. Two whole years spent on that project. Recently the laptop I had it on crashed and all my files were deleted. So the entire movie is just gone now. I can’t sleep some nights because I think about all the time I spent on it, and I can’t even listen to the songs I put in the movie anymore because it’s too painful. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with losing a piece of art you loved? Sorry if this post is a little sad, but I figured if anyone could relate to losing a piece of art it would be you guys.",

I create art because I think I’m decent at it and like being praised for it, but I also do it because art is spiritual to me in a way. I want to think I’m honoring the artists who influenced me throughout my life by creating. A lot of younger artists worry about finding their own unique style, but I don’t think it’s necessarily wrong to wear your influences on your sleeve. It’s just a matter of acknowledging where you came from.",

      "content_preview": "Please delete if redundand or not allowed. Hey everyone, I’ve been sitting with a lot of anxiety lately and figured maybe someone here could relate or offer some perspective. Over 11 years ago, when I was a teenager/very young adult, I was active in the online art community. I posted a lot of fandom work under my legal name, including some pieces I now feel pretty uncomfortable about. Most of it revolved around a toxic fictional pairing (nothing illegal or extreme, just two very messed-up characters and some explicit content). At the time, I was exploring things through art including sexual*ty and taboo topics, but I’ve grown a lot since then and no longer draw that kind of material or feel connected to it. I’ve been inactive for nearly a decade due to simply being afraid pf the internrt (ridiculous ik) and college being stressful and now that I’m trying to start fresh online.. i am feel anxious and like i am jumping onto a pit of snakes. I have no idea how the online world works regarding taboos, art rules, doxxing and what not... Theres a lot i wanna do after healing and getting to a comfortable spot irl...including launching an animation studio. My uni ofc posted my legal name upon graduating. My new work has my name attached to it..but so does the old art that i just recently found and cant delete. I feel paralyzed. I want to share my current work, but I’m terrified that someone will dig up my old art and judge me for it or worse, cancel me and my  partners. I don’t even know what the norms of the art community are anymore, and that makes it harder to re-enter the space confidently. It’s not just about embarrassment, it’s the fear that my past will overshadow the person and artist I’ve become. I know people change, and I know I was just a kid trying to figure things out, but the permanence of the internet makes it feel like I’ll never be free of that version of myself. Not understanding current lingo as a 30 smth y.o isnt exactly helpi g either.. Has anyone else dealt with something similar? How did you move forward? Is it even possible to reclaim your narrative when your old work is still floating around? Thanks for reading. I’d really appreciate any thoughts or encouragement.",
