I edited build.prop and tried some optimization apps, and it was pretty fast. However, as I installed new apps, it started to get slow again. Unfortunately, there are no custom ROMs developed for this phone, and I want to try a GSI. What I want to know is, are there any GSI ROMs that are stable enough for daily usage? It also has to be super lightweight because this phone only has 2GB RAM. If there aren't any stable GSI ROMs for daily use, can you give me any tips on improving performance?",

I love the zFlip, dont get me wrong, but I also switched due to being able to do lots of customization. Now everyone is saying they're going to switch to iPhone since Android will soon be no longer allowing sideloading applications from unverified devs and massively complaining about it. I don't really sideload all too often, but down the road, I would REALLY love to use a custom OS or have custom animations. Or can you already do that without sideloading? Are there still pros with Android over Apple at this point? I still have until the 5th to return my phone.",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I'm on CrDroid 11.7 flashed on a POCO F3 and I'm struggling to get my bank app to work properly. I'm using KernelSU Next with Zygisk Next, Play Integrity Fix Next, Tricky Store and SUSFS for KernelSU. I have tried 3 different checkers. The Play Integrity API Checker from Google Play, SPIC and Safety Net . I must say that Google Wallet works fine, but after adding the card, I need to use my bank app to validate the operation, and that's where it fails. Both API Checker and SafetyNet return Strong Integrity checked, but SPIC only returns device integrity (see pictures below). I think something isn't set properly, but I'm a noob and I don't know how to solve that. Has anyone ever encountered a situation like this? Any help is much appreciated.

After extensive research and fear of bricking my new toy, I realized that the only way to backup the ROM before attempting any changes or even rooting, since the manufacturer's website doesn't offer the firmware to download the boot.img, would be to use sunxi-tools (FEL mode on the Allwinner). Researching here, I saw that FEL mode only enables through the recovery mode, and it seems this device doesn't have a recovery mode because I don't see the options menu when I reboot, only Android lying down. Could someone please help me? https://preview.redd.it/questions-about-rom-backups-v0-852dczx2hlkf1.jpg Volume + or - does not open other options....

Rooting new cell phones like the Galaxy S or Z Fold, Flip, etc. is already being almost impossible from what I was told thanks to the Snapdragon processors and they will soon block the apks that are not signed and seriously... This has to stop, when Android did not exist there was not so much freedom when it came to customizing etc. and this is where Android came into action. An open source system based on Linux without so many restrictions and with incredible potential was lost... Android is already too restrictive to the point that even with root you can't access everything you want like the one set up by r/w for the job, do you understand? It's like having a master key and the door you want to open has a lock that only works with numbers (XD what a good example) not like in 2015, 2017, etc. where with root we could do anything. Have we reached this point? We need another alternative. At the end of the day Android is just a Linux distribution so... We need something new. Not an Android custom rom that still has restrictions but something really innovative, something like a new system without restrictions in its folders, fully modifiable and compatible with Android things like apks, etc. And I do know that a custom rom is easier to create and you can put some of those things in it, but don't you think that even if it is more difficult, wouldn't it be better to create a new system based on Linux like Android but that in that process more functions and compatibility with Android can be added? I mean, think about it, instead of basing ourselves on Android and making a custom rom, do we create a new operating system with everything we need and want and that is compatible with Android? Would it be a revolution, a giant step to finally get rid of the restrictive Android of recent years and be able to have what we wanted so much? In addition, could they add functions such as a native Linux command line, a native virtual machine, useful pre-installed applications and not all that garbage bloatware and a much better settings and customization section? And if all of that already exists, could you tell me what it's called so I can use it? Because Android is no longer what it was before, simply not. Things as simple as entering the data and obb folder can no longer be done without root or without using wireless debugging, and soon WE WILL NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO USE APKS WITHOUT AN AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE BY ANDROID this... It's too much. Please tell me if you know of anything like this or if there is anything we can do because it's already too much.",
