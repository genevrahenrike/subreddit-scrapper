From what I’ve learned you should aim for manta + butter around 19-24 mins depending on how your game is going (pulled from pro tracker), I have a few main build questions. After butterfly, my team often seems to need me to fight. What do you base your next decision off of? Aghs scepter seems great, but as a newer dusa player I don’t fully understand the spike of it. I guess I need to go to demo and test. Typically I’ve gone crystallis->skadi->daedalus-> aghs after butterfly. Can someone contextualize roughly how much value I’m getting out of this 4200 gold power spike in different scenarios? Last one ties into the scepter question. I see some pros go like yasha-> mael, finish mjolnir and manta, and then right into aghs. This build interests me a lot, since I’ve heard it brings a lot of teamfight damage. How much value does the aghs bring in this combo? I’ve heard that this build is good vs high armor, or illusion-heavy lineups. Would you take this build if your team just needs more teamfight damage early? Overall this hero seems like if you can play smart and pick into the right draft it’s kinda slow auto ggs, and that’s a great quality in a hero for climbing mmr. Help me out dusa nerds Bonus ninja edit: shard seems really strong too, how often do you actually purchase this item over pinging torm?",

I tried to make the list as possible to implement in average games as possible. Here's the list: Having a plan for the game Good players will always have a plan for the game, that includes laning stage, next five minutes and overall mid/late game plans, even if they evolve during the game 2. Prioritizing Objectives Map control, kills - are just tools to get the objectives 3. Creating tempo on the map High mmr players rotate a lot, you rarely see people stuck in a lane for a long time. Creating tempo makes your movement unpredictable 4. Playing around power spikes As soon as you have a powerspike, use it. As soon as enemies use theirs, and it's on cooldown - abuse that 5. Reading the map Having some information helps understanding the map, along with dota knowledge. You can predict what enemies will do with just snippets of info Full guide is in the video!",

      "content_preview": "Used to play him a lot a couple years ago as my pos3. Divine. I have a 66% winrate over 300 games. Its dropping, now. You could control the game quite a bit off an early lead. He still can, but his cooldowns got lengthened a TON and his mana pool is nonexistent, less juice to work with early. Okay, I can still snowball some games off a lead so its fine. My issue is, this guy doesn't have a lategame factor at all anymore? I've seen his changelogs over the past year. It seems he's at a point where his job is basically to take out supports. And that's it. You can snowball really hard but some games can still be lost because the enemy carry is stronger than my carry and I'll never be able to do something about that. Axe can always take out a carry in a pinch and overturn a hard game. NS doesn't have that line of play. Halberd isn't even an undispellable 5s miracle item that can be rushed in a pinch either. When you're really ahead NS feels great to play, but we're not here to talk about the free ones. If your team is behind, you can set the team up well and take out one sup, and that just might not be enough. NS doesn't have a comeback factor like other pos3s do where you kill a big core out of nowhere and win big. Its crazy. Past NS could scale quite a bit if he's playing well, and still be strong in rough games where your carry is not doing well. Now he's just an obligate phase echo blink bkb nullifier/halberd dork that has to stay relatively farmed at all stages of the game and somehow lose some games where its not enough. They nerfed NS so much. Am I wrong for thinking this.",

      "content_preview": "So I thought off 2 builds with cent with armlet. Both builds start with 3 branches and 3 gauntlets off strength and horsepower. You get wand then rush armlet. In build one you prioritize double edge and use your armlet to spam max lvl w on creeps waves. You stay under 500 hp but you are probably the fastest farmin hero on the map by far. But you need at least 5-10 minutes off space to farm. You itemize into heart/blink/shard. I feel like if you can get a7-9 minute armlet you can go into the jungle and come out with a armlet heart shard which makes you a complete monster at 15 minutes. But if you get your armlet to late you won't have enough space to use it to farm freely. On the other build you don't level double edge past level 1. You go armlet getting shard as soon as possible  into some combination off blink/vlads/sny/echo sabre. The idea is that you won't need heart if you don't deal tons off damage with your w to yourself, instead you pseudo heal with it as soon as you have shard. At 5 stacks you gain 75% str/base damage which hurts and makes your right clicks respectable and make yourself a big scary tank as you also gain 13 Armor from class+armlet. The major advantage off this build is that you don't need a heart which is probably one off the worst items in the game right now after the like 10 nerfs it got. Also hearts buildup is horrible, so you don't need to need yourself for the 6-10 minutes you farm for it. Both builds build an absolute late game unit. Any thoughts?",

Later it's going to be combined with the Scythe of Vyse's slow so the enemy gonna be ultra-slowed that perhaps Rod of Atos isn't necesary Or still the very fast speed and range of Rod of Atos' catch is unreplacable and just having Phylactery won't catch as many kills against competent people who are going to quickly escape if you don't use the very fast bind of Rod",

I would like to test it out so here is the question: Which neutral creeps are best to capture for maximizing early farm efficiency. I know that alpha Wolf provides quite good early dps with it's crit passive and troll shaman can spawn skeletons so you basically get a smaller WK bone guard farming tool however which other creeps could be very good for farming speed? Maybe the big satyr with it's big magic Ball dmg or the coconut creep that can throw small Hoodwink Q on camps? Edit: I've tried it a couple times already and holy shit it's just Midas with 1/3 of the cooldown lol.",

Pro players got really creative lately with creep dragging, but the base concept is quite simple - you get enemy wave into a safe position for your offlaner, so he doesn't have to suffer under enemy tower. In the video, I show two examples - of 9class and Ammar - doing it as Dire and Radiant, and I also show you one awkward creep split to look out for (and potentially abuse, just like pro players do). The good thing about creep dragging it's basically very simple and repeated movement, that once you learn, you can abuse every time you feel like you can't fix your lane by just using creep aggro or pulling.",

      "content_preview": "With TI approaching, as it's less than 2 weeks away from now, here's a quick update what has changed in the meta. Dominator is becoming more popular Lots of heroes started to buy this item, especially universal ones. I think we will see it more at TI - heroes like Spectre, Brewmaster or Faceless void benefit greatly from the item, as it fixes their issue - lack of natural ability to farm while not griefing your own game 2. Marci topping contest charts Thanks to this build, Marci has become a viable carry, getting into 4th highest contest rate in the tournament. She's viable as both carry and support now. 3. Shaman went down a lot - Ward changes Now that Shaman doesn't take Rosh that easily, his popularity went down a lot. I still think he's very strong and will be picked up at TI, especially by teams on the lower spectrum of the win propability 4. Pugna's 70% winrate Very solid hero, but nowhere near broken. However, he's got 70% winrate at Fissure, so that's something to look out for. 5. Other than that, it's close to being same There are few small changes, but meta is likely to be similar. We will see if TI develops some new strategies (like TI4 (?) Void + Skywrath). Video version: https://youtu.be/4S7vabMz9b0",

      "content_preview": "Starting to doubt it. Divine-ancient. Obviously, depends on the draft and such. But typically when your team is getting destroyed before min 25 (realistically expect this in 40% of games at least) then the opponents have more disables and nukes they can hold onto until you show up. This should probably be a bkb, but I'm still questioning if it is indeed right to. Thing is, 50% of games will have a good early game where you're off doing your thing pressuring towers and accelerating, while your team does somewhat a decent job creating space without feeding excessively. In those games, your 22-25  min butterfly is great. You turn up to a min 25 war with it, kill everyone and rosh. You'll hit a 30 min second item and win. Nobody can kill you and the game is free. Then there's the half where your team is getting destroyed senseless and the enemy carry comes online early, because your team doesn't know how to retreat until its too late. I show up at ~25 with good item timing anyways because I didn't feed, but a butterfly AM isn't the crutch people think it is. Your mates think you are coming to save the day and kill everyone. Butterfly doesn't do that in a bad game. You show up, wait for the big disables to go on CD and then you blink in to pop a support in the backline. You get out of there before the next wave of enemy disables comes off CD. Your team gets destroyed and the enemy carry comes out on top. You can do nothing about it so you go back to pressuring lanes while the enemy gets t3 or rosh. Whatever pressure you're applying at that point really isn't relevant and your team isn't wise enough make the best of it. At some point I wonder if I needed a bkb for that min 25 fight. Obviously, I lose the ability to pressure enemy objectives but in the games where the team is getting destroyed, morale is low, team misplays are rampant and I need more uptime in that fight to kill more than one guy. Demoralized people don't set up good fights for you most of the time and someone will always die for free before you even show up. This makes me wonder, if I identify a bad game should I actually make a bkb before the butterfly? The signs are there. You have 25 mins to figure out which teammates are dying for free in the same way repeatedly, so the enemy doesn't even waste stuns on them. Turning up to those types of fights with no bkb means those stuns are reserved for you. That's my thought.",

I suspect that he just scales less and he has to play like a brawler most of the time. But I need reasons past that. I have always thought of jugg as a hero that gets blink at some point to find the backline support and blow them up. If this is no longer the case then am I just a right clicker most of the time? Running at people just to ult feels bad. My understanding of this hero seems stuck in older patches. Teach me new jugg.",

      "content_preview": "**TL;DR** Looking for in-depth position 1 Wraith King advise on facets, itemization, and counters Background: Long time returner. Was Divine 5 - 5.9k MMR eight years ago. Have played less than 100 games the last eight years. Re-calibrated Archon 3. Find WK fun and easy to gain MMR with. Now Legend 3. **Facets** Is there ever a reason to pick Spectral? Or are there just reasons not to go Bone Guard…lol. I default to Bone Guard for its early game kill potential, tower push, and farming speed. My rule of thumb for picking Spectral is three or more heroes who can instantly kill skeletons with AOE. An offlaner that can clear them is even more of a reason to go Spectral. Earthshaker and Axe are specifically scary. NP can clear them with ultimate. I feel Spectral Blade really doesn't do much damage until late game combo'd with Mortal Strike. At that point, the enemy might as well be dead (single bloodthorn combo) anyway. Should I not focus a hero and instead try to spread the Spectral Curse on multiple heroes? That seems bad. Does your ability to farm in a game affect your decision? For instance, a high tempo draft from enemy team that you expect to try to teamfight and tower push early? On the other hand, what about a farm oriented/ more passive enemy team? Do your own teammates affect your facet decision? Maybe other greedy heroes on your team who you need to make a little space for? Does Tusk tag team work with skeletons? Beastmaster auras? Allies that buff Spectral? **Itemization** For some background, my default item build in a perfect game is Phase, Rad, Blink, Bloodthorn, Abyssal. My situational items are: Shard, Harpoon, Assualt Curiass, Nullifier, Armlet/Deso, etc… When do you NOT go radiance first? My thought process is: Are there any allied heroes that want to go Radiance? Mid Necro, Offlane Doom, Bristle, Abbadon, etc... Are there any heroes on the enemy team it is good against? TA, blink supports I can chase, etc... What else is Radiance good against? Based on my position 5 and enemy composition, can I even expect to farm a Radiance in a timely manner? If I buy nothing but Wand and Phase boots, can I win my lane? If I buy the aforementioned and two bracers, can I win my lane? If I buy Armlet, will it push out the offlaner out completely and do they have a jungle comeback mechanic? In other words, will early armlet completely fuck the offlaner? Is the lane unwinnable and should I just farm jungle at level 4 or 5? What are the situations/enemy composition you avoid Radiance on and what itemization change do you make? When do you go armlet or blink first item? Do you buy Mjölnir instead of or in addition to Radiance against PL? I have experimented with Harpoon and find it awesome some games and useless in others. Pros: The active harpoon destroys heroes with no escape ability and the component build up is nice. Cons: The double strike doesn't synergize well with Mortal Strike or Spectral and the stats are mediocre. Are there specific heroes to buy it against? If you decide to buy Radiance and Harpoon, do you still buy blink (before Harpoon, after, or not at all)? Am I missing any other item considerations? Please also give your opinion on: Treads? SnY? Soul Ring? Aghs? Midas? Etc… **Hero Counters** What heroes do you pick WK into and when would you never pick him? What about ally synergies? Laning phase vs. post-laning phase? Are the following hero counter assessments correct? Bad Match-up: Innate escape heroes: Mirana, AM, QOP, etc… Mana burn: PL, Diffusal buyers, Lion, etc… Stun, Slow, Kite Heroes: Drow, Viper, etc… Heroes who outfight you: Ursa, Troll, etc.. Good Match-up: Glass-cannons who die to a single jump with blink, stun, Bloodthorn. Enemy team compositions that have one big wombo combo that you can resurrect from and kill after. Enemy carries that take longer to come online than you do with Bone Guard/Radiance farming. Thanks for reading this far. **TL;DR** Looking for in-depth position 1 Wraith King advise on facets, itemization, and counters",

      "content_preview": "I've been trying to learn Kez recently and I believe I'm pretty solid in my laning and early to midgame pickoffs with my combos (for my rank, of course). However, once teamfights start happening, I feel like trying to use my burst combos becomes suicide. Enemy disablers wait for me to show before they throw RP/Call/Hex/Coil, and I have grapple on CD because I used it to get in range in the first place. I end up going in on a stun and killing one or two, but dying to followup and ending games with Huskar-type scores of like 15-10-7 or similar and spend a lot of time dead. Not good for a snowbally squishy core. Should I be poking from trees/distance with Echo Slash and Talon Toss until enemies have used their important spells? Or trying to cause chaos with Invis into a multi hero Echo Slash stun? How can I deal with Echo being on CD for so long until I can go back in? Should I only be picking Kez if my team has strong AoE control, good save, or good distraction heroes like Lifestealer? I'm also having some trouble with the build. Deso Aghs takes ~15-20m based on how many kills I got early. Then I usually feel like I need BKB and maybe Blink to really join teamfights. Octarine as an extension feels good, but Hex enables bursting people with quick escapes/disables more easily. Sometimes I need a Nullifier or Linken's as well, so slots become an issue. This also takes a while to come online and I soak up a lot of the farm on the map, so my other cores are weak and can't create much of a distraction for me to go in later in the fight. If my team needs me to fight early,I've tried an early fighting build with double Falcon Blade into an earlier Aghs which feels good early, but my farm and scaling definitely suffers. I'm in high Ancient to low Divine at the moment, although I usually play in a stack of low to mid Ancient average. I would seriously appreciate any advice! Sorry for the disjointed thoughts as I'm typing on my phone at work :)",

      "content_preview": "In an ideal world, you just stay disciplined and shove waves, force TP and then go back and take a 5v4. In an ideal world, your 3 goes in on the right target, your supp follows up, and your carry goes to cleanup with a well timed bkb. Play to the strength of your hero, don't hg too early, do rosh, take towers, do stuff and slowly gain mmr. So on and so on. The usual learndota/truedota tier gospel that makes you climb. I'm in divine and I'm stuck, but I get it. But of all those games, there are certainly many where optimal stuff like this can't happen, because its a 5 man game. Sometimes, your 3 has different ideas and is going on the wrong guy every time and dying. Sometimes your carry just decides its go time and blinks in on the only enemy that showed on the map, with zero information of the four other heroes. Sometimes you push out waves because its just not a good time to take a fight, but your other teammates decides to take a gamble and take a 4v5 very far away from you, and die. In these moments, you're on the clock to come up with something to make a suboptimal situation work out and its not telegraphed decisions. I feel like I am pretty decent so long as things are going as planned and promised. I win those games because the sequences are correct and I already know where my spells are going each fight. Conversely, I feel like I am pretty bad when people aren't working together but it feels like I am just not thinking fast enough to decide if I need to salvage the fight (and probably wipe) or just let the guy die and maybe he will wake up to his senses. Sometimes they just don't talk, but you trust them blindly to be good and you followup hoping for results. How do you make of stuff like this in climbing mmr? Long story short, sometimes being disciplined means you don't see the secondary line of play when someone does incredibly suboptimal plays, and I don't think fast enough to decide what to do.",

I covered it in the video above, but the main points are: Dominator is pretty comparable as a midas replacement. Cooldown to gold and XP ratio is quite similar, and Void always liked the midas. However, it gives him sustain to play alone and the dominated creep is actually pretty good at helping you farm faster. With tempo it provides, it allows you to push towers, something that Void never does in the early game. I also believe this is something that would work better in a pub game - as the amount of stability the item provides works better if you feel like you can't trust your teammates to create space.

I had gone basher anyway (right after orchid), knowing Puck would go Eul's, so it felt even more useless. Would you have upgraded it to Bloodthorn instead?",

I know the basic combos like 1. Coldsnap+forge spirit, 2. Atos+Chaos meteor+def.blast 3. Tornado+EPM but when I am in a fight, I get so overwhelemed that I don't know what to start and when to use which spells My question What combos should I be using at the start? assuming I am going for Atos.

Been seeing my boy Gandalf getting nerfed patch after patch, chipping slowly at his holy movement speed, talents & spells, shuffling again and again his spells, aghs and ult. Now in a pretty rough spot as support, he somehow still excels at midlane (61% wr over 233 matches on d2pt). I desperately want to play him again but, as a modest p4/5 player, god I hate playing anything core. What would it take to make him a viable support without making him crazy for midlane ? Buffing the blind on his W ? The heal on his first ? Add a new facet ? I sadly don't have the  answers. But I'd love to see and partake in some discussion about it, as it would fuel my copium-filled agenda, and help me push relevant narratives and arguments towards my not-so-in-love-with-kotl friend group. My sincerest thanks, may your beards grow longer.",
