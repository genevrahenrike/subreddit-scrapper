Now, the WiFi connected symbol shows up in my upper hand corner of the iPhone. My iPhone tries to get data from it and then I can’t access any data services. If I disable the WiFi connection, CarPlay turns off. The only way it works is if the iPhone prompts “the WiFi doesn’t seem to have internet, use cellular”? But that almost never shows up. Anyone been through this and fixed it? Already turned off my phone, my car, updated my phone, disconnected CarPlay on phone and car and reconnected…",

I have a possibly “stupid” question but since im new to DCT automatic transmissions and I have not found any relevant information on the internet regarding this i thought to ask here, maybe i can get some answers. When the car is decelerating, meaning im not pressing the gas acceleration pedal and I might be slowly braking i have observed that the car will drop its rpm to around idle rpm speed (800-900rpm) and it seems or feels like the transmission is disengaged. Im not sure what the correct term is but basically with a tester i checked im in 3rd gear, the rpm drops to 900rpm and the car is rolling while slowing down but it does not downshift. Its not jerky or anything, it just feels like the car is cruising in idle engine rpm. Is this a DCT thing or i should have a mechanic take a look at it. If i press acceleration pedal the car picks up the rpm and the car pulls so the whole thing is seamless but it did seem weird to me. Thanks in advance for replies and sorry if its a stupid question but im clueless about this.",

      "content_preview": "My wife and I leased a 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 on March 31. Within 3 months, the vehicle began displaying multiple warnings. Upon taking it to the dealer, we were informed that the wire harness was damaged, allegedly due to rodent activity, and that repairs would cost over $14,500. Hyundai's assumption that this occurred after we took delivery is questionable. We have no history of rodent issues at our residence or workplace. We feel it is highly possible that the damage occurred on the Hundai lot before we took delivery, and the system short was triggered by a heavy rainstorm that occurred the night before the warnings first appeared. Wherever the damage occurred, modern vehicles should be designed to minimize vulnerabilities to external factors, such as rodents. If rodents can easily get access to, and damage, critical wiring, this likely indicates a design flaw. Another issue is the use of soy-based wire coatings, which have long been known to attract rodents. Repair costs in excess of $14,000 for wiring damage are unreasonable and suggest poor mechanic accessibility and/or unnecessary complexity in design. Research online revealed that many other Ioniq 5 owners have reported similar problems. There is an ongoing class action lawsuit involving Hyundai and other automakers alleging that the use of soy-based or plant-derived wiring materials attracts rodents, causing significant damage and costly repairs. Hyundai therefore is well aware of this issue, and yet continues to sell cars with these flaws.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I own a 2014 Hyundai Sonata GLS 2.4L with about 147k miles. A few days ago, while driving at highway speed, the car suddenly lost all power. I tried restarting it while coasting, but it wouldn’t start. Luckily, traffic wasn’t heavy and I was able to pull over safely—otherwise it could have been a serious accident. I had the car towed to a local mechanic, and he told me it wasn’t cranking because of a bad starter. Since I’m not very knowledgeable about cars, I agreed to have it replaced just to see if it would start. After replacing the starter, the car did start briefly, but then stalled again. I’ve seen that others have reported similar issues. I called the Hyundai dealership here in St. Louis, and they told me to bring it in for an inspection. However, they said it would cost around $500 just for the inspection, and only if it turns out to be a recall-related issue would they refund me that amount. Has anyone else experienced this? Should I just go ahead and take it to the dealership and follow their process? Thanks in advance for any advice!",

Car started and drove fine several days after these things were addressed. Would appreciate some insight to some of you who have had to deal with this issue before. Now I'm back to square one. I noticed that on longer trips I don’t have issues starting it after shutting the car off, usually only on short trips. Could it possibly be the vent valve solenoid or a blown ignition or starter fuse? If not that then maybe it could also be a camshaft or crankshaft position sensor? Please help, thanks!",
