Went with Hugo since I really hate website design, and GitHub Pages has made the workflow easy. My goal was to high light main points: Terraform modules and automation Demonstrate core cloud architecture solutions AWS cost optimization stuff Some CI/CD pipelines I've built First time really putting myself out there as an independent consultant. Been doing enterprise work forever but the freelance/consulting world is new to me. Would love feedback on what works/doesn't work.

I‚Äôm looking for the most practical and structured course or crash course that can help me learn the essentials quickly and make me job-ready. I know DevOps covers a lot (Linux, Git, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud, Terraform, Monitoring, etc.), but I‚Äôm feeling a bit overwhelmed with where to start and which platform actually gives good, hands-on learning. For those who‚Äôve successfully transitioned or are working in DevOps: Which course(s) or platform (Udemy, KodeKloud, Coursera, YouTube, etc.) would you recommend? Is there a solid crash course / bootcamp that covers the basics to advanced with projects? How long did it take you to feel confident for interviews? Any guidance, roadmaps, or personal experience would be super helpful üôè Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hey folks, I‚Äôm a 2nd-year B.Tech student and I joined a startup 3 months ago as a DevOps intern. The stipend was just INR 22k/month (~$250/mon), which I knew was low, but I took the offer anyway because the company had a great culture, solid mentorship, and promised good exposure. Fast forward 3 months I‚Äôve literally worked on a dozen projects (it‚Äôs a SaaS company so things move fast), handled real production-level responsibilities, and according to multiple senior devs, my performance is already on par with their L2 DevOps engineers. I‚Äôve been working my ass off juggling academics and work, sometimes putting in 10‚Äì12 hour days to ship stuff. So I thought it was fair to ask for a raise. I wasn‚Äôt asking for a full-time salary ‚Äî just a fair stipend for the level of work I‚Äôm doing. I asked for INR 80k/mon (~$1000/mon), which is still very less than what full-timers at L2 make. HR came back with‚Ä¶ INR 30k. I was disappointed but decided to escalate it and spoke to my VP. He agreed that my work has been exceptional and initially sounded positive and said he would talk to HR. He got back to me later and said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done amazing work, no doubt. But company policy doesn‚Äôt allow full-time offers to interns. We have a strict 30k cap on intern stipends. That said, I want to hire you as an L2 right after you graduate.‚Äù And that‚Äôs it. Honestly, I‚Äôm broke. I left a previous internship where I was making INR 425/hour (~INR 70k/month with fewer hours), just because I believed this new company would value growth and reward performance. Now I‚Äôm stuck doing high-level work at 30k/month, with no real upside till graduation, which is still 2 years away. It just feels demotivating, financially and mentally, it‚Äôs starting to drain me.",

This is my second job ‚Äî my first company I stayed for 1 year, and my current company I‚Äôve been here for about a year as well. I know frequent switching doesn‚Äôt always look good, but here‚Äôs the situation: First company: Small startup. I joined as an intern and converted to full-time. Business went down badly, they started firing dev teams. In DevOps we were only 2 people, so we were relatively safe, but I didn‚Äôt want to risk my career, so I switched. Current company: Another startup. Initially I was hired as DevOps Engineer, and was assigned big responsibilities: Migrated 30+ microservices from ECS to EKS for better visibility/reliability Built CI/CD pipelines for Android & iOS apps from scratch (end-to-end publishing to Play Store & App Store) Optimized AWS cost (used right-sized Graviton instances, Karpenter, HPA for autoscaling, CloudFront for static content/js/css loading) The issue now: My org had acquired a product, but now they‚Äôre planning to sell it off to another vendor. Basically, stability is again uncertain, just like my previous company. So now I‚Äôm worried. I want to switch, but all my experience so far is only in startups. I feel I‚Äôve got solid hands-on exposure and end-to-end responsibilities, but I‚Äôm not sure how recruiters/companies will view my frequent switches (even though it wasn‚Äôt intentional). Any advice on how to approach this? Or tips on how to frame my experience better so I can land a more stable role? Appreciate any help üôè",

However, I did not pass the AWS Monitoring Challenge, which was surprising to me as it seemed like one of the easier sections. The task was to identify issues in AWS CloudWatch alarms, and while I found it straightforward, I ended up scoring 62/100, which was below the qualifying threshold.

I am based in Canada but from the UK, I am authorised to work in both places of course but ideally looking for something based in the states that would accept someone from Canada. Pretty flexible in terms of what I am looking for as I just need a change of environment right now. In terms of my skills, my main stack revolves around, AWS, Terragrunt, ArgoCD, python, containers and container orchestration based tools. CI/CD platforms, been involved in migration efforts, infrastructure management and building pipelines to name a few things. Very security focused, been involved in securing developer pipelines, creating lambda scripts to monitor and alert slack users with health checks and using tools such as renovate bot. Happy to send over my CV if anyone wants to connect with some potential offers and go into my skills in more detail. I am ideally looking for a good fresh new role I can start with a month in-between so I can have some downtime.",
