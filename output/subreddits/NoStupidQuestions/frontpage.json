      "content_preview": "FYI, I am actually 22m, but for this post/scenario, let’s say I’m 30m.So I (30m) have never been in a relationship, had sex, or anything like that. I’ve had my fair share of crushes, but I’ve always been too shy and afraid to ask anyone out due to a fear of being rejected. I have also had some toxic friends who always put my self esteem down which makes my confidence even more low. I also feel like there’s always someone better than me, and people I’ve tried to befriend in the past always end up randomly stop talking to me and talk to someone else instead, making me feel replaceable. I am now 30 years old and I’m afraid that no one is going to want to go out with me just because of my inexperience.I’ve heard people online here say that if you’re 30 and have never had any experience, than a lot of women are going to question you and consider being a virgin as a “Red Flag” as they don’t want to “Teach you” or they “want someone more experienced” or it “Raises questions and assumptions” (Which are likely not true in my case). All of this scares me and makes me feel the need to somehow lose my virginity before actually going out with someone real so I can say I’m at least a little “experienced” and no one will reject me due to that one factor. Some people also say that women see having never been in a relationship as a “Red Flag” as they might assume you’re “emotionally immature” or “just looking for sex” (Which I’m not btw). No one has to “teach me” anything first of all, I’d happily figure it out on my own if it meant not being alone forever. I’m just afraid and feel terrible about myself because of that because now I feel like a lot of women are going to not even give me my chance due to being inexperienced, and I really want to be open and honest with my future partner (If I’m lucky to ever have one) I don’t want to lie to her about my inexperience.Anyways, I try to be the friendliest person I could possibly be to people, I go above and beyond for people I care about, and I would like to think that I’m a likable person overall. (Most people I’m acquainted with think I’m a nice person) If that were true, would women in my age group immediately turn me down because of my “inexperience” or do you think a lot of women in my age group would be open to giving me a chance?Hearing this as a 22 year old (Everything I said above apart from being 30 does completely apply to me btw) makes me feel the need to get someone to take my virginity as fast as possible just so I don’t have to carry that red flag around with me anymore (Even if I have to pay for it) and women wouldn’t turn me down because of that. There would still potentially be the problem of being inexperienced relationship wise, I gotta figure out how to solve that one. I just really do not want to be single for the rest of my life, getting a good girlfriend, having a connection, someone who loves me (and I love her), and eventually getting married one day is one of the most important things to me (Possibly THE most important thing to me). I know I’m only 22, but time goes by faster than people think and I feel like I need to rush into a relationship as fast as possible before it’s too late. I don’t want to lie about it either, I want to be able to be open and honest about it to any future girlfriends I have, lying about it causes distrust in relationships from what I’ve heard, and I want to be open and honest about it as well.Anyways, I’ve been losing sleep over this lately. I would love to hear all of your feedback on this scenario/situation. If you’re a woman, I would love to hear your take on dating someone like me and possibly give me advice (Bonus points if you’re around 30 and dating a 30 year old who’s inexperienced like me), if you’re a guy I would also appreciate some advice. Thank you all in advance for your answers.",

I really know that my chances to get help may be small but I’m reaching out with last hope in my heart. After enduring years of mental abuse and control, I’ve finally found the courage to leave my marriage, for the sake of my children and myself. This decision was incredibly difficult, and nothing but easy. I believe it’s the only right thing to do towards a healthier and happier future for us.I’ve now find and secured an apartment for us, but as I start this new chapter, I find myself with nothing. My husband have all the power in his hand. For so many years, so many nights I had cried so hard and prayed to find just a little strength. Strength to not give up on this life and somehow manage to leave the relationship, that made me lost my self piece by piece and question my self-worth. I didn't have any plan, I just know it was now or never and my children need there mother. So this is me now realized that I need a lot of help to get back on my feet and provide a stable environment for my kids. So please tell me, how can I make this possible right now? I don't want to go back, I have to somehow make it. Is there a subreddit to ask for financial help with low karma? I really need help now, I cant handle this much longer. I believe in the kindness of people, and I’m hopeful that with your help, I can create a brighter future for me and my children. Reach out to me if you have any questions. With all my love❤",

How could these people be in business for so long and not own anything or control anything associated with their business?  The lenders just say \"you're done\", and they're done? Are all the small businesses actually just owned and controlled by banks for the profit of the ultra wealthy?  Is entrepreneur just another term for \"cog that feeds the machine\"?  That's depressingly on brand.  I feel like the knife edge our society is balanced on just got that much thinner because I read an article about a local brewery.  Please fill in the gaps for this ignorant fool.",
