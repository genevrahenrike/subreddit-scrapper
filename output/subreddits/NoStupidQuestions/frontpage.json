      "content_preview": "Like seriously, this dude just casually drops $1M+ on random charitable stuff all the time. Just saw he donated another massive amount recently and I'm genuinely confused about the economics here. Last month he donated $15M with some Kick streamers to buld wells. How does he get that money?I get that he makes bank from YouTube ads and sponsorships, but the math seems wild to me. How does someone afford to literally give away what seems like more money than most YouTubers even make?Is it like:His videos make SO much that donations are just a small % of revenue?Tax writeoffs make it financially smart somehow?The donation videos themselves make enough to cover the donations plus profit?He's got some other business empire I don't know about?I'm not trying to be cynical - genuinely curious about how this whole thing works financially. Like does giving away $1M somehow make him $2M through views/engagement?The scale just seems insane compared to other creators. Most YouTubers flex with expensive cars, this dude's out here casually solving people's debt and building wells in Africa like it's nothing.Anyone know the actual business model here? Is philanthropy just really good for the algorithm or what?",

Are they like US/Britain/Australia, where there are minor changes in vocabulary and relatively significant changes in accent, but it's not like there's a language barrier or anything?",

Can somebody explain the whole \"wearing a baseball cap at all times\" thing? I'd understand if it was really sunny here, but it isn't. And why indoors? I found myself in one of Dublin's best 5 star hotels today and the American tourists, male and female, were united by an apparent deeply-held fear of displaying their crowns in the bar.What's this all about? What are you hiding under there? Is this where you keep your freedom and inexpensive consumer goods? Has Tony Soprano taught you nothing? I'm genuinely not sure why this is such a thing.Edit: I've read every response, and I've appreciated and enjoyed all of them, thank you.After this extensive research, I can report that the reason so many American tourists in Dublin wear hats is......Because they want to.Eye-opening findings, I think you'll agree.Edit 2: Awww, it's been locked. Fun while it lasted, though, thanks all.",

I told him I went to class (I’m a university student), had a doctor’s appointment, and then went grocery shopping, did 4-5 hours of homework, which I thought was a pretty average day for a college student? He starts laughing at me and asking how I did “nothing all day.” He was shocked that I had “nothing to do.” Like… just cause I’m not currently working a 9-5 job, doesn’t mean I’m lazy?It’s like a reverse/new type of misogyny where men hate women for… being feminine? It used to be “stay in the kitchen” and now it’s “I hate that all they have to do is be in the kitchen 😡!” What sparks this?",

At first I thought this was a ridiculous level of paranoia, but I learned that analyzing a world leader’s poop to hypothesize about their health could lead to strategic advantage.I have several sub-questions about this practice, however the main question is:beyond Putin, how do we know this happens with other world leaders?Some secondary questions:What kind of training is given to the poop-vessel-bearers?Is this a transferable skill? Once you’ve done this once, if you’re looking for a new gig, do you mention that you are qualified for the responsibility having done it before?Is this only world/country leaders, or do asshole billionaire oligarchs do it too? Seems like the kind of thing they would do, honestly, since they’re so self-important.Are there circumstances where it is lower risk during international travel and no poop suitcase is needed?This is a serious question, I am curious because I really had no idea about this until the latest news cycle.",

I'm just genuinely curious why the LGBTQ+ community seems to be the last holdout of mask wearers.

      "content_preview": "So everybody I know irl (UK, Aus) cooks for the most part everyday. I’ve noticed a lot on social media people say “everyone should learn to cook”. Or people say they “wish they could cook” etc.But what does that exactly mean they do? Like how do people literally “not cook”? Surely you have to make food? Like pasta or rice dishes are literally water and boiling and 5 minutes to make a sauce.Also the main question really, when people “don’t cook” what do they do everyday, surely you can’t afford takeout every single day for life? Not to mention how unhealthy that can be.Anyone in this “I don’t cook” situation have an answer? How do you survive?",

I have traveled quite a bit, but mostly in Europe. I'm well aware of the American narrative of Universal Healthcare=Socialism=Bad and have spent countless hours debating that with friends and family. I guess I just haven't had to think too much about autocracies because my comparison of the US to other countries has always been what I hoped we could become, but now I'm having to compare in the context of what we are becoming.",

And like, I understand why she would make a note of the anxiety I guess, but what is the reason why she mentioned my toy? And why did she specifically mention that it was small?? I mean, it was, but why does the size of the stuffed animal matter?? It’s not like anything about the appointment would have really changed if I had brought a slightly larger one? She didn’t even acknowledge it during the appointment, and it wasn’t in the way or anything.I just can’t think of a reason why it’s relevant to my medical care to the point it needs to be written in my medical notes.",

Because if we assume that an arrangement could be struck with the hotel that you essentially occupy the same room and never give it up, and they agree to the 80/night rate forever, it would be 29,200 Euros a year. This includes a breakfast every day, cleaning, access to the gym, stuff like that. Do people do this? And do hotels ever agree to these types of arrangements?",

Not the pain you get from an injury or something, which is more a sharp intense pain, but just the normal level of pain that is in the background. You know, like tv static. The pain that just comes with living your life.He looked at me like I had two heads and said that he doesn't feel pain at all.Now I found this hard to believe. It feels to me it's impossible to be pain free. Like there's always something that hurts. Doesn't have the be the same thing at all times, but always something.I always figured that this is why people don't like sports or don't like doing chores. Because using your body just hurts to certain degree. And I figured some people are just better at dealing with it or ignoring it.",

I get that rarity and condition play a big role but it feels like there’s more to it than that. Is it mainly nostalgia driving the prices or is there an actual collectible market similar to art, stamps or coins where certain cards are legitimately seen as investments?It makes me wonder if pokemon cards will always hold value or if it’s just a trend that could crash eventually.
