I think eventually a neighbor complained to the city and something was done, but the poor dog literally barked all day seemingly without a break. I sort of know the owner; we wave at each other, her kids used to play with my kids.  They've had dogs before, and they're not assholes or anything. The dog seems cared for and loved.  Assuming there is nothing physically wrong with her, why did she bark all day?  Didn't she get tired?  Was she expecting something, or just barking?",

Can somebody explain the whole \"wearing a baseball cap at all times\" thing? I'd understand if it was really sunny here, but it isn't. And why indoors? I found myself in one of Dublin's best 5 star hotels today and the American tourists, male and female, were united by an apparent deeply-held fear of displaying their crowns in the bar. What's this all about? What are you hiding under there? Is this where you keep your freedom and inexpensive consumer goods? Has Tony Soprano taught you nothing? I'm genuinely not sure why this is such a thing. Edit: I've read every response, and I've appreciated and enjoyed all of them, thank you. After this extensive research, I can report that the reason so many American tourists in Dublin wear hats is... ... Because they want to. Eye-opening findings, I think you'll agree. Edit 2: Awww, it's been locked. Fun while it lasted, though, thanks all.",

At first I thought this was a ridiculous level of paranoia, but I learned that analyzing a world leader’s poop to hypothesize about their health could lead to strategic advantage. I have several sub-questions about this practice, however the main question is: beyond Putin, how do we know this happens with other world leaders? Some secondary questions: What kind of training is given to the poop-vessel-bearers? Is this a transferable skill? Once you’ve done this once, if you’re looking for a new gig, do you mention that you are qualified for the responsibility having done it before? Is this only world/country leaders, or do asshole billionaire oligarchs do it too? Seems like the kind of thing they would do, honestly, since they’re so self-important. Are there circumstances where it is lower risk during international travel and no poop suitcase is needed? This is a serious question, I am curious because I really had no idea about this until the latest news cycle.",

The tariff isn’t high enough for them to even consider moving manufacturing to the U.S. So instead they just pass the tariff price increase on to the consumer hurting us in the process. Gaming consoles are already expensive and sold at a thin margin. They gain Nothing and potentially face the risk of out pricing their consumers. It’s just extra money being paid with no gain for anyone in the process.",

      "content_preview": "Just got new job that pays pretty decent a few weeks ago after last job cut my hours a few months ago to just 12 hours a week when they promised full time because \"We accidentally hired too many people but you're all too good of workers so we don't want to fire anyone\". First pay from new job had to be used to catch up on important bills so nothing got cut off. I make too much to use any of the food assistance programs in my area, tried to ask if it was OK just untill I got my second pay check at the end of the week but apperntly I could have bought food instead of paying my power bill even though doing so would mean no way to cook food and would cause likely eviction as power being cut off is instant eviction under my lease. No I'm definitely not mad at their logic, even if I do understand it's because some people who don't need it take advantage of the food bank. Until Friday I have two big bags of oatmeal and a good sized bag of rice. I have LITERALLY NO MONEY LEFT AFTER PAYING BILLS. I'm technically still behind, I just paid enough to not get everything shut off, which was about 3/4 of what I owed. So no I can't buy any beans or chickpeas or anything either. Should I try to drink more water to help feel full? Should I focus more on eating the oatmeal or the rice? Ways to make it more interesting? (I do have some seasonings available to me, some soy sauce, some sugar, and I do have a bit of oil so I'll probably make fried rice some for sure. But I know I need fiber from the oats and just sweet oatmeal sounds gross.",

With few exceptions though, there are two groups I notice who still wear masks with some regularity - older folks (which totally makes sense, weakened immune systems and all that), and young queer folks. By this I mean people with progress flag buttons/patches/pins/shirts/hats usually paired with other social justice accessories, and, not to stereotype, but quite often also with unusual or brightly dyed hairstyles. I want to be clear, this isn't a judgement thing, or a criticism or anything. I'm just genuinely curious why the LGBTQ+ community seems to be the last holdout of mask wearers. I suppose some of it could be confirmation bias, but I'm very confident in calling this a trend. Not trying to debate anyone, just trying to understand!",

      "content_preview": "First off, I already know that the answer will probably be no, but I’m really anxious and I need reassurance from someone else. I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow to get a wart on my toe removed. I’ve had it for like three years and it’s gotten pretty bad - it hurts a lot and it’s started to spread to a couple of my other toes. I’m honestly really embarrassed that I neglected it for so long and let it get to this point, but I only recently started seeing a family doctor after not having one for years and I was so depressed for the last couple years that I didn’t even care that it was getting worse. I have pretty bad anxiety and I’m really dreading the appointment because I’m so scared that the doctor is going to judge me for waiting so long to get it treated or be annoyed that it’s more work for her than if I got it treated immediately. I’m not worried about the actual treatment because I had it done once several years ago and my pain tolerance is pretty high, I’m just so anxious about the social aspect. And it doesn’t help that I’m going alone - the last time I had a wart removed I was a teenager and my mom was there with me. It’s not really an option to bring anyone with me tomorrow unfortunately Edit - thank you guys for all the comments. I’m still anxious because that’s just how I am tbh but I feel better about it and I see how silly it is to be so worried about a wart when doctors see way worse/grosser things all the time",

Like pasta or rice dishes are literally water and boiling and 5 minutes to make a sauce. Also the main question really, when people “don’t cook” what do they do everyday, surely you can’t afford takeout every single day for life? Not to mention how unhealthy that can be. Anyone in this “I don’t cook” situation have an answer? How do you survive?",

I'm well aware of the American narrative of Universal Healthcare=Socialism=Bad and have spent countless hours debating that with friends and family. I guess I just haven't had to think too much about autocracies because my comparison of the US to other countries has always been what I hoped we could become, but now I'm having to compare in the context of what we are becoming.",

I’ve been giving him a ride this past week because he always seems to ask me right when I’m heading towards my car. I don’t wanna sound messed up or anything so I say \"hell yeah, why not\" At first I didn’t mind because I thought it was just for one day. But he’s been asking me every single work day to take him home. it’s honesty starting to feel like a hassle. It feels like he expects me to take him home everyday which we only work four days out of the week.  And the worst part is that he doesn’t offer me gas money!  Don’t get me wrong he’s a cool dude but at the same time, I love driving by myself and going the long way home. plus he’s one of those people who can’t seem to stop talking. Okay so I consider myself a man of little words and I enjoy quiet time and consider myself an introvert. He on the other hand, likes to talk a lot! especially about random stuff that I have no interest in knowing. He lives like 10 minutes away from me which he claims is right just down the street but it really isn’t. I’ve been thinking of asking him for 15 or 20 bucks for the four days but I don’t know… what do you guys think? Today, I’m at work writing this and he’s at his lunch.. I’m pretty sure he’s going to ask me last sec if I mind taking him home which I understand because we both get off late at night. Still, I don’t want this to be a constant thing with him without any compensation, Which it already has… Also, Thank you for taking your time in reading my post and responding🙏",

Even if I tell myself I’ll watch one and stop as soon as the credits roll I find myself clicking the next one. Is this just me lacking self control or is this how TV is meant to be consumed now?",
