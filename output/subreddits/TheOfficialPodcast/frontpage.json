Jordan will listen to a 10 minute educational tangent and say ‚Äúright, but have you ever thought selling guns to your enemy was a stupid fucking idea?‚Äù Listening to the episode again, it was such a good episode. Hearing Aiden talk about all sorts of historical facts, which I was super into. Then Jordan randomly blurt in the most logical, yet ridiculous thing to make me laugh. It kinda reminds me of Wendigoon and Oompaville. Granted, I just didn‚Äôt find Oompa funny at all, personally. Jordan actually cracks me up",

No hate to either since it‚Äôs not my podcast, but as a listener, I enjoy the banter yall have about how shitty it was to sit through xyz or how xyz was surprisingly good and the reasons why. Kaya going on about sonic was legitimately fun to listen to. Jackson making the presentation was great and interesting. Andrew making the Pok√©mon team was also fun since he took time to put it together and explain everything about it. Idk who else agrees with me on this but the challenges have been very refreshing.",

      "content_preview": "Long time listener here, this has been bugging me for a while but it only really hit me while showering tonight. Could the Official Boys defeat Ivar the Boneless (family, courtiers, army, allies combined) at the peak of his carrier (around ~900 a.d.). Here are some of the reasons I think are in support of the guys: Jackson: He likes Star Wars which means he has a high IQ. He'd probably be able to man the ship's wheel with inspiration from Hans Olo. He knows Mutahar who is Muslim I think. He could fabricate a claim on Ivar's realm and invite the Abassyd dynasty (who ruled a high area in 900 a.d.!) to a holy war, granting them an army of troops. All he must do is keep Mutahar's obedience high with frequent gifts to keep him in line. Andrew: He has sunglasses to hide his homophobia, which makes it easier to sea at see during daytime. He could alert the other two of Ivar's ships ahead of time. He is American which means he owns a gun. If he re-engineers how bullets are made he could shoot Ivar the Boneless, which would decrease his moral. However, Mutahar's troops might be angered if guns are not halal. Andrew is tall and manly and a huge Marvel fan, which means he can take inspiration from Batman and run fast. Carl: He hates diabetic women and has advantage at attack roles against them. If they can mail Ivar's wife the food that Jackson once sent from Australia she might eat and become diabetes at which point Cail could kill her to cause Ivar distress, possibly making it harder for him to command his army. He likes to talk about the boogie man and could scare the vikings who are known to be deeply religious. He is Turkish which lets Cale unlock all those dumb Turkish dramas my wife watches on Channel 3, making the wives of the enemy army be annoying and lower the enemy morale. All in all I await power-scalers to weigh in on the topic, but I think I presented a pretty strong case. I believe the three Official Boys could defeat Ivar the Boneless (in 900 a.d.).",

      "content_preview": "I get the criticisms about Star Wars. It's always goofy even in the Lucas era but how can they not understand the Force one of the most iconic aspects of the franchise. Hearing Andrew and Kaya not understanding the concept behind light side and dark side is frustrating to hear. The force has both kinds of energies. One that is obviously good energy which is life, compassion, etc. While dark side is death, hate, etc. What makes the concept so interesting is that anyone is prone to the negative energy. Once you're part of that spectrum you could tip to the bad side just like how you could lose your temper from miniscule things in real life or give in to guilty pleasures that you know are bad for you. Jedi are seen as mystical space wizard warriors because they managed to hold off these temptations for so long while keeping balance at the same time. Jedi demand strong willed people for their cause which is why the order didn't feel comfortable taking in Anakin. They claim they watched these movies but don't understand why Anakin was a ticking time bomb the whole time.",
