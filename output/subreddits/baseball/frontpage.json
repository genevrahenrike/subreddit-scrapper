      "content_preview": "The record forfewest qualified batters hitting .300 or higher, 6 batters, was set in the infamous \"year of the pitcher\" in 1968. After that season they lowered the mound and shrunk the strike zone. Since then, we've been safely above that mark, year after year, until last year, whenwe just barely scraped by with 7. For 2025, depending on how the final month goes, we realistically could end up with anywhere between 2 and 10.I've made areal-time leaderboardto track this all the way until the end of the season. But here is a brief description of all the key players involved and what they need to do:No doubters (1):Aaron Judge- Qualified, BA sitting at .323 currently, needs to bat ~.160 for the rest of the season to stay above .300, which would just about match the worst slump he has ever had in his career. I think we are safe on this one. Also batted over .300 last year (and 2022), so he is really doing some valuable work keeping the concept of a .300 batter afloat in the modern MLB.Very likely (1):Bo Bichette- Qualified, BA sitting at .307, needs to bat ~.243 the rest of the season. He's had worst slumps this season a couple of times, but not likely, especially given he has themost hits by a decent margin since the all-star break.Likely (1):Jacob Wilson- Not qualified (needs 59 more PAs), BA sitting at .315, needs to bat around ~.220 the rest of the seasonandplay in ~15 more games. Has played in 10/11 games since coming back from the IL, his batting should take care of itself, he just needs to stay healthy.Toss Up (6):The important thing to note about these toss-ups is that your BA goes up roughly 1.5 points with a hit, and down by 0.5 for at bats that don't end in a hit. So anybody within a few points of .300 can easily get there with one good game, and easily fall below it with a couple of bad games. One thing working in our favor here is that batters want to finish the season at .300 or higher (since 2000,batters have been over 4x more likelyto finish the season at .300 vs .299), so we can assume players will strategically be pulled/rested for the final game(s) to lock in the .300 batting average, if possible. On the margin that could get us another player or two above .300, and this season we need all the help we can get!George Springer- NQ (needs 15 more PAs), BA sitting at .307, needs to bat around ~.263 the rest of the season. Never finished a season over .300 in his career so I imagine he will be extra motivated to finish the season strong, especially after last season when he had career lows in BA and OBP.Jeremy Pena- NQ (needs 25 PAs), BA .306. Needs to hit ~.263. Has played in 28 out of the last 30 games so should not have a problem hitting qualification.Trea Turner- Qualified, BA .302. Needs to hit ~.282. Has hit over .300 3 different times in his career (with one batting title) so he is not a stranger to the club.Sal Frelick- Qualified, BA .298. Needs to hit ~.309.Freddie Freeman- Qualified, BA .297. Needs to hit ~.314.Leads active players with 8 qualified seasons batting above .300. Would join notable players like Shoeless Joe Jackson, Mickey Mantle and A-Rod if he can get to 9.Bobby Witt Jr.- Qualified, BA .295. Needs to hit ~.330. Won the batting title last year.Already qualified, just need to get hot (4):Maikel Garcia- Qualified, BA .294. Needs to hit ~.334.Yandy Diaz- Qualified, BA .294. Needs to hit ~.336. Won batting title in 2023.Vlad Jr- Qualified, BA .293. Needs to hit ~.341. Batted over .300 last year and in 2021.Brice Turang- Qualified, BA .291. Needs to hit ~.353Long shots (2):Ramon Laureano- NQ (needs 87 more PAs), BA .299. In the Padres previous 22 games, he's played all 22 with 85 PAs and a .346 batting average. If he plays all 22 of the final Padre games, can manage a .300 batting average and squeeze in 87 PAs, then he'll just barely have himself a qualified .300 season. The last 22 games include 7 against the Rockies, who have by far the worst team ERA this season, so that could help.Alejandro Kirk- NQ (needs 61 more PAs), BA .296. In his team's last 22 games, he's had 19 appearances and 72 PAs, but batting under .300. In order to meet qualification he'd need to play ~17-19 out of the 22 remaining games, and also bat ~.316 to get himself back over .300. Possible, but both metrics are probably unlikely.Really long shots (1):Will Smith- NQ (needs 70 more PAs), BA .296. Everything needs to go perfect for him to even reach 70 PAs by the end of the season, and even if he does, he's been batting under .200 in the last month, so he's unlikely to get himself back up to .300. But it could happen.-----Note: For estimates about target batting average for the remainder of the season, I calculated it based on a theoretical 80 additional at-bats. Obviously the actual number will be higher or lower depending on how many games each player is in, where they are in the batting order and how long each game goes, but it should be a decent ballpark estimate.",

If the Mariners win 1 the Mariners will have at least 74 wins. If the Royals sweep the Royals will have at least 74 wins.With the lack of a game 163 the Mariners (5-1 vs White Sox) and Royals (10-3 vs White Sox) hold tiebreakers. The only AL team the White Sox have a winning record (could go 5-1) against is the Rays. It won't be enough in a 3+-way tie with the Royals. If they tie 3-way with the Mariners/Rays they could be 6-6 against them. The Mariners and Rays went 3-3 vs each other so they would also be 6-6 H2H. In that case the next tiebreaker is division record despite being in different divisions.The White Sox are 15-30 vs the Central (22-30 at best) while Mariners have a 27-18 record vs the West (will be 27-25 at worst). Since only 1 spot is open the Rays division record doesn't matter.",
