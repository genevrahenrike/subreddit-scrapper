      "content_preview": "The White Sox (50-88) have a maximum record of 74-88. Current AL 6 seed Mariners have 73 wins and tiebreaker over White Sox. Then, assuming the Mariners lose out, that’s 3 additional wins for the 70-win Royals, who also have the tiebreaker over the White Sox, meaning they must lose out as well. That gives the Guardians 4 extra wins to put them at 72 wins in this scenario, tied with the Rangers. However, the Guardians and Rangers play a three game series on the final weekend of the season, which means that somebody must hit 74 wins. Both the Guardians and Rangers have the tiebreaker over the White Sox, who can finish with 74 wins at best. Since that is for the 6 seed, the White Sox have no other playoff seed available, and thus will sit out the playoffs this year. Had the Rangers LOST to the Diamondbacks today, the White Sox still had an avenue into the playoffs entering tomorrow: the scenario involves passing the Rangers, Mariners, and Royals on record and involves a 5-way tiebreaker between them, the Angels, Twins, Guardians, and Rays that the White Sox would win on head to head win %.",
