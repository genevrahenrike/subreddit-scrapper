      "content_preview": "Pretty much i dont live in the uk but, apparently there's this thing called Notting Hill carnival in the UK. Which is supposed to be a festival by carribean immigrants to try and replicate carnival. But apparently it's pretty much synonymous with violence and riots, apparently there were over 500 arrests. That was just this year but apparently it happens every year. (Important to note that at least in trinidad, crime rate does go up during carnival). Which is a shame, as it is one of the cultural things I think we should be proud of, yet it's seen as negative by the world, and even many within our countries. And I can't blame them if it always leads to violence. I currently live in Canada, although I really hope ill be able to move back to the carribean soon, but even here (in certain cities like Toronto, not the one I'm in) the \"hood\" consists of a large chunk of carribean diaspora as well. Again this all makes me pretty sad. Unfortunate that so much negativity surrounds us currently. This along with high crime rates and unemployment at home, really demoralising for me.",

Suffice to say, the man's body of work is heavily underrated and I was amazed I havent heard of him before. But I was curious for most of the English speaking Caribbean practicing Obeah is frowned on so I was wanted to hear from the Bahamians how I'd he viewed back home.

My wife and I are both Catholics but she’s more in depth when it comes to praying to saints I just keep it basic and pray to God alone. Anyways we tend to talk about these saints and how Catholicism is practiced in Haiti and basically what each saints purpose is. She told me a lot about St Anne and how she has a close bond with her. Even at some point claiming she has full blown conversations with these saints in her dreams and has extreme unusually sometimes symbolic vivid dreams of them. When she told me at first I just shrugged it off and thought to myself it’s not real, didn’t really take it serious but just told her it was interesting. A few nights ago, I have a dream and in this dream we’re in Haiti, walking down the middle of a wide street with buildings everywhere and the mountains. I turn to her and say “So this is Petion ville?” And we hold hands. Suddenly I feel a presence behind me and turn around and see a old granny looking dark black skinned women walking with a geriatric limp carrying what looks like a small basket by her hip in a blue dress and her head covered, facing away from me walking away from us across the street. The strange thing was this individual never showed their face or spoke to me. When I woke up she was laying on my chest and I immediately told her what happened. She got up when I said I saw a women in a blue dress. She said that’s St Anne. She immediately mimicked the walk and asked if she was dark and if she carried something at her hip, I was absolutely freaked out. This has never happened before in my life where I have a dream of something that someone tells me about without going in depth but when I describe what I saw they confirm it’s the same thing they see.",

I always hear about Americans (white Americans in particular) say they want to move to the islands because it's cheaper than America.

It's been an ongoing issue here and it doesn't seem it's going to end anytime soon, so with the influx of gentrification here; would gentrification in the islands increase as more Americans move out of the country? I've seen talks about it with Puerto Ricans and people gentrifying their island, and Jamaica's private beach issues affecting the locals (this example isn't necessarily gentrification but i feel it exposes a bigger problem overall).

Maybe it was too high, too low, or just didn’t match how that issue is talked about publicly? For me here in Grenada 🇬🇩, it's grounding to see the largest line item in our 2025 Budget going toward Employee Compensation. This means the majority of our public funds are circulating through the hands of teachers, nurses, officers, clerks - the real people who keep the state running day to day. It’s not perfect, but it’s a signal: our government is still investing most heavily in its human infrastructure.

My sister and me signed in for voluntary work (donkey sanctuary) on Antigua starting in December. My sister will directly take a plane from Germany (we are Germans) to Antigua. As I am already in the Caribbean by then I would take that shorter way. I already searched for flights and couldn’t find any direct connection between Panama,… and Antigua. Flights usually had layovers in Miami, Puerto Rico or Barbados and where out of my budget. I also couldn’t find any boat connection. What I heard of however was that it was possible to help as a crew member on sailing boats. But I wasn’t successful in finding someone who is going for this route. I would definitely be open to this idea and I‘d be willing to work. So I wanted to ask you if you have any experience or further ideas on how I could get to Antigua.",

      "content_preview": "I grew up in a blended Guyanese/Trini household, so many of the meals we had were Guyanese in origin, but we also regularly ate classic local dishes. Some of the most frequently eaten foods in our home included: Pelau – This was a quick and easy staple that made an appearance almost every week or every other week. Rice with peas or beans and meat – Probably the most commonly eaten meal. Variations included lentils, red beans, black beans, or even baked beans served with meat that was stewed, baked, or fried. Curried meats – Served with either rice or roti, depending on the day or occasion. Cook up rice – The Guyanese version of pelau, which we had fairly often as well. Guyanese style chow mein - This is so commonly eaten that I didn't realize Chow mein was Chinese in origin until I was like 9 lol. Split pea soup – My mother always seemed to make this on the hottest Saturdays of the year. Pasta with meat sauce – A simple go to meal, especially on weekdays. Sunday dishes – These usually included more elaborate meals like lasagna, potato pie, or macaroni pie. Many other dishes like potato salad and fired rice were normally also made on this day. Leafy green vegetables – We regularly ate greens like spinach and pak choi (bok choy). School lunches – These were usually a variety of different sandwiches. My mother seemed to have fun coming up with new ways to make them. Fried fish – A staple for many, but I couldn’t eat it due to a fish allergy. Ground provisions – Things like dasheen, cassava, sweet potatoes, eddoes, etc., often accompanied by stewed meats or served as part of a hearty meal. Breakfast – Interestingly, my siblings and I almost always had North American style breakfasts: eggs, bacon, pancakes, waffles, cereal, etc. Local breakfast foods never really appealed to us for some reason, though my parents often ate them. On occasion my mother would make local sweets or snacks such as milk fudge, cheese straws, guava cheese, red mango etc. She'd also make desserts of 'foreign' origin like cupcakes, red velvet cake and chocolate chip cookies. Indian sweets like Kurma, Gulab Jamun and barfi were eaten pretty frequently as well but these were mostly bought. There were definitely other dishes in the mix, but these were the ones that showed up most consistently on our table. My diet has honestly remained pretty much the same except I don't eat spinach or pak choi anymore as I always HATED them. What are some things that you grew up eating?",

      "content_preview": "So I'm aware that Dominica and St Lucia adopted English as the official language, with French Creole remaining the traditional language. I've seen loose rumours, however, of a language shift taking place, with more younger people being more comfortable with English whilst the older folk primarily stick to Creole. Could anyone please shed some light on how much truth this has to it, as I'm genuinely curious? For comparison, I know Guadeloupeans and Martinicans are usually on a spectrum between French and French Creole, but when the official language is an entirely different one (English) the question becomes more interesting.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I’m working on a project for Caribbean creatives, including artists, photographers, musicians, designers, and more. I've realized that the most challenging part isn't creating the platform itself; it's understanding what people actually need. From those in affluent areas to those with limited resources, everyone talks about \"collaboration,\" but when money becomes involved, someone often feels it's unfair, and greed can surface. So, I’d like to ask: What do creatives really need to succeed and feel supported? If you could design the ideal space or platform for creative individuals, what features would it include? How can communities remain fair and supportive, even when opportunities and money are in play? I'm reaching out because I want to learn from the community first, rather than just build something without understanding your needs. Any thoughts, frustrations, or ideas you have would be greatly appreciated. – Jason",
