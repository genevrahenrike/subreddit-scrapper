      "content_preview": "by Eladrin Read this post on the Paradox forums ! | Dev replies here ! Hi everyone! The 4.0.23 update went live today with the following changes and improvements - thank you for your bug reports and feedback, which helped us generate most of this list of fixes: 4.0.23 Release Notes Balance Ion Cannon reactors now have more power output. Auto-designed ones should now be less likely to run out of power for the main armament. Auto-modding traits will now scale to 100% efficiency even if a pop group is assigned to multiple jobs. Bugfix Fixed an issue with job assignment not being able to fill all jobs on a planet properly. This was most visible for Virtuality Fixed Necrophage secondary species refusing to work any Worker jobs on game start Fixed necrophage purge sometimes does not generate pops. Fixed Agrarian Villages disappearing on wet worlds for non-angler empires Fix Planet view job types tooltips being wildly incorrect Jobs that require non-slaves should now actually enforce that limitation Several space fauna weapons are now correctly tagged as space fauna weapons Fixed being unable to fire the Devolution Beam Capturing Tiyanki in your Gravity Snare will no longer make the galactic community mad at you for hunting them. You are just putting them in a nice protected enclosure. Effects that create a pop group will now correctly generate a tooltip entry Completing the Clone Potential special project will no longer block Clone Army empires from undertaking non-Cloning ascension paths. Prethoryn Scourge now purges pops on planets they occupy Damn the Consequences now explains what it means to damn the consequences Fixed multiple broken text icons in non-English languages Head of Education can now correctly be filled by both Scientists and Officials Fixed an issue that caused the Distribute Luxury Resources decision cost to cap out very early. Fixes some country map colors being white upon loading of the savegame Fixed Corporate angler councilors being a tenth as powerful as they should have been. Fixed automation building not having upkeep, or being able to build two in a single district under some circumstances Stability Fix to a relatively common crash related to the toast notification manager We’re going to monitor stability over the weekend, and the Custodians of the core Stellaris team will continue focusing on improving the base game. Breaching the Shroud​ Reality is only one thread in a vast, trembling web. In Shadows of the Shroud , empires reach beyond the material realm, attuning to ancient powers and bargaining with entities that exist beyond time. Psionic Auras ripple outward, warping systems and reshaping destinies. While the Mindwardens wage silent war against psionic corruption, the Shroud Patrons gather, their gifts as lavish as their demands. The deeper one delves, the harder it is to return. Shadows of the Shroud is a Major Expansion that completes our “Arc of Ascension” trilogy with a comprehensive remastering of Psionic Ascension. We tapped Abrakam for help with this one after their fantastic work on The Grand Archive and Astral Planes. They’ve been working hand-in-hand with us for over a year on this release. This kind of partnership lets us keep several development tracks running simultaneously, so while Abrakam brought their strengths to the new expansion, our internal teams could stay focused on updating the base game, addressing community feedback, and work on long-standing issues. When we first sat down to discuss the Shroud, we challenged Abrakam to broaden the horizons of Psionic Ascension and The End of the Cycle, reading deeper into the tea leaves already there and channeling whole new visions of thematic content. Their task was to open our third eye to fresh possibilities and project new mysteries into the minds of players willing to pierce the veil. Over the next few weeks we’ll reveal more about Shroud exploration, the new Ascension Situation, new paths through the Shroud, go over how you influence your relationships with Shroud entities, introduce some Minor Patrons, and see what’s in store for Gestalts in this expansion. At this time, we do not yet have a date to announce for Shadows of the Shroud and the 4.1 release. A piece of Concept Art from each of the Two Shipsets All Will Be Revealed​ We’ll be switching to twice a week dev diaries with the following planned schedule: Dev Diary Schedule Sept 2 Shadows of the Shroud Sept 4 Psionic Ascension and Delving into the Shroud Sept 9 Entities of the Shroud and Psionic Auras Sept 11 Mindwardens and Machines Sept 16 THE END IS NEAR Sept 18 [THE RECKONING HAS PREVENTED OUR TELEPATHS FROM DIVINING THE TOPIC OF THIS DEV DIARY] It has been foreseen: Our next dev diary will be next Tuesday, at 15:00 CEST.",

      "content_preview": "Habitats are worse than a normal planet at everything, even for Void Dwellers Void Dweller is my favourite playstyle, but it's just not good at the moment. I've done a couple of comparisons of somewhat (lazily) optimized late game habitats and planets. The tech tier (with cosmogenesis buildings) I'm testing at generally favours habitats in basic resource production and planets in research. Overall cosmogenesis buildings are comparatively better for habitats than for planets, so keep that in mind. The species is nothing special, they have the Voidborne perk but not the Void Dweller trait. Without further ado, here is my case for underpowered habitats and some suggested changes. 1. They are worse at basic resources Unlike normal planets habitats don't have a resource specialisation district for their urban district, so the habitats miss out on the efficiency boost of workers. Habitats are also limited by the system they're placed in for the number of possible energy/mineral/research districts and unlike normal planets they can't increase the number of these slots with buildings such as mineral extraction grid which increases the max mining districts. 7.5k Miners in a habitat with an arc furnace to increase the max number of mining districts. I'm not sure if you're supposed to be able to build research support slots in the city zones, but right now you can and it's the only way to make this somewhat comp 2.6k miners with a mining focused orbital ring producing slightly more than the habitat. 2. They are arguably worse at research They don't have research districts in the top row and are thus limited to archives specialisation which is a research/unity split. They also can't convert their mining and reactor districts to research support so they can't put the specialisation buildings in those slots, giving habitats fewer building slots to put research related buildings in. Unless they have a research deposit in which case the habitas can be specialised somewhat. Unlike a normal engineering research district however the research specialisation gives 45 of each engineering type, and then additional 150 of the specialisation. Research Planet producing 4.7k Research with 19k researchers Recently however, it seems that you can build research support districts in the top row and thus make your physicists, engineers or biologists produce more research. But you can only to this at an exorbitant cost of +2.5 energy/mineral/food upkeep for the specialised pop for a measly 75 specialised researchers and +10% researcher output. Seeing as you can't reduce the researcher upkeep with the habitat designation, this gets ridiculously expensive, especially seing as that's the only way to further increase the number of researchers. If there was a good way for habitats to produce basic resources this would be somewhat acceptable Research Habitat producing 4.7k research with 14k researchers and a 3k energy defecit A research habitat reliant on support zones requires at least one specialised Generator station (which are phenomenally less efficient than a planet). Generator Habitat producing 3.2k energy with 8k technicians 3. They are worse at producing alloys and consumer goods Alloy Habitat producing 1k Alloys with 10k Metallurgists Habitat district specialisations are better than planetary ones, where each zone gives 150 metallurgists instead of 100 which you get on the planet. Alloy Planet with orbital ring producing 1.1k Alloys with 9k Metallurgists However, what ultimately makes planets superior is the orbital ring which makes the jobs more efficient. Trade habitats are are also inferior to trade planets, also due to orbital rings. 4. Inherent weaknesses of habitats Habitats can't really be improved once constructed, they are their own final form. Normal planets can be improved with orbital rings, mastery of nature decisions and can have buffs from planetary deposits and features. Habitats trade that for the ability of being constructed. Planets can also be improved to ecumenopolises for individualist empires and, the even more broken, machine or hive worlds for gestalts which can easily specialise planets to produce many habitats worth of resources . It's perfectly reasonable that habitats are worse than planets for normal empires without the voidborne perk. For normal empires habitats should supplement your economy with trade/fortress/storage habitats. But for Void Dwellers habitats should be strictly better than planets, if not as poweful as ecus/hive/machine worlds. 5. Suggested changes and boosts A short term fix would be to give habitats access to basic resource- and research specialisation districts so they can be competetive with normal planets for basic reseources and research. They should also be given access to the max district increase buildings. Long term I'd love for Void Dwellers access to a new \"Void Arcologies\" perk with the same requirements as Arcology Project (or maybe Citadels and Advanced Space Habitation tech) which will double the effects of the void dweller trait (much like hydrocentic for the Aquatic trait) and uncap and unlock all district specialisations to essentially treat habitats like budget machine worlds. This would, in terms of power, put habitats somewhere between normal planets and ecus/hive/machine worlds (which can be further improved with orbital rings). This would make void dwellers slightly better at producing basic resource and slightly worse at producing advanced resources (due to no ecus) compared to a planet based empire. TL;DR: after 4.0, Habitats are now way weaker than planets in almost every regard and should be buffed/changed.",

      "content_preview": "TL;DR: The upcoming Psionic Ascension rework, a core gameplay pillar, is being outsourced to Abrakam (devs of Astral Planes). Given that their past DLCs have been mechanically simple, we need Paradox to guarantee they will step in and fix/improve this DLC if it doesn't meet the high standard set by the in-house Genetic and Mechanical reworks. Hey everyone, I wanted to bring more attention to a detail from the latest Dev Diary that feels incredibly important for the future of the game. Paradox has confirmed the Psionic Ascension DLC is being developed by an external studio, Abrakam the creators of Astral Planes and Grand Archive. This is, to my knowledge, the first time a core gameplay feature has been outsourced. The reworks for Genetic and Mechanical Ascension were absolute home runs, that were developed internally. They added incredible depth and flavor. It feels only fair that players who love Psionics get that same level of quality. Let's be clear, I'm not saying Abrakam is a bad studio. However, their track record for deep, mechanical gameplay is questionable. Their main titles, Roguebook and Faeria, are card games. Roguebook, in my opinion, was a fairly uninspired entry in its genre and neither game has much overlap with what stellaris is trying to do. Their experience from those games doesn't really translate to 4x. Their Stellaris DLCs (Astral Planes, Grand Archive) have great writing and art, but their mechanics are often seen as shallow or lacking impact. Many of us enjoyed them as optional flavor, but they aren't deep gameplay systems. Unlike Astral Planes or Cosmic Storms, you can't just \"turn off\" the Psionic rework without feeling like you're missing a fundamental piece of the game. This completes the trifecta of ascension paths. It’s the first \"non-optional\" gameplay DLC to be outsourced, and it's being handed to a team whose strength is not in complex game mechanics. This raises some serious questions for Paradox: Why was this core pillar of the game outsourced, especially when the internal team did such a fantastic job on the other two? What is Paradox's quality control and review process for Abrakam's work? Are they aware of the community's mixed feedback on the mechanical depth of previous Abrakam DLCs? Most importantly: If this DLC doesn't land well with the community, is there any guarantee that the internal Paradox team will step in to rework or improve it to the standard of the other ascensions? So far, we've only seen Paradox nerf outsourced content (like Cosmic Storms and Astral Rifts) to make it less annoying, not improve its core mechanics. We shouldn't have to accept a \"mid\" rework for one of the game's most beloved ascension paths. Let's discuss this. What are your thoughts? And Paradox, if you're reading, we would love some reassurance about your commitment to the quality of this core feature.",

      "content_preview": "The current pop job allocation process kinda (read: really) sucks. It's unintuitive but would be a lot better with one tweak. To be clear, I'm talking about the automatic system which decides what jobs your pops work. Pops should lose their jobs if a better pop is available. Currently, if a pop already holds a job, it is impossible (outside of resettlement or job closure jank) for them to ever leave that job. If a sub-optimal pop gets into a job as a diversity hire, they're locked in forever. Instead, they should lose their job if another pop is better. This means, if they're an elite or specialist, they may become unemployed and need to demote. This would solve the problem of your tailor-made mining species always taking your scientist jobs while your scientist pops work in the mines. The populations would naturally stratify over time as they grew to fill the planet. On a technical level, I suspect this would be more efficient too. Whenever pops grow, the entire planet should reallocate its jobs without regard for current jobs. Right now, it has to consider filled jobs and think hard about it. They should just have a target position and go there. If they're stuck in the specialist strata, they become unemployed. On an RP level, maybe this behavior could change depending on ethics and civics. Maybe egalitarians prefer the current system while authoritarians are more likely to fire under performing pops.",

Ever wanted your galaxy in your old game to continue as a new game? Continuum aims to do just that. Converts any savegame into a new static galaxy for a new game. Currently converts systems, navlanes, stars, planets, moons, and asteroids.  But hey it's a start!  Eventually the top empires in your old game become Fallen Empires, and Fallen Empires in the old game will become Precursors. And other galaxy aging ideas. Roadmap posted to the mod forum: Continuum on Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3554276594 Python parser included in mod directory. It's not user friendly but for those who know, feel free to check it out and test against your savegames. Be sure to load any older game into current Stellaris and resave as 4.0.23 or higher. Then use the parser to convert the savegame and output two files you replace in the mod directory. Looking for testers to verify the current parser is working for most savegame conversions.

      "content_preview": "As the title says. I’m kinda worried about the narrative direction of the new DLC especially since the studio that headed Astral rifts are involved. I liked Astral rifts (when I can be bothered to read them) but what they aren’t is narratively flexible. I appreciate the benefits of having the opportunity to make interesting lore, but I prefer the openness of the Biogenesis and Cybernetic ascensions. The other ascensions let you decide what flavor of RP you want, to Utopian and benevolent to Dystopian nightmare fuel. But what I’m seeing from the teasers is that Psionics is going to be super powerful (which in keeping that it always was before the DLC) but at the cost of locking your empire to essentially being reckless maniacs who are messing with powers beyond their Ken and are basically on their way to unleashing the Dark gods like the Eldar did in 40k. It feels like you’re being locked in to being something of an unofficial crisis, which is great for the crowd that likes that. But I want to be less like the Dark eldar and more like the Jedi. I know someone teased that there is a less shroud centered version of the acension, and I hope that that’s not less powerful for the price of being less…eldritch evily. Ideally even the shroud routes have at least some more…morally justifiable routes? Something I can see the UNE doing? What do you guys think?",

I've seen people achieve ridiculous numbers with just a handful or even just a single planet/system, and I just don't know how they do it. I don't want a full step by step manual on how to effectively run my empire, but some tips for which things are best to focus on when would be appreciated. If I know what direction I should go I think I can at least figure my species and empire out by myself",

      "content_preview": "I'll try to keep this brief, but these are the main things that I think need addressing and haven't been touched in (sometimes) YEARS. Why is making war claims and altering sectors easy, but trading a system to the AI is a nightmare? I propose that when you click on Transfer System, it minimizes the diplomacy / trade window until you're done picking systems just like you would with claims. The army builder via starbases was a nice addition, but if I have a lot of species on those planets opening the menu creates a massive amount of lag. Add the Orbital Ring options to the Planetary management view. All we need is the upgrade button, building, and modules. Nice that there's a button that brings us back and forth, but I'd prefer if the toggle opened a top or side panel with all the OR options on it, like the build queue or building options picker. We don't need our fleets to be assigned a home starbase, do we? Your first fleet is always tied to your first starbase. Considering all new fleets have no home starbase and it needs to be set manually, what's the point anymore? To be fair, there are some edge cases where it can be handy, but 95% of the time you want a defeated fleet to spend the least amount of time Lost. And just to sandwich this with some positive feedback: the update to the species window and per-species defaults with gradual integration is perfect. I feel like I'm not having to fight with a thousand sub-species clogging up the view anymore. Kindly add more suggestions below and hopefully we'll be seen.",
