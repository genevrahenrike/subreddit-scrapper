Sometimes, I don‚Äôt know the name of the song that‚Äôs playing, and I have to use Shazam to find out. After searching for a website that could identify songs playing on the radio and not finding one, I decided to create my own. You can check out the project here: https://github.com/Vanilla1002/ShazamRadio Anyone can run it on their own computer by following a few simple steps. You can even add your own custom radio stations with a simple script. I hope others will find it useful too! For fellow programmers, I‚Äôd love to get your feedback and suggestions for improvement. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!",

This song is very special to me because it has been in the works for almost a year. I would like to know the highlights of the song and the least important tracks so I can improve my work, kind of a breakdown of the tracks. I understand it may be too much to ask, but it would be greatly appreciated <3 I would also be curious as to what genre this would be considered as I‚Äôm struggling to find what place this song is in. This was inspired by listening to the SOS album by SZA and Trilogy by The Weeknd. on Apple Music on Spotify on YouTube on YouTube Music on Amazon Music ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ hip hop remix",
