      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, So, not too long ago, I read S&B. Now I very much enjoyed the first two, both were imo quite immersive. But when i started on Ruin and Rising, something shifted. Idk if it was pacing or style, but to me it felt like Bardugo was trying to do too much? It felt like it was suddenly having Alina do so many things at the same time. Now it may be purposeful, but it felt like Alina was accomplishing things either extremely quickly or taking actual ages. Though the final battle was good, the build up to it felt so monotonous. It was supposed to be tense and what not, but I had to put the book down and read back several time because I actually could not keep track of what I read. Sorry if i seem very judgmental, but thats kind of what i thought about it. Am I the only one?",

So using the reference from the fandom wiki, i came up with these spellings, i traced the letters very roughly so they are messy but its good enough for planning, just want to know if anyone thinks i could change it or if its agreed it seems right.  Keeping in mind the letters will be placed vertically when finished on the books. And for context the written kerch language is a Abugida, so consonant–vowels next to each other are written as units, i think only in pairs?  im new to getting into fantasy languages so any help would be appreciated",

I have contempleted for a long time if I even want to start reading the King of scars series because i suspected that I would not like certain storylines in it however I ended up enjoying it for the most part. My issue is, that there are sooo many plotholes and actions that are super unrealistic. Like when they allowed the Darkling to meet Alina and Mal conveniently went with her?! They would never do this in my opinion. It was clear from the very beginning that he was hiding something. Also they would not search his clothes?! I am not used to weak plot twists like this from Bardugo. The worst offens however is when David apparently dies?! In a Fjerdan bombing?? This was so unneccesary and cruel, Genya deserves to be happy after everything she went through. In other books of Bardugo, death has a meaning, or a purpose for some kind of character development but I feel like David dying is only for the schock factor and so something tragic can happen and honestly, I am so mentally checked out at this point... Is the rest of this book better or should I just DNF it?",

What if Van Eck didn't trick them at all, then Kaz was going to give Wylan to Van Eck(knowing he woudnt bat an eye killing him or torturing him once known the truth) and take the money? Cause from what I know Kaz took precautions, but still tought that the exchange was regulated by the council so he really thought they were gonna do it and take the money.",

I did love hearing about or seeing some SoC characters in RoW. I was pretty happy with how everything ended too, I feel like we got closure on all fronts.

I also think that the whole thing about her pushing down her power her whole life and it tiring her out is a GREAT metaphor for pushing down your emotions or your personality. I struggle a lot with being comfortable with sharing my emotions and being my true self and it really takes a toll on me. I think it was a good metaphor for neurodivergence. I also just really like the world, and I especially loved the segment when Alina originally ran away. I don’t know, I wanna talk about how great this book is!!!",

      "content_preview": "So, im a biotech undergrad working at a translational research lab and i had this thought during a career counselling session. it started with narnia and then i ended up analysing the \"small science\" behind the grisha's abilities. The whole Small Science * thing in the grishaverse is literally manipulation of matter at its most fundamental level as i remember in SOC/CK. Hence, it is rooted in altering existing physical realities (matter forms, spin, charge, energy state, and bonding orbitals, arrangement). if you look at it through a scientific perspective, the powers of the Grisha are laid from principles in biology, physics, chemistry, and material. In this post i'll explain the science behind different grisha abilities and the amplifiers. Corporalki The Corporalki can be/are bioelectric modulators and cellular controllers. Heartrenders influence autonomic nervous systems by targeting neural and cardiovascular signalling e.g., advanced neuromodulation techniques. It can however fail if the heartrender is scared. Contradictorily, upon Nina's consumption of jurda parem during SOC she gains the ability of Mind control, heightened healing, tailoring powers, enhanced vision and enhanced hearing due to heightened perception similar to the MK mind control program. Healers are tissue engineers, controlling stem cell behavior and immune responses to repair damage, through epigenetics upregulation or downregulation such regenerative medicine as they are required to touch the person to heal them. This can be due to any form of electro/magnetic manipulation as they have certain mind control powers too (under jurda parem). Tailors probably use a similar approach such as gene expression control to reshape appearance but it's more similar to grafts, plastic surgery due to use of a similar material to change the appearance hence using what already exists. Tailors can also affect skin pigmentation by adjusting melanin interaction with visible light (photoprotection/absorption). eg Sturmhond Etherealki The Etherealki are capable of manipulating elemental forces, but with limitations (however, again jurda parem affects the statement of limitations). Squallers control airflow via electrostatic pressure gradients, similar to fluid dynamics (i hate Bernoulli). they also are able to manipulate weather under the influence of jurda parem. Inferni use a spark to trigger and control combustion through combustion chemistry and energy transfer. Tidemakers can influence water through hydrogen bonding networks and temperature-pressure phase manipulation via phase transitions and surface tension. Materialki The Materialki reflect the world of advanced research in materials and chemical science. Durasts are able to restructure inorganic matter at the atomic level. basically nanomaterials engineering, lattice realignment, nanofabrication. Alkemi are real time chemists, as they initiate and control reactions in real time by fine-tuning molecular bonding and catalysis. you'd ask what are amplifiers then for? Morozova’s Stag, Sea Whip, Firebird are permanent and form a profound bond with the grisha possessing them. so they can be Resonance Enhancers (Quantum or Electromagnetic Coupling) which can help in Stabilizing (Morozova's stag) or amplifying specific frequencies (Baghra in Alina's case). Biological processors (energy flow or feedback control) such as the Sea Whip’s scales or Firebird’s bone which provide more energy throughput, better control, and processing power that enhances energy flow or feedback control. Epigenetic modulators for greater control or new manifestations of power. Hence the grisha use Electromagnetism, photon Radiation (Light & Heat), Atomic & Molecular Manipulation (Particle and Wave Duality) as their minds/bodies act as bioquantum interface which interacting with matter at the atomic and energetic scale.",

Poor Nina… I’m glad Inej decided to stick around with Kaz cause I was about to be extremely sad if he just carried on alone. Ugh idk! It just hurts to see the crew fractured like this. And I won’t lie - throughout both these books I felt like we were right on the edge on a plot climax and we just stayed there on the edge of something big, until the book just ends with a sad separation of all our characters. Shit, half the time I forgot we were on a mission to get our damn payment from Van Eck for the Ice Court job. The plotting of the jobs were great, clever. I just felt like we never got to the moment we were headed towards for the whole of both books. I guess thats to say the ending was more realistic… not everyone could make it out alive, not everyone could stay in the Barrel. And I think Inej should have carved Jordie’s name onto Pekka Rollins chest on the last night she saw him. Period. NOW without spoiling, should I read the next two books? Are there any characters from the first trilogy or the SoC duology in them? Is it all new characters and location??",

I recently finished the shadow and bone trilogy and started six of crows and im really enjoying grishaverse so far While i was reading ruin and rising i remember some vague memories of alinas childhood being mentioned (before kerazmin) and i really thought that since shes the only current sun summoner she would have an interesting background like mal or something so im not sure if I missed something or is it maybe in the other books (or maybe sun summors are just born randomly without any special heritage lol)",

      "content_preview": "Binge watched the show and the books. I enjoyed the books for what it was, but have come to the conclusion that the way Mal was written was boring. Alina always brought up or focused on Mal, to the point it felt like it disrupted the story and flow of the narrative because he was such a bland character to me. The books would’ve been way better to focus on the political intrigue related to Darkling and Nicolei, their dealings, and their beliefs. I was more interested in their characterizations and their dynamic with Alina. They felt like parallels of each other, and that was far more interesting while Mal felt like he was just there. Anyone feel the same?",
