At one moment the actual speed sign postd said 45 mph and I went that speed and the van screamed at me again to slow down as it read 25mph in the system... I need to go faster so I'm not rescued and benched, it was 7:45pm and I only had 15 stops left after I was rescued for a bag with 12 stops, but DSP told me to mark undelivered because of time and to come back to the station. I'm so terrified to lose this job, I can't. Please help me improve. I cant speed :/ idk why my DSP is so strict about it. I fell into a hidden hole on someone's property today and got a grade 1 sprain on my first solo day. I can't tell them, I dont want to get fired. Work is so hard to come by in my area, especially anything that pays above $13 hourly. $20+ is a dream...I cant lose it.",

I have never work such a hard job in my life, load your entire van by yourself, do inspections by yourself, clean van by yourself than working under the sun non-stop, ditching the dogs and cant even take breaks because you‚Äôll be left behind schedule. Wtf is this?? Wells Its my second day, i had nursery routes but its like hell, they are only paying $20 and hour and this is shit bro‚Ä¶ what kind of games amazon is playing? They are hiding behind dsp owners and killing people?? So there company name remain intact in case someone like literally. No disrespect but I dont even see a single girl doing this shit in my company of 100 employees. Obviously i can only imagine. Now if someone comes to rescue you, you wont even get the bonus, you also have to follow each and every road rules?? Bro why you guys doing this shit? I literally going to quit and go back to trucking over the road. Yes its lonely there but atleast i will be alive with more money.",
