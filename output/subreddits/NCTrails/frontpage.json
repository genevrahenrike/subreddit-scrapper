      "content_preview": "Hey fellow hikers & campers, I'm up visiting for the week, and haven't hiked any of the trails since before Helene last year. I'm staying in Newland (spent several years living here previously), and typically access Little Lost Cove Cliffs/Darkside Cliffs/Hunt Fish trails areas via the National Forest Road #464/Old Mortimer Road. Are the roads back there ok at this point and accessible? Tried searching prior posts, but it was tough to tell, and a little vague on links like G5 trail, etc, whether that area was ok. One section does list 464A in Caldwell/Avery county as closed, so I don't want to waste a drive out there to just turn around. If closed, alternately open to any suggestions of nearby and similar spots that would be fun for an overnight camp at primitive sites like that, less popular areas (as much as possible on Labor Day week).",

      "content_preview": "We just finished the Art Loeb this weekend going southbound! We did it in 3 days and two nights hiking for about 8-9 hours a day on first two days, and about 5 on the third. I’m glad we took extra time as it allowed us to stop, look around, and marvel. We stopped to see salamanders, newts, mosses, lichens, trees, wildflowers, mountain top views, or just to have a nice chat with a passerby. We really loved it! Although I do have very swollen knees now and the last day was pretty painful on my joints. I would love to do it again northbound! Water wasn’t too spooky as it rained a bit and we had our fill up points mapped out well. Butter gap was a great shelter and we saw salamanders in the creeks there. Overall, you get to see so many different types of ecosystems due to the severe changes in elevation. It‘s well worth it! Does anyone have comparable trail suggestions for through hiking? We would love to do more longer, technical trails that take 2-3 days.",

Is it typically recommended to take the Grandfather Trail on the way up and Underwood on the way back, or the other way around? 2.) How scary are the heights? I wouldn’t say I have a huge fear of heights (I love rollercoasters and have been skydiving/hang gliding and had a great time with both), but have heard the ladders sections can be pretty gnarly. Asking more just so I can feel prepared. Thanks in advance!",

I'm fine with finding guys or girls to hike with but not looking to hook up for sex, I can't believe how many people suggest that. I am not interested in that, I just want to hike but my wife isn't an outdoors person. I live in the High Point area and want to hike some serious trails in parks like Hanging Rock SP, Stone Mountain SP, South Mountain SP, Pilot Mountain SP, Linville Gorge, Grandfather Mountain, etc. I'm a down to Earth guy that is simple, laid back, love hockey but follow other sports too. I enjoy the outdoors and used to camp and kayak and want to get back into that. If you have any questions please feel free to message me.",

      "content_preview": "Hey Folks. Going to shining rock wilderness next weekend. Plan to park at the Black Balsam parking area, then head up Art Loeb Trail to Shining Rock. Around clockwise on the Old Butt Knob trail to Big East Fork, back south toward the Mountains to Seas trail, then back west on MTS to the parking lot. 3 days, 2 nights. I see there's a major closure of the Blue Ridge Parkway from around Beech Gap to Black Balsam Road. Can I still access Black Balsam Road from the East side of Blue Ridge Parkway, or is that closed off entirely? Worst case scenario, I could start from a different section of the loop. https://www.nps.gov/blri/planyourvisit/conditions.htm Are water sources plentiful enough around this loop? Any favorite camping spots on that loop? If you need an easy visual, I'm doing this route: https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/north-carolina/shining-rock-loop-from-black-balsam-road",
