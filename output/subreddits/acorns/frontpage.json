I am investing 500 a week with 10x round up. I underrated this is long term and you should set it and forget it but Iâ€™m trying to see what is best for me. However I am also using acorns as savings account for a weekly pull so that I donâ€™t spend all the money that comes in. I lost so much in the stock market purchasing  meme stocks and investing in penny stocks so now I want something stable. What are your thoughts?",

I completed all the steps including the friends investment in the first couple of days of the promotion but it took a while for it to confirm eligibility. Today, it finally completed all steps for the referral but instead of getting my 1300, on the transactions tab its saying that iâ€™m only getting $5/referral. I noticed that that was the promotion for this week but it was not the one when I completed all the steps. Has anyone faced this problem before, and if so, what should I do?",

Iâ€™m 27 and make about 7k per month. My expenses are around 6k this being mostly all my check goes to my debt. And I live for free due to other circumstances.",

      "content_preview": "UPDATED POST: So I re-downloaded acorns about a month ago. I've had an account for several years. I'm just now starting to get financially responsible and saving. Took me 24 years, 2 years of being in a joke and toxic marriage (Happily Single and Comfortable now), 5 years of being an average young adult that spends money when they get it. That's besides the point. Backtrack to the original topic. I set up $40/week into the moderately aggressive invest account with the Gold Sub, $50/week into later, and $40/week into savings. I do plan on switching my direct deposit (first harrison) to acorns. Ease of access and everything right there. I do make $12/hour. 36 hours a week minimum. I do live with a 3-way split of rent. Everyone pays on time. I pay $760/month on rent. $120/month for gas. $60/month for groceries. I have the Acorns Card for round-up. I do that probably 3+ times a day on small purchases. I do use Justay on my days off or when I get a little downtime. The total amount of monthly expenses is about $1142. I've cut back on lots of unnecessary items I thought I absolutely needed then and there. Always thought it was never going to show up ever again type deal. Most of you all know what I am talking about. I have plenty of money set aside to pay my debt (over $15k worth. Don't judge. I'm getting there slowly but surely, guys ðŸ˜†) All jokes set aside. My living situation is great. I have a great support group. I have my \"why\" of doing this. I'm trying to become the man I've always wanted people to see me as. More reason to that. I have my life straightened for the most part. Any suggestions, pointers, tips, or any advice that will hopefully set me to quit the 9-5 job space and hopefully retire by 2030, 2035, at the latest. Thank you ahead of time.ðŸ˜Š UPDATE: I did find some errors and mistakes after looking over everything. Everything is accurate now. I don't pay 15k a month for debt. I do apologize for the confusion.",

Are these a bunch of bot posts advertising the platform or is there a legitimate reason to transfer? It doesn't make a lot of sense to cash out all of your gains when you can just continue to let your cash that's already in Acorns to continue to grow in Acorns. I set it and forget it in both an Invest and Later account. Any extra money that I want to play with goes into Robinhood, so I'm certainly not a hater. I'm just unsure how it would be beneficial to cash out and move my accounts and I feel like I'm missing something.",

Its been 4-5 days and still it only shows the people that signed up are \"in progress\" how long does it take to come out of this stage and go into completed? Do I still get $5 referral bonus even if those people never come out of the \"in progress\" stage? I'm trying to get some side money to learn how to invest and stuff, so any insight is welcome.",
