So I’m looking at parks in Frisco/McKinney/Prosper that have pavilions and preferably have bathrooms! Are pavilions claimed pretty regularly? How early do you have to get there? Are people aggressive about it? This would be in the afternoon on a Saturday in October. Thx in advance!",

Here are a few tips I’ve found work well: Exterior: Regular washes + a spray wax or ceramic coat every few months help protect the paint from fading and water spots. Interior: Using UV-protectant cleaners keeps dashboards and leather from cracking in the sun. A deep vacuum + shampoo every so often keeps the cabin fresh. I’m curious—what do other McKinney drivers struggle with the most? Exterior dust, or interior mess (kids, pets, etc.)? I do  myself here in town—both interiors & exteriors—so if anyone ever wants a deeper clean, feel free to DM me.)",

Would love recommendations on public courts, rec centers, or private instructors you’ve tried and liked. Thanks in advance!",

We’re torn between two house options that are similar in size, price range, and location. Both are in the same price range ($25k diff). Both are close to 3850 sqft (5 bed 5.5 bath). Similar lot size at 6400 sqft. Southgate is nicer with better features, options, and build quality. Hazlewood has better school ratings. Southgate is in the Lakeside district in Painted Tree and Normandy, close to FM423 and 380 in Frisco. Price point-wise, I am getting a much better % discount with Normandy, but at the end of the day, the final price is pretty close for both. Any pros or cons for either one of those options will be highly appreciated !",
