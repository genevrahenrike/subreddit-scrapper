My two really dumb questions though (and please - just be kind. I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth right now for rude/nasty/condescending comments) are about fatigue/exhaustion and hair loss. Over the past couple of months I‚Äôve noticed a huge amount of hair falling out - like clogging the shower drain amounts. I‚Äôve got fine hair to begin with, so loosing this much hair on a day to day basis is really scary for me as a female. I‚Äôve seriously begun considering Rogaine and whatnot. My second question regarding fatigue and exhaustion - I‚Äôm absolutely wiped TF out. Like, could sleep all day if I didn‚Äôt have kids at home, tired to the bone, wasn‚Äôt this tired pregnant type of tired (and no - definitely not preggers). I‚Äôve been working on doing some basic resistance type training since my kids are getting ready to head back to school and not sucking up all my waking hours, but it feels like I‚Äôm doing marathon cross fit workouts, just doing fifteen wall pushups. Is this just because of the rapid weight loss? I‚Äôm doing my best to eat - but maybe it‚Äôs not enough calories? Lots of protein, veggies/fruit, low-ish carbs. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this is from too much of a calorie deficit, or if maybe I should try to squish my way into seeing the MD (which would be hard since my PCP left the practice and they haven‚Äôt filled her position - everyone is getting slammed there with rescheduling her patients previously scheduled appointments).",

      "content_preview": "90% of the hearing was the judge berating Lilly's counsel for better evidence and direct harms to Eli Lilly. This was one of the first hearings in many lawsuits designed to stop compounding. I‚Äôm not sure I saw any press there and I haven‚Äôt seen any media coverage of it. I work in the space and make a tool called glpwinner that helps compare glp1 providers, so that‚Äôs why I was there. The Judge focused on the article III standing and wanted to go claim by claim looking at the facts behind it and the concrete injury to Lilly. She wasn't buying most of it. She told Lilly that if they didn't like Mochi selling compounded medication they should go talk to the FDA and congress. She was constantly suspicious of the claims that Mochi's compounded patients were stolen customers from Lilly. They likely couldn't afford Lilly's medications and might go to other anti-obesity medications otherwise. The Judge challenged Lilly's counsel to tell her the price of Lilly's medications and they couldn't give a confident answer on the spot. The Judge did not see enough evidence OR harms to Lilly for: Claims related to Myra presenting herself as a doctor. (She is the Mochi founder with a medical degree but who is not a practicing Dr) Mochi changing compounding pharmacies from Aequita to another Marketing that used the SURMONT trial as evidence for the effectiveness of tirzepatide. She felt the active ingredient was the same. Claims related to compounded medication being less safe OR less effective. The burden to present evidence otherwise was on Lilly. Aequita pharmacy voluntarily shutting down or being shut down by WA state. (How Mochi communicated about Aequita did not harm Lilly) The Judge was highly suspicious of Reddit as evidence - she asked if they spoke to the redditors directly. Questioned if there were broad harms to consumers why there wasn't more evidence of it. Lilly wanted discovery so badly but we aren't there yet. When it came to personalization the judge pushed on concrete injury to Lilly and said \"If you don't like what they're selling go to the FDA.\" At one point the judge said, \"What I hear you saying is that you don't have anything\" to Lilly's counsel. She ended it by saying she was not satisfied and that this was not Lilly's best work. She is allowing Lilly to amend the lawsuit and stressed that she wanted more evidence and concrete harms to Lilly. Not sure how well this bodes for the many lawsuits out against telehealth companies right now. Novo's lawsuits seem to focus on marketing and often marketing that cites their research. If precedent is set that the active ingredient is enough to cite Pharma studies it will lead to some interesting marketing changes.",

      "content_preview": "I seem to lose (on the scale) once a month. The week after my period, I get a whoosh and lose a couple pounds. I know this is normal. I know body recomp is happening all month. I know fat is coming off and that it‚Äôs masked by hormones/water/etc. I get it. But it is absolutely maddening. It is a slap in the face to eat at my deficit all week and have my weight stay the same. I feel like I‚Äôm doing all of this for no reason. It just sucks to totally work so hard and see nothing in return.  I log every single bite of food that I eat. Are here any women here who had a frustrating experience but stuck to it and lost a lot? P.s. I am not the kinda person to weight myself once a month - just not gonna happen lol",

Somewhat a more intense sign up than some of the other telehealths. Requires a phone call with the healthcare provider and possibly blood tests if you don‚Äôt have any recent ones. ‚Ä¢¬†ClubCompound ‚Äî $499 for the same 3 month starter pack with B6 additive from BPI Labs but an easier sign up than Pomegranate. Current delivery times about 3 business days from sign up. (soon they‚Äôll also be offering 3 month plans for no additive tirz from ProRx. see below under Orderly Meds for more on ProRX) ‚Ä¢¬†BrelloHealth ‚Äî $499 for 3 months any dose with B6 additive from Southend a 503A state regulated compounding pharmacy. Will take more than a couple of weeks for you to get it delivered as they‚Äôre backed up and limit new sign ups so you‚Äôd need to do it early in the morning to get a spot. ‚Ä¢¬†OrderlyMeds ‚Äî $499 for a 3 month starter pack no additive from ProRX a 503B FDA regulated facility which had a bad inspection last year but has since changed management and according to them fixed all their issues. Easy sign up as well. Current delivery times about 3 business days. ‚Ä¢ TryAnava ‚Äî $399 for a 3 month starter pack with B3 additive from OptioRX a 503A state regulated compounding pharmacy. ‚Ä¢ LumiMeds ‚Äî $399 for a 3 month starter pack with B6, B12, or glycine additive from 503A state regulated pharmacies MFV, DrugCrafters, Northwest, or Axtell depending on what state you‚Äôre in. And for the non-newbies, comment below your experiences with these places and let me know any updates or new starter deals that might pop up in the future.",

      "content_preview": "I posted this yesterday in response to a newbie‚Äôs question, and several people reached out in the comments and via DM suggesting I make it a standalone post. So here it is. My points, for stall, food noise, ‚Äúbad batch‚Äù, money spend on treatment. If you experienced anxiety, fatigue, itchy/red injection sites, or slower weight loss, those are all well-documented side effects of tirzepatide itself. Browse Zepbound or Mounjaro forums and you‚Äôll see the exact same complaints from people on the pure, brand-name drug. These reactions aren‚Äôt unique to compounded versions, they‚Äôre part of the medication‚Äôs known profile. Pharmacologically, tirzepatide‚Äôs effectiveness is determined by the amount of active drug binding to GLP-1 and GIP receptors. Small formulation differences don‚Äôt alter that mechanism. What does change is how each person tolerates the medication at different points in their journey. Side effects can ebb and flow as the body adapts. When it feels like your weight loss ‚Äúslowed,‚Äù that almost always reflects a stall, something every single tirzepatide user encounters, whether compounded or brand. A stall isn‚Äôt a failure; it‚Äôs your body recalibrating hormones, metabolism, and appetite signaling before the scale moves again. Food noise and stalls often overlap because the drug is working beneath the surface long before you see results on paper. Food noise itself often throws people off in the early stages. It isn‚Äôt a sign the medication stopped working, it‚Äôs your brain and body recalibrating appetite pathways. Old habits may resurface, and that chatter feels loud, but over time it quiets down as tirzepatide continues to reshape signaling. It‚Äôs not a bad batch, and it‚Äôs not ‚Äúproof‚Äù of failure, it‚Äôs part of the process. Plateaus are actually a critical feature of long-term weight loss. They‚Äôre your body pausing to stabilize and reset before the next drop. Expecting constant weekly losses is like expecting the stock market to climb without ever dipping, that‚Äôs just not how biology works. Hormones, hydration, sleep, stress, nutrition, even sunlight can all shift your day-to-day results. Much of the drama I see around this comes from two sources: (1) a lack of understanding of how GLP-1s actually function, their dosing, side effects, and limits, and (2) the financial stress of paying for treatment and assuming a stall means wasted money. But this is not a sprint; tirzepatide is a long-term therapy, and everyone‚Äôs pace looks different. Your progress is not supposed to mirror your spouse‚Äôs, your friend‚Äôs, or anyone else‚Äôs. Here‚Äôs the truth: your compounded tirzepatide will doing exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to do. Stalls and food noise are part of the journey, not evidence of weaker or ‚Äúless effective‚Äù medication. If you‚Äôre serious about this treatment, the first step is education, learn the science, trust the process, and stop treating every stall like a crisis.",

I‚Äôd like to stay at the lowest dose, for long term use and cost. However, I‚Äôve got 40lbs more to lose and loving this journey. Using the flow chart has been helpful. I seem not to be losing much this week, with some side effects.",
