      "content_preview": "(For some reason this post got locked in limbo so hopefully this works this time!) Does anyone think about these two as much as I do? What could’ve been and how the two interact with each other. I think about them all the time and how in love they were with each other but continued to torture the other (especially Katerina to Ivan) over that love? I think about how Ivan must have felt when listening to Katerina (in Crack Up in the Drawing Room) go on about sticking by Dmitry’s side and trying to convince herself and Aleksey that Ivan agrees with her. And how that changed the relationship between Ivan and Dmitry. And then on her side, how Katerina continued to feel so attached to Dmitry even though he took her money AND was unfaithful to her! In my opinion, I agree with Alyosha that the two of them had always been in love and Katerina also knew this in a way but continued to deny it. And at the end SPOILER…….when she is the one to stay by Ivan’s side and take care of him (and even vow to stay with him) after he has his breakdown…man I really love these two. Maybe this is a personality trait of hers (as Ivan said in previously mentioned chapter about how she in a way finds purpose in being a ‘righteous victim’) but I like to think she chooses to accept her feelings for him and in my own headcanon Ivan wakes up and they fall in love and marry, lol. I don’t know I just really had to get this out there because they have nestled into the deep layers of both my mind and heart. I could talk about them for ages and I can’t be the only one so I hope I’m making sense.",

Before his suffering he tells the story of a man who is so pure, whose love is so saint like that even after the girl (Nastenka) rejects him and kind of betrays him and still gives him the sense that he can still be used by her again if something goes wrong, he wished her good life. But in the last part of book, we see that how he imagines his house and life getting darker as a dreamer and someone in isolation. And actually this is where NFU starts from, a man who's done with worldly messes, disappointments, and betrayals, he is now so full of himself that he no longer considers anyone to the par with him, he still preaches like the narrator of white night did, but he's now suffering from existential crisis, and crippling to find the meaning, and forming a meaning of his own for the life he's living. Now this is just my interpretation. Would love to hear your thoughts as well.",

I’d like to hear from people who speak English as a second language (around B2–C2 level) and who enjoy reading short stories, poems or essays in English. I’ve noticed that many non-native speakers read literature in English but rarely get the chance to actually discuss it in English. I’m trying to find out if there’s a real need for a small space focused on that or if it’s just in my head. To explore this, I’ve made a short survey (2–3 minutes). It asks about your reading habits, motivations and frustrations. 👉 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDso8PAfcPLBV4KAV0VzUzn-XzWErduLZsTaXcPax6GXPHOg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=113380171478832286334 I’m hoping to learn whether this idea makes sense beyond my own head.

I think about it all the time: “But how could you live and have no story to tell?” It’s actually simple but it hit me like a truck. Made me realize I’ve basically been living like a real NPC my whole life. Because I used to be super passive, always overthinking the smallest things, too introverted to actually live. But that one line pushed me to change. Start reconnecting with old friends, break some habits, and just be a little braver about life. And I’ve already been doing it, little by little. Dostoevsky wasn’t just a novelist, man. Sometimes it feels like he carried a fragment of something prophetic in him. I don’t even know how to explain it, but I’m sure a lot of you get what I mean, especially after reading more of his works",

I know it's an unusual request, but I'm really getting attached to the characters of Dostoevskij's novels, so I'm looking for someone to write something with me with them. I read Crime and Punishment, the Gambler and White Nights. But I'm specifically looking to roleplay something with Demons, which is the novel I just finished. Perhaps we could invent an AU. I'd like someone capable especially of playing Kirillov, but the other characters as well. You don't have to be super experienced, just to have read the novel and like roleplaying.

      "content_preview": "Dostoyevsky expresses through his characters negative views on the catholic church, that are obviously his own. I'm thinking of the story of The Grand Inquisitor in Karamazov, and Prince Mishkin in Idiot. What I find strange about some of these criticisms is that they come from a reactionary russian orthodox. Without wanting to offend anyone's religious beliefs, the Orthodox church in Czarist Russia in the 19th century was profoundly intertwined with political power, helping to maintain the social status quo. The grand inquisitor's monologue about them having no need for jesus, and power and organization being thr main goal of the church, is like the man in the glass house throwing stones. I can understand how this would harmonize with Tolstoy's christian pacifism, as expressed in his writings on civil disobedience, patriotism and non-violence.  But did Dostoyevsky not see how easily his criticism of the church could be turned against his own political and religious views?",

So, I would like to know if anybody of you have read the Demons for a second time, and, if so, how would you describe the whole experience? Also, according to your opinion, was it worth the time and why? P.s. I apologise for my bad English.",

      "content_preview": "You can read Dostoevsky, but without God, you miss the heart of his work.. An atheist can read Dostoevsky and appreciate his literary genius, his psychological insight, or his social critique, but they can never fully grasp the spiritual and moral depths he explores. Christ is in the very centre of Dostoevsky’s work, it’s rooted in a worldview where God, sin, grace, and redemption are not abstract ideas but living realities that shape human experience. His characters’ struggles with faith, guilt, and salvation assume the existence of a moral and divine order. Without acknowledging that order, the atheist may understand the plot and psychology but will miss the profound stakes: the eternal consequences, the hope for redemption, and the existential weight of divine love. In short, Dostoevsky writes from inside a universe where God is real, and to fully feel the meaning of his stories, one must enter that universe. Edit: Instead of jumping to conclusions, try to understand that in Orthodoxy he’s spoken of alongside the Fathers.. in Russia he’s literally called the ‘Fifth Evangelist, he’s regarded as a prophet like voice. It’s not that he was Christian and an atheist can’t understand the work of a Christian, not at all. Understand that he wasn’t just any Christian, his works are studied in seminaries, quoted by priests and bishops, and placed alongside the writings of the Fathers. This is not just literary admiration, it is spiritual reverence.",

I feel trapped inside Golyadkins mind unable to fully understand what's real and what's part of his hullicinations! Dostoevsky is a genius for that but I feel this burning need to see how things actually are outside his mind. I also can't figure out what kind of disorder he suffers from? Is it schezophrenia, paranoia or maybe DID? It's hard to tell since psychiatry was very primitive when Dosto wrote the book which makes me wonder how he managed to describe disorders that weren't studied yet so accurately.",

      "content_preview": "Subtitle: Don't stop won't stop blabbering! The scope of evaluation is confined to Part 1 only; Part 2 was rather inconsequential for the subjective foundation of the character. Now then: the protagonist does not know how to correctly access enjoyment by means of an object that would function as his desire. He would be galvanized and motivated to acquire it as a result of an underlying fantasy frame that provides the reasons for this endeavor, yet he has none. Crucially, this fantasy could discharge a surplus of enjoyment throughout the process - something that the Underground Man strives for. Focusing on his subjectivity: his psychopathological structure is neurosis, specifically an obsessional neurotic, who preoccupies himself over his misplaced spite, envy and resentment towards imagined and real people who he assumes have somewhat accomplished their cheery desires in life - attributing a smug happiness and vanity to them that he loathes. This is why he unconsciously wants to surpass the field of desire - that he rightfully views as insufficient - to enter into the field of the death drive: reaching the greatest ambit of fulfillment through a desire elevated to a constant daily movement around a lacking object. Onwards, he acknowledges his own mental suffering, his sharp unhappiness from not having his own desire, but doesn’t know or hasn’t been able to reflect on how this discontent ties to his own alienation: the self-division of the subject that creates the desire for desire in the first place. Due to this unawareness, he continues to withstand his unease and accompanying guilt by projecting it onto the Other as a defensive recourse of repression: “but in spite of all of these uncertainties and jugglings, still there is an ache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse the ache.” Through his trait of hypothetical dialogue and applying a pseudo-Socratic Method of breaking down his foes arguments, he thinks he has been able to impede their implanted worldviews and subsequently interrupting their complacency (but tacitly, his goal is to frustrate their ability to enjoy through their banal point of views that are widely accepted in culture). Afterwards, he assumes that others will likely resort to material cupidity in the effort to surmount their own nagging displeasures: “and therefore grinding your teeth in silent impotence to sink into luxurious inertia.” Whereas for him, he ventures to mitigate his pain through journaling. What the Underground Man could not do amidst his mental anguish was accomplish a conversion of his constitutional relationship to subjectivity (e.g. other people, language, society, social links) - realigning it to the position of hysteria. In Hysteria, the self-doubt and uncertainty that unfurls is what equips you with the capacity to initiate your own inherent freedom; i.e. your state of emancipation that was always there to begin with, you just needed the proper subjective position to realize it. But this mandates the sacrifice of his own passive inertia within the Underground terrain, and he clearly won’t do this because he latches on to the bits of fleeting pleasure he obtains from his contempt of others alongside the self-soothing he caters to. Therefore, the obsessional neurotic never stops their meaningless repetitive compulsions of persistent talking / thinking, because as soon as they do, it opens up the course for both self-critique and external critique as to the burdens of existence they are tormented by.",

      "content_preview": "This is the darkest book I’ve ever read, darker than Poe or a Shakespearean tragedy. It’s actually giving me nightmares. I am about 90% of the way through, but the psychological impact it’s having on me is so profound that I’m not sure I can continue. Reading this book for me has been like staring into the sun; I am left dazzled and disoriented when I look away, with strange after images that follow me around for days. I think I need a break from Dostoevsky…",

      "content_preview": "What a book. The emotional toil Dostoyevsky put me through is unlike any other author. The highs and lows kept me in a state of urgency to keep reading and figure out how it all ends. I connected with The Prince unlike any other character I’ve ever experienced. The sad ending, although somewhat expected, has left me melancholy. He truly was a genius and I’m thankful to have discovered his books. If you haven’t picked it up yet, I give my highest recommendation.",
