After lelouch used that geass he will do requiem again  schneizel's plan need time to work so It will have the time because of requiem, first schneizel will scare people like plan but after he gonna  Although there may be fear at first, calmness will be instilled over time, and Schneizel will make peace agreements with other countries so peace will last more, wouldnt that better I'm just curious also theres alot of stuff in code geass that they skipped to mention more, And there are nonsensical choices made purely for the sake of the serie without makes any sense.",

      "content_preview": "Throughout the anime (up to episode R2-21), Charles is portrayed as an authoritarian ruler who justifies his colonization and social Darwinism with the rule of the fittest. He expresses and declares in his speeches that the \"strong\" must oppress the weak, and that the latter only use excuses (such as morality or religion) to try to prevent this oppression. However, Charles's true nature is eventually revealed to us, and with it, his true plan: The Ragnarok Connection. To carry it out, he needs both the codes and the thought elevators (making us see that all the colonization that had been carried out to date was to seize the power of these portals). Even so, if you look at the map that appears as he heads to Kaminejima, you can see that there are Thought Elevators located in areas not colonized by the Britannian Empire. So, how could he activate these if they are not part of his domain? And if it is the case that he can activate them without them being part of his territory, why did he have to conquer so many countries and give speeches about social oppression? What was his intention behind this?",

      "content_preview": "Just finished season 1, DAYUM. I make it a point to take a pause after finishing seasons of a show to reflect on them, and that shit was insane. I'm kinda terrified to see where things so but I have some predictions and thoughts. Lelouch's identity will be revealed to the whole world - This just feels like it makes sense, most important players seem to know who he is already, and TBH I wouldn't be surprised if the King already knows / guessed. Kallen is gonna betray Lelouch / stop following him / take over as leader of smth - I wasn't sure what was going on with her character / what they were setting up, but her reaction to seeing that Lelouch is ZERO kinda cemented the idea (for me) that she won't be comfortable following him. Which is kinda weird because he already said that he wasn't Japanese (but I guess his full identity / backstory changed things). People are gonna stop following Lelouch on mass - While his identity does give him a leg up, \"Oh he actually has a reason to fight\" He's just proved that he's willing to put Nunnally ahead of Japan and leave people high and dry. So unless she died (which is quite the possibility, but because season 1 end hinted at it I bet shes alive in some form) I don't see him being followed by a majority. UNLESS UNLESS, he somehow is able to turn the tide of the fight currently going on, but idek how that would happen. 4 a. Lelouch + C2 ain't gonna work out - Idk, this one is just an airball 4 b. Oh also C2 Will die in the 2nd season - This just seems fitting for the girl who has live \"forever\" (Idk how long) 5. Not a clue what's gonna happen to Suzaku, and have little ideas about Lelouch (already know his ending) I loved that Suzaku wasn't like \"HUAGH?? LELOUCH YOU'RE ZERO\" because it totally makes sense, and he would know. Anyways, thanks for coming to the TedGuess, I'll see you guys at the next crazy episode haha",

I don't think it's a twist as powerful as AOT BUTTTTT every element of it felt perfect built towards (besides just explaining his power + giving the most HENIOUS EXAMPLE ) and I'm so FUCKING HYPE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. This is the first story in years I've truly not wanted to be spoiled for the next part (I already know THE death, but nothing about it).

After all the blood, after all the pain, after all the brillianceâ€¦ IS THAT ALL WE GET? No way. I deny it. I refuse it.
