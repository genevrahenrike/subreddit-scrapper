I'll probably aim to go for as many as possible but will likely end up skipping a few here and there. What's everyone's plan for this month?",

Sure it sucks it's pretty limited this time around, but the way to get it to expand is to show up.  Remember that the Mystery Movie was initially only at \"select theaters\" and originally just with Apple Movies, but it ended up being so popular that it not only expanded within Regal but now pretty much every major theater chain has their own version.  It's all about getting butts in seats, so even if your local theaters don't have it this time around, if you can venture out and maybe get to a couple further away then maybe it may expand to your local Regal in the future!",

I asked the guy if he can scan our tickets and he kept saying ‚Äúto do what‚Äù ‚Äúwhat do you want‚Äù and turned to his coworker and asked ‚Äúoh so we take tickets now‚Äù like this was extremely stupid request. I asked if there was a ticket taker and the coworker said ‚Äúno he‚Äôs on break‚Äù ok‚Ä¶whose going to scan my ticket then. Because the film shuts off if it thinks no one is in the theater. I just walked away and went to the movie because my friend assumed they wouldn‚Äôt shut it off. Guess what happened 20 minutes in.

      "content_preview": "Movies I saw this weekend and my reviews on them! Nobody 2 - 4/5 Great action movie! However felt like it was missing some plot and backstory. Still a fun watch if you're looking for something to pass the time! Caught Stealing - 5/5 One of the best movies I've seen this year! There was action, suspense and a great plot twist! Overall an enjoyable movie that is a nod to the classic crime thrillers! Definitely check this one out! Jaws (50th anniversary re-release) - 5/5 Still a masterpiece of a movie and holds up quite well even after 50 years! The Roses - 5/5 Funny, fun and enjoyable is how I would describe this relationship comedy-drama! A bit slow and may seem uninteresting at the beginning but certainly picks up the pace along the way and becomes a great movie! Overall, this weekend had some pretty great movies to offer and all of these are worth checking out! Anyone who's got other opinions or thoughts on these movies, feel free to drop them in the comments! Glad to be a regal unlimited member, one of the best choices I've made :)",

Last weeks HP marathon clocked an average of 24 mins, which seemed to be the normal time for most of the movies I saw. Paper Moon had 22 mins and The Short Game started only 19 minutes after the posted show time. This was at 3 different theaters over a week and a half, so maybe they'll get it down to 15 minutes. We'll see if it holds true with MMM tonight. Here's hoping.",

Something told me it was highly likely someone would be in my seat, so I reasoned that the wait would be worth having the physical ticket. I was right. There was a couple in my seat, so I double checked the aisle, showed them my ticket, they move a couple seats down, I chuckle and wait. Not five minutes later more people come in and want their seats that this couple is now in. Pretty good chances this guy got torn to ribbons at home, his very pregnant girlfriend was super embarrassed and definitely irritated. Pretty funnyüòÜ Edit to add: They had tickets. They were humble. Take the hate somewhere else, this was just funny",

Starting Friday, we will be going 5 days in a row, maybe 6. I knew I'd want to maximize the subscription, but already it's beyond that. I really missed attending movies regularly, now the desire is becoming insatiable. My biggest gripe is I don't have more time to attend more films!",

People were chatting during the trailers which is normal, but when the movie started this guy continued having separate conversations and wouldn‚Äôt shut up. No one said anything about it the first 30 minutes in, But then he started doing side commentary trying to be funny saying ‚Äú oh hell nah‚Äù and other things that no one was responding to. I got up to use the restroom and walked up to an employee and let them know there was someone who was loud and wouldn‚Äôt stop talking. They let the manager know. I watched the manager walk in, stand in the corner for 10 seconds then leave. Once he left the door slammed shut behind him and the guy started making comments about the door slamming and who‚Äôs doing that. It got to the point where I finally had to turn my head back and said ‚Äúshut up.‚Äù They responded with a whispered ‚Äú you shut the fuck up‚Äù. But it worked. They stayed quiet for the last 45 mins of the movie. Not sure if I handled this the best way. Wondering how other people have handled  this type of situation.",
