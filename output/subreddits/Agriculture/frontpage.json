This year I added some new fields (we started working them after I bought the tractor) and uploaded the field boundaries to John Deere Operations Center. The fields are visible in Operations Center, but when I turn on the tractor the Gen 4 display doesn't show them. My question: will those fields automatically sync from Operations Center to the tractor once JDLink/Operations Center finishes syncing, or is there something else I need to do to push them to the Gen 4?",

      "content_preview": "Hello. My family has had a farm a long time. We have always had barn cats on the property at our house and they are well fed and taken care of. Recently my father inherited land from a relative that passed away and brought animals to live on the pasture land there. There is a large barn on this property as well. This past year my father has brought in many cats to take care of mice or other critters in the barn. It has certainly helped deter pests. However, I’ve noticed my dad does not visit and feed the cats often enough. Multiple cats have disappeared and died over the year and it is making me very upset that he continues to bring in new ones. Currently there is only one cat left and she is extremely skinny, I think the other cat that was most recently with her may have passed from starvation or found a way out to get other food. There is poor ventilation and a lack of food. I want to take the cat away to my college house so that she can live a safer life. I know that my father will probably be mad at me taking away the cat only because he cares about keeping mice out. Please give me any advice on the situation, but mainly I would like to know other ways of keeping rodents out of a barn than cats so that I can give him an alternative and hopefully stop him from hurting any more cats due to neglect and not visiting the property.",

      "content_preview": "Hello! So I know absolutely nothing about farming, agriculture, raising livestock, etc. I just wanted to ask a question to clear up some confusion I have about something my cousin (a pig farmer) told me about his pigs. Just some context to preface - I’m currently visiting my cousin on his pig farm. He raises pigs for Hormel Pork, and has been doing this basically his entire life. This just to say, he’s a professional and seems to know what he’s doing. He said that he has problems with his pigs overeating, to the point where their stomachs explode and they die. To prevent this, he says he puts bleach in their water because he says it prevents and heals ulcers, and keeps their stomachs from exploding. I questioned him on this because I found it very difficult to believe that ingesting bleach, even for a pig, could provide positive health benefits. He insisted that because it’s a small amount, the bleach is not toxic to the pigs, but instead strengthens their stomachs. I searched Google, and found nothing to back this up. In fact, most sources expectedly said the opposite, that bleach is toxic and should not be ingested. I don’t want to question my cousin because he does this for a living and I know nothing about farming. But at the same time, google and my logic says he’s wrong, so I want to get some opinions from other farmers. So my question for anyone who raises pigs: Is this a real thing? Do you add bleach to your pigs’ water or know anyone who does? Or is my cousin just a dipshit? Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this type of question! I tried posting in r/farming but I can’t because I don’t have the karma. Thanks in advance for any replies, I greatly appreciate it! TL;DR My cousin adds bleach to his pigs’ water, is this a normal thing to do?",

We're looking to do that again and might add some clover this year as well. We want to try broadcasting with the drone so we can compare results with growth and stand density in the spring. I was trying to find other field trials to see what seeds have the most success with drone applications but I found it pretty sparse on info. We're thinking rye and crimson clover. Might try this Balansa clover I just heard about. Maybe wheat or triticale or vetch. I had one guy say larger seed was nice because it breaks through the canopy better to make soil contact but I also read that smaller seed is better for broadcasting because it works in better Anecdotal advice here would be great, but I love to have some published info I could show my supervisor so we can make a decision",
