      "content_preview": "I work at a store that excels in every metric except for the big one that‚Äôs out of our control: traffic, and thus sales. Hours have always been tight here. I spent 2 years with open availability and great performance trying and failing to get ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù to full time. Now that I‚Äôm a grad student juggling courses and an internship, I only want to work 2 days a week. And corporate is so hell bent on punishing our store for low traffic that just working 2 days a week manages to be miserable. Every month or two our hours get cut further. 5-7 hour shifts are common. We run on single coverage at least part of every day. Sometimes a department (and we‚Äôre a small store, so clothing + footwear counts as one department, and camping + action sports counts as one department) doesn‚Äôt even get an opener. Just an overwhelmed manager ‚Äúcovering‚Äù it (not really) for 2-3 hours. People are burnt out to the point of tears. Today, Labor Day, is no exception. I‚Äôm gearing up to spend the last 3 hours on my own in hard goods. I‚Äôve already had to run to support front line a bunch. Our bike tech leaves at 6:15. We got a sale truck on Friday that still hasn‚Äôt been fully stocked out because we don‚Äôt have the hours for stockers. Price changes aren‚Äôt getting done. Returns aren‚Äôt getting processed. But don‚Äôt forget!! Mastercards are one of our top priorities, and just asking for roundups for RCAF isn‚Äôt enough!! I think I‚Äôm going to go work in a coffee shop or something while I work on my thesis. My managers are amazing but they can‚Äôt save us anymore.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all! I recently did some backpacking in Guatemala and got a new pair of hiking shoes (Keen) for the trip. While I was there I did a 2.5 day hike through the volcanic highlands. It was about 7-8 hours of hiking each day (with breaks) going up and downhill. By the end of the hike, I had the beginning of a blister forming (despite wearing sock liners and hiking socks) and my big toes felt beat to hell from slamming into the front of my boot while descending. During the hike, some of my toes would also go a bit numb (they didn't hurt, they were just numb). Aside from all of that, the shoes were comfortable. I like hiking in theory, but I've only ever done short, easy hikes (no more than 2 hours) and have never needed to get a pair of hiking shoes/boots so I don't know what my expectations should be. I can't tell if I have good hiking boots and should be satisfied with them given what I put them through, or if there are better shoes out there for me. Is my shoe experience normal? I would love to hear everyone's thoughts :) (Also shoutout to Quetzaltrekkers for the 2.5 day hike! They were amazing https://www.quetzaltrekkers.com/xela/xela-lago-atitlan/ )",
