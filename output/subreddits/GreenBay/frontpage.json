I've been having issues with my apartment, and the office/maintenance have been dodging me or just straight up ignoring me for almost a week. I spoke to a woman earlier in the lobby of the building, she told me she's been living here since 2021 and at one point she had no electricity in her bathroom for almost two months until she threatened to call the housing department or something and they had it fixed within the day. This place constantly has people coming and going. I would rather stay because it allows me to keep my dog and it's within distance of my kids schools, but I haven't had power in half my apartment since last Wednesday and I have no idea what to do. Update/add-on The person I spoke with earlier also told me the reason they have trouble even getting an electrician in here is because they owe various construction/electricians almost $2 million for the new building they just built across the street here (I think it's called The Fort or something stupid like that) and that building is also experiencing outages and water issues as well. I finally got someone to answer me in the office and she said that the girl who's been reaching out to get someone in here is not in the office today and she would be back tomorrow. So it will officially be a week without the lights in my kitchen, my living room, the outlets in my living room, and my Internet. She tried telling me something  about the kind of breakers we have here \"just do that sometimes\" and electricians don't like to work on them, and that all the places they've reached out to aren't available until two weeks from now. I am trying my hardest to be reasonable and respectful but that sounds like complete bullshit.",

When you're driving, Google (and probably Apple as well) are collecting your speed via GPS.  Urban SDK buys that data (your data) from Google/Apple and sells it to cities like Green Bay.  Whether you think this is right or wrong, it's kind of interesting that we, the taxpayer, are paying for the city to buy our data.  Again, not sure how I feel about this, but it's my first time hearing about it.  If this allows to maximize their traffic division and enforce speeding...I guess it's okay?  I dunno. Edit:  Look.  I'm not necessarily against it.  If the data is collected anonymously, and can help prevent traffic accidents and pedestrian death...that's a GOOD use of data.  Still, it probably should have gotten a bit more attention in the local news.",

Do you have any suggestions? Iâ€™m half tempted to call up the old owner and just have him cook me some because my pregnant self needs fried rice more than anything right now. Please enjoy what will inevitably be another 7 months of me asking for recommendations for my pregnancy cravings ðŸ˜‚",

They don't even slow down anymore like a traditional rolling stop either. I see it multiple times per week and almost everyday. They just go through them if they're turning right on red and if they think its clear. I see it at stop signs, too, all the time. And as a bicycle rider and a moped rider, I've now almost been hit twice now. They approach the intersection at such speeds cause they prolly trying to just go through it, that if the need to stop theyre about 15 percent sticking out in the intersection. I think it's getting a little ridiculous. Its especially bad on any major road that connects to little side streets. Main, Mason, and Webster especially bad. Its getting infuriating. And I dont know what to do about it. Alot of the East Side of town doesnt have any sidewalks either so I'm just waiting for someone walking in the gutter to get hit. (And dont get me started on the street racers with their really loud cars on Main St hitting upwards of 70mph on a 35 to 45mph road, near Walmart. And then  they push 60 to 70 on 25mph side streets)",

Trust me, Iâ€™m not one to travel everywhere with my catsâ€¦but ideally we would not be around the first weekend during the showing/people coming in and out process. In a pinch I have family, but donâ€™t really want to travel far with the cats. I also donâ€™t know how well they would do at a boarding place. Any lodging that anyone knows that takes cats? Some are dogs only when I look it up. Idk if anyone works at a hotel or knows of air bnb or cabin that is cat friendly (weâ€™d be with them, not leaving them unattended). This could be anywhere within 30 minutes of Green Bay.",
