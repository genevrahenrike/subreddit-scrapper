Don’t have a whole lot of Meseta. From just wandering around the map and killing everything that moves, I’ve got plenty of augment capsules (most of my storage is just capsules I think…) but I haven’t been using them since I figured where I am now I’ll probably be finding better weapons later so it’d just be a waste to use my good capsules. It’s been a while since I’ve been on PSO as a whole so I’m just trying to get back into the groove. Is there anything I should be focusing on or should I just keep advancing the story? Don’t get me wrong I’m having fun I just don’t feel like I’m getting anywhere… Im not all that new to PSO2 itself, I have almost 200 hours on Base/Classic (got to lvl 81, Ranger\\Hunter, definitely not a whole lot of time or a particularly high level compared to the rest of the community). I was having a pretty good time with it, but there were a bunch of things I didn’t really pay much mind to. I think after a certain point I just started buying weapons and armor from the Personal Shop since it made things easier for me. (I don’t do that anymore, dw)",
