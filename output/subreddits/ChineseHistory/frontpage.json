The case in the northeastern three provinces can be explained because the Han settlements there were recent and the population mainly came from neighboring provinces in northern China; but how were Mandarin dialects spread all the way to the southwest?  As southern dialects like Cantonese are closer to ancient or Middle Chinese and Mandarin was influenced more by the Mongolians and the Manchus, one can guess somehow Mandarin-like dialects have displaced earlier dialects used in say Hubei and SiChuan.  Again note the context of this question: these local dialects were not the result of the 20th Century standardization of Chinese on Mandarin.",

      "content_preview": "Most people name the Tang or Song as China's \"golden age,\" citing poetry, art, commerce, or civilizational confidence. But why is the Qing almost never given that label? From a pragmatic standpoint, the Qing dynasty (especially 1700-1800) had a strong claim: (1) It presided over the largest empire in Chinese history. (2) It maintained internal stability for centuries, even surviving massive rebellions. (3) It fielded modernized armies, built arsenals, and deployed firearms and cannons more extensively than any previous dynasty. (4) It governed a multiethnic, multi-faith empire with surprising administrative resilience. (5) It arguably preserved Chinese sovereignty longer than the Republic of China managed to. Yes, it eventually lost some very small territories (HK, Taiwan, etc.) and signed unequal treaties, but China was never colonized or partitioned like other Asian states. The Qing survived until 1911 because no single foreign power could realistically conquer it. So why is the Qing so often remembered as a period of humiliation or decline? Is it simply because it was the predecessor regime that both the KMT and CCP needed to delegitimize to justify their rise? Ironically, modern China’s borders and territorial claims — Tibet, Xinjiang, even Taiwan — are all based on Qing imperial holdings. If the standard for a golden age is power, size, and resilience, not just poetry and porcelain, shouldn’t the Qing at least be in the conversation?",

The Mongols used similar patterns against Xi Xia. In the context of the Song Dynasty, the Mongols took the unusual, difficult step of marching through the high mountains and deep gorges of Eastern Tibet, bypassing Sichuan, to conquer the Dali Kingdom in (what is modern) Yunnan; then the Mongols invaded the Song from the southwest (Yunnan) or the south (Vietnam) and the north (prior Jin territory) at the same time. No other conquests or invasion of China, by the Manchus in 1644, the Japanese in 1937, or the CCP in 1949, employed such \"deep attack\" at the same time from both ends of (whatever polity as) China (at the time)?

      "content_preview": "link Abstract: This article discusses an important political conflict of historical knowledge between Chinese and Anglophone academia. By exploring divergent perspectives either on long-term and coherent narratives of China or short-term and differentiated narratives of China through the founding issues of Historical Review (Lishi pinglun) established by the Chinese Academy of History in 2020, this article illustrates a ‘battle’ of narratives derived from different regimes of historical knowledge, either officially institutionalized in contemporary China or unofficially constituted in Anglophone academia. Specifically, by critically evaluating the discursive constructions of identity-driven historical narratives of both sides, this article gives a serious consideration to the Historical Review’s mission against the deconstructionist historical narratives. In so doing, I argue that even if it is true that the Historical Review contributors are nationalists and thus help radicalize Chinese nationalism, the liberalist deconstructionist historians of China in English academia are not free from the same types of ‘political contaminations’ by lighting the excessive fires of China bashing. Also by Nagatomi Hirayama “CIVILIZATION” OR “EMPIRE”? “CHINA” AS A HISTORICAL ENTITY IN CONTESTATION Two distinct approaches have shaped the landscape of modern Chinese historical studies. One approach is the civilization-to-nation thesis, which examines modern China's difficult emergence out of its supposedly cohesive civilizational past, a past that could be shared across different groups of people in contemporary China. The other approach—that is, the empire-to-nation thesis—focuses on China's national rise from the disjointed colonial empire of the Qing (and, to a lesser degree, the Ming), a transformation through which China has become the metropolitan center that enacts structural imperial control over different local or ethnic groups across its territorial domains. This article discusses the epistemic capacities, limits, and distortions of both approaches by examining their historiographical and political implications through different historical configurations of late-imperial China and the resubstantiation of national histories in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Although the empire-to-nation approach has become more or less the standard in Western academia over the past three decades, I argue that these two approaches are both essentialist, although in decidedly different ways. In doing so, I call for a more reflective and vibrant perspective on historical China, a perspective that focuses on the lived historical experiences of the diverse groups of people who are not really confined by totalizing and essentializing national subjectivities.",

      "content_preview": "Hey all, what I was wondering is to what extent the Cultural Revolution actually demolished China's history, which is a claim that I've often heard. I know, for example, that the Red Guards smashed up temples, ancestral halls, libraries etc. Some of the imperial tombs near Beijing were opened and some of their contents destroyed. I have read that the corpse of the Ming Dynasty's Wanli Emperor was dragged out of its tomb, denounced by the Red Guards, and burned. On the other end, I also know that sites like the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and the Wild Goose Pagodas in Xi'an were all protected by PLA troops, and I don't get the idea that China's museums are lacking in historical artifacts despite the Cultural Revolution raging on for a decade. So did the Cultural Revolution actually demolish most of China's ancient history, or was it not quite as severe as all that? Also, what happened to historical locations that were smashed up by the Red Guards but were still structurally sound? Were they gradually restored after Mao's death?",

However, I will need some requirements: Neutral standpoint. Not from a left-wing, \"woke\" (what I mean by this word is people who think that racism, sexism, etc. are these absolute principles of satanic evil and that they either demonize ancient people for vaguely following them or try to depict them as victors of wokeism when there isn't good historical evidence for it. This is NOT a statement about whether wokeism is good or not or if it's a good term.) or any other ideological perspective. No anti-Catholic or anti-Christian content. (Being an orthodox Catholic myself.) Some historians like to talk about how Christianity or the Catholic Church was an enemy of humanity or progress. No obscenity or what may be called \"nsfw content.\" Sexual content (what can be common in modern books about Greco-Roman history), excessively graphic content, etc.. If there are any other books worth recommending that aren't strictly about these things, feel free to recommend anyways",

What I have noticed from googling online and searching on Wikipedia is that a cinematic interpretation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms was never made by Shaw Bros. Which I have to ask why? Considering the three other of the four classic novels of China have been made multiple times on films during the Shaw Brother's peak in 1960-1980? Sure Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a much grander epic story but considering they managed to remake Journey to the West multiple times, I can't see why they couldn't make an effective condensed script of Three Kingdoms which their multiple Dream of the Red Chamber and Water Margin adaptations managed to do!",

      "content_preview": "Hi, using a throwaway account for this, since I find it mildly embarrassing to have to ask. I've been working on a graphic novel on the Jurchen Jin for around two years now, and while I have discussed these things with my professors, I found it didn't quite answer my specific, direct questions, and my paranoia has me quadruple checking. (Yes, I know, I'm asking Reddit of all things. It's a good resource, though!). I've made educated sacrifices of historical accuracy for certain things (such as the name 'Tuohei' being used for the protagonist, despite the 'Tuo' being more Khitan), however I will not allow the same to happen for the fictional emperor featured in the story. Based on Yongji, the character is crowned during the actual events unfolding in the novel, and must be given a name. I.E, Emperor BLANK of Jin. I considered making the name Yongji as a reference to the real man he was based on, since his personal name is entirely different (Wanyan Xielu... thats acceptable, right? Lol.) but I wasn't sure if the convention of an emperors name is different enough to cause issues, there. Point being: Just tell me if anything I just said sounds insane or cringe-worthy levels of historically inaccurate.",

I don't want to do something like have someone fortify a border fort and then find out it's actually outside of historical borders. I've also tried taking old chinese maps and eyeballing them on google maps, but it's a bit difficult with all of the place name changes to know if some places are really the same as the ones im looking at on modern maps. Is there something where it is easy to compare the two like an old map superimposed on a modern one or something? Additionally I'm, trying to find a detailed map of luoyang at the time or before, but maps are a bit spare in details. I wanted to know where places like royal academy, markets, and other areas in the city are, for setting purposes, but I can only find ones like the below. Would any of you be willing to help point the way?

I could read other pieces in Japanese which I'm learning but that might take a while as I'm still not very proficient. Anyways, the spirit of our time and curiosity begs me to ask: Has the text of the 24 Histories been digitized and freely available on something like Project Gutenberg or some Chinese web equivalent? I have no motivation or incentives other than curiosity to read them and wanted to throw AI at it probably for a terrible translation just to get the gist of things because I don't quite have the time to spend on what I imagine becoming a Sinologist would entail.

      "content_preview": "I think Yuan Chonghuan is overrated, he is partially to blame for the doom of china and chinese culture by executing Mao Wenlong (毛文龍) the genral who launched raids into liaoning from Pi island this genral was a incredible hindrance to the later Jin/Qing dynasty Maos execution was celebrated by the Manchus to be frank i think people often over praise Yuan and yo be honest his actions suggest he might have really have been colluding with the Manchus killing such a capable genral and weakening resistance to Manchus who wanted to end chinese culture is a crime punishable by Ling chi honest i think Yuan deserved execution Chongzhen did nothing wrong.",
