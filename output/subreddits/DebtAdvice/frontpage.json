It is better to go to a dealer and trade it in/sell it? Or should I just take the credit hit? Is there another option? My credit is very very good right now. And I have stable housing. And my significant other has a car I can use. My car is leased. The place I got the car from scammed me cause I was desperate years ago, and I really have no interest in the car any more or paying for it. What’s the best way to get rid of this car? Sorry if I sound stupid, I really am not knowledgeable about any of this…",

      "content_preview": "For context, I am a 30 year old male that moved from the east coast to the southwest 2 years ago. I didn’t have either parents growing up past age 7, just guardian figures. I turned my life around 2 years ago (today actually) from addictions and substance abuse, etc, went to trade school and graduated and I work in construction now. I currently don’t have any savings. less than 500 total. I’m trying not to touch it. The career is promising but I started out with low pay, 15 an hour, currently at 16.50 and will get a bump to 26 once I get my license in 12 months. An average paycheck I take home is about $1,110.00 every 2 weeks. I currently have across the board with credit card, Student loans and medical debt- $22,812.12 My scores are in the low 500’s but I don’t think I’m necessarily worried about my scores but rather my borrowing ability. I don’t need to make any big purchases right now as both my shit boxes (truck and car) are paid off. I feel like I’m drowning mostly in the credit card debt because I’ll pay a good amount more than the minimum and it’s still not enough from the high interest and my payment barely makes a dent, then I live bare bones till the next paycheck. I have been looking for a second job but right now it’s so unpredictable when I get off work. I could get off at 1pm one day or 7pm the next. I’ve been looking for anything even overnight but I live in a smaller town and have not had any luck yet with a second job. I’m Still gonna keep looking. I’m mostly at a loss of what to do, I hear personal loans are bad because it just adds to your debt. What can a low income/no savings person do to gain control of their debt? I’m tired of having no money at the end of my paychecks to put away for savings and investments. I want to make a change today. It’s been like this for almost 1/2 my life.",

      "content_preview": "It's taking a lot for me to post this as it's embarassing and I also never post on here, so here goes nothing. My wife and I have just a little over 100k in debt between credit cards, personal loans, and an auto loan. We pay $2800 a month just in minimum payments. Not exact numbers but very close: 32k of the debt is an auto loan, 19k is personal loans, 30k is my CC debt and 23k is my wife's CC debt. After taxes, we bring home about 6k each month. 2500 goes to living expenses; (insurance, phone, internet, gas, groceries, etc). Neither my wife nor I have ever missed or been late on a single payment. We've never been called over balances or anything like that yet. The only bad things on our credit report is pretty much just high number of inquiries and high credit usage. I do realize I had a spending problem and i have been doing well as I've shredded all my cards and it's been working great, but all of this has been extremely stressful for us for the last four years and I'm wondering if Chapter 7 bankruptcy might be right for us considering the amount of debt, or at least for me, since 75% of the debt is in my name. Outside of our living expense and minimum payments on all the debts, we have about 700 dollars left to our name. I realize that we can just grind it out and put that 700 towards the debt as well and over time pay it off but my problem is that my wife's income is going to end in two years and I'd like to have the debt gone within the next 30 months realistically. I know Chapter 7 has a lot of negative impacts but what do you guys think we should do? I know that we want to buy a house within the next 5 years and the other thing in my mind is that C7 BK would essentially make it to where we have roughly $3000 leftover each month after bills are paid. Our debt is too high and credit is too low to get any kind of reasonable consolidation loan. I'm also not looking for the easy way out either. I just want to see if there's any options i may have missed or if my only reasonable option is to just keep paying 1K+ in interest+$2500 towards payments every month until it's all paid off. Thanks in advance to anyone who comments for your time and advice.",

      "content_preview": "Alright, so here’s where I’m at. I’m 27. My credit’s trashed. I’ve had basically no savings for years, but I’m finally in a spot where I can start stacking some cash. Scores are ugly: Equifax: 541 TransUnion: 551 Experian: 538 The big problems: Aldous & Associates – $5,116. These guys are impossible. They flat-out told me they never do pay-for-delete. Ever. Best “deal” they’ll give is about 80% of the balance. Which… yeah, that’s basically paying almost all of it and still keeping the collection on my report. Date first delinquent: July 23, 2024. Wells Fargo charged-off card – $9,928. This one’s the bigger headache but I think I can get them down more than Aldous. Date closed: June 6, 2024. Credit report is a mess — bad payment history, credit age sucks, no active cards, barely any inquiries. Both debts are not accruing interest right now, so at least the balances aren’t growing. I work two jobs now and bring in around $1k a week. I live with my parents in California and give them about 10% of what I make each week. The rest I’m saving. Here’s my half-baked plan: Save as much as I can, as fast as I can. Go after Wells Fargo first. Try to get them to take less and maybe, maybe a pay-for-delete (yeah I know, long shot). Ignore Aldous for now because they’re basically saying “pay almost all of it or nothing.” Get a Chime Credit Builder so I at least have something reporting positive payments and helping my credit age. Stuff I’m wondering: Do I just pay Wells Fargo without the pay-for-delete and move on? Is there a better order to hit this debt? How do you get through to collectors who refuse to budge? Does being in California change how I should handle this? This is the first time in a while I’m actually making good money and I really don’t wanna waste the chance to fix this. A year from now I’d like my credit to not look like a dumpster fire. Edit: Added that I live with my parents in California and give them about 10% of my paycheck each week. Added that both debts aren’t accruing interest. Added dates: Wells Fargo closed June 6, 2024; Aldous delinquent July 23, 2024. Background: This whole mess started early 2024. I lived beyond my means during a depressive episode in my last year of university with no job. Got my head on straight in December, set up a plan to pay down a smaller Wells Fargo balance of ~$6,500 over a year, and actually cleared it by May once I started working and living way below my means. After posting this and realizing the reality of how tough settlement talks would be, I signed with Fitzgerald & Campbell to help push for a better outcome with the Wells Fargo account.",

      "content_preview": "Okay here’s my breakdowns living in Utah as a 19F 2000-2200$ monthly(just switched jobs for higher pay WOOHOO starts Wednesday! I currently live w my 20m bf. We split or try to split 50/50 with the understanding that he has to pickup more sometimes as he has more money 2000 Car 117$ monthly Car insurance 133$ bi monthly MACU loan 187$ Rent 800$ish Pc loan 152$ Sezzle balance 381$ Grocery 150$ Phone 25$ Credit card 160$(varies) Savings 0$(used it all on an emergency vet trip) So a little information I know I was stupid when I was 18. I was in college and went low contact w family. Good grade. Most of the time had a job. I didn’t have a car for the most time but got one. I was encouraged and I just was naive and should’ve done more. That was April 17 this year. WELL. Turns out my car is a shitty car and I’ll need to get a new one. My bills are mostly okay rn. I haven’t paid my Sezzle balance or my PC loan. I KNOW ITS BAD. I’ve lived in poverty my WHOLE life. So when I got a fresh breath of air I went crazy. I was thinking of this Paying off Sezzle Saving up 800-1200 and seeing if the loan office would settle(I can barely afford that) And then saving 1000$ to put down on a car. Honestly, I’m still trying to be better about my expenses. Well, I’m trying to figure out what to do. I’ve tried four hustles. Dog watching, doordashing, custom shoes, and feet finders lol. I should be getting around 1200$ back from a refund I got. I plan on paying off Sezzle, saving the rest, then building up on it for a one time payment to see if they would accept. Now I didn’t mention this because I HATE borrowing money. I barely asked from my family. Maybe 25$ two times. What could I be doing better? What would you do? I am going back to school for nursing. I will be working and I’ve done quite well for myself as I have my associates already too. Now back to the car issue, my job relies on my car. My car has been giving me more and more issues and is considered an upside down car loan. I know I’m screwed and I can’t afford to pay it off. So it’s really how much I can unscrew myself because I know I’m screwed either way. I have 5700$ left(this was STUPID I KNOW just plz don’t berate me. I already know, I paid for GAP and the add ons) and my car is on the books worth 5300$. Now I need to know what I can do. I’m going to need to get the PC loan figured, MACU loan figured and my car before I try to get a new one.(my car has been giving me more and more issues).  My MACU loan has only 3 months left to pay so I’m aiming to get it done in two which is possible if I live below my means. So I’m leaving that. You already know what I’m going to TRY to do with the PC loan. What do I do about my car? I went to see what they’d give me for my car and it was only 900$ carmax said 1500$. If I roll over the loan with a down payment, I know my percentage I can do or max car loan is 18000$ but I don’t want a high payment either if it won’t fit into my bills. What’s the best thing I can do for this?",

After totaling everything up I learned that my total debt is $53,425, with me paying about $1,903 a month (credit card debt + personal loan). I realized I've made some serious mistakes in my finances but I believe I can come back from this, since I'm the one that got myself into this mess. Below is the breakdown: Credit Cards: Card 1 Balance: $7,504. Minimum Payment: $310. APR: 29.99% Card 2 Balance: $6,952. Minimum Payment: $256. APR: 27.24% Card 3 Balance: $10,262. Minimum Payment: $420. APR: 28.24% Card 4 Balance: $3,115. Minimum Payment: $104. APR: 27.99% Card 5 Balance: $876. Minimum Payment: $25. APR: 0% until June 2026 Card 6 Balance: $3,553. Minimum Payment: $104. APR: 23.24% Card 7 Balance: $6,427. Minimum Payment: $210. APR: 26.24% Almost all my credit card balances above are maxed out Personal Loan Balance: $14,736. Minimum Payment: $474. APR: 28.85% Current Credit Score: 660 Other stats: 30 years old, no kids, no wife, no gf. Paycheck is every 2 weeks (Get paid 2x a month) - $2,989 Other Monthly expenses: Rent: $2,303 / Internet: $70 / Car: $290 / Car Insurance: $170 / Food: Maybe like $200? I want to note about the Personal Loan - Last year I was unemployed for about 8 months, finally after months of interviewing for multiple different roles I was able to get a full time offer for $100k a year, however this was contingent on me moving to a different state halfway across the country. At that time, I literally did not have the funds to make the move to a different state, so I decided to take a personal loan to fund my move in order for me to take the job. I had to move all my belongings, car, etc. I'm now working in my new job, but it's getting pretty hard to make payments on time, I have to pay rent late this month. Please help me on what I should do next. This amount of debt is causing me to go to bed with anxiety, and its kind of affecting my work life balance as well. I'm kind of regretting making the move to a entirely different state, it caused me so much more debt. I'm super lonely in this new state as well. Just working long hours at my new job, worrying about my debt, and having no friends around in this new state is getting to be really hard on me mentally. I've stopped using my CC's. Been buying from the local grocery store: chicken, beef, white rice, broccoli, eggs, oatmeal, protein powder, butter, and other toiletries is pretty much all I buy. Going to stick to this going forward. What should I do next? Avalanche method? Consolidate all my credit card debt + loan? or just consolidate my credit card debt? Should I reach out to a financial advisor? I've never done that before. I'm seeking financial advice from anyone on the best route to take paying off this debt. Thank you so much everyone. ---------- PS: I'm trying to get advice from other subreddits too, but when I post this it immediately gets removed. What's up with that? I don't see anything inappropriate in this post other than someone seeking help/advice.",

I own an arborist/tree service company with 1 crew, do about $300k/year in revenue. I love the industry but hate the liability and business ownership. I don’t even do the field work, I actually do the business admin side. Anyway, we don’t net much due to many variables but I want to get out. The business has some debt, a $48k loan on a spider lift and a $23k loan on a chipper. These loans are 7a express loans through SBA and a local bank. I think I could sell the equipment for around $60k, but will the bank let me do that? Obviously all the money would go back to paying off the debt. I don’t want to default and ruin my personal credit but the business doesn’t have the cashflow to pay that loan off before selling the equipment. Ideas?",

If someone is so far behind in payments that they are trying to settle debt for less than owed, they more than like have WAY more debts than assets. IRS Form 982 allows you to show your liabilities outweigh your assets at the time of settlement and MANY (most?) people pay little to no tax on that settlement amount. QUIT SCARING PEOPLE.

      "content_preview": "Hello! I need advice regarding a matter that involves debt. Upon being hired, I got a moving allowance from my previous company I worked at. The allowance were to be paid back if I had quit within one year of working at the company. Well, I quit before that year for personal reasons and I had talked to my boss in person about the worry of having to pay back that allowance, which he said I shouldn’t have to worry about it (I have no proof of this). So I quit, moved, etc. Almost a year later, I randomly received a text from a debt collecting company with no verification, that was just a photo of a pdf that had my name, address, and,my debt that I had owed and a text that stated: “This is debt company ,  This is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.  Please read the document in the attached image.  Reply STOP to stop text messages from us.” I had called my prior company because I was super confused and they said I had a debt and that it was sent to collections. They said they sent three letters but I never got them. I moved but changed my address, letting them know during before and during tax season. They said they sent letters at the time after I had changed my address so I should have gotten them, but didn’t. My old company didn’t bother contacting me in any other way or verify if I had received the letters. I was just surprised with a random text message from a debt collection company, which they didn’t confirm who I was or anything. Now, I’m waiting on my company to send me the official debt collection letter but it’s already been two weeks. I was reading that how the debt collector contacted me is illegal. I have not reached out to the collecting company yet because I don’t know how to correctly approach this type of situation or know what my options are. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

Of courses they weren’t happy with the amount but it’s what I could offer and did say I would pay more if I could. I just reviewed my account and saw the last time they took a payment was in March. During that time, I suffered complications in my pregnancy so I didn’t notice that payments were not being withdrawn. I can’t afford a lawyer, judgment garnishment would put me out on the street.

I can only afford to pay the minimums every month and it seems like I can’t get anywhere with the interest rates. I’m now finding myself with some medical issues that I don’t even know how to begin paying off. I’ve gone through my savings and even my emergency funds. I’m scared of consolidation companies because they all seem like they’re scams no matter how many i research. I can’t qualify for loan consolidations because my debt to income ratio is so high. I just want a way to consolidate everything so I’m only making one payment a month to my debt, plus be able to save again for emergencies and pay off any extra fees without feeling like I’m stuck just paying interest. I don’t want to tank my credit score, but defaulting on my cards and loans is not really something I want to do either. I feel like I’m always helping people, but can’t get help myself, and I’m just on my last resort with no-one to turn to. Does anyone have any advice or good agencies they can recommend to help?

She got breast cancer, put debt on the card and I'm the only one being served despite her being a cosigner. I can't get a hold of the attorney they sent it to, tried three different numbers, email and their online contact form that errors out when you submit the request. Synchrony is obviously no help, but said they'd reach out to the attorney that served me and ask that they call me. Synchrony never sent a letter, not even a statement even though mine are paper, and they claim I have them a cease and desist? The court says it's not uncommon for collection agencies to avoid phone calls to avoid settlement, but I can't set up even a payment plan.

For a number of reasons I am currently unemployed and living with my parents in Southern California. I was denied unemployment and will most likely be denied disability if I apply. I have normally been responsible with my credit cards, however, I began spending irresponsibly to cope with stress at my work, up until I got hurt, then with no income I began living off of them. Last month, I was only able to pay 1 out of my 3 credit cards. I owe around $7000 to PayPal (synchrony), $5000 to capitalone, and $3000 to chase. I was also suppose to go back to school starting this fall but I don't even know if that's going to happen. I have no excuse for any of this debt. I have completely stopped using my credit cards. I am currently considering filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy, but I am in my mid 30's and am also thinking about how this would be devastating for me in the long run. Does anyone know of any other options I can take? Edit: I should mention I am looking for part-time non-physically intensive work.",

I work about 50-70 hrs a week and still not enough to make minimum payments so two of my accounts have gone to collections and they’re not even large amounts, I just couldn’t pay it! Anyways, any help or advice would help or just some kind of encouragement honestly. I have been telling myself I fucked up my entire life and I seriously think I did. The only thing I pay on time is my rent. I hardly eat or shop for necessities, let alone anything else. In between my jobs I have been looking for another full time job that pays more but I don’t have a degree and it seems like that is required for everything now. I just tried to buy new tires for my car before the rain season starts. I tried using affirm to purchase and this is what I got back ⬇️Pls give some advice. Your credit score: 529 Date: 8/22/25 Scores range from a low of 300 to a high of 850.

I'm just wondering how people are getting large loans ($40k+) with less than stellar credit (I'm talking less than 600)? I've tried applying to so many places but they keep rejecting me due to my credit utilization being too high, low credit score, etc. I get it... why would someone want to lend that amount of money when they clearly have shown they don't know how to spend money wisely? But... people can change. And I'm trying to get a hold of my finances and pay down my debt. What would really help is a way to get a WAY lower interest rate. I've learned my lesson. Once I pay my credit cards off, I'm not touching them. I have seen some people, when they discuss debt, talk about how part of their debt includes tens of thousands owed from a personal loan (let's be clear - I am NOT judging). I'm just wondering how those people are able to get those loans and for that amount? Where did they look? How did they get approved? Have any of y'all had success in getting substantial loans with poor credit? And if you did, were the APRs crazy high?",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone. I have $4,400 in savings. I owe $3,267 on a Citibank credit card 0% interest but will be 29.22% interest on September 1st due to promo ending. I owe $3,354 on AppleCard at about 20.24% interest. I have a dental procedure coming up that is not covered by insurance. I’m anticipating $2,000-2,500 out of pocket. I am upside down on a car lease around $5,000. The lease end is 2/2027 but I want to turn it in early and purchase a cheap car cash. The mileage is creeping up and payment is $399 a month. Currently has 19,000+ miles, contract is for 30,000 miles. I want to avoid the over mileage fees since I am already in the red on the car. I am not sure where to start or what to do. The dental issue was unexpected and not sure if I should save the $4,400 to put towards paying for it or use that money savings to pay off a credit card. Any advice is helpful. Please be kind!! Thank you!! Monthly income: $2200 Car worth $20k trade in and $23k private sale Extra left over each month: $1100",

Yesterday, I got a letter in the mail saying Portfolio is filing a motion to garnish my wages. Bankruptcy isn’t an option for me right now. My question is: can they legally garnish another 25% of my wages if I’m already being garnished?",

      "content_preview": "Location: Florida, USA. TLDR on the bottom. I am being sued by Barclays for credit card debt right under $6k. It was an old card that I was making monthly payments on and then they double charged me one month in 2022 or 2023. When I disputed the second charge with my bank, Barclays removed my bank account. Being that this was the only account I had, I couldn’t set up an alternative payment. I was also abroad for an exchange program and tried to use the chat to remedy the issue. They told me to call and I kept forgetting to do so and that’s when things started to spiral out of control. A few months ago, they attempted to serve me but I was out of town on family medical leave of absence. I was able to postpone the pre-trial/meditation, but the day crept up quickly. I have to attend tomorrow morning and I have zero clue what to do. My income is very low and ideally, I would like to pay a lump sum and just make it go away. I could pay $1,000 to $2,000. I don’t know what the stipulations of lump sump vs monthly payments are. Do you have to pay the lump sum right then and there? I called the collections company a few months ago to see if I could pay a lump sum but ended up getting nervous and ended the call because they were asking me several questions about my monthly payments and assets and I was worried about answering the wrong way. Additionally, I have a friend who is dealing with  the same issue with a different CC company and went through the pretrial to set up monthly payments. She was applying for government jobs and told me she was told she was declined an offer because the background check showed her CC issue. Idk how true this is, but could this happen to me? I work in the public sector and am actively looking for a new position and this is a real fear for me. What should I do tomorrow? Is there a way for this to be expunged? Should I try to negotiate some sort of plan at the pretrial? Is there any path to avoid court and all of this by dealing with them directly? I would appreciate any help. I have no idea what I’m doing and I’m terrified. Thank you in advance. TLDR; tomorrow, I have a pretrial/meditation for a $6k Barclays debt. I don’t know how to handle it and what the long term consequences will be financially and on my background checks. How do I navigate this? What is the best course of action?",

      "content_preview": "You can read my initial post and a few updates (thru May) in my other post here in r/DebtAdvice , but I thought that post was getting a bit long, so I'm making a separate post for this update. 137k in credit card debt - spread across multiple cards, including AMEX, Discover, Citibank, Chase, and a SOFI personal loan. I entered into 9.99%, 48 month repayment plan with AMEX and 0%, 48 month repayment plan with Citibank. Cards are closed. I entered into 0.99%, 60 month, repayment plan with Discover. Card is closed. Chase has been good about letting me know when cards will be suspended and closed. They offered 6% payment plans that turned into 2% payment plans that turned into 0% payment plans. All were 60 months repayment terms.They now are offering Settlement, but I need to contact them. They have not offered an actual settlement amount yet. I have 5 maxed out cards with them (totalling about $70k), so each one will take a separate settlement conversation, I'm sure. As I've read here on Reddit, Chase keeps their collections in-house, so I'm inclined to wait on them while I deal with SOFI. SOFI never offered me anything. I completed the income/expense survey weekly and, truthfully, indicated income=expenses with nothing left over. The last time, the message back was that the account was too far delinquent. So, I sat and waited. They have now offered me (via email) a settlement of 35% and I have until August 28 to accept. They indicated they may charge off the loan on September 30. Unfortunately, I don't have 35% to pay. They want either a lump sum or 3 payments. Chase has indicated in their messages that any settlement would need to be paid within 93 days of acceptance. I have not received imcome since May and so I haven't been able to save anything for a settlement. I am working again and will contact SOFI before Sept 30 to make an offer based on what I can realistically afford.  I'll contact Chase around that same time to see what they are offering. I'll update this as I progress through this adversity. For anyone going through anything similar, I encourage you to consider your options. Bankruptcy is not an option for me. Chapter 13 is essentially what I've been doing myself (hardship payment plans). While I had severe anxiety and nightmares about my financial situation, once I set about putting my plan in place (after MUCH research), I was able to breathe a bit. I plan to file IRS 982 (to show my liabilities outweighed my assets) to offset any 1099 misc income I get for the forgiven debt. I don't plan on needing credit for a long time - if ever, which is good because my credit score is like 400 right now. 😳 But, I'm working through getting my debts settled and starting fresh and THAT is the most important thing. And, yes, I have contemplated the unimaginable ... Some days are much harder than others. So, if this sounds like you, know that you are not alone. It's just money. It comes and goes and you CAN make more. It isn't the end of the world - or you. It's embarrassing and incredibly depressing, but don't let it be the thing that defines you. This DEFINITELY is not going to be what defines me. F cking rich people hang us little people out to dry with schemes and scams and embezzlements and ponzi sh t and ...  they default on loans all the time. I don't feel bad anymore. Sorry. You shouldn't either. Just be brave, take the bull by the horns, get out of this mess and make every attempt to be and do better. That is all you can do. 🙏❤️",

We entered into a debt relief program last August and have been paying them $1200 per month to “settle and pay our debt off”. We thought everything was going along fine until last month when I got served twice in one week with judgments from creditors. After calling the debt relief company and demanding a payment history we discovered they have only paid about $4000.00 in debt this last year. We paid THEM $14,400.00!  When we spoke to them they indicated they would now make these two creditors a priority. I have yet to receive an accounting of where our other $10k went. We struggle to every month. I work about 50 hrs a week and my husband works about 40 hrs per week. We consulted a couple of Bankruptcy attorneys and our only option is a Chapter 13. There is too much equity in our house plus we make too much for a Chapter 7. The Chapter 13 plan would cost us as much per month as we were paying to the debt resolution place. We have stopped paying them. So our monthly cash flow would improve by $800 as the attorney wants us to include the car loans in the chapter 13. I want to see our house. We have about $120k in equity. If we sold the house, we could payoff all of the charged off debt, owing debts, payoff car loans and walk away with $50k. We would need to rent for a year which is not cheap but we would be debt free otherwise. What are your opinions? How do I convince my husband to sell the house? BTW…all of the debt is in my name and the house is in my name. TIA",

      "content_preview": "When we were young, we got into a lot of debt and filed for a Chapter 7 “BK,” as they call it. Not filing a Chapter 10 was the only thing we did right. (Even our lawyer didn’t know that people are finished with a Ch. 7 three years sooner.) Rich people file for bankruptcy all the time, but usually a Chapter 11, because the company suffers the blow, not the person. In a Chapter 7 you pay a small amount each month but you don’t have to return any cash advances. In a Chapter 10, you get a clean slate, but it lasts for ten long years. That’s a decade. If you do file for any kind of BK, please keep one card for emergencies. The court only knows what you tell them, especially if it’s a card you owe nothing on. My husband had a corporate card that saved us on a trip in a foreign country! Credit cards are a must-have. Alternatives? Yes! I can attest after a long life on one income that you don’t have to put yourself through any of the Orwellian weirdnesses of a BK if you just stop paying “unsecured debt.” (Secured debt is your house or rental and your car, if you’re making payments.) Credit card companies sell you a product that they hope you will abuse, because they double or triple the interest rate when you appeared financially stressed. What to do if your payment was late: First of all, I’m not a lawyer, but I’ve learned that if you call and make the payment to a person, you can ask (about twice a year) to be refunded the fee “as a courtesy.” The same is true for checking accounts. More important, ask them NOT TO REPORT IT TO THE CREDIT BUREAUS. Don’t forget your spouse. What to do if a debt has gone to collections: Don’t come an agreement with them. If you can make payments, make them to the original company that leant you money. There is no point in paying someone that buys up debt just to make money off it. It doesn’t do anything for you or the original lender. It’s punishment, pure and simple, as nobody will go to the trouble of suing you. Most of us are small potatoes. If the bank or credit card was cruel, JUST STOP PAYING. Each month your credit will improve, you won’t go through the nonsense of a BK, and the ding to your score vanishes after seven years. In fact, if you hear from a debt collector, work out exactly how long it’s been. Taxes have to be paid, but the IRS is surprisingly nice. They will accept amazingly small monthly payments. (Student loans? I don’t have any advice there other than to not go to college, or to study in England, where tuition is much less expensive, even for Americans.) If you’re earning a living, you have power. If a dentist defrauded you, don’t pay him! It’s YOUR money, YOUR life, and YOUR self-respect.",

      "content_preview": "Last 3 years I left the military , was under constant substance abuse and made terrible financial choices, not caring about anything. I’ve woken up recently and biting the bullet on my past mistakes, gotten 100% sober. I have a motorcycle 6.6k , car 23k and CC debt 5.3k to sort out. I have 7k in the bank, was contemplating paying off either my bike or CC fully and slowly deal with the other crap. Question is, should I do so, or slowly let the financial bleed continue, with interest etc and pay everything slowly over time? Thanks.",
