      "content_preview": "So I met a girl on dating app yesterday, it was a verified legit looking profile. we talked for a while on app and then she insisted on meeting in like 5 mins of talking(1). I got suspicious, the number here will be denoting suspicion . I asked for her whatsapp number she gave me a whatsapp business number(2).I checked her number on truecaller and it showed another name with another registered email ID(3).So today we decided to meet and the meeting point was decided as lake mall. When i reached lake mall and called her for her whereabouts she asked to come to charuchandra college(4).we met there and she insisted on going to some cafe and sit as it was raining. I insisted on going to mall and sit in food court but she was stubborn on going to cafe and i gave up and we went to cafe(5). It was shady building and poster of hookah were advertised. At that time my instinct kicked in  that it was a honey trap.As she opened the lift door I strongly insisted on going to mall or the date is over. She said she will not go to the mall so i left the building and went to the mall and called uber and left for home. after reaching home I googled the name of cafe and there were many reviews of honey trap scam. Instinct saved me today.Don‚Äôt meet anyone in shady cafes,only meet in public places. the name of cafe is CAFE SHIISHA CULTURE.",

      "content_preview": "So I (19F) was trying out the MG Road to Noapara metro route today from college to home. Didn't expect the metro to be crowded like bloody Bongaon local otherwise I'd have taken the bus or booked a cab. But since I had already paid for the ticket I somehow got on the metro. There was barely any place to keep one of my feet. Now I had my backpack slung in front of me instead of my back. This one man (I couldn't even get a proper look at his face because it was too crowded to even turn around and look at his face) had kept his hand near my chest. At first I didn't think anything of it as the metro was so packed and it didn't feel like he was deliberately keeping the hand there. But slowly he started sliding his hand inside the small space between my backpack and my chest and was very obviously trying to grope me. I tried to turn the other way or shift a bit away from him but it was impossible in that crowd. When the train reached Girish Park and there was the usual chaos of people getting on and off, this man used the moment to press my chest deliberately before getting down. This is the first time something like this has happened to me and I feel so damn shaken and traumatised. I mean I know even worse things happen to women in India and part of me feels like I shouldn't make a big deal out of this but I can't help but feel absolutely disgusted and revolted. I can somehow still feel the ghost of his absolutely disgusting touch on my chest and it makes me wanna puke.",

There‚Äôs so much greenery, the roads are clean and free of potholes (from my own experience), and the AQI is less than 50. There are three ponds nearby, with one right next to my building. People here are warm. I don‚Äôt eat sweets and usually prefer home-cooked food, so I haven‚Äôt tried much outside yet but I‚Äôll definitely try during Pujo. I‚Äôm also learning Bengali by talking to local vendors. From next month, I‚Äôll start pandel hopping which I‚Äôm really excited about. Honestly, I moved to Kolkata randomly without any expectations and trust me, in Delhi I was just surviving but in Kolkata I feel like I‚Äôm truly living. So, I‚Äôd love suggestions which are the major spots for pandel hopping, and where can I meet people offline? Please recommend some good cafes or clubs. Edit: This post is about appreciating Kolkata and its people, not about Delhi, which is my home city. Delhi is the best metro city in India in every way.",

So I work at a CA firm in this city which is run by a Marwari and Bihari CAs. So back when I joined as an intern they used to behave differently with me, i ignored it back then cuz you know the way Indian workplaces are...fast forward to yesterday, I apparently \"disturbed\" them because I called one of the CAs and asked him regarding some work and it was Ganesh Puja day. So they burdened me with lots of work just when it was time to leave( they did not give me any work the entire day) i gulped down my anger and worked and went home and called up one of my ex co worker asking that why are my bosses doing like this, then he reveals this bombshell that \"They wanted to kick you out of the firm because you're a Muslim and one of the partners of the firm hired you on your merit so the other partners got angry\".....one of the partners even remarked that \"Muslim staffs are a bad luck for a Marwari's business and they should never be employed\"........I was completely shocked....and I am still shocked....I wanted to take a transfer and leave the firm but they're not allowing....subjecting me to mental harrassment every other week. The same CAs also remark every now and then that Bengali staffs are like a leech and suck everything out of a business once given the opportunity. I still remember them saying \"Bangali log ko mauka doge na toh aisa kaat ke jayega ki soch se bhi upar hai'",

Near Shyambazar he started racing with other buses, not picking up passengers, just speeding. While coming down Tala bridge toward Paikpara, he hit a cyclist ‚Äî the man fell under the bus with a loud crash. Instead of stopping, the driver accelerated. People panicked and began jumping. I saw a woman in a burqa fall while escaping. Finally, the bus stopped near Chunni Babu Bazar, and the driver ran away through the window. Locals said the cyclist died. I feel sick after witnessing this. Anyone from Paikpara BT ROAD please confirm.",

After a few stops a man got on the bus and stood right next to a girl who I assume was returning from her office too. That man was clearly rubbing his crotch against the girl. I thought someone will say something but no one did. There was a grandpa sitting next to the girl and I know he knew what was happening and still didn't say anything. After seeing this for a few minutes I got up from my seat and stood next to the man. The girl was in tears. I confronted the man saying to move away from there as the girl was clearly having problem. But the girl said she wasn't having any problem and the man argued with me saying that he can stand where he wants. But after the confrontation I stood by the man and the man also moved a bit away from the girl. Now what I want to know is, why did the girl say she was not having a problem??? I did see her in tears and that man was clearly harrassing her. If she did say something after my confrontation that man would have faced some consequence or something idk. I want to know it from a woman's POV.",

I almost walk for Chai to DLF 1 post 11-12 at night it is open till 1 AM and many girls in different clothes which is termed is \" not safe for girls\". Today 1st time I noticed near Coal Bhawan a girl in \"black suit\" was walking in front and just behind were two men in around 40s or 50s look similar to auto walas not local for sure. I felt the girl was feeling unease to I just started walking other side of the road because she was constantly looking back and felt unease. Later I over take her other side and was far but then I noticed them they were surely following ger and talking about her. So I just stared them with a look so that they knkw they are not going unnoticed and I'm here. later I started walking around her enough close to hear steps and not too close to discomfort her finally when my home was close, I stopped her at near by apartment where there was more light and some people so she would not feel uncomfortable and asked her where her home is and are they following her. She said she was enjoying her time sitting near coal bhawan from there they were staring her so she left and her home is near by. I followed her till she reached her gali. Is it common? because I'm here from 1.5years and never experienced the same. Even with my female friends we have walked late night this is first time I'm seeing this. And I used to say others that no matter what political status is but West Bengal is really safe for girls",

      "content_preview": "I saw this post that mentioned about the high profits that Kolkata airport has managed. Now curious about this piece just dug a little deeper. AAI runs Kolkata airport. I looked into the airport revenue and profits of AAI run airports and Kolkata not only makes the highest revenue and profit it does it with a healthy margin. Its profit of around 660 crs is 2.5x the nearest contender Chennai which makes around 280 Cr Ref: AAI Annual Report (Page 166/176) That led to the question why it so high. So every airport has four sources of revenue Aeronautical (take off, parking, terminal and gate rentals and UDF- user development fees, aviation security fees) and Non-Aeronautical (advertising, retail, dining etc). In case of Kolkata, 4/5th of the revenue is from aeronautical. Reference So now we are talking about the traffic that it handles directly. Now one of the things that directly impacts us as passengers is the aeronautical fees. So that drew my attention to the UDF fees and I recently found the details with respect to the UDF fees that get added to the base airfare. UDF Fees Apparently Kolkata has a high UDF fee as compared to its peer Delhi, Mumbai- even considering that Kolkata does not have a public-private partnership. 644 (For Kolkata) as compared to 129(Delhi) and 175 (Mumbai). This seems steep, and gives a sense that Kolkata is charging higher per passenger traffic handled. When it comes to the projections that Kolkata airport is giving: it projects passenger volume to increase by 1.45x with 2020 as the baseline. However the projections for revenue growth from aeronautical expenses is 5x [from 829 Cr to 4550 Cr). So what it basically means is that planes landing/taking off and other expenses related to handling cargo/passengers would increase. Ref Who foots the bill? It is us through higher pax fare value. So next time if you are wondering why a return flight from Kolkata is more expensive than the flight that you took from Delhi to Kolkata or Mumbai to Kolkata, you have the answer: the AAI is filling its pockets from you airfare. And while I don't want AAI to run into losses. What I would rather want is Expansion of Kolkata airport for more international flights (maybe open a terminal) Or equitably distribute the profit sources and not cash Kolkata as the golden goose",
