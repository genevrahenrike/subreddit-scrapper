Proudly Canadian 🇨🇦, made with locally sourced peppers and fresh, all-natural ingredients : no artificial preservatives, gluten-free, vegan, and absolutely packed with bold flavour. 🔥 Why it’s different: Every bottle starts with produce from Canadian growers, think vibrant Ontario habaneros, rich local pumpkin, and fiery Scotch Bonnets & Ghost Peppers from passionate small-batch farmers. Whether you’re craving a fruity Scotch Bonnet kick for your tacos or the full Carolina Reaper punch for your wings, these sauces are flavour-forward with just the right hit of heat : no overpowering vinegar, just fresh, balanced spice. I’ve tried a LOT of hot sauces, but this one nails it: heat that makes the flavour shine . You can taste the quality in every drop and if you want to support a Canadian-made product and add some legit flavour to your meals, this is it.

Would love to hear if it's showing up for others too! Also, heads up: if you pick the Cheese Pizza option, it actually lets you customize the sauce and add up to 2 toppings, so you're not stuck with just plain cheese - and you don't need to order two identical pizzas either. Pretty great value if you're looking for a cheap and easy meal!",

I’m part of a small team working on something called EH!, a new social app that’s fully made in Canada and built to help people discover what’s going on around them, connect with others nearby, and support their local community. We built it because honestly, most social platforms just aren’t designed for local life . They’re loud, global, and not super helpful when you’re trying to find a market, art crawl, trivia night, or cool new café in your own city. With EH!, we’re aiming for something more grounded: Local feeds for events, groups, and places Interest-based communities, not influencer hype Follows, not follower counts Eventually, tasteful local ads from real Canadian businesses — not drop-shipped junk It’s available to download now (iOS + Android) so you can get a heads-up when it launches later this summer. Our goal is to build something that supports real Canadian connection — whether that’s friends meeting IRL, local creators getting visibility, or small businesses reaching actual neighbours. 🔗 https://www.ehnow.ca Would love your thoughts, especially from folks who care about buying and supporting local. Does this feel useful to you? What kind of local stuff would you want to see in an app like this? Thanks for reading 🍁",
