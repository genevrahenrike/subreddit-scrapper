      "content_preview": "'m not sure if this violates rule 4 or not, it's not so much a medical question but more of a sharing your stories question? as at the end of the day I'll have to do my own research and consult with my doctor who I have an appointment booked for next week. So, to go through some background health for context I guess.. - Celiac - Chrons - Anxiety / Depression - GERD And I take Immunosuppressants. I've been hesitant over the past few years about taking medication, esp. as they've been offered to me. I much preferred a natural route, not to say I reject medication but because I don't want to build a reliance or have a hard time coming off of something or how it can impact me in some other mysterious way but I have to acknowledge every medicine ever can have a adverse side-effect. In Canada, I feel like there is a culture of lazy doctoring and people just get prescribed stuff for no reason, and theres this online culture where everyone has ADHD/BPD, again I'm not trying to shame anyone but it's how it appears. My issues has been that daily tasks and activities seem like a pain and I just spend all day dreading/planning to do it rather than actually doing it. I've recently come to a conclusion that my health is based on my sleep, if I'm sleeping on time and normally life is great, if I'm not life is terrible but I'm stuck in this cycle of good sleep, and bad sleep. I have a hard time working for more than 5 hours, I can't study, and in school I couldn't do assignments until the day of, or day after after asking for extensions. even daily tasks such as showering and washing feel like a pain, and I wonder, is there a chemical imbalance? or is it my lifestlye? I multi-task, and my day to day consists of scrolling on the internet, playing a video game/chatting on one monitor while watching a tv/movie on the other, even when talking to friends i'll mindlessly scroll on my other monitor, I also ubereats A LOT, and jerk off to the point I'm even spending money on stuff. I hate living this way and at this point I'm looking at Vyvanse as some miracle drug that will help get me back on track, but I'm worried about the effects and I'm looking to you random people of the internet for stories and experiences.",

While I know it takes an adjustment period, my family is very very concerned at my new behavior within just the 4 days, but I guess I don't realize it as much as they do, I'm assuming it's part of the adjustment but I'm thinking they might admit me if it gets worse yet, I'm half joking on that last statement. Googling it isn't helping either, so I'm coming to Reddit where the answers might be. I had my wife proofread this because I know right now I can't trust myself",

It has been revelatory: helping to make sense why I've always struggled with maintaining my focus for long, poor working memory, being easily distracted, frequently seeking out \"fun\" activities (usually reading, or putzing around online), and difficulty with home/self-maintanence. I'd like to see a therapist about it, try to get an assessment to be sure, and possibly get medication. Unfortunately, money's pretty tight with me right now, and those things are unfortunately a luxury at the moment for me. If I'm able to move onto a better-paying job, I'd like to rectify those. Until then though, does just the knowledge that I quite possibly have ADHD might help to increase the effectiveness of the coping strategies that I've developed for the symptoms that I had been dimly aware of? How about you? Beyond offering clarification, did just knowing that you have ADHD help a little in managing it?",

So, I’ve been working on a calmer alternative: Reminder Rock™ - a small, screen-free, pebble-shaped timer that glows gently and vibrates softly when time’s up. Something you can actually hold in your hand, without it feeling like another distracting gadget. But before I go further, I’d love input from people who deal with this every day. I put together a super short 2-minute survey to learn what frustrates you most about timers and focus tools, and whether this idea would actually help. 👉 First 100 responses are entered to win one of the first Reminder Rocks.

It’s called SympTrack AI — a free app where people can anonymously track medication side effects and see how others on the same meds are reacting. No account required, no data selling, and no ads — just a clean way to spot patterns and feel less alone. If this isn’t the right place to share it, mods feel free to remove — I’m not trying to advertise anything, just genuinely hoping it helps people who’ve been through the same stuff.

      "content_preview": "Long story short. I go to the VA for my healthcare. I'm 52, male. \"Officially\" I don't have ADHD... And what I mean by that is that they gave me a whole battery of test and had me talk to somebody and the results came back and basically said that I have many symptoms of ADHD but that I have managed a relatively successful life without medication, and I have other things that could be causing a lack of focus. Mild depression. Possible sleep apnea. medical ******  use (I was smoking less than 1/2 a gram at bed time ...but pretty sure the Dr doesn't believe I smoked that little...but it's true) So since I don't \"technically\" have ADHD...I just have all of the symptoms... The Dr gave me Strattera and Wellbutrin. I was frustrated at first because I'm going back to school and sucking at it ...I used to be able to deal with the symptoms more because I did outside sales for work. But now because of other health issues I can not. That said ...I would like symptom relief and at least he's giving me something to help. I have webutrin 150 for a week then 300. Straterra 40mg. So far this is day 3....the insomnia has really kicked my butt hard. I'm taking in the AM. I haven't noticed many other side effects. I'm tired but I'm tired from leukemia medications and other stuff anyways combined with not sleeping good it's not super dramatically different than before. I'd appreciate any experiences for how long before the insomnia went away. And also any older adults like me that have had good success with it.",

As an adult in the workforce, I’m really struggling with how people present themselves (nice, friendly) and how they act away from me or to others (lying to a coworker, being friendly but passive aggressive or a tattletale). Basically, I have a hard time aligning the two sides and being nice without viewing them in a friend capacity or opening up too much bc my brain thinks friendly demeanor = safe person even when logically I know that’s not true.

      "content_preview": "I was diagnosed with ADD in my early 20s (~10 years ago). During that time they had me cycle through a few different medications at different dosages. Of those I found that methylphenidate was the most effective, though it had the following effects: Sensory amplification Heart rate increase Personality changes (I was much more serious and focused, whereas normal for me is to joke a lot, probably too much haha) Significant memory improvements. I don't have a very good short term memory, and almost no visual memory, but on the methylphenidate, I could play back things said earlier in the day verbatim in my head. I don't consider myself having issues paying attention, so I think this might have improved my working memory or short term memory. Restfulness improvements - most of my life I would wake up feeling tired and had a hard time getting out of bed unless I had a reason (job, school, etc...). On the methylphenidate, when I woke up I was ready to go and could get out of bed immediately. I decided not to continue on meds at the conclusion of the trial. Later on in my early 30s, I decided it would be helpful to be better rested and improve my memory, but upon trying methylphenidate again, I noticed none of the early effects other than the increased heart rate. Has anyone else, observed an effect like this? If so, were you able to resolve it? I'll note that I have some history of inflammation, but nothing that majorly impacts my day to day.",

The other night I was taking on phone after a long time and idk why in the heat of moment and guilt I said I want to try to rekindle it but we agreed that my tendencies are obviously a hurdle and we’d sleep on it. Now that I think about it, the same loop of overwhelm is taking over and I honestly can’t think that this is my shiny syndrome and I’d just drop the idea as soon as reality will hit me. I don’t want to make the poor sweet soul suffer again and not sure how to even have the conversation that ends in me saying no again. I honestly feel so guilty that these things, the way I am causes suffering to others. Any idea how I can be nice. Already a big asshole at this point. Why can’t I hold shit man. I’m like the worst. All that initial wit and charm pulls others close and then me being the salty bich unable to control my thoughts end up being bad to others. All help is appreciated",

      "content_preview": "My (F, 31) closest friend (M, 40+) struggles with depression, ADHD, and what I would describe as a strong freeze response (that state of inner paralysis where even small tasks feel impossible). He is very reflective and self-aware, and he can describe his patterns in great detail. The problem is that he often gets stuck in explaining and analyzing things instead of taking action. Daily life tasks pile up – finances, contacting his health insurance, organizing his living situation, even things like showering, cooking, or tidying up. He can sometimes handle a part of it (e.g., making a call or paying a bill), but it often leaves him exhausted and with no sense of relief or accomplishment. There are a few dynamics that make this even harder: Continuity is very difficult for him. Sticking to routines or plans almost never works beyond a short burst. Pressure quickly leads to panic attacks. Even small external expectations can feel overwhelming. Autonomy is extremely important to him. He is very sensitive to anything that feels like control. Even gentle suggestions sometimes feel like “being managed.” Distance: He lives 3 hours away from me, so I can’t just drop by to support him practically. I have tried to help by motivating him, suggesting very small plans, and being patient. But honestly, it’s exhausting. It often feels one-sided, as if I’m the one holding his progress together. I don’t want to become his “project manager” – I want to stay his friend. But I also care deeply and don’t want to just walk away. My question to you is: For those of you who have been in a similar place (either yourself, or supporting someone close to you): What actually helped you take small steps forward out of that freeze state? What kind of support from others was genuinely helpful – and what felt like pressure or control? Were there small rituals, routines, or structures that made a difference? If you were the friend/supporter: How did you manage to stay supportive without burning out? TL;DR: My close friend has depression + ADHD and often gets stuck in freeze. Continuity is very hard, pressure leads to panic, and autonomy/control are big triggers. He lives 3h away, so I can’t help often practically. I’ve tried to motivate him, but it drains me. What has helped you (or your loved ones) in a similar situation – and what kind of support works without creating more pressure?",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, With ADHD, completing daily tasks and doing this consistently seems to be one of the biggest challenges for me. I believe we all know the reason behind it: the lack of dopamine and the inability to feel accomplished after completing a task. I want to try a support system where basically you can work with ONE person (I feel like group settings usually lack the actual accountability we need) and be extremely open about your goals, tasks, responsibilities, chores, etc. But there are things that I would give myself and others some grace, such as: When we create to-do lists, we just add too many goals that are not realistic to complete in a given time (we usually underestimate the time it will take). We either go all in and try to get so many things done or get overwhelmed and accomplish almost nothing (the ADHD paralysis). Emotional regulation becomes a struggle especially when we are upset with ourselves for the things we cannot get done. For this reason, I feel like we should gradually improve our productivity and acknowledge that starting slow but then raising the productivity one step further each day is the key. And we don't have to be perfect, any action is better than no action. Personally, I would like to have an accountability partner who is very close to my timezone, is transparent about their tasks (and I mean all the simple tasks such as brushing your teeth to reading X number of pages of a book that day to pay your X bill) and REALLY wants to make a change in their life. If this sounds interesting to you, you can use the template below to basically look for accountability partners close to/in your timezone. Please note that the goal of this partnership should be to get things done together, not to let our ADHD get the best of us by distracting us and finding ourselves chatting about our favorite TV shows for hours. Best of luck and thank you for reading this! Name: Ali Age: 30 Gender: M Timezone: GMT +3 What I am looking for in an accountability partner: Someone that really wants to manage their ADHD better by doing bodydoubling, is OK with having video calls for the bodydoubling to work, transparent about the tasks they need to achieve each day and despite the ups and downs of ADHD, can check in with each other by keeping the communication up. I would also prefer an open minded individual that is against any sort of discrimination.",

      "content_preview": "Posting this as a warning to anyone considering GetMindfulHealth for ADHD treatment. My spouse (early 30s) had one telehealth appointment with them. He was honest at the start and said that back in college he tried a friend’s Adderall once , and it had no effect. That experience was one of the reasons he suspected ADHD. Instead of appreciating his transparency, the clinician accused him of “doctor shopping” and seeking meds for recreational use. For context: He takes no medication other than the occasional ibuprofen. He does not drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs. His father passed away in June, so he was seeking help while grieving. Despite one appointment, we were billed ~$400 for three months of service. The only prescription written (Wellbutrin) was sent to a pharmacy that doesn’t take our insurance, so he received nothing. Support denied escalation, no one ever called us back, and when we emailed, the only response was a 20% refund offer, twice. Out of frustration, I shared our experience publicly on social media. Within 30 minutes of posting a comment on their on Instagram, they suddenly replied and processed a full refund, but only after admitting the case had already been escalated internally. Then they asked me to take down my reviews. This isn’t how legitimate healthcare should operate. If you’re considering them, PLEASE be careful, especially if you’re vulnerable or grieving.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, Looking for anyone who is or has been through  a similar experience. I have several health conditions (low testosterone, diabetes, and sleep apnea) that share some common symptoms of ADHD, such as poor executive functioning, poor memory, fatigue, inattentiveness, being aloof, and anxiety. I first got treatment for the low testosterone and diabetes, which helped and lightened the common symptoms, but still had symptoms. I then started quelbree for ADHD, which sharpened my focus, but the symptoms still existed. Finally, started on a CPAP machine and the symptoms improved drastically. With low testosterone and diabetes, those are confirmed definitely with blood tests and a sleep study confirmed sleep apnea, all of which helped me overcome those cognitive symptoms. That leaves me with ADHD. From asking people that have known me for a long time, they all said that they did not think it was ADHD, even when I sent them literature about it. The ADHD questionnaire demonstrated I may have ADHD. I had my doubts as well, but the symptoms were there and quelbree did help my focus and my spouse was pushing for any improvements. I now wonder if it was even ADHD in the first place and if I should even be on quelbree. The last thing I need is to be on a medication I do not need, even if there is an improvement in focus. Thanks in advance for any advice or comments.",

I'm strictly doing E-Ink because I want something easier on the eyes and disincentivizes Instagram, youtube videos and others. Here's what I have so far but I'm curious if other people have experience. Minimal phone: Full Android experience QWERTY keyboard and touchscreen $500 for a 1st Gen phone (has issues) Worst camera in the group Mudita Kompakt: Best UI and might be best experience in general Apps can be side loaded fairly easily Privacy and digital minimalism are key points NO contactless (NFC) or encrypted texting for Android (RCS) Bigme: COLOR E-Ink display and high refresh rate which is very appealing. cheap for better and worse (good entry device but does feel cheap based off reviews) Made by a Chinese company with servers based in China so no idea what their data security will look like. Decent camera Punkt MC02: -Full fledged 'smart' E Ink phone $600+ Has the best camera Best Security I saw something about subscriptions and that immediately turned me off I'm leaning towards the Minimal Phone or the Mudita Kompakt but I know I'll have to make some other 'sacrifices'.

      "content_preview": "Hello. Lately for some unknown reason, my time blindness makes me only be 100% conscious of what I’m actually doing during the first hours of the day, and the late hours before bed. All the time in-between is a mess. I’m on my vacations and I’m not doing much things honestly, aside from planning a lot of things, obsessing over others, and decisions that keep draining my energies, that I end up not taking as the days go by. And that’s giving me anxiety… But the worst of all is that the things that I do during the day are so boring and inconsistent, that at the end of the day it is hard for me to recall what I’ve done. Also for some reason my energies are in the low range. I think this is more like depression than ADHD but… man, first thing in the morning I have so many things I want to do, but then at the end of the day (like now) I think “oh god, I think I haven’t done even a quarter of the things that I wanted to do”. And all of this is with meds, as I had a two-week meds holiday but I’m already taking them for twelve days. At first it was like they weren’t working after the two week break but then after 5 or 6 days I noticed them working again. But despite that, my body just doesn’t want to do things but to lay on the bed. And thinking… it doesn’t hurt but it completely drains my energies. I suspect what I need is a routine back, otherwise, while I stay at my home, I feel like my apartment is eating my soul little by little… I need to go back and be productive but honestly my energies are under zero. So many things to do, but I just can’t…",

I do have a car but I plan on not driving it once a week to save wear and tear and gas. (Here's some context) I have been working on feeling comfortable at my place. I have a lot of game consoles and a laptop. So I noticed that when I wake up I typically start the first couple hours of the day on binge watching YouTube or being on screens. The other half of the day feels miserable because I feel overstimulated. I struggle having a morning routine. I do have hobbies: Magic the Gathering, going to the gym, and watching some anime. (I used to love drawing but I got burnt out) What do you guys do suggest or do? I do understand that the screens are the problem but I feel compelled to be on them because they're there.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone — I’m looking for some advice or thoughts from people who’ve been through similar situations. Over the past couple of years, I’ve started questioning how my brain works. I never used to think ADHD could apply to me — in fact, when colleagues said they had it, I thought, “That could never be me.” But then I started reading other people’s stories (on Reddit and elsewhere), and I was shocked by how much I related. It felt like someone had written out my experience. Here are the things I’ve been struggling with most: Huge difficulty starting tasks, even when I want to Chronic procrastination and doing everything last-minute Poor memory — I forget what I was doing or saying constantly My mind feels chaotic and impulsive most of the time Inconsistent routines — I do everyday things differently all the time Constant fidgeting, blurting things out, interrupting Strong fear of rejection, and very negative self-image I decided to speak to my GP (UK-based) and went through the NHS assessment process. The outcome came back today — they said I didn’t meet the criteria for ADHD, and that I wasn’t “hyperactive or inattentive enough.” I left feeling confused and kind of dismissed. I know I wasn’t super articulate in the assessment. I struggle with describing emotions clearly, and some of my answers probably downplayed how much these things affect me day to day. But it still feels like something deeper is going on. I’m not trying to self-diagnose — I just want to understand why I find basic things so hard that others seem to manage. If anyone has been in a similar position or has advice on what helped, whether you were diagnosed or not, I’d love to hear it. Thanks so much in advance 💛",

      "content_preview": "I've recently got diagnosed with ADHD, mainly because I suffered all my life from starting new hobbies, only to burn out from them after some time. But now that I have an explanation as to why I can't stick with something I love(d)... Everything collapsed and I'm just disillusioned. Nothing seems worth starting anymore, let alone pursuing because I know how it's going to end eventually. My creativity has become predictable. My therapist told me to arrange myself with cycling through hobbies, but what am I supposed to arrange myself with if my brain kills the joy/thrill/excitement before it even has the chance to come up? Has anybody found a way to deal with it or knows what to do? Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I’m struggling with how (or if?) to help my daughter (19) living with ADD/Anxiety. A few truths: She is our only child and I am an admitted Type-A co-dependent and working on this through therapy -ADD aside, she is incredibly laid-back until something triggers her anxiety, at which point she gets quite reactive before shutting down completely We do have a good relationship but I am absolutely a trigger for her. Some of this could be typical mother-daughter dynamic. Both her father and I have enabled her to develop what I would describe as ‘learned helplessness’ She is also in therapy and takes adderall The struggle is that I don’t know what my place is as she transitions into adulthood with adult responsibilities, tasks, obligations, etc.. She is entering her sophomore year at college and seems either oblivious or unconcerned with things such as shopping for items needed to furnish her off-campus house, checking her student e-mail to let us know her tuition bill has been posted, making necessary Dr. appointments with her Psychiatrist and OB/GYN to ensure prescriptions don’t lapse (I did mention making these appointments to her because I knew this isn’t something she would have thought about, but made it clear she needed to make the appointments). My therapist suggests we need to let her learn some lessons the hard way. In theory, I understand, but it just seems harsh, especially when some consequences could literally change her trajectory (unpaid tuition equals being dropped from school; expired prescriptions could have very detrimental consequences… etc.) I would love to hear from some young adults who have been in her shoes. How did (or could) your parents best support you? What do you WISH they would do in my situation? It just feels like we’re on a hamster wheel and I don’t know where to go from here.",

I always personally try to hear everyone else, I always try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and I always try to accept that I can easily make assumptions about people due to a lack of understanding and contacts, and that I should always be open to listen to people. no one ever seems to extend this courtesy to me. everyone seems to have their thoughts set in stone and there is no changing it.",
