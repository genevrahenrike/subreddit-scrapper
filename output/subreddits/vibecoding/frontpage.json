      "content_preview": "Well, could you? With Framer or Webflow or stuff like that you can build a website with pretty much 0 coding knowledge, of course if you want something very custom you'll need some coding knowledge, but even then that can be vibe coded. Internally we were just creating Figma designs and using the MCP to bring it all over to Claude, since then we've moved to Kombai since it fits our tech stack better and it brings over stuff from Figma a bit more efficiently and straight into our code but I'd say 90% of our web app is entirely vibe coded at this point, and new tools that do it more efficiently just keep coming out (there's already a ton of them like anima or locofy as well). I believe the average consumer (if not pretty much anyone using your website or app that doesn't have some extensive tech knowledge) just won't be able to tell how it was made, and bugs are present in everything anyways, it's just a matter of fixing it. What do you guys think? Have I swallowed too many vibe coding pills?",

      "content_preview": "I have heard the argument that AI will replace junior developers so many times, the more I think of it, the more I see it's full of holes. Take the example of a simple dev team at a company that consists of a senior developer and a junior developer. The company decides to lay off the junior developer and have AI do his/her work. - AI does their work as in vibe coding? Who is vibe coding? The senior developer? If he's busy vibe coding all day long doing the junior developer's work, who is doing the senior dev work? Is the senior developer context switching between his senior dev work and vibe coding junior dev work? - Is the senior developer going to enjoy this new type of work that full of context switching or will he think of moving to another work where he's doing senior dev work that he was hired to do in the first place? How's the company benefiting if it sees its senior developers moving to another company? - Why is the company hiring junior developers in the first place? To save money or for them to gain a lot of experience and business knowledge and stay at the company and become senior developers in the future? If the latter, then why lay them off? - AI will create induced demand. If you're more productive by using AI and vibe coding, guess what will happen? The company will always find more work and more things to try and more features to add. It will always find more ways to make more money and this means more work for the developers. Until we have robots, whether physical or software, that can read and understand the business requirements in stories and program against them totally autonomously, developers will always be needed. Whether they vibe code or not.",

This is especially problematic with AI tools, which excel with clear instructions but struggle with ambiguity. The solution is a systematic workflow that transforms ideas into precise, executable plans, like a detailed guide for an intern. It‚Äôs designed to be clear for humans and computers, enabling seamless work across sessions or devices (e.g., start on one tool, clone the repo, and continue elsewhere). This workflow uses a modular \"plan\" folder with \"specs\" (detailed blueprints for each project part) to organize everything, minimizing reliance on memory and preventing drift. It leverages AI language models (LLMs) for planning, code generation, and refinement, with deliberate context clearing to maintain focus. Many modern AI tools (e.g., Claude, Cursor, or custom setups) allow custom commands or instructions in their settings. The AI world moves fast, so **read the documentation** for your tools to automate steps like generating specs, running tests, or creating branches. Alternatively, paste this guide into your tool and ask it to tailor the workflow to your setup for maximum efficiency. Spend time upfront (days or weeks) planning to save time later. Break projects into small, self-contained specs for manageability. The result is reliable, scalable solutions that match your vision, with automated quality checks. #### Folder Structure Setup Create a repository structure (e.g., in Git) to organize all project documents: - `/plan/`: Main folder for planning docs. - `Project Description.md`: High-level overview. - `Tech Stack.md`: Chosen technologies. - `Requirements.md`: Global requirements. - `Development Plan.md`: Overall step-by-step guide. - `/specs/`: Subfolder for individual specs. - Each spec gets a subfolder, e.g., `/specs/spec-1/`. - `Description.md`: What this spec covers. - `Requirements.md`: Detailed needs for this part. - `Design.md`: Architecture and flows. - `Tasks.md`: Step-by-step tasks with success criteria. - `Progress.md`: Track status (e.g., \"Spec 1: Completed, merged\"). - `Workflow.md`: Execution guide (detailed below). This structure is the project‚Äôs \"memory,\" ensuring clarity and portability. #### Phase 1: Ideation & Global Planning ‚Äì Build the Foundation Turn vague ideas into a clear plan. **Brainstorm the Project**: - Spend 1-3 days defining the problem, features, user flows, and goals. - Document in `Project Description.md` with specifics (e.g., \"As a user, I want to log in securely to access my data\"). - Take breaks to spark new ideas. **Refine with LLMs**: - Input the description into an LLM; ask for summaries, improvements, gaps, and alternative perspectives. - Automate: Set a custom command (e.g., \"Refine project description\") in your tool to streamline this. - Refine 2-3 times in fresh sessions (clear context each time). - Output: Polished `Project Description.md`. **Select Tech Stack**: - In a new session, input the description and request stack suggestions (e.g., frontend, backend, database). - Automate: Create a custom instruction like \"Suggest tech stack with questions\" in your tool. - Refine 2-3 times; compare options in another session. - Output: `Tech Stack.md` with rationale. **Create Global Requirements**: - Input description and stack; generate a doc covering functional/non-functional needs, security, etc. - Automate: Use a command like \"Generate requirements from description and stack.\" - Refine 2-3 times; cross-check alignment. - Output: `Requirements.md`. **Break into Specs and Development Plan**: - Input all docs; ask the LLM to divide the project into modular specs (e.g., Spec 1: User Authentication). - Automate: Set a command like \"Create spec folders from description\" to generate `/specs/spec-1/` with `Description.md`, `Requirements.md`, `Design.md`, and `Tasks.md`. - Tasks.md: Small steps with dependencies and test criteria. - Create `Development Plan.md`: Sequence of specs and timelines. - Automate: Use a command like \"Generate development plan from specs.\" - Refine 2-3 times for clarity, especially for non-developers. - Add `Progress.md` to track status. #### Phase 2: Design the Execution Workflow ‚Äì Automate and Simplify Document a reusable guide in `Workflow.md` for building each spec, ensuring consistency. **Workflow Overview**: - Work spec-by-spec, clearing LLM context each time. - Use Git: `main` for production, `testing` for integration, `feature/spec-*` for specs. - Test-First: Write tests before code to define success. - Automated Checks: Local and CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) for linting, types, builds, security, tests. - Track progress in `Progress.md`. **Detailed Steps per Spec**: - **Start Spec**: Clear LLM context. Input `/specs/spec-1/` contents; instruct execution. - **Create Branch**: Automate branch creation (e.g., `feature/spec-1`) via a command like \"Create feature branch for spec.\" - **Test-First Development**: - Generate tests based on requirements. - Automate: Use a command like \"Generate tests from spec requirements.\" - Code step-by-step until tests pass. - Run checks: No type errors, linting issues; build succeeds. - **Validate Locally**: If OK, commit (e.g., \"feat: implement spec-1 login\"). - **Push and PR**: Push branch, create PR to `testing`. - **Trigger CI**: PR runs automated workflows: - Lint/type checks. - Full test suite. - Security scans. - Code quality analysis. - **Review and Merge**: If checks pass, merge to `testing`. - **Clear and Proceed**: Update `Progress.md`, clear context, move to next spec. - Automate: Tools like Claude or Cursor allow custom commands (e.g., \"Execute spec with tests and branch\") to script this flow. 3. **Refine Workflow**: - Input draft to LLM; ask for gaps and simplifications. - Automate: Use a command like \"Refine workflow for clarity and safety.\" - Optionally: Have one LLM instruct another for execution (advanced). 4. **CI/CD Setup**: - Configure GitHub Actions: - On push/PR: Run tests, scans, builds. - On merge to `testing`: Deploy to staging. - On merge to `main`: Deploy to production. - Automate: Tools can generate CI configs; paste this guide and ask for tailored workflows. #### Phase 3: Execution ‚Äì Build Spec-by-Spec Follow `Workflow.md` to implement. **Environment Setup**: - Install dependencies, set up local dev (e.g., containers). - Automate: Use a command like \"Set up dev environment from stack.\" **Execute Specs**: - Use AI tools for code/tests, inputting one spec at a time. - Automate: Custom command like \"Code spec tasks with tests.\" - Work across devices: Clone repo to continue anywhere (e.g., Claude Code, VS Code, or mobile tools). - Clear context per spec to avoid drift. **Integration**: - Merge specs to `testing`; run integration tests. - Fix issues iteratively. #### Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Deployment ‚Äì Ensure Reliability **Testing**: - Comprehensive: Unit, integration, end-to-end. - Automate: Command like \"Generate test suite from spec.\" - Run coverage reports in CI. **Validation**: - Local hooks: Pre-commit/push checks. - Automate: Set up hooks via tool settings or scripts. - PR Reviews: AI-assisted or manual. **Deployment**: - Staging (`testing` branch): Auto-deploy. - Production (`main`): After validation. - Monitor with basic logging. #### Key Benefits and Tips - **Automation**: Leverage tool docs to script repetitive tasks (e.g., spec creation, testing). - **Flexibility**: Clear plans enable pausing/resuming across tools/devices. - **Error Reduction**: Modular specs and test-first approach catch issues early. - **Non-Developer Friendly**: Docs guide AI tools to handle coding. - **Scalability**: Start with MVPs, scale with team reviews. - **Time Efficiency**: Upfront planning speeds up completion. Paste this guide into your AI tool and ask it to adapt the workflow to your tools, stack, or needs. Practice on a small project, and you‚Äôll build reliable solutions with ease. You‚Äôve got this! üëç",

      "content_preview": "Hey folks. I wanted to post this here because I‚Äôve seen a lot of flak coming from folks who don‚Äôt believe AI assisted coding can be used for production code. This is simply not true. For some context, I‚Äôm an AI SWE with a bit over a decade of experience, half of which has been at FAANG or similar companies. The first half of my career was as a Systems Engineer, not a dev, although I‚Äôve been programming for around 15 years now. Anyhow, here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre starting to use AI for prod code. You still always start with a technical design document. This is where a bulk of the work happens. The design doc starts off as a proposal doc. If you can get enough stakeholders to agree that your proposal has merit, you move on to developing out the system design itself. This includes the full architecture, integrations with other teams, etc. Design review before launching into the development effort. This is where you have your teams design doc absolutely shredded by Senior Engineers. This is good. I think of it as front loading the pain. If you pass review, you can now launch into the development effort. The first few weeks are spent doing more documentation on each subsystem that will be built by the individual dev teams. Backlog development and sprint planning. This is where the devs work with the PMs and TPMs to hammer out discrete tasks that individual devs will work on and the order. Software development. Finally, we can now get hands on keyboard and start crushing task tickets. This is where AI has been a force multiplier. We use Test Driven Development, so I have the AI coding agent write the tests first for the feature I‚Äôm going to build. Only then do I start using the agent to build out the feature. Code submission review. We have a two dev approval process before code can get merged into man. AI is also showing great promise in assisting with the review. Test in staging. If staging is good to go, we push to prod. Overall, we‚Äôre seeing a ~30% increase in speed from the feature proposal to when it hits prod. This is huge for us. TL;DR: Always start with a solid design doc and architecture. Build from there in chunks. Always write tests first.",

Think about it this way: if a developer used to bang out maybe 100 lines of code on a good day. Now with AI doing like 90% of the grunt work, you'd expect the same developer will be chilling and only writing 10 lines, right? Nope. What actually happened is now we are shipping 1000 lines a day because suddenly everything feels possible. The AI cranks out 900 lines, but guess what? You are still writing 100 lines - except now it's all the gnarly stuff. The edge cases, the architecture decisions, the \"why is this AI-generated function acting weird\" debugging sessions. All those features that used to get shot down because they'd take forever? Now they're \"quick wins\" that end up on my plate. Prototypes that should stay prototypes somehow become prod systems because \"we already built most of it\". The bottleneck went from \"how fast can I type\" to \"how much complexity can my brain handle\" - and spoiler alert, that doesn't scale like machines do. Is this just me going crazy or is anyone else feeling like we've accidentally created way more work for ourselves?",

      "content_preview": "The answer is not the tools I use, but lies in the process I am using. If you vibe code tools or even use AI a little bit, you are well aware of how many documents you have to write before you start building the actual project. And how easily hidden discrepancies can sneak into those documents if you don‚Äôt review and correct them line by line. Now here comes my solution. I cloned a simple voice agent from GitHub and set it up to interview me about the project I want to build, step by step, until it fully understands every aspect of the project. It then generates the final spec sheet or documents in the relevant format for the coding tool I choose in it. You can also try the same using Chat GPT voice AI. Have a conversation with it, and let all the context accumulate in the chat history. Once it has enough context, end the voice chat. And prompt it to create detailed spec sheets (not just a PRD but proper spec sheets). Then, use any coding tool you prefer to proceed. I feel productive with this workflow. A 10 min conversation saves me from lots of manual tasks. Although experiences can vary, some might feel less productive with it (MAY BE). But if you try it, let me know what was your experience. I felt productive with it and I thought it might be worth sharing.",

I noticed whenever i post - get lot of comments from coders or Expert devs but very little from begineers... I am a VibeCoder and started my Journey a bit earlier Oct24  before ' Vibecoding' term been coined by Andrej Karpalthy in Feb 2025. Built 25 apps with replit in 2024 ( was one of early adopters of Replit) Sadly recent times there has been lot of hate for Vibecoding and as hard truth been looked down upon by seasoned dev. Which i somehow understand- The vibecoding hype hid the fact that building Apps is challenging and required deep understanding of systems and code.Not as easy as advertised. But, I want to connect with fellow VibeCoders like me. To share my Journey ( my APP got featured in Ycombinator and Hacker news and went Viral few months ago). Please comment !! if you are non coder and want to part of this journey of learning to code and vibecode beautiful ,funtional and hopefully safe APPS.. Cheers !!",

      "content_preview": "TL;DR: Been coding for few months with heavy AI help. Can understand and modify code but can barely write anything from scratch. Is this normal in 2024 or am I doing something fundamentally wrong? My Current Situation I started learning django about 3 months ago. I've built some decent projects: Web applications with user authentication Real-time features and live updates Database-driven applications API integrations Here's the catch: Almost all of this was built with AI assistance. I'm talking 80-90% AI-generated code that I then understand, modify, and debug. What I Can : Reading complex code and understanding what it does Modifying existing features or adding new ones Understanding system architecture and data flow Explaining how my applications work ‚ùå Things that make me panic: Starting a blank file and building something from scratch Coding without AI assistance for more than 30 minutes Technical interviews that require whiteboard coding Quick prototyping or coding challenges Remembering syntax and methods without looking them up The Speed Difference is Insane Without AI: Building a simple login system takes me 2-3 days of struggling, googling, and getting frustrated With AI: Same login system takes 2-3 hours, and I understand every line This efficiency gap is making me question whether I should even bother learning to code \"the hard way.\" The Imposter Syndrome is Real I constantly feel like I'm cheating. When I show my projects to people, they're impressed, but I know I didn't really \"write\" most of it. It's like: Others see: \"Wow, you built this complex application!\" I think: \"I just got really good at asking AI the right questions...\" Questions That Keep Me Up at Night Is everyone using AI this much? Or am I over-dependent compared to other beginners? Will this hurt me in job interviews? What happens when they ask me to code something live without AI? Am I actually learning programming or just learning to be a better prompt engineer? Should I force myself to code manually even though it's painfully slow and inefficient? Is this the new normal for learning in 2025? Should I embrace it instead of fighting it? What \"Real Programming\" Feels Like to Me When I try to code without AI: I spend hours on syntax errors I forget basic concepts I swear I understood yesterday I get stuck on problems that AI solves in seconds I feel overwhelmed and want to quit Simple tasks become day-long ordeals But when I use AI: I focus on logic and problem-solving I learn patterns by seeing good examples I can build complex features quickly I spend time understanding rather than syntax hunting I actually enjoy the process What I'm Really Asking To experienced developers: Is this AI-assisted learning path going to bite me later? Should I step back and learn fundamentals the traditional way? To other self-taught devs: How are you balancing AI assistance with building core skills? What's worked for you? To hiring managers: What are you expecting from junior developers in 2024? How much AI dependency is acceptable? To anyone who's been in my shoes: Did you feel like a fraud when you started? How did you build confidence in your actual coding abilities? My Goals I want to be genuinely useful to a development team. I want to: Solve problems independently when needed Contribute meaningfully to projects Debug issues without panic Learn new technologies without starting from zero every time Feel confident calling myself a \"programmer\" I'd really appreciate honest feedback, even if it's tough to hear. Am I on the right track or do I need to completely change my approach? Thanks for reading this long post i used ai to structure my words ! üôè",
