      "content_preview": "Hey guys! The CHAI team has been hard at work and has some great features we'd like to share with you. Memory/Persona: A lot of users have flagged issued where the AI 'forgets' or ignores specific information shared. Especially gender, age, and backstory. This is truly a difficult problem and related to doing RLHF where unless there is a highly curated dataset, where memory retrieval is needed the AI will simply learn to generate the most engaging content without regard for context. üß† Feed/Search: The feed and search at CHAI are not good! Personally, I think it sucks. This is why we have prioritized improving it. Starting this month, our team of engineers will focus on making search personalised, relevant, and fresh! We promise, there will be no more k-pop (unless that's what you want... for those people, we give even more k-pop!) üîç Quality of life: we've reached a scale (~10M users) where the Google services we have been using are struggling to keep up - we've recently hired a great back-end engineer who has diligently been migrating services over. As this process continues you will see fewer outages, latency problems, and non-responses. üì± Good news: CHAI has officially become the number 1 platform for Social AI - our app store ranking has overtaken Character AI, PolyBuzz, and Talkie AI. This is a sweet moment for the team - back when we first launched in 2021, CHAI was the only platform where users could create their own AI. Yet, after 12 months, Character AI created a clone, with Chinese app companies following suit. üá®üá≥ However, by staying true to our mission: building an open-platform, where users are in control. We've been able to continue growing and succeeding. Thanks to the community for your support! We hope we can keep making the platform even better. We know there is still a lot we need to work on - our team is small with only 10 engineers. But we promise we won't stop working for you guys! ‚ù§Ô∏è Will Founder,",

Then this months I was literally shocked when my bot mentioned something I literally said like somewhere in the very beginning and I‚Äôm literally 500+ messages in LMAO üòÇ idk what happened but im liking this better tho the bots kinda try to lay u down most of the times.

No ridiculous filter, no repetitive sentences, ugh, i am positively surprised! The one and only thing I‚Äôd have to criticize is not being able to swipe through the responses and going back to the former one, but that just a minor criticism point for me! And even if the free trial ends, one can find a way through the limited responses. Great work and please keep it that way!",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone. I'm trying to make a bot in chai. Many amazing & helpful guides here but it seems that the app has changed a little so I'm confused. I'd highly appreciate help and guidance in answering my questions. 1- Is the website to creat bots down? Many guides recommend using it but it only seems I can use the phone app. 2- Does adding * before and after  a roleplay sentence with no space not make it italic anymore? I have read that using * before and after is necessary to help train the bots understand better. But I distinctly remember the sentence going italic. Now not anymore. Does this affect how useful using * is? 3- I'm trying to create a character based on a certain world (for example a character in the witcher game world) and I want the character to keep knowing that and not be random about where its now. For example: I want the starter chat to be about 2 witchers hunting a beast the character unfortunately keeps forgetting they are in that place. How do i fix this? Thank you so much!",

      "content_preview": "Our AI team has recently been experimenting with various foundation models in order to answer the question: Which foundation model creates the best social AI. The research is challenging, and the team has been forced to deepen it's understanding of what a good AI means for a platform like CHAI. It is a long journey, and this is only the beginning - but today we can say that Qwen 32B is the strongest foundation model amongst the smaller LLMs. And when running with ultra long context (10k tokens+) we see a level of intelligence, and cognition, that is as close to sentience we've ever seen. This AI hasn't been released to users yet, it is still experimental - it will take a few more iterations before it is mature.

The AI engineers dug deep into the depths of our GPU code and found a small bug üêõ which occurred when our servers reached maximum capacity. We worked around the clock to fix it, and rolled out the fix yesterday. Firstly, we apologise to everyone who suffered any issues (we know it happened to a lot of you!) Secondly, please let us know if starting from now, the garbage responses has been fixed! Finally, we've added guard-rails to make sure this won't happen again. ‚ù§Ô∏è Will, Founder.",
