      "content_preview": "Hey everyone! Been a while since I posted anything here. TI’s coming up, the hype is slowly building up, for most of us it isn't enough, but wcyd. So I figured, instead of being negative about it, why not do my part. Why not do what I’ve been doing every year as a coach/player for my teams, but this time for the community instead? I’m gonna be breaking down the TI teams inside out: drafting, playstyle, strategies, player roles, ratings, replays… the whole deal. It takes a lot of time, so I’m not sure how many I’ll manage before the event starts.  I’ll try to cover as much as possible. To keep things fair, as I'm sure some of it will be used by the pros too, I’ll start with the favorites first. The first one about Team Spirit is out, I recorded all of it before they played Fissure Finals, but they had to standin and I focused mostly on their full roster. Here's the link : Team Spirit TI14 full analysis Lately I’ve been focusing a lot on educational DotA content, basically what I used to do before I was “Ceb,” back when I wrote blogs some of you old-timers might remember. So far I’ve made guides on the laning phase, and what I call “dissects.” The concept is simple, I take a replay from a pro performing really well on a hero, and break everything down for you guys. On stream I realize a lot of people aren't aware I'm doing that, so I'll link a bunch here. Yatoro Faceless Void carry with dominator Sumail Magnus mid Nisha Ember mid Ws Axe offlane Miposhka Bane hard support etc... Anyways, hope you'll enjoy the content. I'm mostly posting it here to get constructive criticism, ideally on the dota part. What can be improved? What's interesting? What is too far fetched / boring etc. You probably have quite some feedback on the aesthetics xD, I know it must be ugly, tried my best though. Just a dota guy at the end of the day. Take care, and enjoy TI! Much love from Ceb",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I’ve been working on a massive prediction project for The International 2025 (TI14) Swiss stage. Instead of just going off vibes or recent match results, I combined multiple approaches : Monte Carlo simulations (1M+ runs) Performance data (June–August 2025) Elo + Glicko2 models Expert heuristics Upset potential After crunching everything, I generated a summary card, plus raw data files with probabilities for every team (who’s more likely to 4-0, 4-1, drop to elimination, etc). EDIT: Quick clarifications: the intro paragraph was AI-generated just for readability, since I don’t post on Reddit often, i just said to chat: please make me a body and title for my monte carlo predictions, but all simulations, probability matrices, and calculations were done with real match data and code. The Monte Carlo Swiss sims assign each team a probability distribution over final records (rows sum to 100%), and the “final picks” table is a single illustrative run, which is why Team Nemesis can show 2-3 despite their highest probability being 0-4 or 1-4. Early fast outputs used independent per-team estimates, so column sums may not match slot counts, but proper joint simulations enforce exact slot counts. Bottom-tier rows sometimes looked like “5 teams in bottom 3” due to showing all low-probability teams; the bracket itself respects the elimination slots. Expert heuristics and upset potential incorporate recent scrims, roster volatility, and H2H tendencies on top of Elo/MMR. Group constraints in rounds 1–4 slightly shift early probabilities, explaining SEA teams like Nemesis being more likely 1-4 than 0-4. For Tobi standing in for Tundra, the model uses base team Elo plus player delta plus a chemistry effect accounting for role fit, hero similarity, prep time, and overlap, producing a small Elo/MMR drag (~–10) that modestly lowers BO3 win chance; simulations capture variance across events. EDIT 2: ADDED PLACEMENT AND CHAMPIONSHIP PROBABILITIES. POSSIBLE OUTCOMES! SECOND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES! CHAMPIONSHIP WIN PROBABILITY PLACEMENT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION",

Boots, wand, wind lace, raindrops, tp scrolls, dust, mangos. Meanwhile my teammates treat theirs more kindly. Waiting more time between trips. Sometimes sitting in trees buying tangos. Like they just want to respect their couriers time. Now I am sitting here feeling guilty. This poor donkey/bird has been tirelessly running errands for me. I never once said thank you. So what about you guys, do you feel guilty? And don’t get me started on how many times I get my courier killed. Should I actually apologize in all chat anytime I get my courier killed?",
