      "content_preview": "I just got to episode 1 of season 6 and honestly needed to take a break when the guards handcuffed Maria and Gloria together in the shower and tell them to kiss. Didn’t even finish the scene tbh. From what I’ve gathered about the rest of the show, it seems like it’s going to continue going down this kind of “tragedy porn” route in terms of any storylines. I honestly had to grit and bear my way through season 5, and I was really hoping the story might refocus on the women’s lives/backstories with chances of redemption or even just little flickers of humanity for the characters we’ve been following all this time. Instead, I feel like the writers might just continue with escalating how cruel and psychotic the guards will be towards the inmates, which I personally don’t want to sit through. Is there any more worthwhile story building in this show?? Or is it basically just watching these characters suffer relentlessly until an anticlimactic end??",

And I know she’s a tomboy and dresses different but if you’re going to do a dress, maybe you can ask her if she could do a single color dress or like a nice bold color like red or purple or like a royal blue would go really good with her. but also since she’s a tomboy, maybe you could have her dress respectful, but still able to be herself ,maybe she could’ve worn a pantsuit, girls look very respectful in pantsuits. Also weren’t pantsuits a popular thing for business women of Boo’s childhood time period? I get pantsuits were less common, but weren’t they still a thing during her childhood? I guess they were trying to make a point of how her mother never listens to her and that she’s constantly being pressured to “be a girl.“ and traditional views. (I.e.:Girls wear dresses)and her mom didn’t listen, never accepted her, and the estrangement between her and her mother. But I mean come on, the mother should have some compromise.",

I remember even pausing the TV to make sure I was hearing right. 🤭😂 However there were multiple songs throughout the series that I found so beautiful, haunting and just catchy. My favorite being... \"Release me\" by Corrina Repp. This song played during the scene of Pousseys death, when Taystee laid down next to her and the credits came. It has always stuck with me and it never fails to give me goosebumps when listening to it. 🤍 another HUGE one, \"hush\" by Trills 🇨🇴",

      "content_preview": "i hated them, honestly think the show got bad after season 5. i mean season 4 was extremely sad and emotional and season 5 was chaotic and some scenes were hard to watch but it’s like they completely gave up on the show in the last two seasons. it makes sense that some of the prisoners would end up in max but to make it last two whole seasons and ruin many storyline, torture characters (like red, frieda, tiffany, lorna etc) and completely write off loveable characters just to quickly show them in the last season with no closure or explenation (big boo, soso, angie and leanne which even tho they are bad people were a comic reliefs) (also the fact they completely ruined tiffany’s and boo’s friendship and boo never knew that she died i will never forgive them for that cause their friendship was so wholesome and important to tiffany’s character development) don’t even get my started on maritza. i mean i know they wanted to show the reality of america and stuff but maritza was also a really funny and sweet character and her duo with flaca was a relief to watch and they gave her no closure at all. the barb storyline was interesting but all those new characters it completely got out of hand, daya becoming some kind of mafia drug dealer even tho i understand her downfall the storyline kind of sucked, the whole piper and alex situation with the cheating ? again their relationship was always chaotic anc toxic and even tho they always found their way back to each other the cheating situation didn’t make sense i think it was ooc for them. again they gave them almost no closure, just a quick scene without sound of piper visiting alex in ohio i think? which implies that again they made up cause i mean they litteraly got MARRIED but it wasn’t clear at all and i feel like the ending was just bad and disappointing for a show that lasted so long and was so intense and emotional. the whole taystee situation also, it really is sickening, i get they were trying to show a message but i mean it is a tv show so they could have at least given the fans idk some hope ? sometimes i just think about the ending and it makes me mad",

Years have passed and I decided to watch again from the beginning with the intention of watching all the way through, this time having introduced my wife to it too. We binged our way through the first four seasons (we have 9 week old twins so oitnb has been an amazing night feed watch for us!) but struggled a bit with s5 since the whole riot thing seemed to drag. We’re now on s6 and struggling even more because it suddenly feels like a whole different show. We took a little break but we’re pushing through since we do want to finish it, but does it ever go back to feeling like the earlier seasons? Do they go back to the original setting? I need to see everyone’s ending, but I’m not enjoying it as much as I was :( we’re currently starting s6e6.",

Something where you saw what they were going for, but it just fell flat for you. For me personally, it was Badison. I could never buy that she intimidated people or ran anything. No shade to the actor, but for me the character wasn't interesting or funny. One of the more baffling choices I think the writers made. I love this show and I''m very interested in your thoughts!

      "content_preview": "I'm watching season 7 and that's some pretty serious stuff. Of course this show always portrayed darker side of life, but it was always put next to these little moments of happiness- looking for chicken, making shoes out of pads, generally everything looked more lighter and colorful. Now, we have grey and pale background, Red's and Lorna's mental decline, ICE, baby killers and  genital mutilation. I'm not saying it's wrong or that we shouldn't talk about this, or that everything should be all raindow and sunshine, but I can see a lot of series changed dramatically in the same years- GOT(I mean, winter actually came), even Modern Family started to use different light, becoming more \"mature\". I kind of miss little cringe niches and stereotypes from 2010-2017(maybe 18?).   I miss sun on screen!!!",
