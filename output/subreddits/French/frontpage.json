      "content_preview": "In English it's quite easy since the term \"date\" is often used by Gen Z in day to day life and is also commonly agreed upon to refer to a romantic outing. And when you tell a girl \"Can I take you out on a date?\" she knows what she's in for and can't play the \"but I thought we were only hanging out as friends!\" card. In French on the other hand, you don't really have an equivalent except maybe the word \"rencard\" but A, no one under 40 uses that word and B, using it in a phrase like \"ca te dit qu'on fasse un rencard ?\" doesn't sound right anyway. I know about the \"Ca te dit d'aller boire un verre ?\" phrase but that still doesn't convey the romantic intent as well as the word \"date\" does. So yeah that's why I was wondering what terms you guys use and if there's no equivalent term, how can you convey that it's a romantic outing without being ambiguous?",

Mon accent, je dirais qu'il est bon. Il est un peu défectueux quand je parle en réalité, mais il marche encore. Mais mon écoute ? Elle est carrément nulle. Je comprends une phrase qui a moins de quatre mots, mais après ça ? Je suis perdue, même si elle est simple. Je trouve difficile à regarder et écouter beaucoup de choses françaises parce qu'elles me rendent assez fatiguée. Mais chaque fois que j'en choisis, j'utilise toujours les sous-titres français. On m'a dite que lire les sous titres, ça m'aidera à voir les bruits écrits de la langue. J'ai aucun doute que ça, c'est le cas. Et ils m'ont bien aidée avec la prononciation beaucoup de fois. Par contre, j'ai l'impression de ne pas apprendre comment distinguer les mots de la langue à cause du fait que mon cerveau décide peut-être plutôt de se concentrer sur la signification. Peut-être, mon cerveau se détend parce que c'est plus facile à lire ce qui est écrit à la place de ce qui est vraiment dit ? Y'a quelqu'un qui a des conseils pour moi, là ? Vous pensez que c'est bien d'arrêter d'utiliser beaucoup de sous titres ? Peut-être je devrais étudier plus souvent, comme regarder un truc français sans les sous titres, écrire ce que j'ai entendu, puis voir ce qui est vraiment dit ? J'aimerais vraiment être capable de comprendre sans sous titres et avoir des conversations orales. Merci d'avance ! En plus, il faut que je mentionne ne pas vivre en France ou à un autre pays Francophone.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I’m a Chinese high school student. My goal is to reach B2 in French within the next 2–3 years, because I want to study in France. This makes me a bit anxious since my time will get tighter in the future. The problem is: I feel stuck and demotivated. Grammar is especially hard for me—it feels punishing, and I don’t see how things connect even after finishing a textbook. I’ve tried different methods (tons of input, sticking to one coursebook, etc.), but nothing really feels effective. Unlike English (which I had to learn at school), French feels easy to ignore. Could you share advice on: •\tBuilding a study system that connects knowledge •\tDealing with grammar in a less painful way •\tBalancing coursebooks vs. input •\tUseful resources (books, grammar guides, input materials) •\tWhen to start preparing for B1/B2 exam tasks Any help or personal experience would mean a lot. Merci 🙏",

Or is there a different word to indicate \"safety\", in the sense, \"I feel safe here at night\", \"It is not a safe area\". I would love to hear some thoughts on this, thank you in advance! P.S. if an anecdote interest you, the reader, there were some teenagers on the metro 6 in Paris today who opened the door that connects two coaches and tried to stand in between. I did not know if I could say \"ce n'est pas sûr\", so I said \"ce n'est pas \"safe\", and I have never been ignored and looked down upon worse than how two of those boys looked at me today 🥲 oh and people from RATP came and told them off anyway.",

I am trying to translate 'La Foule' by Edith Piaf in order to learn some of the words, and one of the phrases says 'nous ne formons qu'un seul corps' in reference to the narrator and a man she is dancing with. Why does this phrase use 'ne'. 'Nous formons qu'un seul corps' seems to make more sense, whereas 'nous ne formons qu'un seul corps' seems to say 'we don't form one body' (and I think the phrase is trying to convey the opposite). Also, the verb 'former' when put into google translate, says 'to train', rather than 'to form.' Can anyone explain this? Thanks very much",

Un plaisir délicieux m’avait envahi, isolé, sans la notion de sa cause. I'm not sure how to exactly understand the last sentence. Is isolé an attribute of plaisir , or is it dependent on avait ? In other words, is a correct paraphrase “A delicious pleasure had invaded me, (a pleasure that was) isolated, etc.” ora rather “A delicious pleasure had invaded me, (had) isolated (me), etc.”? The doubt has caught me while reading this article from “The New York Review”: https://www.nybooks.com/online/2025/08/24/on-translation-practical-translation-merve-emre/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=NYR-083025-Emre_translators&utm_content=NYR-083025-Emre_translators+CID_793775e72f6140006aa6b8779707c177&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_term=Practical%20Translation%20Proust (I hope it's not paywalled), where several English translations of that passage are shown, and different translators seem to interpret this in different ways: for instance “An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin” and “A delicious pleasure had invaded me, isolated me, without my having any notion as to its cause.” Or might the ambiguity be deliberate on Proust's part? EDIT: Sorry for the misspelled “ambiguous” in the title. EDIT 2: Exchanged the order of my paraphrases to make it consistent with ordering of the other translations.",

      "content_preview": "I was August of this year, years old when I learned that code Lyoko is a French cartoon. I've been meaning to get back to watching it, but my current french level is around lower B1. I found out that I can watch it for free on YouTube, but I'll like to ask this subreddit if it's something worth watching. While it is a show that was translated from French to English (it's usually the other way around) it is also around 25 years old. Is it worth watching now to learn French?",

Quand j’ai su que Marie était en réunion avec Théo, je lui ai aussitôt envoyé un message. ⁠La phrase porte à confusion. ⁠La phrase ne porte pas à confusion. ⁠La phrase ne porte pas à confusion, si on remplace « , » par « : ». ⁠Je ne sais pas. My question aussi est: pourquoi cette phrase porte a confusion?",

      "content_preview": "I absolutely love the language, and I would like to be able to sound as close to the natives as I can. I'm a beginner but I would like to perfect it as much as possible from the beginning. I love the poetry and the romantic aspect of it and I'm willing to dedicate my time and effort to achieve this. Given that the Greek 'γ' is pronounced the same as the French 'r' and the Greek 'τ' and 'λ' are pronounced the same as the French 't' and 'L' do you think achieving the almost-native effect is easier compared i.e. to English speakers? Have you ever had experience with a French-speaking Greek? (I'm also a musician so I generally pick up sounds and rhythm pretty easily.) Thank you in advance, love from Athens!",
