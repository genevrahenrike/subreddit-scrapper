      "content_preview": "Hey, I am taking part in a University Rover Challenge, and am part of the antenna team, our job is to find a new antenna and base station system as the current system is far too powerful for the distances we operate at. The current system uses 5 GHz, 13 dBi antennas on the base and rover, along with a ubiquiti rocket M5 base station. Currently we are looking into reducing the frequency down to 2.4 GHz and are considering a 4-6 dBi antenna on the base, with a 1-3 dBi antenna on the rover itself, both omni-directional. We only operate in a 0-70m range. I was wondering if this sounds reasonable and other things we should look out for when searching for antenna/base station set ups, such as transmitting and receiving power ratings. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm pretty new to this sort of thing, being a second year uni student. I'm happy to clarify any further details. Cheers",

      "content_preview": "EDIT: TIA stands for transimpedance amplifier Some context: My job is IC and PCB bring up for 3 different high bandwidth TIAs (5GHz, 10GHz, 20GHz) I do not have a background in IC design. All three of these TIAs are oscillating at 5GHz, 8GHz and 18GHz respectively on the PCB. The IC designer has run different stability analysis on their Cadence IC design software tool and has ruled any problem with the circuit inside the IC itself. Since I have no background in IC design I have to accept what they are telling me. I have added big caps at the input of the TIA to see if low input cap is causing oscillations, but adding even 1uf does not show any change in the amplitude or the frequency of the oscillations. Along with various other random tests like grounding all the digital IOs etc etc on the IC, nothing seems to work. All other circuits in the IC work as intended! After revisiting the IC design on Cadence we added a small inductance to the power supply rail to account for wirebond inductance and in that case, we see oscillations at the output of the TIAs. It is now clear that the wirebond inductance in the power supply rails is the culprit, but we are not sure how it is causing this oscillation. As in how is this inductance causing a positive feedback? What is more interesting is that adding a capacitor to ground after the inductance used to mimic the wirebond still does not make the oscillations go away. Additionally for power supply decoupling on the PCB we just slapped 1uF, 0.1uF and 0.01uF and called it a day, could there be a situation where there is something wrong with this and that might be causing the oscillations? Some information that maybe useful: the TIA circuit is made using BJTs, the TIAs are differential input and differential output (100ohms differential output). The TIA are servod using LPF in feedback. The outputs are AC coupled using 0.1uF caps. All thoughts comments and suggestions are welcome, because I am at my wits end and so is the IC designer",

When I cascaded the 2 components, for some reason I got S11 = -22 dB (the response somehow got better at this harmonic). Im using CST studio, and made sure the simulation was converging to a stable result. Is this result even possible (some sort of interaction between the 2 elements)? I guessed that the worst case scenario was that the S11 of the harmonic would stay at -9 dB, not become -22 dB. Thanks in advance.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, My friend an engineering student (ECE/EEE background) trying to build projects and pick up new skills. The challenge he face is that many of the industry-standard tools (like PCB design, simulation, or VLShe-related software) are very expensive. As a student, he can’t really afford them, and free/student versions are often limited. Because of this, he sometimes have to rely on “unofficial” copies just to learn and practice. My question is: If he use these tools to make projects and then present them in his portfolio/resume, can this create problems during interviews? Do companies check how exactly he got access to the software? is it safer to just present the final outputs (schematics, simulations, reports) instead of saying what tool he used? he is not doing this for commercial purposes — just for learning and building a portfolio. he wants to know how risky it is, and what others usually do in this situation. Any guidance would be really appreciated",

Recently I’ve been dealing with audio rerouting, phone being remote controlled, hearing static/background voices on other devices around me not just mine and even when I’m miles and miles away I still hear static/background voices. Does anyone have an idea on what device it could be (Bug,RF/EMI)? Even when I put my phone on airplane mode, turn off the line, turn off Bluetooth, AirPlay,and WiFi and shut my phone off completely I still pick up RF. I’ve even turned off the power to my apartment and still hear RF through TV,Phone,Speaker etc. Any help on how to get rid of it or what it could be?",

      "content_preview": "I have a question regarding 2 CMCs. We want to filter some common mode noise from 150kHz to roughly 700kHz. Trying to resolve some AC mains conducted emissions measurements. The two CMC we ordered are the following: B82727E6223A040 and B82727E6503A040. Here is a link to the datasheet : https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/epcos-tdk-electronics/B82727E6223A040/5322273 Now according to the datasheet : the B82727E6223A040 has a higher impedance than B82727E6503A040, now I expect the attenuation to be greater. When I inserted the CMC in the system the one with lower impedance had a better attenuation than the one with larger impedance. https://preview.redd.it/common-mode-chock-question-v0-ul9xe4fff8kf1.png Here are some of the Conducted Emissions measurements. https://preview.redd.it/common-mode-chock-question-v0-y9zz4u3hf8kf1.png The purple measurement is the system with the CMC B82727E6223A040, the yellow trace is the system with CMC B82727E6503A040. These results surprised me quite a lot so, I thought there must be something I am missing, so I decided to measure the S21 of both CMC. The setup for the measurement of both CMCs is the same. https://preview.redd.it/common-mode-chock-question-v0-7j82votif8kf1.png Indeed, the CMC with a lower impedance has a higher attenuation at the frequency of interest. Can someone explain to me how is that possible? That does not make sense to me…",

The next level of my interview will encompass making changes to a microstrip patch 2.4 GHz rectangular antenna I’ve created in pyAEDT. Being from a different domain, the learning curve was steep and I’m trying my hand in bridging the gap. It would be really great if you could pitch your time and suggest things to look into, changes to try out to the antenna, different types of plots perhaps etc. PS: anything that can be done in HFSS/EMsim can be done in pyAEDT; this is more of a RF/HFSS question than a coding question. One area I felt I was lacking in was being able to infer results about the antenna apart from the S11 metrics. Any suggestions/topics to look into or practice would be golden! Thank you!",

So, my question is Is it mandatory to have or pursue a master's degree to get a job in this field. I have consulted many of my professors about this problem and all of them said that people pursue masters as it gives you exposure to new and advance concepts which are required for today industry so if you manage to get some knowledge and prject you can try your luck. With that note I have already started to study about this field for now I am just using Christopher Bowick RF circuit design as my reference slowly wanted to build my way up to Pozar Microwave engineering, Antenna design by Balanis. So a guidence from experienced guys or those who are connected or work in this industry is required on this topic.",

      "content_preview": "So I was trying to see if I could measure components (L and C) with a VNA. What I did was stick a 15pf (through hole) into the VNA port (*). The smith chart shows that, for 50MHz, the capacitance is spot on with the value printed on the component. But if I increase the frequency to 400MHz, it's no longer 15pf. in fact, it measures nH now. So does this mean that this capacitor is no longer a capacitor at 400MHz? If I were to build a lumped element filter with it, it wouldn't work as a 15pf cap? Does this happen because this is a \"big\" component and parasitic RLC is dominating at 400MHz? (it's tiny but it's still TH, and it's big compared to a 0805 SMD) (*): I actually built a jig out of a N connector and did a SOL calibration. BUT! I used a rando 49.9R 1210 SMD resistor, so I don't really know how it performs at 400MHz. Maybe the problem is compounding because of parasitics for both my 50 ohm load throwing my calibration off from the start?",

I'd like to be able to measure the Antenna pattern of these panels once installed as each locations installation can vary a bit. Some have 25mm x 75mm thick composite panels going horizontally across the panel while others may have metal bars. We sometimes find that tags are not read or in some instances dozens of tags fail to read.

However, I have encountered a few obstacles in designing the circuits: First I have no idea how to properly choose a transistor other than Ft for any application like amplifying or oscillators, to this is added the problem that I live in Italy and the non-consumer electronics industry is pretty much dead there. Second is, that if my understanding is correct I need a local oscillator to provide me the carrier wave to modulate. I have been trying to use a colpitts-type oscillator, however the values for the inductor and capacitors have to be abysmally small, and I don't understand if 466Mhz are even achievable with a colpitts oscillator. Any thoughts on how to solve this are greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!",

      "content_preview": "I need to build a couple of passband filters to prevent LNA and SDR frontend overloading. FM broadcast is the biggest offender but there are other things that also overload my cheap SDRs. I've successfully built helical resonators for VHF (137MHz), that are very tight and perform great, but I don't know what type of filters to build, specifically for ~402MHz (weather ballons) and ~433MHz (telemetry satellites). This is what I've evaluated: Helical filters: they become impractical to build manually at 400MHz, with resonators 10mm tall. Calculator Interdigital (mechanical) filters: they are manageable for microwave work but they become rather large at 400MHz (resonators 18cm long). Calculator . Interdigital (microstrip) filters: these sound promising and I think I could etch some at home but I don't know the Er of my substrate (cheap FR-4) so I can only guess. I also don't have the ability to do plated vias. Calculator . Lumped element filters: discrete L/C along CPWG? I think these could be doable but I'd have to buy an assortment of L and C to tune them, but I think with 0603-size componets they could be doable? I've also looked into things like SAW but I can't find any in the frequency range I need.",
