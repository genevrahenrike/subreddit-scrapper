      "content_preview": "A little lengthy, as I wanna put down as much memorable details of this journey as I can before some of them slip away from my goldfish brain. This is my first ever run of Alola, and boy was it wonderful. So many mons, incredibly challenging (by pokemon standards, so not that much but was still considerably harder than other mainline games), so many friends and partners made along the way. I cherish the gang very much and some of them are in my list of all time favorite mons now. I played with a personal ruleset of not allowing items in battle and on set mode. The final squad was: Bast the Decidueye Le Bray (James) the Mudsdale Gorgon the Bewear Annet the Ribombee Fuckface the Bruxish Gooner the Goodra and shoutout to Phoebe the Ampharos who was benched for Gooner when I reached Exeggutor Island, meaning he was with the team for most of the playthrough. Rowlet has always been my favorite base form starter so I picked him without hesitation. Carried the early game and shouldered the team when they were still babies, always reliable when the situation calls for it. Against totem Araquanid, I trusted Flaaffy to be the main damage dealer but he got knocked out early. As I thought a wipe was inevitable, Bast stepped up and Plucked his way to victory. His best feat however was against Ultra Necrozma when the motherfucker tanked a Dragon Pulse with 7 HP remaining, retaliate with his signature Z move then finished it off with a Sucker Punch. Le Bray is the absolute MVP of the run. I never knew Id end up loving this damn horse this much. Solo'd almost every totem battle that he wasn't at a type disadvantage. Salazzle, Togedemaru, Kommo-o, Ribombee, all defeated by the unit that was Le Bray James. I was really afraid going into the Ribombee battle as my team was very weak to it. He two hit KO'd the bee with Heavy Slam. This thing tanked literally everything, including a Photon Geyser from Necrozma. Mudsdale wasted 2 Photon Geyser PP from the stupid thing, allowing Decidueye to survive the D.Pulse. Bast was absolutely not surviving a Photon Geyser, it was only through PP stalling that move that allowed us to win. Stamina is so fucking broken an ability its unreal. In the league, him and Bewear demolished Olivia and Molayne. Contributed nicely to the rest as well, I dont think theres a single battle in the league that he didnt register a kill. Definitely a top 5 favorite pokemon of all time for me. Bewear is such a monster my god. Gorgon hits like a truck and if you dont resist it he will kill you. You'd think a normal fighting type would struggle against ghosts, but he he was actually my go-to option thanks to Payback. Fluffy is a phenomenal ability. I used to think the Bewear in the anime was exaggerated in power for humorous purposes, but nah every bewear is just built different. Second mvp of the run and for sure a top 10 favorite mon. Annet the Ribombee was caught only as measure against Lurantis, but ended up sticking with the gang til the end. He was quite frail so probably died the most of the team, but pulled his weight when it mattered. Early game he was a beast, but fell off a bit later on. His best feat was probably Quiver dance setup on Acerola's Dhelmise then swept her entire team. I love Bruxish. Its so damn ugly that I cant help but love it. I thought that the team was quite slow and lacked a Water type, so I decided that Bruxish was the perfect addition. The way he devours pokebeans is so funny for some reason. Wasn't spectacular or anything but was definitely a fun one that I glad I got the chance to use. Lastly is Gooner the Goodra. Holy fucking shit shes the cutest thing ever. The animation in pokemon refresh is so adorable its insane. I was debating if I should switch out Ampharos, but after seeing the animation and learning that Goodra can learn Thunderbolt, meaning I still have Electric coverage, the decision was made. It was quite tedious to find one, and honestly she didn't contribute that much, but cuteness triumphs reason and thus every bit of effort was worth it. Live laugh love goodra. This was definitely one of my best experiences playing Pok√©mon and would definitely love to replay some time in the future. https://preview.redd.it/1ozwhm7l11gf1.jpg",
