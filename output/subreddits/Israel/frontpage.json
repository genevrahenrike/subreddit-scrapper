First, all of the conditions of the French-Saudi New York Declaration must be met. These include the \"mutual recognition\" of Israel in the Arab world, the Democratic elections in Palestine, and the agreement on Final Status talks between both parties. Only after these conditions have been met, every last hostage is released, and Hamas is dismantled, Belgium's Foreign Minister will sign a decree that Belgium recognises Palestine; however, no official diplomatic relations will be established at the state level, no embassy will be opened, and no official deals will be signed. The Belgian Government's official Agreement of the Federal Core Cabinet notes that it is “aware of the trauma that Israelis have experienced after the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, Belgium will only formalize this recognition of the State of Palestine by royal decree once the last hostage has been released and terrorist organizations such as Hamas have been removed from the governance of Palestine.” At least they have some decency.",

Hamas are armed, but there are way more civilians. Surely some civilians will die but with this kind of lack of any life or hope I would expect them to revolt. It happened numerous times in history. What have they got to lose? Many of Hamas fighters are probably just young and inexperienced and maybe not even there for the cause. So a big revolt will turn them. I'm actually not sure what's going on. Some options I came up with. I don't find any of them particularly likely. Gazans think supporting Hamas is still the best way. Some revolts are going on but we don't hear about it. People who want to do something just try to leave. Any thoughts? PS note that fighting against Hamas doesn't mean in any way they're pro Israel. Even if I'm an Israeli hating Gazan I'd still want to topple Hamas.",

I get the whole startup culture, but here’s what I’m trying to say: in countries that have built themselves through education and grit rather than natural resources, it really shows in the people. Look at Korean or Japanese kids—their parents instill discipline, ambition, and a focus on studying from a young age. But with Israeli people, it’s different. Despite the Jewish community’s rich history of innovation and intellect, when I meet Israeli kids, it doesn’t seem to translate. They party, stay up late, and life seems like endless fun. I rarely hear conversations about studying, careers, or ambitions. Israeli parents seem more relaxed. And yet… Israel is incredibly successful and wealthy. My guess is it comes down to the hard work of previous generations, smart governance, and a few brilliant innovators who built the startup ecosystem. That strong foundation allows the younger generation to live it up while the country continues to thrive. You guys are so incredibly lucky to be in this situation. I wish we could exchange lives!",

I can't log into the website, I can't log into the app, I can't log into my debit card app, I can't connect my bank or debit card to my PayPal, I can't even use my atm card to withdraw money. I need to switch banks, but I have no idea which one I should switch to. Does anyone have any advice or recommendations? Edit to add: I have פטור מתור. Does that make a difference in which bank I should use?",
