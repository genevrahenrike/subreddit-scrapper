But who knows, I could be completely wrong. I'm going to avoid listening to any audience recordings until after I have seen them again, but I still can't wait to hear some fan reports from the shows.",

Most of the big sound-collages (LAMG, TBL3 etc...) weren't present, and I was wondering if I could maybe motivate some members of this sub to add links and samples I'm not aware of? Like, some dude found the original Jarboe sample for Her Mouth Is Filled With Honey and posted it here on this sub, but nobody seemed to mind. I think it's cool to have the most connections possible between the band and their influences/artists they influenced referenced on a site dedicated to the art of sampling. Hell, Michael and co were sampling and recording loops as early as their first studio sessions.",

This song feels like remembering a very big traumatic event all of the sudden. It could explain is short lense of only 1 minute. I kinda feel it talks about a sexual agressions. Atleast I interpret it this way. It reminds me of my own traumas. I know Micheal got SA when he was younger. So the idea that some of his songs were about it isn't impossible. Anyway very powerful song.",

Which is why I get really excited when I hear a band that seems to be truly challenging norms but at the same time making exceptional music. Recently the band Majura have turned up on my radar, these guys sound like they listen to Swans a lot, less guitar focused but I hear it in the Rhythm section a lot, I hear something essential and something that pushes towards the ceiling. I hear a band I want to go on a journey with and, well I find it exciting. Daughters was the last band I felt that way about and that hasn't gone so well :(. Anyone else got any other torch bearers that make you feel excited about the beauty and transcendence we seek in a band like our beloved swans?",
