They withdrew $10,000 more from my savings account to purchase more bitcoin but couldn't move it out because there is a 7 days holding period. That newly purchased Bitcoin is currently still in the wallet. The bank initiated a chargeback after the provided evidences proved that it was an unauthorized transaction. I have reported the case to IC3, USSS, police, the bank, and Kraken. Kraken has restricted my account since then without much customer support. I received email stating that I am responsible for the bank chargeback. My concern now is that even after I FUND the chargeback, my account will still remain unlocked with the fund frozen in there. Please escalate the case to management as the information we have on the thief proves activities of money laundering and are tied to criminals. I would like to discuss this case with a human agent and to provide more details about the criminals that committed the fraud.",

Honestly, it is shocking that a platform like Kraken can spend so much on ads to lure new users yet refuses to assist with such a common and straightforward crypto transfer mistake. Customers are left stranded even when the issue is clear and fully documented. 😡😡",

      "content_preview": "Ticket # 18272416 Ticket # 18493173 Dear Kraken support, Several weeks ago, due to some bugs and delays in the Kraken server, my account was turned into a negative balance with -0.009988 BTC , and I was approached by the Kraken support team with Ticket # 18272416, asking me to reimburse the amount, so that my account could return to normal. Yesterday, 0.45592 BTC was deposited into my Kraken account and has well-reimbursed the negative balance. However, when I was trying to withdraw the remainder, I found myself unable to withdraw any crypto, in any amount or currency (including BTC, SOL, USDC) from Kraken. On Aug 13th, I replied to Ticket # 18272416 informing the support about my situation, and openly said that the negative balance will be reimbursed within a few weeks. The support team didn't reply to my email. On Aug 26th, after the negative balance is reimbursed, I find myself unable to withdraw cryptos, so I raised a new ticket, # 18493173 , which was met with a reply quoting that the request is transferred to another team, but I haven't heard from that other team yet, and that ticket is seen as closed now. On Aug 27th, I sent another reply to Ticket # 18272416 saying that the negative balance issue should be resolved and Kraken should resume my account to full function, still met with no reply. That ticket is still open. I have also tried to: Deposit some SOL into my Kraken account to test if I can withdraw these, and I can't. Seems like my Kraken account can only accept deposits, but is unable to withdraw anything. Sell some BTC into USDC to test if the trading function is also blocked, and it is a success. So seems like only the withdrawal function is restricted for my Kraken account. I cannot withdraw these USDC either. I would like to know that: What is causing the withdrawal function to be blocked? The negative balance issue should be fully resolved with that significant amount of BTC deposit yesterday. Does my account require some manual operation from the support to restore its withdrawal function? If yes, would you help to escalate this issue and push for a quicker resolution? Please also inform me if there are additional documents/procedures needed to help speed up the process. Thanks very much for your attention and quick response. Best, More_Concentrate_234",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I’m looking for advice and to see if anyone else has experienced this. •\tOn 8 August, I deposited £30,000 into Kraken. The system duplicated the deposit and suddenly showed two £30,000 credits. I immediately flagged this with Kraken. The following Monday they removed the extra £30,000, but I never got an explanation or apology. •\tOn 25 August, it happened again — but this time in reverse. My ledger shows a phantom –£30,000 deposit marked “failed.” I never made this. Instantly, my GBP balance dropped by £30,000. •\tLess than a minute later, my BTC position was liquidated. Instead of being left with around +£17,000 residual, my account now shows –£13,500. •\tIn other words, £30,000 just disappeared from my account, and the ledger entry triggered the liquidation. I’ve raised a ticket (18479501) and chased, but so far no resolution. They’ve also charged me more than £9,000 in funding fees on this trade, which seems outrageous given the liquidation was forced by their own system error. Has anyone else had phantom deposits/withdrawals like this on Kraken? How did you get it resolved?",

This is wrong on so many levels to just freeze funds like this because of low liquidity or whatever the problem is with the platform. I need my funds released. This is the majority of my money.

Kraken requires me to withdraw the funds to the original deposit bank account, but that account has already been closed. They asked for official bank closure documentation and accepted electronic proof, so I provided a screenshot of the bank's closure confirmation. However, Kraken then rejected this proof. Honestly, the format of the closure notice isn't something I can control—this is exactly how the bank issued it. What else can I do? I even forwarded the original bank closure email to Kraken. Now, Kraken is asking me to attempt a withdrawal to my closed bank account, claiming the failed transaction would serve as proof of closure. Following their instructions, I initiated a €10 withdrawal to verify this, but for two days now, the status has been stuck as \"on hold.\" I've emailed Kraken's support team multiple times but haven't received any response. I've done everything Kraken has asked—yet my funds remain inaccessible. At this point, I'm exhausted and deeply concerned. Losing this money would create serious hardship for my family. Kraken is testing the limits of my trust and patience. Please, I just need a resolution—how can I get my money back? Ticket # 18276290",

      "content_preview": "Hello everybody, I've been having a hell of a headache using kraken recently. First of all, I spent 2 weeks having issues with my bank because they kept refusing to allow me to deposit 200$ to kraken. One day I was able to call them and they said that since Kraken is based in the UK (as their system is showing them) thats why they are declining the payment. They said they can only make an exception for one day and that everytime I want to deposit, im going to have to call them for the exception. They made the exception and I deposited 200$ into my Kraken account, here's when the problems begin. I bought 192.25$ at 50x leverage worth of SOL @ 206. I set SL to 204 and TP to 215. So I basically had 9300$ worth of SOL on a trade. Kraken calculated that gain would be like 500$ and loss would be like 80$. Then I wake up the next day after placing the trade to a 150$ loss. Double of what I had set my stop loss. I go to my trade history and it shows me that it sold all my SOL @ 203.85. I tried to calculate how much money did I exactly lose since it stopped at 203.85. It said 90$. Not 150$. Then I calculated fees which totaled to like 4$. Still adds up to 95$? Where did my other 55$ go? Then I decide to place another trade, 40$ with 50x leverage on SKL. I bought @ 0.0346 and set SL to 0.0340 and TP to 0.0360 (+27$ if hit). I watched the trade live. I saw the open order as it was going up. When it hit 0.0346 the order closed as it has hit my TP, I go back to check my portfolio value only to see that I gained 3$ instead of 27$? Then I check my trade history and apparently my trade closed at 0.0348 which is like right above my entry? Something wasnt right at all. I didnt set my stop loss or take profit to that. Also I was watching the trade live, I saw it close at my TP and I saw the 27$ unrealized PnL as it was moving. How could I have just gained 3$ and why was my trade history showing it closed way earlier than what I saw with my own open eyes. Then, me being so frustrated with whats going on, enter another trade for SKL. This time I put 40$ with 50x leverage again. I set my SL to 15$ below my entry. Then I see my portfolio calue go from 40$ to 25$. Then my trade closed because it hit my SL, then the second it closed, my portfolio value went from 25$ straight to 7$. Like what is going on? It was displaying right. 25$ was the right display, ther when the trade closed, it just jumped to 7$. Where did my 18$ go? Huh? Something isnt right AT ALL! I was so mad as I have a total loss of now 305$ trading. Then I decide to check my bank account, to see that I still have the 200$ | supposedly deposited a couple days ago to kraken. I chek my checking account and it shows current balance (which is the balance after all pending transactions). It said I have 200$. It was wierd because there was no pending kraken payment, if it did have one thats even pending, it would show as O. Then I go to my specific card which I used to make the payment on Apple pay. My bank app shows the Kraken transaction but shows it as pending. Which is odd because why would it show it to me on the card statement but not on my checking balance or display it on my current balance. Its odd because it has never happened before. Then I go check apple pay, apple pay says the payment went through. I go to kraken, it shows that Allocated USD and Deposited USD of 192.25 (7.75$ fee taken from 200$). I turned off my card so the payment doesnt go through. Im not sure if this entire time I was using fake money (phantom money) and I was not actually trading with real money and thats why kraken was closing trades at random times and why I am losing double my money than what I set my SL too. I turned off my card as I dont it to later process and kraken will argue that I already used my 200$ on trades. Because yes I did use 200$ but it was very unfair and unjust as the payment had not cleared and clearly something is wrong with every trade that I have executed. I contacted kraken support, the person was asking me what phantom money is and what was I saying. He said he will escalate it to the Futures team and I should receive an email about it. I want to report everything on here as I want advice on what to do and if anyone has ever experienced this issue before. Im 100% sure im not tweaking or anything and that there is something 100% wrong with kraken.",

It told me to reset my password (again) and sign out of active sessions and etc. After having done so, I had to respond saying that I've done everything so they would reactivate my account, but now 2 days later I'm being asked to complete the ID verification page. I live in US, and sadly they don't accept military ID. What can I do? I don't want to go out of my way to get a state ID",

      "content_preview": "|| || |I deposited $55.55 into Kraken on Aug 28 . Within 2 hours, I noticed $3.02 missing from my balance. Here’s the breakdown: I submitted a support ticket. Kraken responded with a ledger breakdown of manual transactions, but did not address the paused recurring orders that triggered debits. This feels like a backend logic error—not a UI issue or user mistake. Has anyone else experienced funds being deducted from paused recurring orders ? I haven’t found any documentation or Reddit threads about this. Would love to hear if others have seen this. If it’s a rare bug, Kraken needs to fix it. If it’s systemic, we need visibility. I had two recurring orders paused before the deposit Kraken still deducted funds for those paused orders No XRP was delivered in return My manual purchases totaled $51.30 , and my balance was $1.23 That leaves $3.02 unaccounted for |",

A lot of people are sending to time sensitive wallets / temporary addresses. Y'all better refund these transactions.. You belong in jail if you don't. Say goodbye to many costumers.",
