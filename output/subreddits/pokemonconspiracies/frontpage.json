      "content_preview": "In Legends Arceus the player is sent back in time to complete the Pokedex and defeat Volo. But out of all the millions of future humans Arceus could have picked, why did it pick Rei/Akari? Probebly because they are one of the few who as the capabilities to do this. The main matter of all Pokemon mainline games is how powerful the main protagonist is compared to other trainers in the games. Despite only being young and new, the protagonist are able to defeat Gym Leaders, Elites and criminal bosses, all of which are older and much more experienced then them. However, there are some things I noticed. Training Pokemon is implied to be very difficult in-universe (he only reason it's easy for the player is because \"video-game\"). Which makes sense, given how Pokemon are like animals, and each species would have it's own needs. In fact, most trainers don't have a 6-pokemon team, and many tend to use pokemon that are similar to each other. Most notably Gym Leaders and Elite Four members tend to stick to a certain type. Of course, Gym members have the advantage of being in a facility that has the necessary equipment to help take care of certain Pokemon. Comparison to Blue Oak I could write an entire post tearing apart every non-playable trainer, to explain why the protagonist is special, but we'll be here all day. So, I'm going to do a comparison to Blue Oak: Red's rival from the Kanto games. Blue is a powerful trainer. He's a beginner, like Red, but by the last battle, he has become the \"Pokemon Champion\". Also, unlike most NPC trainers, he uses a diverse team of Pokemon, even useing a full team of 6 by the 7th and 8th battles. However, there are some things I noticed about him. When we battle him the fourth time, on the S.S. Anne, he claims to have caught 40 individual Pokemon. Yet he only uses 4, despite being allowed to have up to 6. The only reason I can think for this is that, whilst he owns 40 pokemon, he can only care for 4 at a time, not due to legal restrictions, but rather practical skill. You could say catching Pokemon is easier them raising them. When we meet him in Pokemon Tower for the fifth battle, he now has 5, suggesting he's getting better. But is Raticate is missing, leading to the infamous \"we killed Blue's Raticate\" theory, which is (hopefully) not true. So, maybe he still couldn't handle a full team, and had to store one of his Pokemon in the PC. Of course, by the end, he has a full team of 6. But one thing I noticed, whilst we fight him 8 times, he always uses the same 7 specimens, at different evolutionary stages, despite owning 40 or more. So, all-in-all: Whilst Blue is very talented and gifted, he's still just a regular guy. Unlike Red, who is able to train hundreds diverse Pokemon and win the league and defeat the villains. Summary So, could the protagonists have some kind of special quality or power? One that allows them to train hundreds of different Pokemon species at such a young age and quash evil organisations all whist winning Pokemon leagues?",

One issue with that in the case of Focus Blast specifically. The one pokemon we currently know to learn focus blast naturally, awkwardly, is Yveltal, of all things. Meaning whoever recorded the TM for Focus Blast for the first time would’ve had to fight the literal god of death, after finding it while it’s awake , and avoid casualties as much as possible. They might’ve even had to be careful not to outright kill it trying to escape afterward, because then it would presumably make a temporary crater in the world’s biosphere by going back into dormancy. The fact that we don’t hear any tragic stories about the development of the Focus Blast TM seems to imply to me that whoever made that recording might be a national hero to some extent for whatever region they came from by not letting the whole thing end in cataclysm.",

      "content_preview": "(TL;DR down below.) Reading through Hoenn's lore (ORAS timeline), there's something odd when looking at Rayquaza's power scaling. For that, let's look at the three recorded instances (Source) of the Weather Trio appearing: 2000 years ago: Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon clash, Rayquaza steps in and ends the conflict. 1000 years ago: A meteor strikes Earth, Primal Kyogre & Primal Groudon reawake and clash, Rayquaza Mega Evolves and ends the conflict. Present day: Primal Kyogre / Primal Groudon are artificially awakened and shortly after stopped by Brendan / May; Rayquaza appears later, its ability to Mega Evolve is restored and it destroys Grand Meteor Delta. According to this lore, base form Rayquaza was able to win against Primal Groudon AND Primal Kyogre. Meaning it's already very powerful in its base form. So getting a Mega form only made Rayquaza more stronger, making it one of the most powerful pokemon in existence. But that seems ... unnecessary. Why make it more powerful when its base form's power was enough to take on both Groudon and Kyogre in their primal forms? Quick obvious answer: Meteors. As seen in the Delta Episode, only in its Mega form is Rayquaza capable of destroying giant space rocks threatening Earth. And there were two scenarios, one in present time and one 1000 years ago, which was coincidentally the period when Rayquaza first Mega Evolved. But there's a problem: Rayquaza performed its Mega Evolution AFTER the meteor struck Earth. So there was no justification for enhancing Rayquaza (other than making it overpowered for no reason), as there was no longer a threat. Well, Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre were still on a rampage, but as already pointed out, base form Rayquaza would be enough to deal with them. The third instance might give us an answer to that. It's somewhat of an outlier compared to the previous events. First, none of the Weather Trio members met, as only one of them was active at a time (Kyogre / Groudon was quickly defeated before Rayquaza could intervene). Second, we learn that Rayquaza lost its ability to Mega Evolve. Now this is interesting. Rayquaza should be able to replenish its mikado organ on its own, according to the αS dex entry: \"It flies forever through the ozone layer, consuming meteoroids for sustenance. The many meteoroids in its body provide the energy it needs to Mega Evolve.\" (Source) In the Delta Episode, this issue gets resolved by feeding Rayquaza a special meteorite, which I assume is either different from the ones usually found (I wrote a theory on that too, if you're interested) or Rayquaza didn't manage to eat enough to maintain its ability to Mega Evolve. Whatever the reason - the official lore doesn't give us an explanation on that - we can at least state that Rayquaza can lose its ability to Mega Evolve. (I will come back to that point later.) With that, here's a graphic to visualize our findings. https://files.catbox.moe/192og5.png To summarize, (base form) Rayquaza was always way more powerful than (Primal) Groudon and (Primal) Kyogre, possibly in order to keep both in check. The \"upgrade\" was merely there to allow Rayquaza to destroy giant meteors on course to Earth. But two questions remain: A.) Why did it first Mega Evolve 1000 years ago AFTER the meteor struck Earth, not BEFORE? B.) Why does it lose its ability to Mega Evolve? To give answers, let's continue with my theory. THEORY: Rayquaza becomes weaker over time. What I described as \"upgrades\" were actually measures to counter Rayquaza's declining power level. Its first Mega Evolution was meant to restore its power level above that of Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon, as its base form had become weaker in power. And in present time, Rayquaza loses its ability to Mega Evolve. Which gets restored by feeding it a special rock, but not some ordinary one, as its diet usually consists of meteorites and Mega Stones. With that, we also answered both previous questions. Yet, there's one inconsistency to answer: Why didn't Zinnia - a lorekeeper versed in Hoenn's history and myths - as well as the Draconid people know about this problem? My guess is that perhaps she misunderstood some of the lore. Having mistaken \"rocks shining in colors of the rainbow\" with Key Stones, when actually another kind of rock imbued with Infinity Energy was required (Source) . Or, the lore Zinnia and the Draconid people refered to was lacking this information in the first place. The ancient people might never had the chance to observe Rayquaza becoming potentially weaker, because historically this was the first time Rayquaza ever Mega Evolved. They only knew that Rayquaza was more powerful, and wrote down how to perform Mega Evolution, not how to treat Rayquaza's decline in power. This would also explain Zinnia's surprise when realizing Rayquaza's inability to Mega Evolve (Source) . With that, here's the previous graphic, but updated: https://files.catbox.moe/otd6rq.png This interpretetion would make much more sense in explaining the timeline. There's a general downward trend, requiring \"treatments\" at times to restore Rayquaza to a power level high enough to fight current threats. Though, we are left with this question: C.) What is the reason behind Rayquaza becoming weaker? That would be up for speculation. Perhaps an outlook for another theory. - - - - - - - - - - We aren't done yet. Let's get back to our statement that Rayquaza can lose its ability to Mega Evolve. We have this quote by Zinnia: \"The Meteorites that should lie within Rayquaza's great body...aren't enough? Have these thousand years drained them of their power?\" (Source) The idea of Infinity Energy imbued rocks depleting over time leads me to my second theory. THEORY: Key and Mega Stones are consumables. I don't mean \"consumable\" in terms of eating and digesting it - Rayquaza's the only exception that does that - but fractions of the stones being used up every time a pokemon Mega Evolves. If that's the case, why don't we see this phenomenon portrayed in XY, ORAS or any other media? The answer could be quite simple: The amount of matter / energy lost is so slim, that you wouldn't notice any differences in weight over several years. And the adventures shown in any media never lasts for decades, so most people won't have the chance to notice any difference. The rate of consumption could also depend on the pokemon. Judging by size and performance, most pokemon wouldn't require that much energy when Mega Evolving, meaning Mega Stones could last much longer before they show any signs of \"wear\". We might get a rough understanding when looking at Rayquaza again. Between the second (Rayquaza's first Mega Evolution) and the third (Rayquaza's inability to Mega Evolve) instance, we have a timespan of one thousand years. We might assume that Rayquaza would require much more energy due to constantly flying, guarding earth from extraterrestrial threats and the likes. More than most pokemon capable of Mega Evolving would need. Meaning the rate of consumption would be even lower with all other pokemon. Meaning most trainer's - or mortals - wouldn't even notice this phenomenon taking place. At last, one might wonder when Mega Evolution is no longer possible. Is there a quantitative limit at which there's not enough energy in Key and Mega Stones left? Just like with the question about the cause for Rayquaza's decline in power, the answer would be up for speculation. - - - - - - - - - - TL;DR: Some facettes of ORAS' lore have plotholes regarding Rayquaza's power level, which can be resolved if we assume that Rayquaza's power stagnates over time. Events like Rayquaza's ability to Mega Evolve and feeding it a meteorite in the Delta Episode are therefore measures to restore Rayquaza's power. The fact that Rayquaza lost its ability to Mega Evolve may imply that Key and Mega Stone get marginally used up whenever a pokemon Mega Evolves. Which means they are consumables.",

I know the theory behind Paradox Pokemon and I agree with them! BUT, if Paradox Pokemon are just truly past and future Pokemon and nothing else added to the explanation, then I think perhaps we're really seeing Pokemon from the past before they slowly over hundreds and thousands of years changed to what they are now. Which means Raging Bolt, Walking Wake and Gouging Fire did indeed used to look like that and that they were NOT revived by Ho-Oh. Yes, the legends say Ho-Oh revived three beast-like Pokemon (possibly Jolteon, Vaporeon and Flareon) and Ho-Oh became their leader. But maybe those legends are just legends. Humans trying to explain their natural world. Like how some cultures believe the fox can shapeshift and play tricks on people. Or how the Oarfish is believed to be a harbinger of earthquakes and other natural disasters. Or how unicorns aren't real in the present but perhaps there was an animal that has gone extinct that resembled a unicorn enough for us to believe unicorns are real. I think it's neat to think this way...that some Pokemon have legends behind them to explain their origins just because humans can't explain their power or their rarity.",

      "content_preview": "before diving into my theory here are a few things * these games are connected in many ways (HG/SS, XY, ORAS, Sun and Moon/Ultra) - Life Energy (Kalos) and Infinity Energy (ORAS) are the same thing. These energies have the ability to open wormholes in space-time and to other worlds. and made it possible for mega evolution My theory is that when AZ fired the Ultimate weapon 3,000 years ago not only did it ruin the enemies region , but caused the entire region to move to another dimension altogether. This is why we do not know who the enemy nation was, because it vanished from the face of the planet and was forgotten in history. After the Region was sucked into another dimension The Life Energy caused a background radiation of sorts behind. Now Zygarde is know to balance out Xerneas and Yvelta's energies between life and death and balance out the ecosystem. So After the weapon was fired, my best guess is near Alola Region and that is why there is the search for Zygarde Cells all over because Zygarde is still fixing the ecosystem of all that background energy from the weapon so long ago. Not only that, but remember that Life energy can cause wormholes to happen. Thus what if Aether Paradise is near where the weapon was fired and can explain why they are able to interact more so with wormholes. It is said the Solgaleo and Lunala came from an Ultra Wormhole around Alola far back in time. So what if when the weapon was used it created the first events to happen to open wormholes causing these dimension pokemon or other world to slip into the current world. Now fast forwarding 5 years before ORAS. At the Embedded Tower which is located in Johto region in HG/SS and was made by the Devon Corporation. They captured Rayquaza and held it there untill it was freed and was able to mega evolve to escape. In ORAS Delta Chapter can Mega Evolve again after certain events. Within the Delta Chapter you learn theat Devon Corp. is able to harness life energy now called Infinity energy. with a special technology they planned on opening a wormhole to another world to save themselves from an asteroid, but are stopped. my point is that the weapon did cause a wormhole 3,000 years ago. Take a look at Ultra Sun/Moon and Rainbow rocket. Team Rainbow Rocket is comprised of former boss of evil organizations. However, these bosses succeeded in there plan in there worlds where the player (you) never stopped them. Which brings me back to Lysander was teleported through a wormhole when he succeeded in firing AZ's Weapon in his dimensional world but possibly back fired on him causing him to be swallowed by a wormhole. further more you learn that the Ultra Beast Guzzlord lives in the Ultra Ruin which consists of a ruined Alola Region. What if there are other Ultra Ruined Dimensions out there such as one where the enemy region rests in ruins possibly. This is just my theory on how the war 3,000 years ago happened and Why we never hear about what region name. just references as to the enemy nation and its destruction due to AZ's Weapon and that the weapon brought not only destruction, but opened the first wormhole ever causing other dimensional pokemon to cross over.",

Eventually, after years of new games, spin-offs, apps etc., maybe some Pokémon holograms in many, many years from now, technology advanced so much that we managed to create actual Pokémon. Maybe not with their corresponding powers of course, but still, someone could just get a harmless Piplup or a Munchlax from some lab or sth. It was all fun and games obviously, who wouldn't like to have their starter or their favourite Mon as a pet? But then stuff hut real; people started taking advantage of this new reality, making Pokémon with actual powers in order to gain power themselves, maybe some of them even went as far as to create the legendaries through AI for even more power. And maybe that's how the war that took place before the events of Gen1 happened. People started using Pokémon alongside weapons to fight. Modern technology, combined with all the forces of nature (water, fire, grass, electricity, air, ground), as well as the more special ones (ghost, psychic, dark) and the rest of the types took a great toll on earth. The legendaries, being made from AI, although stronger, had the mental capacity to leave the planet (or the dimension altogether) and were never used in the front lines. Maps were redrawn,  countries vanished, normal animals disappeared, or some of them were barely left... And the countries that were left standing were what we know as the Regions. The victors then decided what would change the world for the years to come: since everything that led them to this moment started with Pokémon, they decided that this is how they'll continue. The governments as we know them got replaced with the Pokémon Leagues, with the strongest person (aka trainer) of each region being the highest form of authority, followed by a team of four, less strong but absolutely capable trainers (the champion and the elite four). After them, each region's canton/district would have another strong figure to make sure that there's peace and order in their area (the gym leaders). And to ensure that there's not going to be another war like the aforementioned one, they decided to teach love and friendship to the younger generations. They gave kids the opportunity to have their own Pokémon; to have it not as a pet or accessory, but as a friend and companion. To spend time with it and learn how to grow alongside another living creature, battling with it, competing in contests and using their bond to make friends out of other Pokémon and trainers that they'd meet along their journey. That would explain the presence of normal animals in the first episodes of the anime and some Dex entries that describe a Pokémon as an animal, Misty trying to repel a ghost type with a cross (remnants of religion), Lt. Surge being called the Lightning American (his country, before the end of the war), all the monuments around the regions ( Eiffel tower in Lumiose, the twin pagodas in Ecruteak etc.) and also the presence of the Andes, where mew was supposed to be roaming. Team rocket creating Mewtwo was another attempt to get ahold of a legendary, one that this time would obey it's creators and won't flee. And all this high technology that exists in the Pokémon world, is just because after decades and maybe centuries, technology just got as advanced as it could get.",

      "content_preview": "I believe that Larry, our favorite bland gym leader, is Ash’s father. Larry lives in Paldea, and he works for the Pokemon League as his day job; however, is also a Gym leader who is part of the most richest school districts in the world. I’m sure he’s sending loads of money home. It’s not a short ride to Pallet either which is why he is never home. The hat he leaves with Ash is specifically associated to the Pokemon League, which a long timer like Larry, would most def have access to. Opposites attract - Larry, being the most boring underwhelming person conjoined with Ash’s high energy ultra supporting mother works well. Larry is also moonlighting as E4, which shows similar talent is capable. That’s all I got but I like it better than Giovanni bc in B/W he paid ash no attention when capturing him lol Edit: Additional notes as I’m learning more… Possible Medali / Delia M. connection (anagram) Delia runs a restaurant …. Larry’s gym is literally a restaurant… need to explore food choices though to see if we have any similarities now… More interesting quotes after rematch battle: \"Nowadays people only seem to want a shock factor. Something weird, something bizarre.\" \"At the end of the day, though, nothing beats the relief of coming home , even after a fun vacation.\" In the game upon the third visit: \"It’s just that the best part of traveling is trying out all the local dishes, if you ask me. The topic tends to make me talkative.\" Holy shit: \" There’s something special about having nice, familiar rice balls once you’re back home, too.. .\" Gemini AI search Beyond that, the anime showcases moments where Ash enjoys his mother's cooking, especially croquettes. He remembers and misses them when he's away from home. Croquettes …. Some types of croquettes are a form of rice balls… You seriously can’t have this much depth for an NPC for it not to mean something, right?

      "content_preview": "This is an (admittedly quite so) educated guess off how Poké Balls seem to work and be constructed off mostly game lore and mechanics (ESPECIALLY PL:A) and some anime tidbits (and the official replica merch). 1 / Ancient Poké Balls With the release of Legends Arceus, we were introduced to ancient Balls as they were made and used in the Sinnoh of the past, which is roughly based on the end of 18th-start of 19th century in Japan. First things first, basic Balls are crafted using 1 brown apricorn and 1 tumblestone, along with the metal used for the latch and such. They are stated to specifically make Pokémon shrink to miniscule sizes and capture them, as it is a power they are all share, as opposed to the popular idea that the tech in a Ball turns them into energy/data. It was also stated that Apricorn Balls, when they were invented, were simply carved out apricorns fitted with a special device. Concept art confirms the top lid of most Balls (Heavy variations are mentioned to possess a graphite coating instead) are all wooden (adjective) and lacquer stained, while the bottom lid can be made of various materials (birch wood, vanish wood, metal etc). Since brown apricorns are all used in the crafting recipes, this suggests they are used in the crafting for the top lid and then painted with lacquer. Ultra Ball concept art even mentions Maki-e painting techniques for the pattern on it, which is a form of lacquer painting. So, the external shell of a Poké Ball is composed of painted apricorn, metal, and the material used for the bottom lid. That leaves the tumblestone to discuss. The inventory description for tumblestone states the following : \"When combined with an Apricorn, this mysterious, tumbled stone can draw out the properties required to forge a Poké Ball.\" According to it, tumblestones are what give Poké Balls their catching properties. This is backed up by the different types to be crafted using explicitly variations of the ore (Sky tumblestone / Black tumblestone) and as such having varied effects. Iron chunks (along with more tumblestone) are required for tier 2 and 3 Balls as well despite the latch not looking any different, so it's likely the \"special device\" is an iron frame of sorts holding varying amounts of tumblestone. So, the basic composition of a Ball isn't complicated technology but actually quite simple (relatively) to craft, it just needs the right materials. 1.5 / Tumblestone properties and colored apricorn The ore in a Ball seems to contain energy/create a reaction, when in contact with one, that triggers a Pokémon's shrinking ability and draws them in. It might be what creates an environment fitting the Pokémon too (a canonical feature of modern Balls), since ancient Balls are still mentioned to be comfortable. (Along with that, it might also make the Ball fly back to whoever threw it since it affects how they are thrown.) What makes me think it's an energy similar to the kind a Pokémon possesses is related to Dynamaxing specifically : the Ball itself reacts to Galar particles like the 'mons do and dynamaxes. It might just be technology, but to my knowledge nothing else reacts to the particles like that. Balls react to Terastal energy too, since they can crystallize to catch a Tera Raid Pokémon. One might even think the ore is crystallized energy like evolution stones, since they both react to Pokémon with different results. (It also justifies Poké Balls being able to teleport from boxes to the Trainer and vice versa, as it might just be working like the Teleport move itself.) Effectiveness is probably determined by the comfort the Pokémon finds in the created environment, where the energy contained by specialized Balls will have better compatibility (as such, more comfortable)  with the Pokémon that fit the criteria. Higher tier standard Balls likely just have higher efficiency in creating the most fitting environment for any of them universally, but not as much as specialized variants. Colored apricorns seem to have their own special properties each reacting to the ore as opposed to standard brown apricorn which doesn't have any, since Kurt just carves them out to make Apricorn Balls which are all specialized/situational. No Hisui balls share them and the Cram-o-matic in Isle of Armor has a high chance of making standard Balls (Poké and Great) with any color used. To summarize, tumblestone carries energy/properties that reacts to Pokémon and their own energy, while colored apricorns have differing properties each with the brown (more common) ones lacking them. 2 / Modern Poké Balls As we know, in the present, Poké Balls are mass-produced in factories (like in XY) by companies like Silph Co. and Devon, and apricorns have fallen out of usage entirely. If the official replica is anything to go by, both lids in a standard Ball are made of the same material and still lacquer painted, though it's likely metal. (In the anime, apricorns are shown to be heated in a furnace and forged like a foundry does with metal casting, so the two materials were probably similar enough in texture/durability to begin with.) Tumblestone is probably still used, or a different ore with the same properties, in the creation of a Poké Ball. New discovered variations of it seem to be used for different kinds of Balls, with their rarity each reflected by the actual price the specific Balls are sold at. This is a very flimsy explanation to fill in, but the standard line (Poké, Premier -> Great -> Ultra) may use the same ore with respectively higher concentrations of energy. The inside/core of the Poké Ball is created using the hypothetical ore, and then the lids are slotted onto that. Thanks to modern technology, the button allows more varied usage of the energy by being able to trigger the process of shrinking the Ball for storage/restoring its size for throwing, again like Pokémon themselves do (to a lesser extent). It seems Pokémon are able to return to their Balls phasing through the button as well, without needing to press it and having it physically open. Extra / Ultra Beasts and Beast Balls Ultra Beasts have an extremely low catchrate on any Balls that aren't the Beast Ball, likely because they consider earthly environments foreign and hostile, and have trouble finding them comfortable making them significantly less likely to accept being caught. As such, Beast Balls might be crafted using the equivalent of the ores found in Ultra Wormhole dimensions, as they required external aid from the Ultra Recon Squad (in the manga at least, I believe). Nothing suggests it wouldn't exist, as Ultra Beasts themselves are Pokémon, just alien. The environment created will be more reminiscent of their homeworlds, hence the high catchrate, which will freak earth Pokémon out as it'd instead be foreign and hostile to THEM, hence the low catchrate. I might have missed a bunch of things of course, or outright information contradicting my theory, but this is my take on Poké Balls as a whole. (As for Master Balls, it simply forces a capture likely by being made too durable to break open or something else, but they are so rare because only trustworthy people would use them ethically, such as genuine emergencies. Indigo Disk shows they need to be broken open by the Pokémon inside to be free of them.)",

      "content_preview": "That theory are remake of my old one. In old version i talk that humans was cells of giants,but when I read that theory i fill that was bad. So let's forget about that old theory and move on to this one. In myth say that \"The power of defeated giants infuses this Plate.\" Remember that nowhere does it say that arceus killed the giants, only that the power of the DEFEATED giants infuses this Plate. Never said that giants was pokemons, maybe giants don't even a pokemons. Also In old myths giants was an imaginary or mythical being of human form but superhuman size(many things in gen 4 based on myths and legends). However, let's move on to something interesting. Humans, nowhere is it said how humans appeared in Pokemon world. Humans look like that they don't belong to this world. Plus the world is called: the world of POKEMONS, not otherwise, but the world of POKEMONS, that is, it is a world for pokemons. Also, it is necessary to remember that no one in the pokemons universe mentions arceus as the god of humans, only as the god of pokemons. And plus arceus treats people not as pokemons but as other creatures. Also in 8 movie, tree of beginning not attack pokemons, only humans. Let's return to pokemon:legends arceus and remember that the main part of plot that pokemons going crazy and start attack humans, not other pokemons, only HUMANS, It's as if humans aren't locals at all. Interesting fact, in the early version of creation myth (which was supposed to be in gen4), it said that pokemons was created by dialga and humans was created by palkia. This means, even then it was planned that humans and pokemons would be different things. However, this idea was not implemented (game freak screwed everything up again as usual), because of this, the existence of humans is a complete mystery. People make theories that humans was a evolved pokemons, but let's remember that also in legends arceus we learn that humans can't shrink like pokemons. This thing pretty much completely destroys this theory. It's not possible to assume that humans are aliens, but let's not forget that all aliens are still pokemons (ultra beasts are still pokemon, just a little different),there are no inhabitants of ultra megapolis who can be called aliens, but they are just ordinary humans who just have blue skin. Also we know that humans have powers like aura, psychic and other powers(for example, in the manga, govanny could heal people, but it was to weak and not all humans have that power. But let's talk about theory. This sounds more like a guess than a theory. After arceus defeat giants and take their power. Giants evolved (or should I say DEGRADED) in humans. Arceus not eradicate humans because they can't do to it anything, but it used lake Trio to give humans:reason, emotion and will power, because it want make them to less annoying. The reason for the most part, humans have psychic and aura powers, because giants of the psychic and fighting type are more powerful then others.",

      "content_preview": "This theory is pretty iffy, I don’t have a whole lot of facts to back this up, this is kind of just an idea but here it goes… Every Pokemon fan knows that in every single mainline Pokemon game you only have a mother and no father, except for one… and that is the Hoenn games (Ruby and Sapphire) In Hoenn your father is the petalburg city gym leader, Norman, he is the the normal type gym leader that you get to battle after receiving your 3rd badge I believe that this could mean that your father in other Pokemon games is a strong trainer traveling through other regions, or perhaps even greater than that, the champion or an elite 4 member/gym leader. This could be why the player seems so devoted to training up their Pokemon, striving to be the very best. And why the player always is a much more talented trainer than other characters. The fact that these gym leaders who have been training their Pokemon for years are getting beat by a 10 year old, means that there must be at least something making the player so skilled at Pokemon battles. Another piece of evidence I have for this is that your mother always seems to be fine with their ten year old child traveling through the region alone, getting attacked by magical creatures with unlimited power. Especially since the player usually has never  even had a Pokémon before. So why would she be okay with this? All good mothers would be at least somewhat concerned for their child. The reason she might be okay with this in every game is because she knows that (because of the father) her child is most likely extremely talented with Pokemon and will be able to handle themselves in the region. Or another idea is that maybe she knows her husband is probably out there somewhere, and will look after their child. (That one is a little bit more iffy than the first one but it’s all I’ve got) Sorry, I really don’t have a whole lot of information to back up this theory :/",

      "content_preview": "There are two items associated with Ditto, Metal Powder and Quick Powder . The former raises Ditto's Defense, the latter Ditto's Speed stat. Both powders differ in color: Metal Powder is purple and Quick Powder light blue. If we look at Ditto and compare its normal and shiny form with both powders, we find something interesting: Take a look. As you can see, the powders' colors match Ditto's normal and shiny form. Either that's a coincidence (just like Mew's normal and shiny form matches Ditto's), or there could be more to it. Instead of just being a recolor, shiny Ditto could be an independent form, comparable to regional ones. Both powders are said to raise one different stat. Perhaps they reflect what makes the normal and shiny Ditto special: The normal Ditto tends to have a better physical defense, while the shiny Ditto is much quicker. Who knows, perhaps there exist other colored forms as well, each in reference to a different stat. Unfortunately, this is the only proof which supports this theory. But it's interesting to think about if shiny related items could indicate some special traits about shiny pokemon. As far as I know, Ditto is the only case that has this item oddity.",

      "content_preview": "In ORAS, you have this key item called \"meteorite\". It plays an important role during the events of the Delta Episode, as it allows Rayquaza to Mega-evolve so it can destroy the otherwise world-ending meteor. But there's something odd about it. Let's start by posing this question: Is the meteorite a Key Stone or a Mega Stone? Let's see what clues we can find in the games: Mega Stone Key Stone Zinnia mentions the meteorite is \"just like... a Mega Stone\" ( Quote ), and after Rayquaza eats the meteorite, it's able to Mega evolve. The meteorite's item descripton says \"it's shining with seven colors of light\" / \"rainbow-colored light\" ( Quote ), which resembles the appearence of Key Stones. Mega Stones are shown to be limited to three colors only. The meteorite is probably another Mega Stone. Just because it shines in rainbow colors doesn't automatically mean it's a Key Stone (right?). Though, it's odd why the meteorite isn't called \"Rayquazanite\" then. Question answered, correct? Not really, because we have this peculiar quote by Team Magma's boss Maxie, when you confront him on top of Mount Chimney: ”If we create the right conditions, we should find ourselves able to alter this Meteorite's qualities. Yes, even into a Mega Stone. Even into a Key Stone.” ( Quote ) That's really interesting, because this means you could apparently \"refine\" the meteorite to create a Mega or a Key Stone by yourself. But that also means the meteorite is neither. So what is it exactly? I think it's some sort of \"raw\" material that can be processed into a refined product, namely a Mega or a Key Stone. I'd like to call it \" Stem Stone \", by making a comparison to biological cells: You have stem cells, which are \"unspecialized\" cells. They can change to become different cells, with different functions (like muscle or blood cells) ( Reference ). Briefly speaking, Stem Stone can be altered to create a Mega or Key Stone. This raises some further questions: - If we said those Stem Stones need to be refined first, why is Rayquaza then capable of Mega-evolving? Why isn't there a \"Rayquazanite\"? Well, I suppose that some pokemon could simply skip the Mega Stone step and directly siphon energy out of the Stem Stone. Perhaps because the energy is much more powerful and unadulterated in that form. It's not that farfetched, considering Mega-Rayquaza is one of the most powerful pokemon (evolutions) in existence. - So, if Stem Stones could be directly used to Mega evolve a pokemon, then why aren't there any known examples of their usage? Maxie seems to have knowledge about refining the meteorite / Stem Stone in the first place. But why even make that detour when you could directly tap the source? I don't have a precise answer for that, but there could be several reasons: Stem Stones are just really rare. The only sources seem to be meteorites so far, like those meteors filled with \"primal energy\" 2000 years ago ( Source ). You then have to find and identify a meteor as a Stem Stone, which could be tricky when you know nothing about them. Key and Mega Stones are much more common in comparison. Another clue could be Zinnia specifically stealing Key Stones to summon Rayquaza. While the Key Stones were initially meant to call Rayquaza, Zinnia as a lorekeeper might have mistaken the lore, by thinking the necessary stones with \"rainbow-colors\" must have been Key Stones, not Stem Stones, simply because both share a similiar appearence. Would also explain why she didn't recognized the Stem Stone as such when seeing one for the first time (\"That glittering Meteorite that you've got there... Hmm... It's sure giving off some vibes.\" ( Source )). Key and Mega Stones are more \"stable\" or reliable compared with Stem Stones. Remembering the biology comparison, specialized cells are made for a purpose, while stem cells cannot fullfil any functions. So instead of using Stem Stones as a \"wild card\", you would use Mega Stones which are more alligned to their corresponding pokemon species. It's also possible that the power release via Stem Stones is too powerful for the pokemon to handle. We know that Mega evolution can be painful ( Source ), so using Stem Stones could possible even kill a Mega evolving pokemon. Rayquaza could be the only exeption to this, strong enough to withstand the energy release. There aren't simply any known applications for Stem Stones aside from refining them into Key or Mega Stones. Given Reason 2, the refined products are more sought after, and because of this, Stem Stones are simply regarded as raw materials. It's only with Rayquaza that we see Stem Stones can have uses on their own. - What Mega Stones can be made out of Stem Stones? Maxie doesn't give any clear info on that. Assuming there aren't any limits, perhaps it's possible to make Mega Stones for any pokemon species in existence. The reason why the existence of only a couple dozen Mega Stones is known could be again related to stability. Some Mega Stone are too unstable and thus cannot be found naturally, while it could be possible to create them artificially. Or only some species are compatible with naturally occuring Mega Stones (with the Mewtwo- and Charizard-species being the most compatible species, with two Mega evolutions each). For other species, you would need artificially created Mega Stones, which are more complicated to create. === To conclude, it's possible that there exists a third set of stones related to the Mega evolution phenomenon. They provide the basis for Mega and Key Stones, and despite being possibly more powerful, they could be also more dangerous, resulting in the preference of \"refined\" Key and Mega Stones. The reason why there isn't much known about them could be due to their rarity; with so many Key and Mega Stones in circulation, you wouldn't even think about there being a third sort of stones as well.",

      "content_preview": "So, I've been doing some thinking about the way the Pokédex works, and how often it will produce entries that are fundamentally, ridiculous. These entries will talk about how Pidgeot can fly at Mach 2 speeds, stories of how random children get kidnapped and/or turned into Pokémon, and probably most infamously/overly discussed, Magcargo being hotter than the sun. I know one of the most common answers I hear is that the Pokédex is actually just the wild imaginations, silly guesses of children, which is a valid theory, but one I find unsatisfying. So I am here to propose a theory I find a bit more compelling: The Pokédex as we know it, functions similarly to a LLM AI system. You've seen the way AI summaries and ChatGPT answers will sometimes just sound like complete delirium or misinterpret extremely clear data and come to an extremely odd conclusion and say something that is just wrong. I think the Pokédex is operating on a similar system. You can imagine an LLM being trained on a ton of Pokémon research data, and potentially outputting entries that say some stupid things. For instance, the Dex says Pidgeot flies faster than the speed of sound, but maybe the actual research and observation of Pidgeot shows that its flight movements can be observed to be similar to a jet plane, or other Pokémon who can fly at those speeds, or perhaps that there was an extremely exceptional Pidgeot that was able to fly at speeds approaching Mach 2, and the Pokédex just outputted that information as \"This bird breaks the sound barrier.\" or perhaps, people on a website similar to our Reddit in the Pokémon universe answered people asking questions about Kadabra with some complete ridiculous answers like \"My buddy Kevin used to be a person, but one morning he just woke up as a Kadabra\" and everyone agreed with him for a laugh. The Pokédex decided that was a good enough source, and output that as data. And Magcargo, oh Magcargo, the idea that it's hotter than the sun is physically impossible. Either the Pokédex just hallucinated a completely insane number, or maybe research was conducted on Magcargo that found that the internal core temperature of Magcargo's heat sac or something, under an extremely high level of stress, was able to briefly attain a temperature level equivalent to 10,000 C, in a sort of Plasma-like state. The AI just ignored all that context and just put that out as the temperature of the whole slug. I think this is a pretty compelling theory, while also being a fun way to dunk on AI for being stupid. I hope you like it :)",

Giovanni has some very clear Italian-American mobster influence in design, while Unova is the \"American\" Region. Ghestis only made Team Plasma very recently, with a very specific goal, so there wouldn't be a precursor Team in ancient Unova. Proposal : Team Rocket had its origins in ancient Unova, starting as a peacekeeping organisation ( Defend the World from Devastation) following the chaos caused by the Dragon's Division. They were allied with the Hero of Ideals and sought to either conquer those allied with the Hero of Truth ( Denounce the Evils of Truth) or just to prevent a civil war ( Unite all Peoples within our Nation). Also might have some issues with Enamorus. ( Evils of Truth and Love) I have nothing to back this up. Be interesting if we get a Legends Unova game during the Tao War though.",

      "content_preview": "What if Dynamax and Gigantamax aren't just size transformations — they're actually caused by Pokémon absorbing environmental Dynamax energy, specifically from Power Spots in Galar. The massive growth and enhanced power are just side effects of a dangerous energy overflow. The Dynamax Band isn’t what allows a Pokémon to Dynamax; it’s what regulates and limits how much energy the Pokémon absorbs to prevent it from being overwhelmed. There’s strong in-game and anime evidence to support this. In Max Raid Battles, wild Pokémon stay Dynamaxed (or Gigantamaxed) indefinitely, even after being knocked out. You have to throw a Dynamaxed Poké Ball to catch them, suggesting they’re completely saturated with energy. In the Crown Tundra’s Max Lair, scientists won’t let you use your own Pokémon because they might be harmed or run rampant due to the high energy levels in the cave — even with a Dynamax Band, your Pokémon could be overexposed and lose control. In the anime, when Ash’s Pikachu Gigantamaxes near a Power Spot without a band, Leon immediately recognizes it as dangerous. This reinforces the idea that Gigantamaxing can happen naturally, but the Band is what makes it safe and temporary. This also explains the three-turn limit. Instead of thinking of it as a timer, it makes more sense as an energy cap: each Max Move (even non-damaging ones like Max Guard) uses a portion of the Dynamax energy. After three moves, the energy is exhausted and the Pokémon returns to normal. The Band allows just enough for a full transformation and three Max Moves — no more, no less. Gigantamax adds a twist to this. A Pokémon like Corviknight or Cinderace visually transforms into a new form with glowing patterns or physical changes (like Corviknight’s drone cape or Cinderace’s giant Pyro Ball) as soon as they Gigantamax, even before they grow in size. You can actually see the Gigantamax form changes appear before the Pokémon grows in size in this video at the 2:02 mark if you watch at a slower speed and pay attention. This suggests the form change is triggered by the energy itself, not the size increase. The growth is simply the result of excess energy filling the Pokémon’s body. That means it could be theoretically possible to trigger a Gigantamax form without growing in size at all — if the energy were regulated just enough to cause the transformation, but not the overflow that causes the Pokémon to become gigantic.",

      "content_preview": "Berries in the pokéworld are inspired by real life fruits and the likes. That's nothing new and evident in the berry's name or its appearence. Sometimes the berry in question has a color that's in stark contrast to their real life counterpart. The following ones are blue while their real life inspirations are not: - Rawst (strawberry) - Oran (orange) - Wiki (kiwi) - Yache (cherimoya) - Chesto (chestnut) (referencing this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd7Lz9xY0GQ&t=600s ) Why is this interesting? It's the fact that the color blue is rare to find in nature. I'm not talking about shades of blue or colors appearing blue (like greenish blue or purple), but true blue. Only a fraction of all known plants contain blue pigments, and blue animals are even rarer to find. For example, plants or fruits like blueberries aren't truly blue, but have a different color. There's a physical explanation for why that is. In order to grow, plants need light. They prefer to absorb light that is high in energy (with blue light having the most, and red light the least amount). Absorbing low energy red light would be possible, but it's rather inefficient. It would require complex molecules capable of absorbing that specific kind of light. Though, why should plants absorb red light, when there's plenty of higher energy blue light to take? Because of this and in terms of evolution, blue plants are exceptional. For animals, they either get their colors by ingesting pigments from blue plants or having a special kind of skin/fur/etc. that bends light in a way to reflect blue light. In the former's case, when there are no blue plants, animals cannot gain blue pigments that could turn them blue in appearence. (referencing: https://set.adelaide.edu.au/news/list/2019/08/20/why-is-the-colour-blue-so-rare-in-nature https://www.livescience.com/why-blue-rare-in-nature.html ) So, what has this to do with Pokémon berries? Well, they appear quite frequently. In the case of the Rawst, Oran and Chesto berries, their frequency is reflected in their importance as medicine in curing some common ailments. This contradicts what I wrote earlier, though. Assuming the pokéworld follows similiar rules on how life evolves, it's curious why blue plants / fruits appear so often. My theory is that those are artificial in origin, either specifically bred or genetically engineered to gain this blue color. For some reason, they became widespread to the point that they replaced their counterparts, which have \"natural\" colors (namely red, orange, yellow, green, pink, purple). While a bit farfetched, it could be also a hint that some pokemons' origin could be artifical as well. When some of the plant life has been tampered with, why shouldn't this be also true for the wild life? In retrospect, this theory could be easily refuted by searching for evidence that shows that those berries already existed before the modern age. So no artificial origin while showing that the pokéworld kinda differs from our real life rules of nature. I don't know if the aforementioned berries appear in media set in the past, like PLA, or in the anime (time travel episodes or something dealing with ancient stuff), so I leave that open for now. P.S.: The idea came to me after I realized that the Rawst berry is basically a blue strawberry. I then remembered that there was this hoax with blue strawberries back then. https://observer.com/2019/08/amazon-ebay-online-seed-scams-blue-strawberries/",

      "content_preview": "If you notice Gastly and Haunter's eyes you can see how similar they are to other Pokémon's in the generation. Those Pokémon are Graveler, Golem, Grimer, Muk, Shelder, Cloyster, Onix, Voltorb, Exeggute, Koffing, and Wheezing. I don't think this is just a coincidence. Here is my explanation: Graveler- a possessed rock. When a Gastly or Haunter wanted to surprise people by pretending to be a rock it turned into this Pokémon. Other Gastlys and Haunters caught onto this trend making this Pokémon form. Golem- a possessed boulder. The same thing as Graveler but with a boulder. Grimer & Muk- possessed sludge. When Gastlys and Haunters wanted to hide in the sewers they got covered in sludge. They found that people hate the slimy substance and thought it'd be a good idea to keep this form in order to gross people out. Shelder & Cloyster- possessed shells. When a Haunter or Gastly needs shelter it becomes these Pokémon. Sometimes the shells automatically trap them in the forms making them unable to escape. Onix- possessed group of rocks. The same thing as Graveler and Golem except it's a rock snake Voltorb- possesed pokéball. When either ghost pokemon wanted to surprise unknowing trainers who found an abandoned Pokéball they'd possess one but the electricity cause them to become an electric type. Exeggute- possessed eggs. When the ghost Pokémon find a bunch of cracked eggs they possess it to surprise people who just want their breakfast. Koffing & Wheezing- possesed gas bombs. When team rocket was experimenting this poison type essence they made a sort of sphere that could expel a toxin. One day a bunch of the ghost type Pokémon from lavender town broke in and possessed the bombs. When team rocket workers found them they assumed it was an experiment to make a new poison type Pokémon. The reason they didn't keep the ghost type is because nobody knew that they were possessed objects, therefore when put into the Pokedex they only had the most prominent type(s). Edit: it has come to my attention that Exeggute isn't an egg. It is infact a seed. The explanation still stands since it looks like an egg that people might pick up.",

      "content_preview": "So I have a throry and you guys can tell me your thoughts and even spread it if you want. So we all know Skrelp and Dragalge they were 2 pokemon introduced in Gen 6 but something is off. Why is Skrelp a water type and Dragalge isn't? Well my theory is this, What if Skrelp was NEVER an aquatic pokemon? What if it's water type is forced? So pokedex entries of Skrelp and Dragalge say that they aren't good swimmers and they hide in seaweed to ambush their prey by poisoning it but there is something off. What if Skrelp and Dragalges started going extinct? What if their population was little? You might call me crazy but hear me out There is one pokemon that has seaweed on it and was introduced in Gen 7, one Generation after Skrelp and Dragalge. In pokedex entry for Dragalge it says that they go in sunken ships to live and never be seen again. But what if they never made it back? What if these Dragalges died? And why Ships? Thats because kf that Gen 7 pokemon. Delmise. Delmise is a Ghost Type pokemon meaning its basically an object possesed by a ghost. And what object? A SHIP ANCHOR and what it has on it? SEAWEED. In it's pokedex entries it even says it that it surprisingly goes well with Skrelps. Well that's it. What if Delmise came to life and saw what was happening to the Skrelp population, Skrelps might have been always land pokemon but they were dying by predators. What if Delmise took Skelps and put them underwater forcing them to live underwater. Seaweed produces oxygen in real life which in the pokemon universe Skrelps may use to be able breath underwater, hence why they always hide in it. And once Delmise saw Skrelp growing it evolved to Dragalge (which might be the first time after the Dragalge extinction). Then Dragalges go out of the water to hunt pray but some just still stay woth their Delmise. What if these \"Never to be seen again\" Dragalges in the entries were Dragalges that went out of water to hunt but when they went back in they couldn't find their Delmise protector and eventually drowned? Cause Dragalge isn't a water type pokemon meaning that as i said before Skrelp might be a water type cause it lives underwater in the protection of Delmise not cause it's actually aquatic. What if Delmises are the Protectors of Skrelps (Land Poison Type pokemon) to help them regrow their population? Also one new note: In the anime when Ash finds Skrelp for the first time it immidiatly attacks them, so maybe it saw their pokemon, remembered what the other pokemon did to it's population back then and attacked to protect itself (hence why it attacked pikachu with no remorse). Please tell me your thoughts and if you find more evidence of that being true hit me with it. And please spread this theory.",

      "content_preview": "As you already know, there was a city planned for being between Vermilion and Celadon, while Cinnabar was planned to not have a GYM. https://imgur.com/a/ypF4Psj This city (let's call it CYAN), according to the map, has a GYM. But what type would it have? According to the order of the gyms, if there were a gym with GROUND type between Vermilion and Celadon, and Viridian gym were swapped by a BUG type, the order of gyms would make a cyclical loop of type-effectiveness, where the next gym is effective against the previous. rock < water < electric < ground < grass < poison < psychic < bug < rock So the fourth gym, in CYAN city, would be of type GROUND. It would likely have a team of Cubone, Dugtrio and Sandslash. From the gym of Vermilion, which had a BUNCH of unevolved pokémon and a strong evolved one, the next gym would have one pokémon of a future city (Lavender not being accessible yet), and two evolved pokémon from previous cities (Vermilion, just accessed, and Cerulean's sandshrew), then the difficulty would evolve into Erika, with two third-form evolved pokémon and one unevolvable pokémon. This gym was the original approach for giving the TM 28 DIG, the signature move of Dugtrio and that's why DIG is so STRONG in gen 1, it was supposed to be the fourth gym, past Raichu's powerful Thunderbolt, and not BEFORE as we met. But what about Giovanni? He's the GROUND TYPE GYM! Except, he WASN'T, he'd be a BUG-type. JUST LOOK AT THE EARTHBADGE. It got 2 WINGS and a STINGER IT'S DESIGN IS AN INSECT! https://imgur.com/a/QPQBn4p And I have another proof for this conspiracy. Giovanni would have at least 4 pokémon, possibly 5, but I don't see him using Butterfree. Venomoth, Scyther, Pinsir and BEEDRILL. His core would be his first pokémon ever caught, in Viridian Forest, which is BEEDRILL, with HORN DRILL. When his gym was cut off during development, the rocket hideout received a very important TM which is surprisingly imbalanced for how early you get, right? TM 07 HORN DRILL. Was supposed to be earned on the very LAST GYM, and has been replaced with Fissure, a TM with similar effect. After he was cut, other gyms got his Venomoth in contexts that made less sense. No reason for Sabrina to have one, or even Koga in anime/yellow, that's because they got Giovanni's Venomoth. Giovanni was supposed to be a BUG TYPE. A Viridian Gym leader that got his first pokémon, a Weedle, in Viridian Forest. Also, makes sense the leader of the Mafia has a bunch of pokémon famous for EXECUTION: Pinsir, Scyther, Beedrill. I rest my case.",

      "content_preview": "Before you say what you are thinking, I'll talk about that now... You: \"BW2 was 13 years ago, they can't make a sequel to that game, not many players have it-\" BW2 is only about 1 year older than XY, so it has a 100% chance of having a sequel if this game can. And yeah, ZA is a sequel to XY. The recent promo art for ZA all but confirms that they have revealed Emma and proved this game is in the present rather than the far future, and seems to be more connected to the region than BB LEAGUE was, with it being disconnected from Unova's grand lore. I mean, if you're bringing back Emma, that means you will HAVE to talk about the time that she spent (unwillingly) working with Team Flare, being the user of the Expansion Suit (she is even wearing, I think). And if you are going to bring up Team Flare in fashion , that means you have to talk (or at least touch up on) about the events of XY. And you already have AZ, who can discuss the old past of Kalos, such as the war that occurred 3,000 years ago, and perhaps touch on what he was doing in Hoenn since Zinnia mentioned that he was there at one point, witnessing Mega Rayquaza. And that is true, as evidenced by the fact that in Sootopolis, an eternal flower was planted in the meteorite, which now functions as a modern-day city where people reside. You will gain the complete history of a region while also getting a new story that will hopefully do justice to the original \"story\" and worldbuilding of XY/Kalos. This means that ZA is a sequel to XY, a game released 12 years ago. So what's stopping them from doing this with a hypothetical bw3? The DLC2 for Unova intentionally does not mention things like Team Plasma N, or the original dragon, making me think they are saving it for something down the line. They only mentioned Bugh, Drayden, and Clay, which are baseless in the grand scheme of things.",

Steven Stone's father is the owner of Devon Corp which built many products such as Pokemon producer, PokeNav, various pokeballs, etc. Apart from the released ones, they also have ongoing projects such as Pokemon speech and reading Pokemon dreams. Thus they specialize in innovative and ground-breaking products. Now, Steven Stone is the only person in the Hoenn with a Metagross. The only way you can get a Beldum is when he gifts it to you after you beat him. Let us look into the characteristic of the Metagross line which are all described as robotic and mechanical. Their evolution methods are also robotic with multiple pokemon combining together to evolve. This begs the question, was Metagross secretly created by Devon Corp? If so, it immediately follows that this would be then orchestrated by Mr Stone specially for Steven who used such a powerful Pokemon to propel himself into a Champion. This creates a dirty conspiracy by Devon of utilizing its technical prowess by creating Metagross and implanting Steven as the Champion, granting them a total monopoly over all matters related to Pokemon. Is this too far of a stretch? What do you guys think?",

Every new-ish pokemon game has a section where you can pet/play/etc with your pokemon and honestly the way they are treated is like a mix of animal and retarded child. Alakazam has a 5000 IQ and you can still play fetch with him. The Alolan Rotom and Meowth are both able to talk normally, and are treated and behave like people. Everyone else, brain damage. Some pokemon are less animal and more childish, like the Chansey that went to nurse school with Jessie, or the Jigglypuff that colors your face after singing. In the Scarlet Violet manga, there is a dialogue where they talk about not wanting to feed Miraidon so he wouldn't get used to getting rewarded or something. Essentially solidifying his place in the pecking order as a subhuman lowlife animal. Most pokemon appear to be accessories and pets, rather than friends or partners. Even Rotoms are just considered Siri, despite Alolan Rotom being treated like a person. With all that in mind, I feel like when a pokemon learns how to talk, their whole world view shifts and they unlock a whole untapped section of their brain that makes them human. It is very creepy, you are human and are able to talk and read, and then you meet other people your age who say \"human! human!\" all the time and walk on 4 limbs and play fetch.",

      "content_preview": "I'm not usually one to make more speculation-based theories. Typically, I prefer using as much solid evidence as possible, as it helps minimize the number of reaches, assumptions, or pure speculation. I'd say it's a reasonable and fairly normal approach to theory crafting. Normal, just like our good friend from Paldea, Larry. As 'The Exceptional Everyman', Larry's the most normal guy you could ever hope to meet, he says so himself a bunch after all. \"I simply appreciate being ordinary--nothing more.\" \"I consider myself quite normal. Just another average joe.\" Actually, Larry goes on a bit too much about how supposedly normal he is; most average people don't tend to constantly tell everyone how unremarkable they are. Larry almost seems a bit desperate for everyone to think he's just a normal guy. \"But personally, I appreciate the Two-Segment Form. It has its own charm. It puts me more at ease than something exceptional... I'm just an average, everyday joe, after all.\" \"(What an odd Eevee... As a fellow Normal-type user, I'm intrigued, but a Pokemon like that might be too exciting for an average guy like me...)\" He insists on being so normal, he not only avoids something as insignificantly special as the slightly rarer Three-Segment Dudunsparce, but also refuses to ask about Elaine's unique Eevee, despite being intrigued. Most people would be pretty open to asking about something unusual, while Larry seems unusually insistent on avoiding drawing absolutely any attention to himself whenever possible. \"Anyway, my boss will dock my pay if I spend too much time chitchatting. Let's get this battle over with.\" Despite what many fans of Larry would like to believe, it's pretty reasonable to assume Geeta's not so harsh to legitimately cut someone's pay just because they spent a few seconds talking to a challenger; she's got Iono working for her after all, someone who absolutely despises ever being quiet if she can help it. \"As a streamer, there's nothing scarier than dead air, y'know? I don't feel right if I'm not saying' SOMETHING!\" Speaking of Iono, even she wonders about Larry, questioning how and why he gets away with not facing the camera for his profile picture. Larry claims: \"I prefer to keep a low profile... If people knew my face, I'd run the risk of drawing crowds. That'd make it hard to get into restaurants--or worse, I could get banned for causing a disturbance in one.\" Bit of a strange explanation. Gym Leaders may be more popular than the average person, but unless they have a particularly flashy side job like Iono or Elesa, they don't tend to draw much attention, at least not enough to be any kind of hinderance. Larry's a depressed middle-aged salaryman, not exactly the kind of person at major risk of being swarmed by fans in-universe. But hey, maybe every Gym Leader gets at least a little attention, but even that little bit is too much for Larry, which is fair enough. Though it's far from the only questionable aspect of his character. Larry: \"...I'm not a passionate Trainer like you, Kabu.\" For as much as Larry goes on about how normal and generic he is, about how he's not a passionate trainer, the man has quite an impressive resumé as one. He's not only one of the strongest Gym Leaders in Paldea, but he has the unique distinction of also serving as an Elite Four member. He claims he does this because the league is short-staffed, yet even Kabu wonders if that's the only reason. Kabu: \"Larry, is it true that you work double duty as a Gym Leader and an Elite Four member?\" Larry: \"Yes. We're short-staffed...\" Kabu: \"Is that the only reason? I can tell you're a very skilled Trainer, Larry.\" While it's relatively simple for the player to grow stronger throughout the course of a game, for the average person in-universe, training Pokemon is quite challenging; becoming strong isn't something that happens by accident, you have to be quite dedicated to making it happen. Hop: \"I remember Lee talking about Kabu. He said that a lot of Gym Challengers give up because they just can't beat Kabu.\" Motostoke Gym Front Desk Man: \"We don't have too many challengers, since our Leader Kabu has made his Gym mission so hard...\" Nemona: \"Hey, I heard the good news! Congrats on Gym Badge number six! Not even a tenth of the Trainers who take on the Gyms get this far, y'know!\" Perhaps Larry truly isn't passionate about being a trainer anymore, but it's clear that at one point, he was. Despite that, he still oddly continues to be a Gym Leader and Elite Four member, even though he both clearly has other work to occupy his time, as well as the fact he clearly hates his job. So long as he doesn't get fired, he doesn't care what happens. \"Thank you for doing business with us regarding the redesign of the Montenevera battle court.\" \"I don't understand people who want to work all the time. Even when I'm working, all I can think about is other things, like what to eat when I'm done.\" \"It's important to pretend you're focused on the surface. Remember that. It's a coping technique I learned on the job. It could come in handy when you're an adult.\" When asked if food is all he cares about: \"I wish, but I do think about my job. Mistakes are a pain to fix, after all.\" \"Lunchtime is one of the few things that a salaried employee like me can look forward to at work...\" Larry: \"Correct. I wasn't trying.\" Rika: \"Oooh, the nerve... I swear, you're in for another lecture from Hassel.\" Larry: \"So all I have to worry about is a scolding...? Let me know when my job's at stake.\" (...) Hassel: \"Larry? Larry! Are you even listening to me?!\" Larry: \"If I answer honestly, will it make you angrier?\" (...) \"Well, I was asleep just now, actually.\" Hassel: \"GRRRAAAGH!\" Even if the Paldea League truly is short-staffed, one would think Grusha to be a more optimal choice to fill in as an Elite Four member, what with him being the strongest Paldea Gym Leader, plus having plenty more free time since his accident. Additionally, if Larry were just some random salaryman with no battle experience or passion to become better, it'd make more sense for him to fill in as an earlier Gym Leader, not one of the last challenges. If Paldean Winds is anything to go off, Larry's been working his current job for at least 25 years, so perhaps he started off with a bit more passion and naturally got better over time. Though it's also equally possible he already had his battling skills prior to taking the job. Lear: \"You veteran Trainers have amassed a treasure trove of experience, skill, and knowledge...\" With him being such a notably strong trainer as a late Gym Leader and Elite Four member, it does suggest the second option as more likely. If that is the case though, it begs the question of what exactly was Larry doing prior to joining the Paldea League? Considering he worries about being recognized and causing a scene, going to such lengths as refusing anything even remotely rare or even asking about such things, perhaps he was once someone famous. As a skilled trainer, perhaps he worked in some sort of battle facility, maybe an old Battle Frontier; those places are known for having some of the most gimmicky battles and rules in the series, with Larry seemingly having firsthand experience in coming up with gimmicks. \"I'd warn against anything gimmicky, since that would only work in the short term. Personally, I think you'd be better off maintaining the high quality of the dishes you already have...\" \"Nowadays people only seem to want a shock factor. Something weird, something bizarre. When all's said and done, simplicity is strongest.\" \"...And that's why your instructions to your Pokemon should be precise and accurate. You don't need fancy moves or outlandish tactics. Just keep things plain and simple. When people and Pokemon try to be different from everyone else, they just end up with more work on their plate.\" Larry always goes on about how normal he is, so it seems unlikely he's referring to his dual role as Gym Leader and Elite Four member with that last quote. The series also has plenty of characters that try to be fancy and different, yet don't seem to suffer from any particularly massive workloads. Perhaps if Larry did once work as some sort of gimmicky trainer like a Frontier Brain, he simply grew tired of constantly coming up with new gimmicks to attract attention, instead preferring a simpler life where he can just do basic work and go home. Or maybe he just grew tired of being a bigshot trainer in general. Kabu: \"After all, life's all about training for as long as you're alive!\" Larry: \"...Shouldn't your training be complete once you've reached a certain age, though?\" Or maybe, there was another reason he quit. After all, he does seem to still hold some passion for battling, given his previously mentioned dual roles he likely could've refused. There is something odd that Larry did refuse though. In the League Club Room, he may have a conversation with Poppy, where she asks if she's his best friend, which Larry isn't sure how to answer. \"Errr...well... Hm. I don't think any answer is a good answer for this question.\" Even if he doesn't like Poppy, there's no reason not to just humor her, she'll probably forget about it anyway. For some reason though, he refuses to answer, eventually trying to change the subject without answering. Hell, even with people he clearly does like and enjoys spending time with, he still avoids calling them friends or establishing any form of proper connection. Rika: \"Your meet-ups with Kabu goin' well?\" Larry: \"Hard to say.\" (...) Larry: \"...I have plans to go to the hot springs and eat Hoenn specialties with Kabu after work.\" (...) Rika: \"Wait a minute... \"Hard to say\"?! When they're CLEARLY hangin' out and havin' a good time?!\" What if trying to come up with new gimmicks for attention wasn't what pushed him over the edge and made him look for a simpler job? Perhaps he succeeded and did get attention, the only problem is, he got too much. Considering he worries about being recognized, perhaps he unintentionally created an overly obsessive fanbase that began to interfere with his normal life. Perhaps that's why he's so hesitant at establishing any form of connection, because he worries it could accidentally lead to another disastrous result. With how unusually generic his name is for the franchise, maybe \"Larry\" isn't even his real name. Perhaps he fled his original region and took up the most unassuming identity possible, one that's definitely very normal and hates anything even remotely unusual; this guy couldn't possibly be that old gimmick obsessed trainer from all that time ago, that's just crazy talk. ...Or is it? Well, it probably is. Like I said, this theory is a lot more of idle musings than a solidly crafted theory after all. At the end of the day, it's probable Larry was just a bit more passionate for battling and helping the league grow back when he first started, which ended up getting him more work and eventually completely burning him out, rather than being some bigshot gimmick obsessed Frontier Brain. Larry just goes on and on so much about being normal, it makes him come across as anything but.",

      "content_preview": "A brief rundown of Pokerus to start us off: Pokerus is a virus that only infects pokemon. It has no effect on the host pokemon except to increase the EVs gained from battle. It is more rare than finding a shiny, and is spread through battling. An infected pokemon will naturally cure itself of Pokerus over the course of 2-4 days unless it is deposited in the PC. Pokerus also no longer exists in the games as of Scarlet and Violet. This harmless virus has gone from rare and benign to completely extinct over the course of 20 years. At the same time as it has gone extinct, we have seen vitamins go from limited efficacy to being much more efficient. I posit that the player characters over the course of the game have gotten so many pokemon infected with Pokerus and then deposited them, that they have given the professors ample time to study Pokerus in detail, and to use it to develop more efficient vitamins. But why? We already stated that Pokerus is harmless, and potentially even beneficial. The answer? Because Pokerus is highly contagious, and a small mutation that gave it even an infinitesmally small mortality rate could leave millions of pokemon dead during any outbreak. Under ideal conditions Pokerus can spread from one pokemon to over a thousand in less than 24 hours. Even in less than ideal circumstances it will spread to at least 5 others before being cured. Such a high infection rate would be horrific if it had even a 0.01% mortality rate. We players have been helpfully containing individuals with pokerus for the professors to study, even spreading it to countless other pokemon so that the professors have more case studies. In the process the professors must have found some chemical structure within Pokerus that accelerates EV gain, and after publishing that research the Vitamin companies have modified their vitamins with said chemical compound to increase the efficiency of vitamins so that the limit of EV gain from vitamins is now the pokemons limit of EV in that stat, rather than less than half. At the same time the professors have figured out how to kill Pokerus and have driven it to extinction.",

      "content_preview": "We meet Clair of Blackthorn Gym, \"the blessed user of Dragon types\", in Gens 2 and 4. However, she doesn't show up until Team Rocket is dealt with, and when she does, she starts out boasting that she can even compete with the Elite Four. I think she was intended to be a fraud all along by the developers, rather than just a bragging jerk like Blue. Here's why: She acts like an immature sore loser like Whitney, but at least the latter had the decency to quickly pull herself together and hand over the badge. In contrast, Clair insists that you didn't deserve her badge and invents a bogus test. That's not only immature, but also completely unprofessional, and unlikely to be done by a qualified Gym Leader. Then you go to the Dragon's Den, answer a few trivially easy questions, and she's stupid enough to make a fool of herself in front of you and the master by admitting she failed the test. Then the master rightfully blackmails her, threatening to tell on her cousin. For the record, the test includes the question if strategy, training or CHEATING is more important! Which means it's implied that she values cheating above all else, and is completely devoid of basic trainer knowledge to the point that a 12 yo can effortlessly pass a quiz she flunked. Also, her team consists of three Dragonair and a Kingdra (a Gyarados replaces one of her Dragonair in HGSS). Pretty much all other important trainers in her games have varied, different Pokemon even if they're specialists, suggesting they put time and effort into getting different members from different places to cover each other's weaknesses even if the traditions/conventions dictate they can't be type generalists. Magikarp/Gyarados, Dragonair and Horsea, on the other hand, can just be found around her hometown or in its caves. Kingdra also only requires an item, which highlights Clair's ambitious yet lazy nature and coasting on being a nepo baby. As for the Gyarados in her HGSS team, let's remember that she doesn't show up until the end of the Rocket plotline. She apparently thinks she's so powerful, yet doesn't lift a finger to fight the Rockets, while her cousin is instrumental in dismantling them, and one would think she would have at least helped him if only to get the plaudits for being a hero. So why doesn't she? Because she's lazy and corrupt. It would be just like her to capture an easy Magikarp, and use the Rockets' radio waves to forcibly evolve it instead of training it properly! And for all we know she made a deal with them. Also, she's a much more fierce competitor than the usual laid-back Gym Leader as well as immensely proud of her perceived abilities. It's established that Gym Leaders' and E4 members' task is to test you, not beat you down, which is why they hold back the first time and later come back with increasingly stronger teams. But Clair isn't the type to hold back or intentionally appear weaker than she thinks she is, so the team she puts out against you really is the strongest she's got while the others are actually stronger, but they intentionally hold back to test you.",

      "content_preview": "I know we all consider Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee to be baby games (and they are lmao, like Trace doesn't even have full movesets in his champion fight) but I think they are truly meant to take place within the universe that ORAS setup as the \"mega timeline\". What is the Mega Timeline? (Skip down if you already know it) It's this whole idea of a world that doesn't have mega evolution that Zinnia first hypothesized during the Delta Ep for her reasoning of destroying the device that was going to open an artificial wormhole to a world without the means to defend itself from said meteorite (since Rayquaza can't mega evolve to destroy it due to mega evolution not existing). It's implied she is referring to Emerald (which doesn't have it), as opposed to the world they live in, the story of ORAS (which has mega evolution). https://40.media.tumblr.com/28cbe9508ed54287fe5a49c614c04433/tumblr_nftk63x8tF1tbud5ao1_500.png (Link to scene where she talks about this during the delta ep) Side Note: Mega Evolution would never have existed if it weren't for AZ, from firing the ultimate weapon, to end the Kalos world 3000 years ago. People speculate that this caused a spilt in the timeline, but it's not confirmed whether it did. Imo more treated as a parallel universe type of situation. Like Universe 6 and Universe 7 in Dragon Ball Super where certain things are different like the Saiyans not being wiped out in one universe or Earth still being around as opposed to being destroyed...if you get what I mean. While Zinnia is an unreliable source at times, this is more or less true of an idea of a world without mega evolution since we see Looker later in ORAS, who had lost his memory and doesn't seem to recognize the item that he gives the player (it was a mega stone, Audino). Looker while not the strongest fighter, he is a pretty smart guy being an intentional police member and tends to be informed on the places/things he interacts with as we see in XY, BW1, and PT. So this was a major thing back in the day since he didn't know what was going on or who he even was! This whole memory loss plotline is later expanded upon in SM/USUM as Looker reappears alongside someone from the \"mainline\" timeline, Anabel . Who is 100% not from the mega timeline, since she seems be in the same situation as Looker where they were snatched from their world from an ultra beast, guzzlord to be precise (I think), and are considered \"Fallers\" as they fell from the wormholes and lost their memories. Also, if you don't believe that the whole \"they aren't from our world thing\", yet. Anabel also has the BF  theme (which wasn't finished with construction in ORAS) in her battle tree fight, as well as her Entei from Emerald... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPAE5uNZpBo (like to Battle Tree Fight) ( Kinda related sidenote : Funny enough Lusamine's husband, Mohn, had something similar happen to him which caused him to loss his memories of being a smart genius behind the ultra beast stuff to being a farmer who does bean stuff.) So like to sum it all up, it's told to us that there is a world where mega evolution doesn't exist and the events of the games that were remade still happen like usual (otherwise known as the \"mainline timeline), and then there is the \"mega-timeline\" games where mega evolution exists. I feel this was done to keep the integrity of the original games that don't have mega evolution/gimmicks relevant, while still adding to their lore with the new things. ANYWAYS, to the Let's Go Pikachu or Eevee thing. These games are funny as this sounds, are kinda more akinned to like ORAS than you think. They are beat for what makes it fit well in the Mega Timeline...basically \"what if pokemon yellow had mega evolution\" the game . You get a starter that doesn't evolve, in Pikachu/Eevee. Like Yellow. Your rival gets a starter that DOES evolve but starts mostly as a weak mon like your starter is. Like Yellow. The Team Rocket Trio are in the Game, like Yellow. But only they are a bit more \"fleshed out\" (if you want to call it that). They appear far more frequently usually to point you in the way to go or not to go. You play through Kanto with a nearly exact same main story, with small things being added regarding lore and \"shortcuts\" that allow you not to have to backtrack like ORAS. You even get a cameo from Alola and Kalos, with Blue giving you an item called \"Shalour Sable,\" which was meant to refer to a Shalour City from Kalos. This had to be intentional since it which funnily enough lines up well with XY where there is an NPC who mentions Blue being in Kalos at one point. https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonMasters/comments/djfttz/so_thats_where_blues_catchphrases_come_from/ ....and for Alola... You meet an important character from other region in Mina (the trial captain), who is visiting kanto from Alola. This is eerily similar to Looker appearing in ORAS despite first debuting in Sinnoh, obviously under completely different situations but still worth mentioning. You can use Mega Evolution, which kinda speaks for itself. Even your rival has a mega evolution in the main story, yes, Trace...the friendly rival...of all people has a mega evolution. As I said, this is basically just \"What if Pokemon Yellow had Mega Evolution\", which kinda makes it apart of the mega timeline as ORAS was more of less the same thing with the idea of mega evolution lore being the divider for what makes the game different from RSE. Thank you for listening to my glorified Ted Talk, I hope you have a nice day!",

      "content_preview": "I've developed this theory on how Mewtwo was created: that the Mew embryo/clone that was used as the basis of Mewtwo was altered using the DNA of the Pokérus. I also think that Deoxys is the very source of the Pokérus itself, with fragments of its surviving viral DNA evolving/regressing into an actual virus. Details to support this: The Pokérus enhances the growth (EVs) that Pokémon get from battling. Mewtwo's biological obsession with battling is an expression of this as a full living thing as opposed to the quasi-life of a virus. The Pokérus itself is a virus; Deoxys was mutated from a virus. There's a solid connection there. Also, all of Deoxys's forms have major strengths coupled with serious drawbacks. Mr. Fuji's team probably wanted to combine that with Mew's \"infinite potential\" as the \"genetic template\". Mewtwo's DNA, the Berserk Gene, causes an influx of physical strength but causes the holder to go berserk and uncontrollable (confused). It's as if the DNA infects the \"victim\" like a virus. Mewtwo has a vaguely \"hourglass\" body shape like Deoxys. In conclusion, Dr. Fuji wanted to experiment with the idea of combining two natural \"Ultimate Pokémon\" to create an artificial \"Ultimate Pokémon\" to surpass them both. And the combination ended up being very destructive in itself, with Mewtwo itself likely being tortured by its biological drive to fight and grow granted by the Pokérus/Deoxys DNA.",

      "content_preview": "Okay, this is going to be a pretty long one, don't worry, it doesn't have anything to do with the leaks going around, only information we know. Now, in the Z-A trailer we got introduced to Quasartico Inc., the seemingly random, not suspicious at all company doing the urban redevelopment plan and all. Well, I believe they've actually had quite a large presence in the series up until now, and I'll try and explain it all here. First, I believe they are mainly based in Unova, and are the ones who developed the Terarium. My first thoughts when seeing the new Wild Zones is that they seemed quite similar to how the Terarium had artificial environments for Pokémon to live in, just coexisting with a school instead. Now, at the beginning of the Indigo Disk, if you asked why the school was in the middle of the ocean, Lacey would explain that the school was connected to an underwater plant that develops the natural resources used to create the Terarium, and in this case, the Wild Zones. On the map of the Academy you briefly see while swapping classrooms, you can see the diagram of this plant, while inaccessible in the game, looks to be around twice as big as the entire Terarium, which raises the question how big of an operation this is. Also, it could explain why the Indigo Disk brought this up, to hint at the next game in the series, that being Z-A, and potentially how Unova was skipped in the remake schedule. So, saying Quasartico owns this plant, what else have they done? First, the Nature Preserve, a relatively obscure location in B2W2 said to be far away from Unova, where you could encounter a Shiny Haxorus and some other mons not in the Unova Dex. Now, if we're seeing Quasartico Inc. as the more humanitarian, eco-friendly organisation in this universe, it makes sense for them creating this random place, but also ties into how the Canyon Biome has an area with a near identical layout to the Preserve, which otherwise was just a fun nod. In my own map of all the regions, I placed the Nature Preserve east of Kalos in areas I believe were affected by the Ultimate Weapon, and it was made there to help redevelop natural habitat there, which might tie this to Kalos (but this is more of a head canon). Next, to Alola, with the Aether Foundation, another humanitarian organisation with a large artificial island with artificial environments made for Pokémon preservation. I believe Quasartico could have sponsored and contributed to Aether Paradise's construction, which also makes sense since the Coastal Biome is modelled after Alola, so they could have done research there into Alola's natural habitats. Then, the Pokémon Leagues. A lot of the Gyms have crazy designs, like how the Blackthorn Gym has literal molten magma pools inside of it, so Quasartico could have helped build these as well. Considering the League is most likely affiliated with the international government that runs the whole world, that ties Quasartico to the government, which isn't out of the question considering Macro Cosmos sponsored the entire Galar League. Not only that, the whole Z-A Royale in the new game seems to be a branch of the Kalos League, which makes sense if they have affiliation. Also, the Blueberry League exists, which could have affiliation with the existing Unova League, like how its sister school Naranja/Uva Academy is heavily associated with the Paldea League. Now, as for Lumiose City itself. Lumiose City is the largest city in the Pokémon world, at least from what we've seen, and would be an incredibly ambitious project to fully redevelop if we consider that canonically millions of people could live in this one area. If Quasartico is mainly based in Unova, the whole point about Unova being a diverse region where people and Pokémon all live in harmony could reflect some of their motives on what they want for the future of not just Kalos, but the entire world. But, now the Great Tusk in the room, Quasartico's potential affiliation with Kalos' previous big revolutionary company, that being Lysandre Labs, who previously in the timeline tried to cause complete extinction of all lower class humans so that only Team Flare would remain in the universe. Now, in Pokémon Generations, we saw a bit more of Lysandre's motives, he did it primarily because he believed crime and \"ugliness\" would destroy not only the world's beauty, but lead humanity into a timeline where Pokémon would go extinct (much like the one that the future Paradox Pokémon may originate from), and that needed to be stopped immediately, or he just really hated the homeless, I guess we'll never really know. Now, that sounds somewhat similar to how Quasartico are trying to \"deepen the bonds between people and Pokémon\", and how they just showed up after the whole near doomsday incident in X & Y that probably caused a lot of public distress. Also, I do NOT think it is a coincidence how they installed anti-homeless benches, and that Wild Zones being built in the middle of busy roads and streets would be a major inconvenience for the many citizens of this city. Also, we saw a map of the new Lumiose City, and unlike whatever the hell the Hisui map was, it seems to line up perfectly with the existing X & Y map. However, as some others have noticed, Quasartico's Kalos office is in the exact same place Lysandre Labs once was, which mind you was the area where the Ultimate Weapon was activated all the way in Geosenge Town. This doesn't directly mean they're the second coming of Team Flare, it could have just been free real estate, but it definitely could mean they're getting research on the fuel source of the Ultimate Weapon, Infinity Energy, bringing me to my next point. Now, for reference, Infinity Energy was originally discovered by Devon Corp in Hoenn, as the lifeblood of all Pokémon. Its also the same energy Mega Evolution uses, Primal Reversion uses, and Rayquaza and Zygarde are closely associated with. Its also type energy, and sourced from the Life Plates, tying this all back to Legends: Arceus. There's lots we don't know about Infinity Energy yet, making it the biggest gap in the lore right now (at least in my opinion) which is what I think this entire game is being made to tie up before we move onto whatever the big Gen 10 brings. Now, we do know an eerily similar project that occurred in Hoenn, that being the development of the first indoor city, the region's capital, Mauville City. Possibly after leaking info from Devon, the company that developed Mauville, Greater Mauville Holdings discovered Infinity Energy, and believed it could be the key to creating New Mauville, a multi-billion Poké Dollar project that would create a new underground city that went to nearly a hundred floors beneath the surface. So, they opened up Sea Mauville, said to be an on-water research station for marine Pokémon biology, but was actually a slaughterhouse for the ocean Pokémon, to harvest their Infinity Energy for the project. Now, it did shut down thanks to a whistle-blower, that being the Mauville Gym Leader, Wattson exposing its toxic work environment and unethical practices, leaving the Sea Mauville a sunken tourist spot for wild Pokémon nowadays, and the New Mauville project a cancelled urban failure, infested with Magnemite and Voltorb. We also see modern-day Mauville City as quite a dystopian thing, a giant urban block presumably under constant surveillance, with insanely high cost of living, the whole thing was just a disaster. Not only that, Wattson mentions how Mauville and Lumiose have an incredibly close friendship and connection, it just writes itself at this point. Now, I doubt Quasartico are straight up slaughtering wild Pokémon, that would go against their supposed morals, but something is definitely going on with Infinity Energy considering its ties to Zygarde and Mega Evolution, and how it would be a complete waste of potential to not include this as part of the story. Also, Zygarde has appeared in the city right now for some reason, and is probably on edge considering the somewhat recent (in terms of gods that have been around for eons) incident with its two bickering co-workers Xerneas and Yveltal. The last time a company tried to manipulate a dangerous and mysterious energy source associated with a super-ancient god, Galar got the Godzilla KOTM treatment, and the Brit's sport match was cancelled, so a disaster on all ends. I wouldn't be surprised if the final boss of Legends Z-A has some horrific abomination of corrupted Zygarde Cells arising from the city like in the XYZ anime after some science experiment goes wrong. Now, what I think the main theme of this game will be will tie into the previous Legends game. We saw Hisui as an untamed era where Pokémon ruled the land, while in the far future of Kalos, humans rule over Pokémon. The big message of the story will be that like in any situation, people and Pokémon, truth and ideals, life and death, there must always be balance, one should not rise above the other. The whole story of this series is about this really, two wildly different species trying to live among each other while the terrorists and corporations meddle with ancient creatures dating back eons, either for money, world domination, or some insane ideals, all while the government leave this all in a random child's hand to solve with their dragon they got from an old man. So, tell me your thoughts! I had a lot on my mind about this, and just felt like writing it up, since I feel it solves a lot of plot holes in the series. Also, shout out to u/Christophisis for bringing up Greater Mauville Holdings in a theory a while back :D",

      "content_preview": "For a while I've been rationalizing the mechanic of leveling up in Pokemon by seeing it as what would be normal physical exersice for us humans. By exersicing every day not only you get healthier, but also stronger, and capable of things you couldn't do before. Level 100 would be the biological limit a pokemon's body can reach, just how our bodies eventually reach a limit they can't realistically surpass if we tried to be as strong as possible for whatever reason, which hardly happens as it isn't necesary to go that far to be considered healthy or strong or to have good muscles (unless you're in some sort of competition I guess). Now, obviously, if you break your routine for a while, you would slowly get weaker as time goes on, until you're back at your starting point. If pokemon levels follow this same logic, then when a pokemon doesn't participate in battles for a while in-universe, their levels would drop with time. This would explain those seemingly impossible cases where a trainer has an evolved pokemon at a level lower than it requires to evolve. They got to that level once, but for whatever reason their training slowed down or stopped afterwards. For casual random trainer this can happen precisely because they're casual, they could neglect their pokemon's training a bit if they are busy and don't have a reason to get unreasonably strong anyways; but for experts like Gym Leaders or the Elite Four (though the only cases I can think of right now are Champions Lance and Iris), this can be because of the trainer having multiple pokemon beyond the ones they use in battle. They would change the members of their team from time to time, maybe some trainers do it constantly and all their pokemon keep up with each other, but others may do it after months of using the same team, basically giving their other pokemon \"vacations\", after which their levels would've decreased some and thus what we see in these battles. For all we know, we may have faced Lance after he just picked up his three underleveled Dragonite from Blackthorne City after they spent half a year chillin away from battles. Then there's the wild pokemon at impossible levels. The logic would be that the evolved forms don't have to fight as much as their preevolutions, either because now they are more intimidating or because they migrate to an area with lower leveled pokemon upon evolution and now they don't have neither reasons nor means to stay as strong. An example would be the Salamence in Alola's Route 3. They clearly evolved somewhere else far away, but migrate there probably to help the wild Bagon that fall from the cliffs, and being the most menacing thing in the area, they have ended up so underleveled. As for why this isn't a mechanic in the games, well, because it would be awful. Nothing very fun about the chance of your entire team being level 1 at the entrance of the league because you were busy a few days. Besides, the games canonically take place in the span of a few months at most while we're actively preparing for a league, so not enough time to see something like that happen.",

I always thought the placement of Cerulean Cave was a bit random, considering it is basically the final test of your trainer skills and holds Mewtwo, the strongest Pokemon in the game. And why is it so far from where Mewtwo was born (Cinnabar Island)? My theory is that the cave was originally planned to be on an island between Pallet Town and Cinnabar, a route that is oddly empty aside from some NPC trainers and a small grass patch. This makes way more sense due to its proximity to where Mewtwo was created and also where your Pokemon journey began.",

      "content_preview": "I'm gonna try to summarize this as best as possible, but: Kamado's accent slips through in PLA in every translation, with every version of the game making sure it's a Kansai dialect, which is from the place that Johto is based on. In some languages, he outright name-drops several locations from Johto, talking about them with familiarity, as if they're places he knows enough about. Not to mention that of the 7 pokemon he uses, 5 of them originate from the Kanto/Johto regions, the only exceptions being Braviary and Probopass. Now, why is he in Hisui? Well, according to Beni, Kamado's original village was destroyed by rampaging Pokemon that went berserk one day, which traumatized him so badly he still hasn't forgotten that day even after such a long time. We know that Gyarados is a pokemon whose lore specifically mentions a historical event where it destroyed an entire village (keyword \"village\", meaning it was a very small town). That in mind, the Lake of Rage is a village completely destroyed by Gyarados that eventually filled with rainwater and became a lake. Now, to add something else to the theory: PLA has a weird moveset system, where they mostly learn moves via level-up and other moves come from special training. Of the 5 Pokemon on his final and strongest team, 3 of them are capable of learning Electric, Rock, or Ice moves via level-up. All of those Pokemon know their strongest moves of those types. Then his ace Pokemon is a Snorlax, a Specially Defensive wall that can utilize Giga Impact to take down any non-tank Pokemon in PLA. Looking at Kamado's team, there's one specific type that his team is built to counter: Flying types. Specifically, Water/Flying types. Kamado's teams are built to counter Gyarados specifically, from his moves down to his ace pokemon being one of the only ones capable of tanking a Hyper Beam from a Gyarados, the move said to have been used to destroy his hometown. Between Kamado likely being from Johto, and the lore of the Lake of Rage lining up with the lore of his own destroyed village, it's strongly implied that his hometown was destroyed by Gyarados and eventually became the Lake of Rage. As a result of his traumatic memories from that day (and the destruction that also possibly caused the death of his wife shown in a photo on his desk) he began trying to keep those around him safe, leading to the rather paranoid Kamado we meet during the events of PLA that is willing to exile and kill anyone or anything that would risk the safety of his people again.",
