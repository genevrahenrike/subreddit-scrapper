      "content_preview": "Hey all, There is a local shop that is VERY highly reviewed and the owner has been piercing for over 30 years. I spoke with him briefly and he mentioned that he uses clamps for nipple piercings whereas his other piercing staff do freehand. Upon googling it seems the VAST consensus is that freehand is far superior from a Pain POV (people mentioned that the clamps compressed tissue and made it more painful) but more importantly to me a lot of people mentioned it is less accurate with clamps and that the clamps prevented proper placement...etc. Is there any merit to this? I am assuming since he has been doing this for so long that he must have apprenticed during a time where clamps were the norm. Any input on this? Thanks in advance,",

My nostril piercings are seamless stainless steel and my stacked septum rings are stainless steel clickers. All of these piercings are not fresh at all. Never had a problem with healing them either. My question is, why do they smell so bad???? I know its a buildup of skin cells, oils, makeup, etc. But holy shiiiit its bad. I used to use saline spray in a sterile spray can (neilmed) and then I would use a Qtip to get it on the jewlery and piercings holes. However, this would dry my nose and then skin in and around my nose out so bad. Is there a good soap to use in the shower? I feel like my normal body wash and face wash doesn't \"sterilize\" it and make it not smell/have a neutral scent. Anyone else have a problem with this on healed piercings???",

I recently discovered that my partner got gonorrhea from a metro-Atlanta piercer in late January or February. We weren't together at the time, so thankfully I didn't get anything (I mean it sucks that he dating this girl the entire time but thankfully I'm safe from any infections 💀). I'm not sure when exactly she contracted gonorrhea or if she gave it him or vice versa (they have a whole cuck fetish thing but that's another thing 💀💀💀). But anyways I want to know is the laws regarding piercing licenses and physical health of piercers in Atlanta area. Ik you must have a HPV and hepatitis vaccine, but one of my friends in FL got herpes due to poor sanitation standards of the piercing shop and her piercing having herpes). I'm not sure if I should report her for infecting an client by doing piercings while having an active STD (since I obviously can't confirm this) or if I should just go to the GA piercing standards board and let them know that she had an active STD during a certain period of time + just have them look if she pierced anyone during the same time and just let them deal with it. I kind of don't want to report, since it may come off as extremely petty given the course of events but one of my friends (who's a semi-expert on these kinds of things) says its a major health code violation to pierce or tattoo someone with ANY kind of STD. Could someone please tell me what I should do with this info?",

But my septum has still been bleeding a decent amount, and is quite tender to the touch, but I have been taking medication for pain and swelling. Is this bleeding on day 4 of my septum normal? And should my angel fangs be sensitive around the edges of the entrance site? I have also been using a saline solution to clean my piercings, going in and using a q tip to clean around them, but I was usually using salt water. Should I move the piercing at all when cleaning? Like twisting it or anything? Especially the septum, where there tends to be a bit of blood on the bar during most cleanings at this point.",

I do NOT want them showing through at all (Very conservative work environment and family), I understand that busy patterns and darker colors as well as thicker fabrics/looser fitting can hide them better, but I would like them to be not super visible in the first place. If I angled them, it would be a maximum of 30 degrees, maybe even milder than that. I plan on getting a snug fit during the refitting as well as 2.5 to 3mm balls (likely the 3mm because 2.5mm may be too small for the 14G bars, right?l. Any other tips for hiding them in general? Has anyone tried the silicone nipple covers with piercings? Thanks in advance!",

Some of the easiest piercings I’ve ever had! Aftercare has been rinsing really well in the shower & saline spray 1-3 times a day, depending on crust levels. Now 1.5 months in, my right nipple is randomly sore to the touch! No swelling or redness, but random sharp pains when they are grazed or touched at all. I’m wondering if they maybe snagged on something & I didn’t realize? Is sudden soreness normal, even after a super easy post procedure? Should I be worried 😅 I’ve been extra careful with them since the soreness has started. Update for future humans: all resolved! I kept up with normal saline spray & cleaning in the shower etc. tbh I think the excess pain/sensitivity was lining up with ovulation 😅",

Im not sure what to do, if i should change it now to 7mm or wait. What is your opinion?",
