I've already created this by duplicating the track and in that duplicate track, removing the notes that should play normally, increasing the feedback, and then making it a 100% wet mix. But what if I want to tinker with the instrument still? I have to make changes on both tracks. Is there a way to only modify the instrument once and have it affect both tracks? I thought about exploiting return tracks but because the note sequence must be different, that doesn't work.",

I have some guitar midi files from HIFIMIDI, and every time I drag one onto a project timeline it changes the set tempo of the project. Is there a way to prevent this happening in Ableton 12 (running on Windows 11)? The used to be a pop-up in A11, I believe, that would ask if you wanted to import the tempo but is no longer in the latest version; correct? Sorry if this is a novice question, but that's what I am.... 😆😆 Any help is appreciated. UPDATE: This is now solved...silly notification restore in preferences!",

After looking around a bit it seems that maybe my answer is learning about return tracks?

      "content_preview": "Hey, been producing for a few years now using ableton. Its been on the same desktop this whole time and ive just been putting up with incredibly slow performance, but lately it feels like ir got exponentially worst. Like loading a set with 10-20 tracks takes upwards of ten fifteen minutes just watching the cursor do the wheel spin thing. Not super duper broke rn but dont wanna spend money on a new desktop tbh, but i feel like its gonna be like when Rock Lee took off his training weights in Naruto when im upgrade. In the meantime however do yall have any suggestions to increase performance within ableton or just like computer maintenance tips to get more life out of it? Thanks in advance if u drop a comment.",

I downloaded a sound I want to use and I’ve managed to map a note to a single key but there seems to be a delay like my sound is loading up before playing which is causing a delay for when it’s meant to come in on song (anyone reading that interested it’s the elephantus sound from Genesis No Son of Mine). If this makes sense to anyone, is there a way to stop that happening where I can just press the key and it plays straight away without seeming like it’s loading up? Hope this makes sense to someone.

I want to be able to adjust multiple parameters on an instrument/effect to a random value on set beats then return to a default value after those beats. For example lets say I had a drum rack or drum sampler snare track and I wanted to randomize the pitch and some delay parameters on every 3rd down beat only. An LFO will randomize, but not return the values to back to their original.  Automations don't randomize, and would be tedious for more than just a few parameters. Am I missing something obvious?",

      "content_preview": "There is/was a feature like this in ProTools. When I'm doing a remix, I load all the stems into arrangement view, and then I break the song up into sections. When I make sections, I highlight - vertically - the section in all the tracks and Ctrl-E.  Then, I consolidate (Ctrl-J) across each track.  What I generally do is move the entire section around - all tracks - and work on arranging the remix.  What I would like to have is all of the tracks that make up a section move TOGETHER without having to highlight all the bits from each stem. Ex: A song has Vox, Bass, Drums, Rhy Guitar, Lead Guitar, Samples, Drum Machine, Backing vox, Ear candy - 9 stems.  If I make an edit to just capture the chorus, and I want to move it around in the arrangement window, I have to ctrl-Click or shift-Click to highlight the 9 constituent parts of the chorus section every time I want to move, copy, duplicate, etc. Is there a way to lock all 9 of these parts that make up a section in arrangement view together, so that I can click on a block of these 9 stems as easily as I click on one bit of audio in one track and drag it around?  The chorus should travel together and remain aligned wherever I move it, without having to highlight all 9 parts. My workflow in remixing is generally to divide up the full arrangement of a song as described here (prob verses, chorus, bridge, solo section, weird little in-between bits that I can transform into loops, etc.), and then selectively mute, affect, etc. parts of each section as the remix takes shape.  So what generally happens is that I have multiples of sections throughout the song rearranged and it looks a bit like a checkerboard with things muted (hitting 0 on one of the parts in the group of stems), blah blah - ARRANGING.  Then I go from there with more transformations. I realize that my way of remixing is a bit weird, and I do not use Session View for remixing.  I have a bit of a filmmaker's approach to remixing.  Cool thing about film with sound is that the dialog is encoded within, so the visual HAS to move with the dialog when editing.  I want this to be the same for audio: the drums HAVE to move with the vox (plus any other tracks) from that section. Thanks for sticking with me on this description.  Maybe this has been implemented and I just don't know it yet.  Links, etc. would be super useful.  I am on the current version of Live Suite.",

To demonstrate, I always set up my tracks with some groups for drums, bass, typical stuff, and then have a pre master audio track that I send various groups into that acts as an additional limited prior to the master. If I were to instead just make another top level group that all these groups go into as opposed to setting the output from main into the alternate track with monitoring in, is there any actual functional difference or are they essentially exactly the same thing?",
