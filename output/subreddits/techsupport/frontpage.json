      "content_preview": "I live in an apartment where the internet is supplied by a third-party company. It's part of the rent. They do NOT supply a router, which I'm not a fan of, but I've never had a problem with the ISP until now. We get our own individual network assigned just to the apartment.I have a Brother monochrome laser all-in-one with AirPrint. I've had it for years; it's rock-solid. However, over the last few months, the printer will say it's connected to the network, but none of the PCs, iPhones, or iPads can find it when one of us needs to print, even though all the devices are connected to the same network. After trying to troubleshoot this, and after moving the laser printer everywhere in the apartment, I sent a ticket to the ISP.They had me do some basic troubleshooting, and had me send a Network Status report to them from the printer. That was fine. I was basically thinking that, since WiFi is pretty strong in the apartment, the problem probably lies with the printer, and that I'd need to replace the printer. I'm not opposed to that; I'm in grad school, and my fiancee and I are open to upgrading to a color laser print.However, today I got an email from the ISP stating that the solution is to connect the printer- and all of our computers/iPhones/iPads that need to print- to a public network throughout the building. And that network's password is...\"password\".My response was \"heck no, that's not secure. And these PCs have info for work and school, so we're not going to connect them to a big public network with a password of password.\"And their response was, \"No, it's secure. Totally secure. And the private network you're on can't handle the printer.\" Here's the exact text:\"Unfortunately, we cannot add the printer to your [individual] network, as it is not designed to support devices like printers. The [shared] network is secure and does not allow traffic to traverse between units, so neighbors cannot access your devices in any way. Additionally, the [shared] network uses MAC address–based authentication, so if a device’s MAC address is not verified on the network, it cannot connect even if the password is known.\"This smells like BS to me. I'm not comfortable with this at all. Am I wrong? Should I do this?",

Any tips to confirm if it’s hardware (GPU/motherboard/mouse) or some cursed driver bug?Thanks in advance",

      "content_preview": "My Chromebook is only about half a year old, I bought it used but it works great basically brand new, hardly used, no issues except for a cracked screen which was my fault. The crack is mostly at the top and doesn’t really interfere with visuals.Recently I put my laptop on charge and it wouldn’t charge, which I found very odd. I use the original charger that came with it. On my wall socket there are two outlets: in space one, no charge, just a second of blinking orange light next to the USB-C port on the laptop then if would turn off; in space two, the same thing. I also tried two different Android phone USB-C chargers on the same socket, same issue. Then I tried the laptop charger on a different socket in space one, same problem.But on space two of that same socket, I used the Android charger again and it worked, showing slow charging message with a red light, and then I used the laptop charger there and it started charging very slowly, light still red (for a while before turning orange). I honestly don’t know what was happening. It was working perfectly before with no issues.It seems to be working properly now and the light turns orange (it sometimes shows a red light when I put it on charge but it will go to orange) I've also noticed slower charging battery draining a little quicker and the laptop getting hotter as well as the laptop completely shutting of at or below 20 percent.Is it possible that someone may have used a USB killer or some other device to damage the charging somehow, or got hacked? or could this just be a hardware or software issue with the Chromebook? The laptop is on the latest version and I haven't messed around with anything. Thanks",

      "content_preview": "Let me preface this by saying that I have no idea if this is actually a virus/malware/whatever, and I might just be an tech-illiterate moron and this is something very simple and a non-issue, idk.I also don't really have anything to show cause the only thing I can use as evidence are videos which aren't allowed, apparently.This started back in 2023 with a completely different computer, some crappy Acer gaming laptop. At random, usually if I was idling for whatever reason, audio from an unknown source would begin to play. With the laptop, this audio was like if I was in a call with someone and their mic was left on, white noise but with occasional sounds as if picking up random household noise, maybe with a couple random sounds here and there but nothing I can typically pin down, like voices. There were a few instances but I only have one recorded, which has a loud thud sound as if something was knocked over. In all of these cases, the audio would eventually abruptly stop without fanfare.Cut to today, where I have had this new computer for a little over a year now. Within the past couple of weeks there was an instance where I thought I heard some weird beep, but wasn't entirely sure about it until now. As of earlier today, a similar thing happened, but instead of the audio being like someone's mic was left on and I was hearing it somehow, it was music, played crystal clear as if I had something normal playing music on my computer (In fact I looked around at first to see if I somehow had a game open, but didn't). It was some fairly generic orchestral horn music, like you'd hear as ambient music in a game or something, but while I started looking around, the music abruptly cut itself off with a car honk sound effect.I know this sounds like some stupid meme shit or utter nonsense but honest to God, that is what happened. I really wish this sub allowed videos cause I feel like I need an example and even then I wouldn't be surprised if people assumed it was fake and edited.As for non-audio stuff, I got nothing. Nothing ever appears on my screen, I've never had any accounts compromised, I've never had anything pointing to a mining program or anything using resources, never had \"Huh my computer seems to be having a harder time doing things\", NOTHING. I have absolutely nothing to go off of besides the audio.If it matters, I have had Bluetooth on when each of these happened (I think one of the instances had me with my headphones plugged in, but it was so long ago I can't remember for sure), but as far as I can tell, There was never any indication that a Bluetooth connection was the cause. I can't rule it out, but I also don't have evidence for it.And of course, yes I have run a few of the usually recommended AV/AM tools and they turned up nothing.Sorry for the lengthy post, I've already asked around a ton and get met with equal amounts of confusion and I at the very least just wanna know what the deal is and put this question to rest. I'm posting this here out of sheer not knowing what else to do. Of course I can try factory resetting my computer, but naturally I would ideally prefer to not go through all the setup and shit all over again, plus with out random this is, it could not fix the issue and I might not know for a long time, maybe years.",

Is there something that Verizon needs to fiddle with to correct it? Is the school running some sort of cell phone blocker?

If I just simply turn it off and back on it boots like normal. This happens regularly (a few times a week).I’ve run checks on windows, reinstalled drivers, updated firmware for the drive and it still happens. It’s a Samsung drive and I’ve used the magic wizard to check drive health (even the hours long diagnostics) and functionality which found no issues either.Obviously the BIOS not finding the drive makes me think hardware issue with the drive or drive slot - but just a simple reboot of the PC resolves it which is very strange.Any thoughts?",

I went in and looked and there were a few (2-3) devices on that weren’t mine. I kicked them all off, but 30ish minutes later they were all back on my network and more. I kicked them off again, changed the password, changed the wifi name, and set it to a hidden network. 1 hour later, all 12 of their devices were back. Both the initial password and the changed password were random numbers, letters, and symbols. The initial name was my apartment number, but when I changed it I also called it something random.I called support and they’re sending me a new modem so I hope that’ll fix the issue. In the meantime, I left the devices “on” the network but paused them all because the above obviously wasn’t doing anything.Is there anything else I can do to make sure they don’t have access? Any ideas how they’re managing to get on in the first place? Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated! I’m not tech savvy and couldn’t find much by googling.UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your thoughts and advice! What I have done so far and some more info - it’s set to WPA2; WPA3 is not available on this modem but it might be on the new one that’s coming. I changed both the router password and wifi password, and changed the name again. I made sure that Xfinity’s public hotspot was off, and double checked that WPS was off too (it was). Their TVs popped back on almost instantly, nothing else has as of now. I am positive that they aren’t my devices; MAC addresses are different, pausing access on theirs doesn’t pause it on mine, and there are things connected that I do not own. They’re also showing up under the list of “my devices,” so they’re not just devices that are in proximity or trying to connect… they are connected. Nothing is hardwired to the modem. No one has been in my apartment besides myself, my best friend, and my family, and I never leave the door unlocked so there is a low chance someone had physical access outside of the maintenance man. I’ll update again when I get the new modem and if I do anything else… I have it on my todo list to figure out how to whitelist MAC addresses, though based on some comments with spoofing I don’t know that this would be successful.

I really don’t want to be associated with her. Weird that she’s put her address into MY eBay account though as now I have her address 🤷‍♀️",

It has had Windows 10 - until this morning.This morning when I turned it on to work on some files, my screen wouldnt come on, and then suddenly, my laptop restarted and started installing updates. When it was done, only one profile remained - my husbands, as he was on it last. Mine and my son's are gone. My son's is lesser of an issue, but my profile had all of my school stuff and files for gaming, work, school, home, as well as pictures that I dont know if they were backed up - i tried to keep up on that but I dont know if I had because I hadn't been on it for a few weeks (under my profile anyway)We've checked for profiles maybe not being turned on and in temporary users... its just my husbands.  I'm so upset that it just completely upgraded my windows (which i didn't want) and now my files seem to be gone as well.I thank you all.Please tell me there is a way to restore my profile and files!",

I even tried to delete stuff on part_1 and I was able to (I think) and still it did not let me shrink the partition.After I restarted the pc I can now no longer even see the drive on disk manager or file explorer.How do I view and free up space on my part_2 now?",

Quand je rentre, je vous donnerai plus de détails.UPDATE :Hello everyone, First of all, thank you for all your replies. I didn't expect so many people to help me in such a short time.Here's what happened next. You'll see that it was MUCH LESS serious than expected.Yesterday when I got home, I inspected the computer, and contrary to what my mother told me, the CPU was turning on, but the screen was completely black. I checked the hardware and, by some incredible coincidence, the HDMI cable broke the same evening my mother unplugged the computer while it was still on. When I changed the cable, the screen came back on and I could see Windows Scanning and Repairing the C: drive. This lasted for about 5 hours, than I restarted the computer and it seems to be intact. No errors on restart, and the files seems to be intact (although I haven't checked them all).I told her to stop turning off the computer like that every night, but she doesn't listen to me, saying that it has never had this kind of failure before and blaming instead Proton Drive which I recently installed on it, and I saw this morning that she unplugged it again...Thanks again for all your answers !",

Later, a Tinder “You have a match!” email came through — unfortunately, my wife saw it before I could explain. Awkward moment, and I’m still not sure she believes my explanation, even though it was the truth.From what I gathered, this guy is in his late 20s, I’m mid-40s. Things were quiet for a while, but yesterday I got an email about a 2-year Norton LifeLock subscription renewal. Apparently that’s an identity theft protection service — can you see the irony?Two years ago I even tried to contact him via the info I had from the renovation plans (emails, phone numbers), but never got a reply.My questions: •\tCan he, in any way, access my Gmail and read my emails? •\tWhat would you do in my situation? Ignore it? Try harder to contact him?",

If you go on about managing the ISP nodule and using my CFX app on my Interrim Router Cable or whatnot, I will not understand a word of what you're saying, lol.I live in an apartment with my boomers parents. I have a bedroom downstairs, the living room with the internet modem is upstairs. I have a wifi signal booster that I am plugged into with an ethernet cable that gives me an average of 40mb/s download speed and stable-ish internet. It's not the best, but since we live in a rental unit, I can't exactly connect a wire and drag it through 2 doors and a staircase and a whole room across 2 floors to plug my PC directly into it. I have learned to live with it.Recently, our router randomly stopped working. There's technically a signal, but it was so weak, it was unusable. After a week of no internet my dad called our provider and they got us a new router and the issues seemed to have gone away for a week or two. We assumed it was a faulty router.However, now, every night at EXACTLY 10:40pm, the internet goes back to the same state. Unusable. Ping for games in the 1000's. 10 second delay in voice chats. Absolutely abhorrent. Even my phone doesn't have internet.My paranoid, boomer dad won't let me touch the router, plug anything in it or do anything to it, but he is also frustratingly refusing to call the provider because upstairs, they have no issues with it it seems. Their ipads are running fine.Is there anything I can even do?",

Following the day I noticed my microsoft store was not letting me download anything, \"stuck on retry\" A day later my sound greyed out and in device manager all seemed to be running fine so like all of us I mapped out whole of google and reddit, tried every single step. From restarting services to what not and nothing helped my problem, it did help some other people as mentioned in the thread but did not work for me and then some others. I noticed my windows update has failed aswell and showing no internet found when internet was perfectly fine.SolutionI am chronologically mentioning all the steps that I did and found, some may work for you, some may not but the last one most definitely should.1.) For sound, go to services - Windows Audio - Log on - Set to Local System Account and check the box allow service to interact with desktop.2.) Further if device manager shows that your audio device is not working or something like that, uninstall it and do check the attempt to remove the driver if it pops up and restart your device.3.) For Windows Update, Restart or Start if not already started the following from Services , : Windows Update - Background Intelligent Transfer Service - Cryptographic Service4.) run the following command in CMD or Powershell as admin:DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealthsfc /scannowIf DISM one fails it is most certainly because of a corrupt file, now you can try to fix that through some commands and files but it doesn't gurantee a permanent fix.5.) For microsoft store :wsreset.exeand thenGet-AppxPackage -allusers *WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register \"$($_.InstallLocation)\\AppxManifest.xml\"}Final and closing solutionif nothing has worked (Your CMD isn't running as admin, update issues, microsoft store not working if all overlaps it is 99% that your windows files are corrupted because of \"Windows Update\" IRONIC. \"Go tohttps://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows11Download ISO for x64 (It should be around 5 GB) Now you are not going to directly run the setup because it will get stuck at 46% or something like that so navigate to sources folder and you will find another setup there, run it, make sure to go with the option that keeps your personal files.Plus you would want to download your system's wifi driver and put it in one of the drives (Not C) because after the setup it will ask for wifi to begin installing new updates, if you have ethernet, Chill.It will automatically save your old C drive files in C drive with .old extended file.I wish there was a work way around this lengthy setup but this is the only endgame.I read over 50 different posts, went to customer executive thrice and nothing worked until this. I do not want anyone else to go through that headache. Hope I helped !!",

I’ve checked my display settings and it’s set to the correct 1440p resolution, I even scaled down the fps and it hasn’t helped. I’ve tried different HDMI and Display port cables, checked all my drivers, and everything is up to date.I even checked my GPU cable connections. I’ll list the specs below in hopes that may help. I called memory express for help and they want me to just bring the PC in for a tech appointment.Ryzen 7700x, Asus Prime 9070 OC, MSI B650M A Pro, Kingston fury impact 32gb, DDR5 CL30 ram, Crucial P3 Plus 2tb, Corsair RM750e.

About 15 minutes after getting off the phone with them and everything they tried not working my internet suddenly works and that random network is no longer showing up. No clue why that all happened which makes me think even more someone was blocking my internet but I’m not even sure someone could do that. Maybe I’m paranoid because I’m not very tech savvy but thanks for the help or at least the comments to fill my time while trying to get this crap figured out lolI don’t post often or ever but this just happened to me and I’m unsure whether or not I should be concerned. I was playing some video games about an hour ago (Fortnite) and I tried joining a creator made game and right when I was about to join the lobby my internet suddenly stopped working. I tried loading a YouTube video on my phone, & tried the same on my Xbox but nothing worked. So I tried resetting my wifi to see if that would help, I unplugged my router/modem for about 30 seconds and plugged it back in, waited for the connection and still nothing. I checked my phones wifi connection to make sure I was connected to my wifi and randomly in the “other networks” section I saw a network with no password needed that had my last name and a few numbers & commas. I guess I am posting this to ask if I should be concerned. I’m certain it isn’t a neighbor pranking me, and it felt odd that this network never showed up until the moment my internet completely stopped working. I plan on calling my ISP first thing in the morning. Any information would be greatly appreciated!",

When the drivers timeout my screens all go black and I have to hold the power button to shutdown to be able to get everything running again. Last week after doing one of these shutdowns my sata SSD (Crucial BX500) was no longer detected by windows. Device manager showed it as an unknown device, disk manager wouldn't let me initialize it, and it didn't show up in BIOS. I plugged it into an external enclosure and nothing. I tried it in another PC and it wouldn't boot with it connected, and didn't show up when connected after boot. I tried to let it self repair and nothing. Finally I cut my losses and ordered another identical drive, only for the exact same thing to happen again a few days later.Are there any steps I'm missing? Did I do something wrong? I had been hard shutting down like this for months prior to the first instance of this happening and nothing bad occurred.",
