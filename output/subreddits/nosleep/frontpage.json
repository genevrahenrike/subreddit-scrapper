      "content_preview": "I know this title seems dumb and weird but I need help because I saw it last night. I was minding my own business cooking when a movie I was watching finished. It auto played to a man standing in a room with a light beaming down with his back facing towards the camera.He was like that for a minute or longer. He then adjusted himself and turned around to face the camera. He was wearing a nice suit and tie with shaggy hair. You just couldn't see his face. No it wasn't like he was missing his face. You could see his lips. It was the lighting of the room. It was like a spotlight for a stage.He then began to speak. I couldn't remember most of it for it just sounded like rambling. He would start on one subject and then immediately jump to the next. It was kinda disorienting.I was gonna shut it off when he started another ramble.“I remember seeing her for the first time. She was so perfect. I thought right then and there she would be my home. Someone I couldn't live without.” A smile of delight grew on his face.“The first few interactions were bumping into each other. We had been working at the same place. She was just starting and I had been there for a while. Her smile was like magic. I would intentionally find ways for me to bump into her. She was my little way into heaven.” He was rubbing his ring finger.“It took awhile to convince her to go on a date with me. She was worried about how it would affect work, how they would look at us, normal little things. When we did go I took her to this lavish place downtown. It was beautiful and perfect. I knew she would love it…. She did, she was absolutely smitten. I could see it on her face and how she did her little excited dance. We ordered some basic fancy food like steak and lobster. The shit that makes a dent in the pocket. I would do it all for her though. When we got done at the restaurant I took her stargazing. I had found this perfect place not too far from the city. It was a place perfect for a first kiss.” He stumbled with his words for a second.“She was so pretty. I was staring at her more than the stars. I think she knew but didn't care. She looked at me at one point and all I could stare at were her lips. They called me. Now maybe I was a little all over and wine drunk but I went for it. Something sober me wouldn't have done. The more I think back on it, I lucked out. She kissed me back and from there it was history.” The excitement growing in his voice was like a little kid getting a toy.“We would go on more dates. Get more daring at the work place. Finally we decided to go home and… and have sex. It felt like heaven. I had never felt anything better.” The euphoria on his face was growing exponential at this point.“It wasn't long though. I had forgotten one thing. One simple thing. That my wife hadn't worked today and was only dropping the kids off for school. You could see the red in her eyes before she swung the axe. It hit me first and went straight through the back of my skull. I didn't feel the pain. I was dead on the spot. The lady on the other hand wasn't so lucky. They say they are still finding pieces of her all over the neighborhood.” He chuckled on that remark.“My wife turned herself in only after drowning our son. Saying that was her only crime…. They found me a couple days afterwards. Head off and penis cut off. I think that being her last fuck you to me.” He paused for a moment before dropping the smile.“September 4 2025 8:00 am” he said before the tv cutting back to some old film. I was confused to say the least. It only got worse when I woke up the next morning to the work group chat saying the boss had been killed. That his wife went crazy or something. Not all the details are known except there are two more victims. One being their child and the other being unknown.I just need to know if I was the only one to see it. Thank you for your time",

      "content_preview": "You ever wonder what kind of job makes a man come apart at the seams—fracture not over weeks or years, but in one single, black-lunged night?Not from stress. Not from boredom. But from something else. Something dry and crawling that licks at the edge of your sanity like windblown sand against old bone.Yeah, I used to wonder that too.Now I don't wonder much of anything. My thoughts come slow, like they’ve got to drag themselves up through molasses. I don’t sleep—not really. When I do, I hear the whispering. I see flickers in corners that should be empty. I don’t trust my reflection anymore. I don’t trust my own voice. Something came back with me from that place. Something I never invited.The job was simple—or so I thought. One night shift in the middle of nowhere. And a list of rules. Just twelve of them. Keep your head down. Stay awake. Follow the rules. But rules mean nothing when the air itself wants to gut you. When silence starts to hum. When shadows breathe.Let me take you back to the beginning.My name’s Eric. I’m 28 years old, though now I feel older—worn down like desert stone under centuries of wind. I’ve never been the stay-in-one-place kind of guy. I’ve chased hurricanes on oil rigs, run toward wildfires when everyone else ran away, and even launched myself off rooftops for a few thousand YouTube subscribers back in the day. I guess you could say danger was my drug. I didn’t just flirt with risk—I waltzed with it, arms wide, laughing in its face.So when I saw the job post—a night watch gig at an isolated weather station in the far reaches of West Texas—it felt like a gift. The pay was suspiciously good. The location? Dead center of the xyz Desert, fifty miles off any real road. No towns. No neighbors. No signal. Just a pin on a map and a time to show up.I packed light: books I wouldn’t read, a journal I wouldn’t write in, and that stupid optimism only people who haven’t been broken yet still carry.The outpost—Station 119B—was a concrete box. One room. No markings, no signs of life. Just a dented steel door and a big black window staring out at an endless stretch of sand. Inside, there was a desk cluttered with equipment I couldn’t name, a fridge, a cot, and a generator that sounded like it was one bad night away from dying. But what caught my attention wasn’t any of that.It was the manual.A thin, grease-stained pamphlet on the desk, labeled in crooked red ink:RULES FOR NIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR – STATION 119BNot instructions. Not training. Rules.There were twelve.And they weren’t the kind of rules you find in HR handbooks. They read like folklore passed down from some ancient desert cult.Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.If you hear tapping on the window, turn off all lights and lie face down until it stops.Log wind speed every 30 minutes. If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.If the desert goes silent (no wind, no bugs), recite the phrase taped to the fridge.Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base Code: Yellow Echo.If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.Don’t fall asleep.Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.If Rule 1 is broken, burn the manual immediately and pray.I read them again. And again. Each pass made my skin prickle. It was like reading a curse disguised as policy. But instead of walking away, I laughed. Really laughed—sharp, barked out loud like a man who thinks he’s above fear—because I was still the guy who thought ghosts were fun stories and rules were made to be tested.It sounded strange in that room—too loud, too human. It bounced off the concrete walls like it didn’t belong there. Maybe it didn’t.In my head, this was all just some elaborate hazing ritual. A creepy prank left behind by some disgruntled ex-employee with a flair for drama. I imagined a guy like me—bored, probably high—scribbling down those rules just to mess with the next poor sucker assigned to Station 119B. The candle, the weird times, the chanting. Classic psychological tripwire stuff. Probably some government joke I wasn’t in on.Still… the place didn’t sit right with me.The air was too dry. Not just desert-dry, but hollow, like the atmosphere had been scooped out. The silence felt rehearsed. Choreographed. And the stars above the station—they didn’t twinkle. They just watched. Cold, close, too sharp. Like pinholes poked through a thin sheet of sky. If you stared too long, you got the feeling something might stare back.But I told myself, I’ve jumped out of planes. I’ve stood on collapsing fire lines. I’ve put my own damn hand in a box full of scorpions on a dare for likes. What’s a little ghost story in the desert?The first couple hours passed like I expected: dull, dry, and quiet. I logged the wind speed like Rule #3 said, every thirty minutes. I even timed it with my watch to be precise—treating it more like a chore than a warning. I made some instant coffee that tasted like regret. I watched a tarantula the size of my palm crawl across the outside of the window—slow, aimless, like it knew it was being watched.Then, around midnight, things started to… bend. Not snap. Not break. Just bend, subtly, like the world had gone a few degrees off center.It was 12:11 AM when I heard the knock.A sound so ordinary it felt impossible for it to feel so wrong.Not banging. Not frantic. Just three knocks—spaced out. Intentional. Like whoever was outside wasn’t asking to be let in. They were stating they were already here.Every hair on my neck stood at attention. My hands clenched around the mug before I realized they were shaking.My mind stumbled back to Rule #1: Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.I froze. My thoughts tried to be logical, tried to be brave. Probably just the wind, I whispered to myself, though the words felt hollow even as I said them.But the wind doesn’t knock. It howls. It hisses. It dances through cracks and moans through empty places. It doesn’t walk up to a reinforced steel door and knock three times, exactly, then stop.I checked the wall clock.12:13 AM.My throat tightened like I’d swallowed dry sand. My legs screamed to move—toward the door, away from it, I didn’t even know. But I stayed still. Not because I believed the rule. No, not yet. But because something in my gut, something primal and old, told me that opening that door would be a very final kind of mistake.The knocks came again. Same rhythm. Three. Then silence.12:20. More knocks.12:29. Again.12:41. They kept coming—every few minutes. Always three. Always the same weight behind them. As if the thing on the other side had all the time in the world.I didn’t respond. I didn’t speak. I just sat there, heart hammering, watching the second hand crawl across the clock face like it was moving through tar.Then came the tapping.Not on the door.On the window.A soft, delicate tap-tap-tap, like fingernails on glass.I turned slowly—deliberately—expecting to see something. Anything. A face. A shape. But the window showed only the dark, stretching desert. Pale sand under a black sky. Empty. Still.Then: tap-tap-tap.Right against the glass. Closer this time. More urgent. Like whatever was outside had grown impatient.Something deep in me—some instinct older than thought—screamed to obey the manual.I threw the lights off and dropped flat to the floor, face down, just like Rule #2 demanded.And let me tell you—I felt ridiculous. Lying on cold concrete like a scolded child playing hide and seek. My breath echoed in my ears, too loud, too fast. The tapping continued—soft, steady, like it was trying to coax me up.I didn’t move.The darkness stretched forever.Finally—mercifully—the tapping stopped.I waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Then, slowly, I pushed myself up, muscles aching from the tension. I flicked the lights back on and blinked into the sterile brightness.Then, like a complete jackass, I laughed at myself.Real mature, I thought. Terrified by shadows and knocks like I’m in a Halloween special.But the laughter didn’t stick this time. It crumbled in my throat like dry paper.Because as I stood there, letting my pulse settle, my eyes drifted toward the wind monitor on the desk.And it was flatlining.Zero.No wind. Not even a whisper.My stomach dropped.Rule #3 roared back into my mind like a siren:If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.And suddenly, I wasn’t laughing anymore.I checked the wind monitor again, hoping—praying—I’d read it wrong.Wind Speed: 0 mph.Nothing. Not a breeze. Not a whisper. The line on the graph was dead flat, like a heartbeat that had given up.My chest tightened—squeezed from the inside like my lungs were folding in. That couldn’t be right. Out here, the wind never stopped completely. Even the still nights carried a faint, restless stir through the sand. But now? The world outside was holding its breath.I should’ve stayed inside.But something pulled me toward the door. Not curiosity—denial. That desperate human instinct to confirm the lie, to tell yourself everything’s fine if you can just see it for yourself.I stepped outside.And immediately felt the weight of a mistake settle on me like lead.The air was… wrong. Not just calm—dead. Still in a way that felt manufactured, unnatural. Even my own breathing sounded too loud. There was no wind. No rustle of dry shrubs. No skittering bugs. Nothing but the crunch of my boots on sand.The desert had gone mute.And then I saw them.Footprints.In the sand, just a few feet from the threshold.Coming in.But none going out.I stood there for a full, frozen second, my body refusing to catch up to what my brain was screaming. Then instinct kicked in—I spun, bolted for the door, slammed it shut behind me like it might keep something out that had already gotten in.Lock. Chain. Bolt. I checked everything. Hands trembling. Breath sharp and uneven.And then my stomach twisted as another rule clawed its way up from memory:Rule #7: Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base. Code: Yellow Echo.The satellite phone was right where it had been—on the desk, a grey relic from another era. I grabbed it like a lifeline, dialed the code with fingers that barely obeyed me.It rang.Once.Twice.Then it connected.And what I heard next nearly stopped my heart.It was my voice. But not like a recording. It was live. It was me. Except it wasn’t. The cadence was slightly wrong. The tone a hair off. Too calm. Too final.\"You shouldn’t have opened the door,\" it said.Click.Silence.I stood there, staring at the receiver like it might explain itself. Then I yanked the cord from the back. The phone went dead.That’s when the lights cut out.All at once.Like someone had flipped a master switch on reality.Total blackness swallowed the room. The kind of black that has depth. Like it could reach out and touch you back.I didn’t breathe. Didn’t move.Then my memory jolted into motion—Rule #4: If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.I scrambled to the shelf, nearly knocking over the chair in the dark. My fingers found the candle—a thick, stubby thing already set in a glass holder. I fumbled for the lighter, struck it, and lit the wick with a hand that couldn’t stop shaking.A small, flickering flame sprang to life.And the room changed.The dim red light didn’t just reveal the space—it warped it. Shadows twisted too far into the corners, stretching longer than they should. The air shimmered, barely perceptible, like heat off asphalt—but colder. The walls felt too close now, as if the room had been inching inward, shrinking around me when I wasn’t looking.I turned slowly, and for just a breath, I thought I saw movement in the reflection of the window. Not a shape. Not a face. Just shifting. The kind of thing your brain registers an instant too late.That’s when I heard it.A whisper.Soft. Barely audible. But unmistakable.\"Eric.\"My name.It wasn’t shouted. It wasn’t angry. It was… gentle. Almost caring. Like the voice of someone who knew me. Loved me. Wanted me to trust it.But it didn’t come from the door.And it didn’t come from outside.It came from somewhere. From everywhere. Inside the room. Behind the walls. In the space under the cot. In the reflection in the window I wasn’t supposed to look at. My skin crawled. My mouth went dry. My heart slammed against my ribs like it was trying to run for the door by itself.Rule #5: Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.But was it outside?I didn’t know.And that’s what terrified me most.I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself not to move. Not to speak.The voice came again.\"Eric,\" it whispered. Closer this time. Like it had crossed a threshold.Like it was already inside.I clutched the manual like a child clings to a teddy bear in the dark, desperate for comfort that paper couldn’t possibly give. My arms wrapped around it as if the ink inside could somehow shield me from whatever else was breathing in that room with me.Then I heard it.The fridge.Buzzing.Low, mechanical. A sound so ordinary it shouldn't have chilled my blood. But in that moment, it was like hearing a coffin creak open by itself. My eyes snapped open. The red candle flickered wildly, the flame stuttering as if suffocating in air that was too still, too heavy.Then came the silence.Not quiet—silence. The kind that doesn’t just fill the room but consumes it.No wind. No bugs. No low hum from the machines that had kept me grounded in reality for the past few hours. Even the candle’s flicker made no sound.Just an aching, crushing stillness.Rule #6. My breath hitched.I bolted toward the fridge, legs trembling like they didn’t belong to me. My fingers scrambled along the metal door until they found it: a small, weathered strip of paper taped just above the handle.The writing was faint, as though the ink had tried to escape the words it formed.“O watcher of dusk, I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”My lips moved before I could think.“O watcher of dusk…” I began, my voice cracking like an old record. “I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”It felt like trying to speak underwater. My tongue stumbled over the rhythm the first few times, the words sticking to my throat like glue.I repeated the phrase. Again. And again. Louder.And then—I heard it.The silence shattered.A sudden gust slammed against the walls of the outpost, making the concrete groan in protest. Wind howled through unseen cracks. Insects returned in a chorus of buzzing, scratching life. The room breathed again.And I—God help me—I nearly cried.But the relief lasted all of three seconds.Then the phone rang.That shouldn’t have been possible.I had unplugged it. Pulled the cord straight out of the back. I stared at the empty socket, then at the receiver.It rang again.And again.Three times total.Rule #8 screamed through my skull: If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.I already had.I backed away, the manual still clutched in one hand, candle in the other. My eyes flicked to the wall clock.2:51 AM.And just like that, another rule surfaced.Rule #9: Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.I hadn’t meant to. I swear I hadn’t.But the moment I thought it, I looked.And that’s when I saw it.Not in the window itself, but in the reflection. In the far corner of the room, behind me—a tall, human-shaped figure. Perfectly still. Head cocked slightly to one side like it was trying to understand me.My breath caught in my throat like a wire pulled tight.I turned.Nothing there.I whipped back to the window—and it was still there. Same spot. Same tilt of the head.Watching.Unmoving.I lit another red candle. Then another. My hands moved on instinct now—desperation drowning thought. The room bathed in flickering crimson light. Shadows danced madly along the walls.The figure remained. Still. Patient.Then—I blinked.And it was gone.Just gone.No sound. No movement. Like it had never been there.But I knew it had.My instincts screamed: Get out. Get in the truck. Drive until the sky changes.But the manual… it said nothing about leaving. Not once.And suddenly that absence felt deliberate.Like the rules had never been written for leaving.Only for surviving until morning.And morning felt very, very far away.Then it hit me—Rule #11.Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.Simple. Strange. I'd read it like a joke the first time. But now, it loomed in my mind like a warning carved into the walls of a tomb. Something churned in my gut—hunger, maybe. Or dread wearing hunger’s mask.I moved toward the fridge.Every part of me screamed don’t, but my hand gripped the handle anyway. It was cold. Damp with condensation.I opened it.And found… nothing.Not empty shelves. Not expired leftovers.Nothing.Every item that had been there earlier—gone. Erased. As if they'd never existed.Except for one thing.A single, folded note resting where the milk used to be.I unfolded it slowly, heart pounding like a drumbeat in a funeral march.“Don’t look at the window again.”That was it. No explanation. No name. Just that one line, like the fridge itself was whispering.My hand trembled as I slammed the door shut.Then—knock knock knock.Again.Same rhythm. Same weight.The sound drilled into me, stripped away whatever calm I had left. My whole body tensed, but this time, instinct didn’t scream. This time, I didn’t freeze.I glanced at the clock.1:35 AM.I blinked.Wait.That was past the time window. Rule #1 ended at 1:34 AM.Technically… I could open the door.And I did.Cautiously. Slowly. Holding my breath like it might make a difference.I opened the door.And saw nothing.Just the empty desert, black sky overhead, wind rustling sand like whispers too quiet to understand.But then—I looked down.And that’s when my stomach dropped.A second manual lay on the ground.Different cover. Thicker.Stamped in large, blood-red lettering:“Rules for Eric – Night Two.”Night two.There wasn’t supposed to be a night two.I wasn’t coming back. No one was.That’s when I realized the truth.This place—Station 119B—wasn’t a weather station. It never had been. It was a test. A ritual. A trap.And I wasn’t an employee.I was a subject. A sacrifice. A participant in something I didn’t understand and could never escape.Maybe I hadn’t broken Rule #1. Not technically.But I didn’t care about technicalities anymore.I was done playing by their rules.I walked back inside, teeth clenched, and dropped the new manual into the candle flame.Just like Rule #12 said: If Rule #1 is broken, burn the manual immediately… and pray.The paper caught instantly. The flame devoured it. Pages curled and blackened, the fire dancing like it had a mind of its own.Like it was laughing.I backed away.That’s when the room changed.Instantly.No warning. No flicker. Just gone.The cot—gone. The fridge—gone. The desk, the equipment, the satellite phone—all erased.The room had reset.Same size. Same shape. Same walls.But stripped bare.Just me.The window.And the candle.My breath came in shallow gulps.Then came the tapping.But this time—it wasn’t on the glass.It was inside the walls.Light, skittering taps at first. Then heavier. Then moving.Circling me.Like something was crawling through the concrete. Tracing a spiral I couldn’t see. Trapping me in the center.My mouth opened, but no sound came out.And then—I remember screaming.I don’t remember why, exactly.Only that my voice tore from my throat like it was trying to escape without me. I remember scratching at the door. Fingernails splitting against steel. I remember the candle going out.And I remember the shadows.They crawled under my skin.Not metaphorically. I could feel them. Like black centipedes burrowing through my veins. Eating their way into my thoughts.Then—Nothing.I woke up at dawn.Face down in the dirt, fifty yards from the station. My clothes damp with dew. My hands shaking.My car keys clenched tight in one fist.The manual—gone.I stumbled back to the building.The door hung open. No lock. No chain.Inside?Empty.No furniture. No gear. No candles.Only one thing remained.A mirror.Taped to the center of the window.I walked up to it.I should’ve turned away.I should’ve remembered Rule #9.But I looked.And what looked back wasn’t me.It wore my face—but not my eyes.The eyes were wide. Too wide. Stretched like the skin around them had been peeled back.They were black, bottomless. Not hollow, but full—of things I couldn’t describe. Things that watched from the other side of glass. Things that waited.Things that remembered.Now?I don’t take jobs anymore. I don’t go outside after dark. I stay indoors. I keep the lights on. I pretend the rules still protect me.But nights are hard.Sometimes I hear knocking.Always three times.And if the wind ever dies completely…I stop breathing.Just in case it's still out there.Waiting for me to forget the rules.Even just once.",

      "content_preview": "I live in a fairly safe neighborhood in a not so safe country if you know what I mean. I reside in a street that’s lined with houses that are blocked around/ private and everyone more or less knows everyone in there but of course we’re always vigilant because you can never tell when you might be unlucky .I live about a quarter mile in , my house right after a bridge next to a deep river (that you can’t really cross) and on the other side miles of tall grass. I live with 7 other people in the household. Every night we ensure we lock the main front gate & activate the security cameras. We also have staircases leading to the front and back entrances of the second floor that’s burglar proofed & secured by even more gates . The remaining perimeter of the property  is blocked off with high concrete walls adjoining the roof leaving no space for any sizable creature to crawl through.This particular night the entire family was out. They had gone to a wake of a close family friend. I was home alone because I’m 26 and needed an early night’s rest for work the following day. It was just after 8pm I locked up & went to shower. I usually play music while doing so but a few minutes into my routine I could’ve sworn I heard a faint knock coming from my front door. At this I quickly jumped out , turned off the music & stood in silence. Feelings of confusion and panic were creeping in because I was 100% sure everything was locked , the gates the doors plus I had the keys inside the house. A few drawn out moments passed when I heard it again but this time it came from my bedroom window that’s on the second floor with no ledge to stand on , on the opposite side of the house . I  checked the cameras and saw that there was no one at any of the windows or entrances and it showed no one entered any time into the property.My logical mind brushed it off as maybe a huge bug or something but I wasn’t convinced. I got dressed and as soon as I walked back into the living room, I heard the padlock on the main front gate being tampered with. This padlock is inside and you basically have to shove your hand in an awkward position through narrow metal bars to even reach it. I hurriedly checked through a window that gave direct sight to the main gate & what I saw made my knees buckle.Standing outside my gate, in the darkness of the night faintly aglow by the dimming street light was my grandmother. She was in one of her homemade dresses she had sewn and her head was covered with a white translucent shawl that obscured part of her face.Now you’re probably thinking - dude go open the gate for your grandma. Well only one problem with that - she’s been dead for 14 years AND was CREMATED.I blinked a million times trying to blame exhaustion from work for what I was seeing but somehow whatever that stood there taking the form of my poor grandmother had caught sight of me looking through the window . It slowly raised its hand and waved awkwardly and beckoned me to come open the gate without saying a word.Immediately I called my mom and explained what was going on. Thankfully she didn’t doubt me because she had also experienced strange things along with my other relatives in this street. I looked out after making the call and saw that the figure was gone. Within 20 minutes my mom and other relatives arrived home.They did a thorough search and found no one on the property. What’s even weirder was that the security camera footage showed no one was standing at the gate during the time I was experiencing this. My older cousin decided to do one last check around the house outside this time and in some tall overgrown bushes a few feet from the property he found a white shawl - except this one had many holes and was tinged with dirt as if it had been buried under the earth for years.This happened a month ago & since then I’ve never stayed home at night alone.",

      "content_preview": "Part 1Part 2I didn’t sleep. Not after Shaan. Not after the fan’s thin wheeze kept tracing a boy’s last breath through my ceiling.Morning didn’t arrive. It seeped. Pale light bled through the curtains while I counted fan clicks like rosary beads.At 7:12 a.m. the intercom coughed once, reminding me it knew my name. It didn’t ring. It didn’t need to. The rules stirred in my head: It learns your voice. Do not breathe at the crack. Never go to the terrace.I made tea with bottled water. The towel over the mirror had a wet thumbprint on the inside. Not mine.In the hall, footsteps matched me for five beats then stopped when I stopped. I slid a rolled towel hard against the door’s bottom until the draft stopped touching my ankles like a tongue.I was brave long enough to be stupid. I went looking for the extra landing.Between the seventh and eighth floors, a shadow waited: the outline of a landing that had forgotten to be built. My feet corrected it.A black door stood there, its number carved not painted, wet as if the wound wouldn’t close. In front, an offering plate of tilgul sweets—black, damp. From what? From breath.The door exhaled. The hair on my arms leaned toward it. Rule 7 thudded in my skull. I climbed until the real eighth floor pretended nothing had happened.Back in 13A, the diary had edged closer to the bed like a stray that knows kitchen timings. The pressed marigold bled darker, like a thumbprint.Blank pages weren’t blank anymore.DON’T FOLLOW THE RULES. THEY BELONG TO HIM. HE FEEDS ON HABITS. HE COUNTS IN FIFTY-TWOS. DON’T LET HIM COUNT YOU.The handwriting was adult, gouged deep enough to scar the paper’s back.The next page held a photocopy: Kutumbakam CHS AGM Minutes – 27/10/2017. The stamp was crooked, the paper smelled of kerosene.Agenda Item 3: Weekly Sankalp Pooja to continue for “kutumb cohesion.” Resolved: unanimous. Note: Water tank to be covered after incidents with stray animals. Note: Children’s laughter during power fluctuations to be ignored—“electrical discharge in conduits.”Signed: Secretary – Mrinal.Mrinal. The WhatsApp landlord.On the next page, in jagged ink: MRINAL IS NOT THE LANDLORD. THE LANDLORD IS WHAT LIVES WHERE MRINAL LIVES.Below, 36 names. Each marked JUMPED, BURNT, HUNG. Beneath: BRANCHES carved deep.Banyan roots. Family. Kutumbakam.At 1:53 p.m. my phone died.Rule 11: Do not let your phone die inside the flat. When it is dead, reflections get ideas.The black screen behaved like a second room.A second me blinked back—delayed, like a livestream lagging. I raised my right hand. He raised his left, then corrected himself. He looked past me.The bathroom towel slipped. The reflection of my bed had someone already in it. Breathing in a rhythm almost mine.I spoke. “Who are you?”The intercom rang. One bright beep. Then my own voice echoed back: Who are you? Tilted wrong, like a man practicing a new language.The bed breathed deeper, pleased we’d been introduced.I grabbed my backpack. Rule 9: if someone is already in your bed, leave immediately. Do not pack. Do not turn.I turned.The sheet showed the faint print of a striped tie across a chest. Blue bled through like gasoline sky.“Shaan?” I asked, because my stupidity has always looked like hope.The sheet smiled, crease stretching into a mouth too wide. I ran.The stairwell smelled of incense. Rule 13 belonged to 2:00 a.m., not 2:00 p.m., but time obeys the building.The khaki lift operator stood waiting. Eyes too wide. Counting under his breath: one… two… three…I climbed.Between 7 and 8, the black door whispered my name, sweet as tilgul. Behind it, voices braided—uncles, aunties, children giggling until it became choking. Kutumb, kutumb.Three knocks rattled my window upstairs. Rule 10 allows three. A fourth bent the curtain rod like a hand leaning to peer in.I kept climbing.The terrace door was unlocked.Rule 15: Never go to the terrace. The landlord lives there.The terrace stretched wider than the building. Hooks lined the parapet. From each hung sacks that twitched like they remembered being alive.A chauk was drawn in lampblack and turmeric: a banyan tree whose roots grew downward from branches. Thirty-six names on the roots, and a fresh red dab waiting for a thirty-seventh.Ajmera waited by the tank. Shirt neat, cuffs damp with something not water. Tan briefcase open, rows of black sesame laddoos pulsing faintly.“Welcome, Sameer,” he said with my voice. “Eat, beta. Speak sweetly. Belong.”The diary’s warning burned in me: DON’T FOLLOW THE RULES.I bit my tongue and spat blood into the chauk. The roots darkened like wet stone. The sacks shuddered once, then stilled.Ajmera’s face slid like a mask catching on teeth. Smooth marble eyes behind it looked… relieved.“Ah. A breaker,” he murmured. “We haven’t had one since Shaan tried to count backwards.”He touched the red dab on the tree. “We are thirty-six. We need fifty-two. Fifty-two voices. Fifty-two windows. You’ll help us count.”Below, the intercom rang through concrete. Beep. Beep. Children laughed in my corridor. Light flickered though every clock said 2:17 p.m.“It’s not midnight,” I said.“It is if we say.”Something knocked my window four times. Shaan’s figure stood in 13B, tie in hand, counting on his fingers. He lifted a fifth.“Don’t call him Shaan,” Mrinal’s voice said from the intercom inside my skull. “He’s ours. We don’t use small names. We use roles.”“What’s mine?”He smiled with my mouth. “Landlord.”I don’t remember reaching 13A. The door was open. The towel pushed under it like a tongue retreating. Two shapes breathed under the sheet.My dead phone lit anyway: WhatsApp—Mrinal. 1 new message.There were sixteen rules now.16. When you finally hear me knock, open. We are waiting.The bed smiled. The towel lifted. The kitchen whispered my name.The key I found inside the diary is slick with oil that isn’t oil. Teeth cut in wrong places, like it was made for a throat.Knocks now overlap—from the black door, from the intercom, from the mirror’s mouth.Three. Four. Five.The sixth is for me.I am going to open.Edit: If this posts, it means I got something through the keyhole that is not me. If I don’t reply, do not DM, do not visit. If your phone dies while reading this, put it face down and count backwards from fifty-two without using numbers that curve. Don’t ask why. It’s not a rule. It’s a wound.",

      "content_preview": "I was at work when I received a call from my son’s school. Worried that the little guy had thrown up again I quickly dismissed myself from a meeting with the other partners and stepped into the hall.“Hello? Is everything alright?” I asked.“Good afternoon Jack, this is Amanda calling. Is now a good time?”I frowned. Why was the principal reaching out? “Um, sure. I’m sorry but is everything okay with Flynn? Is he sick again?”There was a long pause before Amanda spoke. “I have some concerning…material…here that your son was working on during recess. We confiscated it because the other children were getting scared. Flynn was a bit upset about that and he isn’t calming down. I understand you’re at work but is it possible that you could come by?”I was already grabbing my keys and heading towards the elevator. “Of course but have you reached out to Rose? She’s closer by.”“We tried several times but she hasn’t picked up her phone.”I hissed through my teeth. I loved my wife but if there is any one thing that gets on my nerves about her it’s the fact she never picks up the phone. It’s like she has a special knack for never being by it, especially when there is an emergency.While I was speeding down the freeway Rose called. “Jack, please tell me you’re on the way to the school.”“I am. Want to tell me what you were up to in the garden this time?”“Look hun I already feel bad. I called the school as soon as I got back inside. I’m just turning the corner now.”I shook my head and let out a slow exhale. A healthy marriage really did come down to picking your battles wisely. “Sounds good Rosie. I’ll be there in ten.”I pulled into the school’s parking lot and power-walked over to the main entrance where two armed security guards chatted with one another. I ignored my buzzing phone and dabbed my brow with my favorite silk handkerchief.I greeted both men and handed over my ID. While I waited I checked my phone and saw several missed calls from my secretary in addition to one missed call from Bob, the managing partner.Oh well. Fuck Bob. My kid is more important.The security guard took his sweet time checking my ID. Normally I wouldn’t mind that. We paid good money to keep our son in a school that cared about the safety of its children. But I didn’t like the dark look one of the security guards shot me once I got my ID back.I flung open the door to the admin building and locked eyes with the secretary. She looked me up and down while her fingers danced across her keyboard. “Amanda is expecting you, she said go ahead and walk right in. I’ll let her know you’re on the way.”“Thank you,” I said.Unfortunately I knew how to get there by myself because like I alluded to earlier, my son has had a recent slew of health issues. The odd thing though is that these issues didn’t seem to have a physical cause, which led Rosie and I to suspecting some kind of psychological explanation. The school psychologist agreed with us and ever since we have all been trying to get Flynn to understand he can get our attention without forcing himself to vomit.It had been a while since he last threw up, which made me suspect at the moment these ‘drawings’ were his latest way of trying to get attention.Amanda looked up from her stack of papers and smiled when I stepped in. “Jack! Thank you for coming by,” she said. She reached out and took my hand in hers.I nodded and took a seat across from her. “I like the desk. You got an upgrade.” I rapped my knuckles against it. “Solid wood right there.”She chuckled and took off her glasses. Her honey brown eyes were soft, her voice soothing. “How are you?”I laughed and looked away. There was a cute picture of a kitten hanging onto a branch that caught my eye. “How do you think? This is what, the seventh time this month that he’s done this?” I massaged my temples. Reminded myself to breathe. “Then there’s work and…everything else.”Amanda tapped a manicured finger against her lips. “How are things with Rose?”“Good. We are in a very good place now.”“I’m glad to hear that Jack. Really.”“Alright well enough of this,” I said. “Where’s Rose and Flynn?”“They left a few minutes before you arrived. Flynn was getting a bit too…how do I put it…”“Speak plainly please. You know me Amanda, I don’t care for all that fake talk.”Amanda folded her arms and sighed. “He was getting…upset. He hit one of the nurses and nearly jumped across this table to get to his drawing. I’ve seen some pretty possessive children but I have never seen one get that upset over their art. How is he doing at home? Does he get protective over either one of you? Does he play well with any neighborhood kids or…?”I rolled my eyes. The fucking schools these days man, I’ll tell ya. The way the administrators talk reminds me of corporate speak. Just a bunch of phony bullshit masquerading as politeness.“Good Lord. Let me see it already. I want to know what everyone is getting so upset about. It better be the worst damn scene imaginable to justify…”Amanda slid the paper across the desk and looked away, but not before I caught her grimace.I grabbed the paper and flipped it over. I stared at it for some time and tried to make sense of what I was seeing. Then my hands started to shake. I wanted to ask so many different questions after realizing what my boy had drawn. Questions that every father is afraid to ask when something like this happens. But my throat was so dry that any words would have came out as choked grunts.“Take your time,” Amanda whispered.I finally found my voice and said, “I don’t…I don’t understand? Could he have seen something like this in a video game or show?”“Possibly. How well do you monitor his technology usage?”I placed the picture back on the table. Left it face down. I wanted it burned but I needed some questions answered first. “He doesn’t have internet access and the TV is limited to what, the animal channel and the history one? Forget what they are called.”She shrugged. “These days those channels have more than just animals or history. But either way, Cera is on vacation so she won’t be available to see Flynn anytime soon. In the meanwhile I suggest you look very closely at the media you allow him to consume.”“Tell me Amanda. What do you really think about this?”“I really don’t know Jack. The throwing up was bad enough. This makes things worse. I know you so I’m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, but to others it looks bad. You told me to give it to you straight so I will — it’s not normal for a young kid to draw something so…violent. And we can’t control the other kids from going home and telling their parents what they saw.”I didn’t like that. “What are you trying to say?”She got up from her chair and walked around the desk, taking a seat on the edge. The late afternoon sunlight made her hair match the color of her eyes. “I’m saying that if this continues we may have to expel Flynn.”I sprang up and got closer than I should have. But I was so pissed over everything that I lost myself. “Are you serious? After all the fucking money I have sunk into this school? We have donated double, no triple, of what anyone else has!” I grabbed her arm and stared deep into her eyes. “You’re not kicking him out of here even if he draws the damn Devil, got that?”Amanda didn’t move my hand away. I wasn’t grabbing her that hard either. Not any harder than I have before. I let go and sunk back into my chair. “I’m sorry…I shouldn’t have.”She came closer and before I knew it she was running her hands through my hair. The way she used to. “I wish…” she began.I took hold of her wrists and moved them away. “You’re lucky Rose didn’t see that.”Suddenly professional again, Amanda returned to her seat. She placed her glasses back on and shuffled through the documents on her desk before handing me one. “This is for you, it’s a record of today’s incident along with my approval to keep Flynn at home for the remainder of the week. Cera will be back by next Monday. Maybe she will be able to help or at least point us in a better direction.”I thanked her and started to leave. But then I stopped in the doorway. “Amanda I’m sorry.”“I knew what I was getting into, Jack.”No. No she didn’t.I stopped by the local pizzeria on the way back home. Nothing made Flynn happier than a couple slices (don’t forget the extra olives) and an old western flick.When I got home Flynn ran and tried to snatch the pizza box from my hands. He chased me through the house and into the kitchen where Rose was drinking what appeared to be her third glass of wine judging by the blush on her face.I greeted her with a kiss and one of those looks that said ‘we have a lot to talk about.’ Then I started grabbing plates while Flynn got us some sodas from the fridge.Flynn talked to us about some new dinosaur he was obsessed with. He showed us pictures on his iPad and enthusiastically explained how it defended itself with its thumbs. In between bites I marveled at the resilience within the mind of a child. How was it that they could change emotions so quickly? Or forget so soon?Was that a blessing or a curse?Whichever it was, I envied my son for that. These days, I felt a growing weight that seemed to carry me further and further into a dull apathy. I tried to stay in the present. I felt more alive there. But at night when everything got quiet, those inner voices got really fucking loud.I noticed my wife glaring at me over her wineglass. I smiled at her tiredly, ignoring those cries in the back of my mind. The ones that repeated again and again:SHE KNOWSLater that night, after we tucked Flynn into bed with his legion of protective stuffed animals and guardian war-tabby, we started to discuss the day.“I’m scared Jack.”“I know. So am I.”“I don’t want him in therapy,” she said softly. “Did I ever tell you about my grandma? How they put her in that one asylum because she kept having nightmares of a man watching her from the closet?”“They don’t do that anymore.”“But the other kids…if they find out they will rip him to shreds. I can’t take that…”“He’s a strong boy. He can get through anything.” I traced her shoulder in the way I knew she liked. “We’ll look back at all of this and laugh someday. Nothing bad lasts forever. We have both been through worse.”I heard her sob. Tears started to wet my shirt. “I just want him to be okay…”I held her while she cried. Then after she cried herself out and drifted off I laid there and stared up at the ceiling fan as it spun. I couldn’t fall asleep so I checked on Flynn, who was sleeping safe and sound, then went to sit down in the living room.I don’t know when I fell asleep.But I do know it was my son’s screams that caused me to scramble off the sofa and race down the hall.I pushed the door open. Flynn was on the bed, knees drawn up to his chest. He was crying and looking back and forth between me and the window.It was wide open.I leaned outside. We live on the outskirts of town, so there is a fairly wide range of view from the second floor of the house. There was no one on the lawn, nor were there any signs that someone climbed up or down the wall. I couldn’t see anything out by the trees either.“Daddy!” Flynn shouted. “It was in the closet! Not outside.”“What?” I said. That’s when I noticed the closet doors were wide open. Some of Flynn’s toys were scattered around. Plushies, for the most part. They were missing limbs, eyes, and heads.Rose ran into the room. “Jack? What the hell is going on?”“Mommy there was someone in the closet who said they wanted to take me into the woods,”  Flynn sobbed.The woods? The woods? I looked at Rose. “Stay with Flynn and call the police. I’m going to drive around. See if I find anyone.”“Are you stupid?” She shouted. “You’re not going anywhere if some freak is out there trying to snatch our kid! Stay right there. I will call the cops.”Rose left the room. I clung to Flynn until I was finally able to relax by reminding myself that he was here with me. Safe and sound. Not taken. “Flynn? Buddy?  Can you tell me what the person looked like?”Flynn trembled. “I…I couldn’t see them.”“What do you mean? I thought you said they were in your closet?”He hugged the only stuffed animal that hadn’t been ripped apart to his chest. “It was skinny and had long hair…”I paused, wondering if it would be too soon to ask him the question I was terrified to ask. But I knew I had to. “Did it hurt you?”Flynn shook his head. “No. But it told me that it doesn’t like you.” He started to cry and between deep breaths he said, “it said…it said…that it doesn’t like you or Amanda.”An eerie silence settled over the room. I leaned away from my son and took him by the shoulders. “Are you sure it said that name?”Flynn nodded.I felt rather than sensed Rose enter the room. I didn’t look back at her, I don’t think I could have even if I tried. “Are the police on their way?” I finally managed to ask.“No,” Rose said. “But I think I found out who the culprit is. Come see. Flynn, stay.”I hugged my son, and followed my wife out into the backyard. It was cold out. A low wind sent a haunting moan echoing into the night. We came to a stop before the garden shed. It was there that I realized the moans weren’t coming from the wind, but from inside the shed.“Rose, what’s going on?” I asked.She looked to the side. Her cheeks were stained red. “I caught the person who has been destroying our family.”I stayed planted. “Why didn’t you call the police?”Rose, my Rose, laughed into the night. “The police? How would they help with this?” Her voice rose in pitch. “Come see what I planted.”From inside that damn shed I heard another moan. I looked at my wife and then at the shed. In that moment, I made a choice. Not one that I am particularly proud of, and had I not been a father, I may have chosen differently.I shoved Rose with all my strength. She hit the shed with little resistance and collapsed into a sobbing wreck on the ground. I called the police and waited there, watching Rose wilt, until they arrived.She was taken into custody and I was questioned. I received little sympathy from the officers and later the detectives. I told the judge at Rose’s sentencing that I wished for some lenience and that Flynn would still need his mother once she was mentally well again.However, the nature of her crime against Amanda was so severe that she was made an example of.It was a little over a year later, while I was at work, that I received a call from my son’s school.They told me that he had started drawing again, and that I needed to see what he had drawn. I sighed. He had just started doing better.I was listening to the radio on my way to his school, and while I listened, I heard them start talking about an event that occurred last night.Apparently there had been a mass breakout from Levitt Asylum. The asylum where my wife was being treated.",

      "content_preview": "My phone sent an amber alert using my name. It kept updating from outside my door.At 2:17 a.m. my phone ripped the room open with that Amber Alert siren. The status bar said T-Mobile LTE — 2:17 AM and the banner read:EMERGENCY ALERT This is an amber alert order. Recipient: Danny Hide immediately. Do not answer the door. Threat level: EXTREME.I live in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, third-floor walk-up above the coin laundromat with the busted neon “DRY R” sign. Six units. Old red brick. I killed the lamp and slid to the floor beside my bed, feeling ridiculous and also like my heart was going to climb out through my teeth.I checked Twitter, local news, weather—nothing. No one else had an alert. When I cleared the banner, it reappeared with the same timestamp.2:21 a.m., another update:EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED They are inside your building. Do not leave your unit. Maintain silence. Avoid windows.Two seconds later, the hallway stair door at the far end clanged open. Not the soft, guilty step of a neighbor coming home late—heavy, measured footfalls. They stopped outside my door. I eased the deadbolt, slow as a prayer.The phone buzzed again.EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED They are at your door. Do not approach the peephole. Do not speak.Our elevator belts squeal when someone rides at night; the sound hung in the walls like a toothache. Under the door I watched a shadow stop. The building vent rattled, the way it does when somebody presses a hand over the grille.A different tone—text from Maya.Maya (2:23 a.m.): you up? my phone did the alert noise but there’s nothing on it. was that you?Me: i got one with my name. shelter in place. someone’s outside my door.Maya: i’m calling 911. stay put.She called; I let it ring out. Seconds later:Maya (2:25 a.m.): 911 says no active incidents. prob spoofing? want me to come over?New banner, right over her text:EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED Do not allow Maya Rangel access. Compromise risk: HIGH. Remain silent.Seeing her full name in the alert made my scalp crawl. I screenshotted; the screen flash made the shadow outside shift its weight.I called 911 myself. “What’s your emergency?” the dispatcher asked.I gave my address and name. “I’m receiving individualized emergency alerts. They keep updating. They say someone is at my door.”“We do not issue targeted alerts,” she said, typing. “If someone is attempting entry, we can dispatch a unit. Do not open your—”The siren tone bled into the call, faint and wrong, like it was playing under her voice. The line hissed and dropped.2:31 a.m.Maya: leaving now. 10 min. i’ll honk. won’t come up unless you text me.EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED Do not open for uniformed personnel. Impersonation observed in sector.Three soft knocks at my door. Not urgent. Patient. A pause; then three more. The elevator belts squealed again, even though it hadn’t moved.Another alert, faster:EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED Window extraction in 3 minutes. Do not resist.“Extraction” made every part of me retract. My bedroom window faces the alley and a rusted fire escape. I shoved a towel against the door gap and taped a receipt over the peephole with shaky hands.The voice that came from the hallway was so calmly familiar that I almost answered without thinking. “Hey, man. You up?” It sounded exactly like Drew from upstairs. Drew moved out in June.My phone camera opened on its own, flipped to selfie, then blacked out as if something passed in front of the lens from the outside. When the image came back, for one frame the bedroom door behind me was open a few inches with something tall in the gap; then it was just my face again, pale and shaking.2:38 a.m. The belts squealed a third time and the AC kicked on hard enough to rattle the vents.EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED Dispatch authentication failed. Maintain darkness. If approached: do not speak your name.No Caller ID flashed. I didn’t touch it. On the third ring, the phone snapped to speaker by itself. The siren tone coughed and a calm voice said, “We regret the inconvenience. Please remain still.” I slapped the phone silent. Outside the door, the same voice as before repeated—identical cadence, like somebody pressing play twice on the same clip: “Hey, man. You up?”2:56 a.m. A double honk floated up from the street, distant through the window glass.From directly outside my door, rushed and breathless: “It’s me. Open up.”Maya (2:56 a.m.): parking now almost there“It’s me. Open up.” Maya (2:56 a.m.): parking now almost thereThe phrasing and pause were exactly the same. The towel at the threshold lifted a millimeter, like breath found a seam.2:59 a.m.EMERGENCY ALERT — FINAL Time expired. We’re sorry.Everything went quiet. The AC stopped mid-cycle. Pressure shifted in the building; I felt it inside my ears. Somewhere above, a faucet screamed and then died.I must have slept. When light edged the blinds it was 6:41 a.m. My phone sat at 3% even though I’d plugged it in. The alert history was empty.I nudged the towel away with my foot. Dust filmed the strip of wood outside. In it, one footprint—bare, adult-sized. Every toe defined. The big toe was flattened, the nail thick and yellow like it had been crushed too many times.No courtesy card from LAPD. No tape on the peephole. The receipt I stuck there was gone.Maya (7:03 a.m.): did you sleep?? i ended up not coming. got freaked out on the 5 and turned around. felt sick. my bad.She swore she never left her place. She sent a timestamped pic of her kitchen clock at 3:00 a.m. with her cat on the counter like proof of life. The dashboard photo she’d texted earlier wasn’t in our thread anymore. My screenshots were gone too. The chat jumped from 2:23 to 7:03 like the phone tunneled through the night.I called the non-emergency number. “Wireless Emergency Alerts don’t target individuals,” the operator said. “Contact your carrier.” I asked if any units came to my address between 2 and 3 a.m. “No record,” she said, bored.I cracked the door. The hall smelled like antiseptic and warm plastic. The elevator sat open on my floor as if it had been called and no one got on. The stair door was propped with a package I didn’t recognize.I tried to wipe the footprint with a damp paper towel. The toes smeared. The heel wouldn’t lift. The wetter the wood got, the darker the print bloomed, as if the boards were drinking it.It’s 11:12 a.m. now. The phone keeps giving me little phantom buzzes with nothing on the screen. I can hear the elevator belts squeal even when the elevator isn’t moving, like the sound got left behind.As I typed this last part, the siren coughed once—just a second—and a banner flashed and vanished so fast I only caught the first line:EMERGENCY ALERT — RESUMED Recipient: Danny Do not answer the verification call.One single knock followed. Not friendly. A clean, wooden gavel right at the center of the door.The phone is ringing again—No Caller ID—and the screen keeps dimming like something is passing in front of the camera.I’m setting the phone face-down now. If it rings, it isn’t me.",

      "content_preview": "I need your help. I don’t normally post online about my real life. How much help can the internet be? It’s just people screaming their opinions at each other. But I genuinely have no idea what to do in this situation.I’m a professional housesitter. Never used to know that was a thing, but friends I petsit for recommended me to wealthy acquaintances, and a few testimonials later, I’m housesitting these big McMansions. I usually show up the first day in a beige jacket over a black tee—casual but classy. But once the owners are gone and I’m in charge, I switch into my laziest jeans or PJs, make myself an espresso with their fancy machine (they always have one), and wander barefoot out to the deck overlooking the lake. And I open my arms wide and say something cheesy like, “Jeeves, fetch me the morning paper.” Then I open my phone and play Wordle and fantasize that I actually live there and think about how next summer I’m going to refinish the deck—basically LARPing life as the 1%.But I always leave the place looking better than I found it, usually with a note about how I changed the flickering bulb or the CO2 detector battery or fixed the squeaky door. So I get pretty good reviews.Never any problems.Until now.So, latest gig. Rich old white guy, keeps referring to me as “Gen Z” (Bro, I’m a millennial). Prattles about investments and the market and asks about my golf game (I do not have a golf game. Like all poors, I play whatever is free at the park). Halfway through introductions, he remembers he hasn’t told me his name yet and says, “I’m Gerald. My pronouns are she-her. Hah! Just kidding.” Claps me on the back.Haha. You’re so funny, Gerald.He gives me a tour of the house—huge windows and hardwood floors and sliding doors leading out to the patio overlooking the shimmering lake. He even has an indoor swimming pool, I guess for when the lake freezes over. The guest room where I’ll be staying is the only bedroom on the main floor. I ask him why he needs a sitter since he’s got no pets and is only gone for three days. He tells me it’s for peace of mind. He’s had break-ins recently. Speaking of which—he explains the fob system.“For security, the doors autolock. So if you remove your fob and later go out to the patio, or leave and come back, you’ll be locked out. Always wear your fob. I’m giving you my spare—nifty, huh?” He grins as he pulls on a gold chain around his neck to show me what looks like a turquoise amulet. The amulet is a stunning bit of jewelry that looks like he plucked it straight from King Tutankhamen’s tomb. It’s probably priceless and belongs in a museum. But when I ask if I can see it he draws it back and tucks it under his shirt. “Ope! Sorry Zoomer. This thing is worth more than your life, haha. Yours is the discount version.” He hands me a small silver chain with a fob set in the back of a similar amulet, but mine is just colored glass and cheesy plastic. “Leave it in the crystal bowl near the entrance when you leave the last day. The doors will lock behind you.”Discount version?Specially made for poors! “Sure,” I say.Upstairs are bedrooms themed in different colors, a trophy room, and a library. It’s not exactly off-limits, but he tells me I shouldn’t have much reason to go up there. Then he says hedoeswant to show me one thing. We troop up the ornate staircase with the carved banister and he points to a door at the end of a long hallway. Like everything in the house, it is ornate, but rather than the modern style of the rest of the house, this door has a carved gold handle and plaques with relief sculpture around the frame as if from an ancient tomb. Hell, that’s probably exactly what it is, and it probably opens to his own personal museum of plundered artifacts. Gerald, unsurprisingly, tells me under no circumstances may I enter. I tell him he should just put a velvet rope up in front of it.After laughing way too loud at my joke, he says, “You might hear thumping—we have squirrels. I’ll take care of them once I get back. Just don’t worry about the noises.”“Gotcha.”“Pretty cushy job, right?” He smiles as we return to the main floor. “The hard part, for me, is finding someone trustworthy. Privacy is my main concern.”“Yep, understood. I won’t go upstairs.”“You’re probably tempted now that I’ve told you not to.”“Nope.”“Probably think, ‘Oh, he must have a dead body in there!’ or something, hah!”What I actually think is,Wow, you are really making this weird, my dude. In the same way it might be weird if I ordered a meat pie and was told, “Here you go, delicious pie! 100 percent beef, absolutely no fingers inside.”Perhaps realizing his remarks sound sus (as this “Zoomer” would say), Gerald adds, “Just kidding.”Haha.Anyway—the first day, I arrive wearing my discount jewelry and do my usual checks, but it’s all immaculate, nothing that needs fixing or cleaning, so I head out to the deck with a beer. “Zoomer, open this bottle,” I say, role-playing Gerald. “My pronouns are fuck me,” I add as I crack it open and take a swig. Lol. I down a couple bottles while watching the stars twinkle over the lake. As the sun fades and a chill sets in, I retreat indoors—THUMP THUMP THUMPThe knocking is so loud I drop my beer. Swearing, I clean up the sticky mess, my pulse hammering with eachTHUMP.Those are some big fucking squirrels,I think.I stand underneath the ceiling below what I assume is the locked room and a squirrel hurling bowling balls. With a final, ominousTHUMP, the noises cease. After a few tense minutes, I make a circuit of the house, just re-checking the security of everything for peace of mind. Aside from the occasional thumps upstairs, everything seems normal. I find a plush robe of Gerald’s in the walk-in closet that is bigger than my entire apartment. I prance around in it for awhile, lip-syncing to music booming through the house, eventually luxuriating in a bubble bath with some fancy chocolates he won’t miss. The tub is the ostentatious centerpiece of the master bathroom, set on a raised platform in the middle of the room with gold-gilded mirrors along the walls, which I can only imagine Gerald looks into while airing out his wrinkly junk out and saying things like, “My Gerald, what a snack you are!” I’m still lounging in the tub when noise starts up from that door at the end of the hall. And even though it’s a little ways down, I have pretty sensitive hearing, and I notice…Thud thud thudThe noise this time is less like pounding or thumping and more like…Footsteps?“Fuck, no,” I whisper.Like someone walking around in that room just beyond the door. I lean out and call, “HELLO?”The footsteps cease.Every hair on my neck stands on end. For a few minutes, I stay in the tub. But when the steps start up again—thud thud thud—I haul myself out of the warm water and wrap myself in Gerald’s fleecy robe and pad down the hall with my wet feet. Raise my knuckles to rap on the door when I stop, my eyes fixed just above the ornate gold handle. It takes my buzzed brain a few seconds to parse what I am looking at, to catch up to the chill that’s already freezing the blood in my veins and sending every hair standing on end.I stare. And keep staring. Trying to make sense of it.The locked room. The bolt is on the outside. Onmyside of the door.This room isn’t locked from inside to protect Gerald’s privacy and keep me out. It’s locked to keep something or someonein.Oh fuck me. Is my role actually not housesitter, but jailer?***THUMP THUMP THUMP2am. I haven’t opened the door. I called police, but for some reason I get no reception inside the house, so I had to speak with them while standing out on the deck. They seemed to think I was prank calling after I told them I was housesitting and scared by knocking and when they asked me to go back inside the house and open the door I said, “But there’s no reception so you won’t hear if something happens… What if it’s a monster that eats me before you get here?” I might have been slurring a little, too. Something to do with all those beers I had. Or that fancy liquor in the cabinet that probably cost 2k a swallow. I only had one swallow. Anyway when the dispatcher asked if I’d been drinking I hung up.I decided to leave the mystery for morning. But every time the noise quiets enough that I might sleep, a sudden furious pounding wakes me again. Pretty sure what he’s actually got in there is a velociraptor, with its mouth tied shut so it can’t shriek, only bang its claws and tail against things. And open doors. Of course. Hence the lock.THUD THUD. Christ I’m losing it.THUMP!Fuck it. I make my way upstairs in the dead of night to the door, flicking on my phone’s flashlight and considering the bolt. I rap my knuckles on the wood—knock knock. Is anyone th—KNOCK KNOCKThe resulting knock sends my heart into spasms. For a second I almost pass out standing up. Swallow hard.Ok. I square my shoulders, call out in my most assertive voice: “H-hello?”Silence.“Hey. Is someone in there? Who just knocked?”Silence.“I’m not going to let you out unless you say something.”Silence. Fine. I can play hardball with whoever orwhateveris inside. I’ve taken all of four steps when suddenly, a loud:KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKThen the door begins rattling. Rattling loudly. Like someone’s grabbed the knob and is shaking with all their might. Rattle rattle rattle rattle—I do the only sensible thing, at this point.I leave the house.***I come back in the morning and the room upstairs is quiet. I have a pleasant day scrolling on my phone and swimming laps in the indoor pool. But every so often, there are those footsteps shuffling around above. I put a pizza in the oven for lunch and stand in the main room looking at the ceiling, and that’s when Gerald reaches out. When I answer the phone, he thanks me for taking care of everything and asks if the “squirrels” kept me up. I put on a fake smile and tell him no, and I ask him how his vacation is going. Pretend like all is normal. Like he’s not hiding some crazy secret in there. He has that same shit-eating smile himself, like he’s hiding a crazy secret in there. Things are great, he says, he’s having a wonderful vacation, the ladies there all love him ‘cause he’s got therizz.God I hate this man. Then he sobers up and says, “Just remember, Zoomer, the one rule you have to follow. I’ll be back in two days. Ignore those squirrels. Keep up the good work and you and I will be skibidi, you get me?”“I get you,” I say. As soon as I’m off the phone with him, I’m back upstairs outside the door, contemplating it.OK Zoomer, I think.Let’s do this.And I unlock the door and open it.***The room inside is just a collection of boxes and storage. I don’t see anyone at all. No velociraptors. No squirrels with bowling balls. No prisoner bound and gagged and thumping around. Not even a person who just for some reason can’t talk and walks around with footsteps thudding.The room is empty.I’m about to step inside and search when the oven timer goes off for the pizza, so I shut the door and turn away, heading back down the hall—I’ll go through those boxes right after lunch. I’ve almost reached the staircase when I hear it. The shriek of hinges…CreeeeeaaakThe door behind me is open.Time feels suspended as I stare at that opening door. A door that I definitely closed. And I wonder if the wind did it even as I know there are no windows open and no drafts. And then I hear it, even though I’m not moving. I’m standing still there in that hallway, but I hear it, loud and clear.Thud… thud…The floorboards. Like someone is stepping along them. Heavy steps. Shuffling toward me—And that’s all the warning I need before I’m ducking into the master bedroom, slamming the door shut, and realizingit has no lock.Fuck!I dash into the bathroom—whichdoeshave a lock—slam the door, lock it, and back away, my mouth motoring a series ofshitsandfucksas the door rattles. Something just beyond shakes the knob. Rattle rattle rattle and I fumble for my phone, only to remember belatedly that it has no reception inside these walls. I have to use the wifi. But the wifi isn’t working—why isn’t the wifi fucking working? What happened? I need to get outside!I dash to the bathroom window, and that’s when I realize the windows are sealed closed and made of some kind of reinforced glass. I grab the porcelain lid from the back of the toilet and slam it into the glass, and the lid cracks. The glass isn’t dented. But what kind of psycho has windows in their bathroom that can’t open and—There’s a crackling sound, and then the same speakers that I previously used to blast music throughout the mansion now pipe a voice down at me like the voice of God. But it’s the voice of Gerald:“You can’t escape my pet, Zoomer. Sorry to do this to you. But that curse has to feed on somebody. And better you than me.”“Curse?” I shout. I’m searching the bathroom for a weapon. Something else to use on the glass. I find baby powder under the sink and scatter it all over the floor.“You’ve seen my collection.” Gerald loves to hear himself talk. I imagine him pontificating in front of a whole crowd of old white dudes. Tossing back expensive bourbon. Drinking in their attention. Holding court. I imagine him sweeping his arms out, wherever he is, bragging to me from across the world. “You won’t find anything like it anywhere in the world. But some of these items, they come from tombs. All those old stories about tombs and curses? They’re not all fiction.”“And lemme guess your amulet is part of it?” That shiny fucking thing. And I got the glass version. I should’ve known it meant something. It didn’t look natural.“Amulet of immortality,” he gloats. “Or at least agelessness. A shame I found it when I was already in my sixties. But that was nearly seventy years ago now. I’m well over a century, Zoomer.”“Really? Well how about you let someone else be its meal? I thought you and me were, you know, skibidi?”“You think I haven’t seen you prancing your bare ass around my place?” Oh. I didn’t see any cameras. But I should probably have assumed. He chuckles. “You’re practically in the cradle. Don’t feel bad. Scrabbling for crumbs, housesitting? You wouldn’t have made much difference in the world. Me—every day I’m alive I pour thousands into research, into charity, into making something of my life. More than you’d ever amount to even if you did live to old age.”“But why do you even need me?”“Well, I’m its mark. I opened its tomb. Took the amulet. But like anything, its energy is finite. Especially this far from the tomb. I figured out when it gobbled my buddy first, who broke in and took the amulet with me. It took awhile to come after me again. Next time it did, it got one of the guides who was with us. One touch, drained the life out of him. That time it took even longer for it to come back again. And I realized… draining the life essence out of someone, putting it in this amulet takes a process. It always goes dormant for awhile after. But once it wakes up again, once I start hearing footsteps, well… it needs to be fed. Distracted.”“Or maybe you could give back the fucking amulet!”“Already told you Zoomer, this is my eternal life we’re talking about. And yours isn’t worth shit.”“But I didn’t open the tomb! Why would it come after me??”A long chuckle. And then he says, “No, but youdidopen the door.”The door. The fucking door. With its ornate carvings and all those weird symbols and—shit, it must’ve been taken right off the tomb. He’s made me into a tomb raider and now I’m the nearest one to violate the sanctity of its space, while Gerald is off across the globe. My phone is a brick and I can’t get out through the glass. This thing is going to kill me if I don’t think fast.“Sorry Zoomer. Bye bye now.”And then I hear a click, and realize how fucked I am because even remotely, Gerald has control over the house. The bathroom door unlocks.I am definitely fucking dead.***I have about five seconds to figure out a plan before that thing sucks the life out of me. All I know is that I can’t let it touch me. I back away from the opening door as footprints appear in the baby powder I’ve spilled on the floor.Thud… thud. I snatch towels from around the tub and fling them, and the invisiblesomethingdoes not slow as it shrugs the towels off, but for a few seconds I can clearly see a sort of towel-mummy, and we play ring-around-the-rosie around the bathtub. It slouches after me, footsteps appearing in the baby powder while Gerald’s voice booms:“One touch, Zoomer! Hahahaha! One touch!”Before the bathroom door can swing closed, I dash out, the footstepsthud thuddingafter me, gaining speed. I bolt downstairs but the front door of the house is sealed. The glass doors leading out to the patio are locked and also strongly reinforced. Gerald’s voice taunts me, his eyes following me through the cameras—“keep zooming, Zoomer!” Like this is all just a sick sport, and I’ll be damned if I let him spectate my end. So I scramble to the door to the one part of the house I haven’t really ventured—the basement.“Ohohoho! Now you’re really trapped!”Ignoring him, I scurry past wine racks and shelving and aha, there it is! The panel for the breakers. Shutting the power down won’t unlock the doors, but I’m hoping to at least get this dickweed’s eyes off me as I rapidly flip all the switches—Gerald snarls, “You’ll still be locked in, you little sh—”All the lights go off, and I am trapped in total darkness.***Fumbling for my phone’s flashlight, I tap on the dim luminescence. Listening. Panting in the pitch black. If it’s already down here with me I’m fucked. There’s no place to hide. And only one door, one staircase back out. I stand, panting, terrified…thud… thud…My heart almost gives out in relief. The footsteps are above me. Circling around overhead. The curse hasn’t followed me down… perhaps because it doesn’t realize where the stairs are. It just keeps shuffling around overhead, and sometimes moves a little ways off but always circles back, homing in on me, pounding at the floor. Like an invisible zombie.Of course, as soon as Gerald gets back, I’m fucked. I think about the mansion’s layout. And finally, I formulate a plan.***I’m in Gerald’s fanciest bathrobe when he finally arrives back at the mansion, and I haul myself up from the lounger where I’ve been tanning by a window beside the indoor pool. The atmosphere is silent—no thudding, thumping, or pounding—and I’ve spent most of the past few hours typing up this post while sipping one of his probably-priceless brandys. Which brings me to the point I need some advice on—what to do about the amulet? With the tomb raided and most of the relics in museums and the door here on the mansion’s upper floor, there’s no real way to put the genie back in the bottle, so to speak. I’m open to suggestions about the amulet’s fate.Anyway, I called late last night and lied to Gerald that I found a way to break the curse. This morning I restored power so he could watch me on the camera and see for himself how quiet the whole place is.“Well I’ll be damned.” Gerald looks genuinely impressed when he steps in through the front door, and a little annoyed. He glares at me as I come out to greet him. “How the hell are you still alive?”“It’s a secret. One I’d be happy to let you in on…” I examine my nails. “… for 100k.”His eyes bulge. “You gotta be shitting me, Zoomer. Listen, you drank about ten thousand dollars worth of alcohol and left my bathroom a fuckin’ mess. You’re lucky I don’t sue you for damages!”“’Lucky?’ You tried to kill me! I could report you to the authorities. That money is peanuts to you anyway. Plus, if you don’t pay me, you’ll regret it. I didn’t actually break the curse. It’ll get you if I don’t tell you the secret.”He laughs. “Oh, Zoomer. Never play poker. You wouldn’t be standing here safely if there were any danger! You’re just lying to try to scare me into opening my wallet. You think I don’t recognize a hustle? Listen, you wanna play legal games with me, I’ll crush you like the bug you are—\"But I’m not listening to him anymore. Instead, I’m looking past him, to where the pool room doors are open, and I can see the stretch of blue water and my lounger at the far back, near the deep end. Wet marks have appeared on the wood floor coming out from the pool room doors. The plush oriental rug Gerald and I are standing on gets a few dark marks on it. Gerald is too busy snarling at me to hear the firstthud…. thud, but then his face whitens, and he whirls around and exclaims, “No—NO—NO!!! Stay awa—” He stumbles backwards, but it’s too late. His skin withers, shriveling like a time-elapsed grape drying into a raisin, his hair whitening and his skin shrinking onto bone until he resembles a crusty mummy, like all the years of his immortal life have been sucked away… and then he drops dead to the floor, the amulet glittering on his neck.Was gonna warn him but, you know… I checked my ratings this morning.He gave me a one starreview.",

      "content_preview": "It’s hard to know where to begin with something like this. “Start at the beginning”, well yeah, no shit, that’s obvious.But how do you know where the beginning is? Life isn’t neat; it isn’t broken down into little plots with defined starts and ends. It’s one big mess of choices and coincidences that merge and weave together to make what is normally a very boring story.So I’ll preface this by giving you what you need to know about me.I’m not smart. Ask anyone who knows me. These days, they’ll say I’m reliable, responsible, personable, and lots of other –ibles and –ables that mean nothing. But I’ve been very stupid at times, made some very dumb mistakes and choices that I still pay for. But I’d say nearly everyone has at some point.So, second, I want you to know I’m not a bad guy. To say I’m a good man would be a stretch, I’ll agree, but I’m not cruel, or unkind, or even particularly hateful. I don’t even hate my mother, however much she might deserve it.Anyways, here goes:My roommate is normal.That might not sound bad, almost sounds like a compliment, even.But it’s terrifying.He’s just left, gone to do… something. I really couldn’t say. But it feels like when you’re in the deep end of the pool and come up for air, or when you’ve been lost in the woods for hours and just found a trail you recognize. It’s that kind of relief, and all because this guy is seriously screwing with me.Somehow, no one even notices him; he just blends in. And yet, he’s ruining my life.Let me rewind to this particular story’s beginning, as all stories probably should, except the super weird or time-travel related.It was summer, a month-or-so ago. I had just been promoted to a full-time job (Assistant Manager of a Whataburger). I was hoping to finally follow in my big sister’s tiny shoes and find a place of my own, moving out of her spare room. I live in a pretty big city. Not Austin or Dallas or anything, but big enough rent is pretty crazy if you want your own pad that isn’t in a ghetto or between two crack dens.I found the perfect place, about a 20-minute drive from my Whataburger, not too central but central enough. 770 bucks a month, two bedrooms. I could survive, just. But in the long-term I’d need a roommate. Going halves on that and I’d be able to save, invest, that sort of shit. So I hit up social media, tried to find someone to fill my gap.Didn’t take all that long, maybe a week or two screening out the weirdos. My sis helped me vet the guy. His name was Mike, 26, same as me. Worked an entry-level white-collar type office job somewhere in the city. Typical hobbies, didn’t smoke, drink, or do drugs, which was good for me. We decided to meet him.My sis, Jen, came towards the end of my shift. It was nearly 3 in the afternoon, so plenty quiet, and we mostly just shot the shit while I wiped a few tables and looked busy, not that the main manager was in.Then he came.I’d said, “I finish at 3, so maybe come round then?”And I could swear, the moment that the clock struck 3, he came through the doors. We recognized him from the app we’d found him on. I can’t remember what exactly it was now.Either way, neither of us found anything odd then, when we first met Mike. He was civil, good posture, fairly well-spoken, with a normal smile set in a normal face.“What did you think?” I asked Jen.She’d shrugged, “Better than a crackhead. Dude seems normal. What did he say he does for fun again?”I couldn’t remember then, and I sure as hell have no idea now.He only walked out maybe 10 minutes ago, but if you ask me for the specifics I think I’d struggle. He had one of those faces. Like an extra from an old TV show, the kind of guy who’s there somewhere in every episode, but you never even notice until someone points them out.He just blends in. He isn’t ugly, and he isn’t handsome. He has no notable scars or marks, and if you put a gun to my head, and really forced me, I’d guess his hair and eyes were brownish. But I wouldn’t want to be in a position where I’d stake my life on it.For the first week or so he was great. Well, average. He normally cleaned up after himself okay, and wasn’t too loud. We didn’t really talk, didn’t hang out at all. He just didn’t seem the type.He had his life, and I had mine. Or so I thought.My job involves some pretty long hours. The head manager of my restaurant is also the franchisee, Mr Dixon, or Dick, as we all call him. He takes what he calls a “Hands-off approach”. That means he’s basically never in, and I’m stuck doing almost everything. Some days I work as long as 12 hours. I don’t mind though, keeps my mind off things, and the overtime pay is pretty sweet.Most mornings Dick’ll stick his head, and its many chins, in the door, and say “Something’s come up, I gotta go downtown. You got this, champ?”“Sure.” I’ll say.“Good man, good man, keep this up and you’ll go far.”And that’ll be the last I see of him. Sometimes he might turn up at close, grab a diet Dr Pepper, and sit there sucking at it while we shoot the shit and I sort the kitchen. On a Saturday night, he might occasionally take me to some bar, catch a game or something. He always pays too.I don’t mind, I kinda like the responsibility. If you’ve never worked in fast-food, it’s pretty tiring physically. You’re on your feet all day, keeping track of a hundred things at once. As a manager I should probably be doing more, well, managing, but invariably at least 1 or 2 of the high school stoners we employ won’t show, so I have to jump on the grill.It’s fine, makes me tired enough I can just go home and collapse at the end of the day, and don’t have to think about anything too hard.If I’m not working on Sunday, I might get out my battered old Honda Civic and visit my sister. She’s got a good job, receptionist at a fancy golf club about an hour south of town. We don’t talk to our parents much, not anymore. It’s always been us against the world.When I was younger, a lot of my friends never really understood how I could be so close to Jen. I heard all sorts of horror stories about siblings fighting constantly, stealing pocket money from each other, spreading each other’s secrets all over school, that sort of thing. I never got it. My big sis was always the only person I could rely on.I wish she was here now.Everything changed a couple of days ago.It was a pretty normal Saturday. I left around 7am, and Mike was already up, sat in the living room, eyes fixed on the TV, facing away from me.“I’m heading out.” I said as I passed through.“I’ll be here.” He replied, as always.It was after the lunch rush had been and gone, and I was sitting pretty behind the counter, talking with one of our new hires. The moment the clock struck 3, there Mike was. I don’t think I even heard the door open.It was a weird feeling, one moment I’m talking with this kid, he’s telling me he’s saving for a car, and everything feels     normal. Then, there was this pressure, this feeling, like the entire world is watching me. I cut myself off. Felt my hairs on my arms rise, and there was this… embarrassment. A gut-wrenching sensation, like when your parents have found your weed stash and you know you’re about to have all your secrets laid bare.I turned, and there he was. Cargo shorts, white T-shirt, looking for all the world like the most average customer you could have, and he was staring at me hard. So I pushed down that feeling, greeted him as warmly as I could muster, being that he is my roommate, and took his order.He did nothing, and it was the most intense moment of my life. He ordered normally, a double meat meal. The kitchen beeped, and employees moved around me. And I was stuck, trapped like a deer in the headlights as my roommate continued to stare at me. A cold sweat ran down my face and arms, and I blurted out the rest of my lines, telling him to wait by the side, but I’m pretty sure I jumbled it all up. The beeps from the kitchen drowned out everything but the blood rushing in my head.He moved over, though, never taking his eyes off me. I was shaking as I packed up his box, keeping my head down, looking only into the sauce trays under the counter. I couldn’t bring myself to ask which he wanted, so I just threw a few of each in. Dick would kill me if he was there.I was feeling dizzy, lightheaded, borderline nauseous as I handed over the box. I didn’t want to look, really didn’t, but I couldn’t stop myself, and I took a quick glance into his normal face.His eyes burned, and scalded my soul. That embarrassment returned 100 times stronger, and those night terrors you have about being naked at school felt like nothing in comparison. It was as if he could see every secret, every part of my being, laid out like a dissected animal.My heart beat so loudly in my ears even the kitchen beeps fell away, and for a second I felt like I was gonna throw up or pass out or something. I’d never felt anything like it, never felt so known, so judged.Just as I could take no more, he thanked me for his meal, and he left.My shirt was stuck to me, even with the AC on full blast. I had to run to the bathroom, and I probably sat there for 10 minutes once I was done, just waiting for the shaking to subside.When I came out, I went over to the kid who’d been at the counter with me.“Uh, hey.”“You good, man?” He said, giving me an odd look.“Uh, sure, why?”He shrugged and made a face. “You look kinda rough dude. You sick?”I shook my head, trying to place a reassuring smile on my face that probably came out as a grimace. “All good, just a little hot in here, don’t you think?”The employee made a noise that could have meant anything.“Anyways,” I started, “that guy who came in just now. He seem kinda… off to you?”“Huh?” He looked perplexed. “Which guy?”I tried to recall anything visually that stuck out about him, but it was like trying to find words to describe the taste of water.“That guy just now, cargo shorts, white tee? You were right here with me, man.” I said, trying to keep the edge desperation out of my voice.The employee’s eyes flicked with recognition. “Oh, that guy? Nah man, he seemed normal. I barely even noticed him. Why?”I struggled to find anything to reply with. “Dunno. He was almost, like, too normal, y’know?”The new hired just looked puzzled. “Uh, sure, I guess.”I dropped it real quick. It’s like I say. My roommate is just normal. It’s a weird paradox, he’s so normal no one even seems to notice him, but like, that just makes him too normal.It was that effect he had on me. I’d never seen it before. At home, all he really did when he wasn’t in his room was maybe watch TV or eat something. Before now, I don’t think he ever really looked my way at all.In fact, now that I think about it, he almost blended in with the beige wallpaper and the gray couch. I couldn’t say I’d ever even taken notice before. He was like a lamp or an unused chair that happened to pay half the rent.By the end of my shift, around 10 that night, I was still feeling pretty shaken. In fact, I wasn’t feeling like going home. He was always in bed around midnight, so when Dick turned up and hit me with that “Coming to the bar, sport?” I said sure.I’m sure you know the kind of bar it was. Faux wood paneling on the walls, tacky neon signs, pool tables with ripped up felt, floor always slightly sticky, and Creed blaring on the jukebox. A real dive. The sort of place Dick seemed to like for some reason. Couldn’t ever figure out why, he had money, lots of it, but he seemed to like the dreary miasma of run-down bars.Dick was spilling over his stool, gulping at his Bud, and I was nursing mine over the bar.“So anyways,” he goes on, “I always wonder how you manage to stay thin. I mean shit, you built like a crackhead.”That elicited an ironic smile from me. “Just genes I guess, man.”That got a chuckle out the big man. “Well shit, I don’t remember the last time I fit in a pair of jeans.”I laughed along with him. But today’s encounter was eating at me, and a few beers had done a lot to loosen me up.“Hey, look Dick.” I began, struggling to find what to say. “I had a real weird customer today. Kinda freaked me out.”Dick’s glazed expression snapped serious. “Was it that damned tweaker who’s always on 16th and Dallas? I told that fuck he weren’t welcome since his last OD in the shitter.”“No, no. It wasn’t a tweaker. It was this guy. He was, like, normal. Too normal, you know?”“Uh, no. Can’t say I do.”I kept pressing, though what answer I wanted I didn’t know. “He looked normal as hell. But he stared at me. It was super intense, like he could see into my fucking soul.”But Dick’s eyes were glazing over as he sank what was left of his beer. “Heh, I remember when the ladies gave me that kinda look. Maybe he had a little crush on you?” And he started giggling.……I came back to my senses a few hours later, maybe 2am. I was staggering back towards the apartment. I say that, I was still drunk, just this part I can remember. I assume I’d shared Dick’s Uber, and was only about a block away from the apartment. The world was spinning, and I was trying to keep upright whilst shuffling in vaguely the right direction.I don’t drink much anymore, not more than 2 beers usually. But today had shaken me, and I’d pounced on that warm feeling that booze gives you, like everything’s gonna be fine and damn whatever comes tomorrow.Tomorrow hit me hard as I rounded the corner.One minute I was in the reassuring embrace of a drunken stupor, then, I was standing stone-cold sober looking at the unsuspecting 2-storey building that was my home. It was cold, I realized, despite my jacket. Yet the sweat came anyway. There was some sense, something prehistoric, primordial. I knew I was prey, being stalked, watched by the ultimate predator, and I knew there was nothing I could do in the face of such overwhelming power.He was watching me, my roommate. He was standing at the window, had been standing there maybe for hours. I couldn’t see him, not from this far, but I felt it with utter certainty. The adrenaline was flowing, I could feel my heart banging in my chest, and I took a step forward. And another.I was drawn in. What the hell else could I do? It was 2am, and that was my home.Slowly, I kept moving forward, every atom of my being the sole focus of that presence I felt watching me.There was that small, logical voice in my mind. I’m surprised it was still there, thought it had died off long ago, absent as logic was from nearly all my prior decisions. But still, a part of me said there was nothing to fear. It’s just a guy, a normal, mortal man with a weird stare.Now as I said, I’ve been plenty stupid in the past. I know what it’s like to drive yourself into paranoia. Some part of me wondered, as I staggered down the street, if I was just freaking out, if maybe I’d had something other than beer and shots, if I was high.But I knew I wasn’t, and I know I was right to be afraid.I didn’t look up at the second floor window when I approached. I didn’t want him to know I was scared. But I could feel his gaze beating down on like the summer sun, could almost feel it singe my flesh. I shuddered, but then I moved around from that side of the building and his presence left me, towards the worn, steel stairs. Ascending them, caged by solid steel that rang underfoot, I felt safer.Next came the door. A plain, white door, marked with 3B in plain black. I stood there, the automatic light throwing a sulfurous orange glow about me. And in the middle of the door, beneath the plain, glossy number was the peephole.I couldn’t tell you how long I stood, poised with the key, looking into the beady little hole. It might have been 2 minutes, might have been 2 hours.In some way, it was worse than the certainty of knowing he was watching. Maybe he was on the other side, watching my warped form, or maybe he was already asleep.Standing there, adrenaline leeching from my system, probably still way too drunk, I made the decision, unlocked the door and entered.The apartment was almost as I’d left it that morning. TV and PS4 were in their place, the fan had been left on, a jumble of wires, chargers, and the router sat on their little end table. Gray couch with miscellaneous stains. Fridge covered in tacky magnets from Jen’s trips and old receipts. Everything was normal.Except the window.The window was open; the curtains billowed lethargically in the night’s breeze. I stepped up to it, and putting my hands on the sill, I could look out, and see exactly where I’d rounded the corner and felt his gaze, I could look and see how I would’ve been spotlighted by the streetlamp. I felt my skin crawl, and I turned to look at my roommate’s door.It was closed, and hopefully locked. The apartment was still. He either wasn’t here anymore, or else was asleep.The day was starting to catch up with me, and all the tension and adrenaline had been draining since I came in. I felt unsteady as I closed the window, drew the curtains. Staggered through to my room, closed and locked the door as gently as I could, pushing the deadbolt home as quietly as I could manage.Then I collapsed on the bed.……….The next morning I awoke, sticky, reeking, with a miserable pounding in my head and a mouth that tasted like crap. I’d passed out without turning on my AC, and the hot Texan morning was doing a number on me. I dragged myself from the salt-crusted puddle I’d left, having taken my clothes off some point in the night. A glance at my phone told me it was 11:49 and I had 2% battery left.Shit, I thought. I put the thing on to charge and crawled through to my bathroom. Luckily both rooms had their own, though I wasn’t thinking about my roommate just then. I quickly showered, rinsing away the grime of the stifling night and pissing while I was in there. A quick brush of the teeth and I felt somewhat more normal.Clothes on, I closed my hands around my door handle, determined to make some coffee and start my morning, when yesterday hit me. In a flash, the encounter at the Whataburger and him watching me stagger home. In an instant, I felt scared again. Scared and angry. What the hell was I so afraid of? In the cold light of day, with an aggressive hangover and things to do, it seemed silly to be terrified of my own damn roommate.I unlocked the door with viciousness, and grabbed my keys and wallet.As I stepped out, I was greeted with blaring laughter from the TV.Mike was there, facing away, ostensibly watching an old repeat of The Big Bang Theory. His back was straight, unnaturally so. He sat stiff and immobile.Some character quipped, and the laugh track erupted, but my roommate wasn’t laughing.He was statue-like, my roommate, unflinching as the laughter went on, sitting still as a taxidermy, not looking back at me.I could barely bring myself to speak.“Hey,” I got out.“Yes.” He said, and for the first time it struck me how flat his voice was. Not even emotionless, but flat. As if someone had taken a recording and screwed with the levels and balancing and left a voice devoid of anything.My mouth moved and no sound came out. Some big punch line went off on the TV, and the laugh track howled and shrieked, and my roommate didn’t move or make a sound.“Look.” I got out. “I’m going out for the day.”The hollow voice came back. “I’ll be here.”That was what he always said, and for the first time it registered in my brain, not as a friendly affirmative, but as a threat. I all but ran out the apartment.I was in my shitbox Honda and half way down the street before I realized that I’d forgotten my phone. I was half tempted to turn around, but decided I wouldn’t need it.As I was driving, I realized I was still really pretty drunk, so I stopped for an early lunch at a Burger King. Nothing good, just a double Whopper with cheese. I felt that a big slab of meat and bread like that, plus a crappy coffee, might help me sober up.Whether it helped or not I don’t know. I didn’t crash on my way to Jen’s place, at least. Once I’d arrived, it was hard to knock normally rather than bashing the shit out of the door, but I restrained myself.Now I’m kind of a scrawny guy, tall, but thin, built (as Dick said) like a crackhead. My sister is quite the opposite, short, a bit chunky, and covered in tattoos. I said hey, trying to not look too insane when she opened the door.“Hey yourself. You could’ve called.” She started.I smiled and shrugged. “Forgot my phone. Had a crazy morning.”“Right. You coming in? Sue won’t be home for a few hours anyway.”I nodded, and followed her in.It was nice, Jen’s apartment. Far nicer now that I’d moved out. White, modern, minimalist (besides for the amp and cables strewn across the floor), with a big kitchen and a huge TV we’d both pitched in for.“How’s the spare room coming on?” I asked, trying to seem casual as I poked my head into the room I’d lived in since I was 17. It was bare and empty, all my crappy posters and other crap I’d left long gone. That hurt a little. Like my sister had ripped a part of me out of her life. Not that I could blame her.“It’s coming. It’ll be cool to have an office.” She said, coming over to peer in besides me.I nodded. “Yeah. I’m sure.”Jen is more the creative type than me. Her and Sue wanted a place to work on her music for ages. It’s just a hobby really, but she’s always talking about it, and she always needed a special place to work properly. Back in high school, she never did any homework, until our Dad set up a little study area in a spare room.“So,” she said, “what’s this visit all about?”I sighed hard, crossing my arms as I threw myself on her couch. I sat for a moment, biting my lip, as I tried to think of something to say. There weren’t any secrets between us, except maybe one of mine, but it was hard to frame it.“It’s my roommate.”“Oh, right. What’s him name again?”I hesitated. “Mike, I think.”Jen snorted. “You think? Some roommate you are. Don’t you talk with the guy?”“No.”“No?”I looked at her, feeling embarrassment rising once again. “I’m scared of him.”Immediately her expression sobered. “Why? He’s not into drugs is he?”“No!” I started. “No, it’s not drugs. He’s… There’s something real off about him.”“Off how?” Jen pressed. “Something we should tell the police?”I shook my head. “There’s nothing to tell them. His behavior is just, strange as hell.”“Was he jacking off in the living room?”“No!” I took a breath. “Look, I never speak to the guy. Don’t even notice him. But the other day, he came into work, and he stared at me.”Jen looked unsure. “Well, yeah, you live together.”“Not like that. He’s scary, Jen, terrifying. He came in and stared at me, like he could see into my soul.”I watched her face fall at my words; I saw the pity in her eyes, that sudden hard edge of accusation.“Are you on anything?” She asked.My sister, my rock, and the one person I could trust. She thought I was having a relapse. It broke my heart.People do stupid things. It started in high school. My girlfriend at the time, she got into it through her older brother’s friends, and I wanted her to think I was cool. Stupid shit, I won’t go into it here. I’ve been clean for 5 years, now, all thanks to Jen. But her reaction made it all come back.I talked longer, I explained as well as I could, told her about last night, about this morning. Finally, she was coming around.“-and he wasn’t laughing? He was just sitting there?” She asked.“Yeah.”“Well, it was the Big Bang Theory; I don’t know anyone who laughs at that.”I kept my frustration buried. “Yeah, but he was completely emotionless, not moving, not blinking.”“Okay, I can see why you’re freaking out a bit.” She said.“Thank you,” I said sardonically, “but what the hell should I do?”She leaned back into the couch, looking sidelong at me. “I guess I’ll have to mediate.”“What do you mean?”“I mean I’ll talk to him. Figure out if he’s got something against you, or why he’s being so weird.” She explained.“Okay, Jen. Thanks. I’m glad you believe me.” It was a weight off my chest, having my sister back on my side. She always was, even when my own parents threw me out. She’d done a lot for me, and here she was coming to my rescue again.It’s isolating, going through things alone. Just having a single person to share these things with brought a sense of peace and security I’d been missing for a day.We’d been talking for nearly an hour at this point, and Jen agreed to come back with me, talk to my creepy-ass roommate, and help me sort all this shit out. I was standing, grabbing my keys off the kitchen counter, when I looked out the window.“What the fuck?” It slipped out of me, along with every shred of hope I’d gained since I left that morning.“What?” said Jen, peeking round my elbow.He was there. Other side of the road. Standing, watching.Jen tensed as she saw him.“He isn’t moving.” She said, an edge creeping into her voice.“Nope.”“Okay, wait here. I guess this makes it easier.” Jen said as she slunk into her room, coming back out with her purse.“Makes what easier?” I asked, as she began digging through all the receipts and crap in her bag.“Not laughing at shit sitcoms I get, but no one stalks my little brother.” She emerged from her bag with a spray bottle.I blinked, “What’s that?”She rolled her eyes at me. “Deodorant, dipshit.” She only called me that when she was super pissed. “What do you think? It’s fucking mace. You’re right, this guy’s a fucking creep, following you out here, and now he knows where I live too.”She gave me a look as she strode to the door.“I’m sorry I ever doubted you, bro.” She said.In that instant, a flicker of my old hope returned. At least I could always count on my sister.She stormed out the door in a fury; pepper spray in hand, shoulders set. She might be short, but she could be terrifying in her own way at times. My roommate, however, didn’t move. He just stood, rooted to the sidewalk, in front of the apartment block opposite, and he was still staring at me, not noticing 4’11” of protective older sibling marching towards him.She was right on him when he turned.It was slow, she was shouting, bringing up the spray can, when Mike began to speak. He turned and looked at Jen, and her shoulders fell.I couldn’t hear them, not from in there. I had no idea what they were saying.But Jen seemed to fall inwards on herself. Together, she and my roommate turned, facing me. Mike kept speaking, and Jen looked down at her feet. He put a hand on her shoulder, almost reassuring.She dropped the can, and my gut dropped with it.I have no idea what happened, what he said. But next thing I knew Jen was coming back over, mace picked back up. At the door she stopped, and I saw the tears on her cheeks. Her voice wobbled.“Get out.”I couldn’t understand. “What? What’s wrong with him, is he gonna le-“Jen pointed the pepper spray in my face.“Get the fuck out. Never talk to me again, or I’ll call the fucking police.”My mind raced and I felt sick, as she slammed the door on me. With nothing else to do I looked about the street, but my roommate was gone. I was shaking, probably in shock as I walked by to my car. I was breathing hard.I didn’t even know I was driving until I pulled into my parking spot, just as the sun was going down in a big splash of orange.What the hell did he tell Jen? What could he have told her? And why the fuck would Jen believe my weird roommate? I couldn’t make sense of any it, I shut my eyes and pounded on my dashboard, probably making the cracks in it worse, but I didn’t care.I tried to tell myself that it was an act; that Jen was doing something to get rid of Mike. I just needed to trust her. But part of me knew. There are mistakes I’ve made, ones I’ve only told Jen about, sure. And also one I’ve never told anyone. If my roommate somehow knew it, if that’s what he told Jen. I could see that leading to her reaction.But I couldn’t see how he could know, or why she’d ever believe him.I looked up at my apartment. He might already be back. Probably was. But I needed my phone at least. I figured that I might as well take all my crap, leave town for a few days, until this is sorted. I think I could sort shit out with Dick, not lose my job. Besides, I was gonna have to deal with Mike.I came up. He was here. Standing in the kitchen, with his back to me. It was like being in a room with a temperamental nuclear bomb, I felt so tense. I don’t know if I was trying to sneak, that’d be pathetic, but I kept my breathing shallow, and stepped as lightly as I could across to my room.If anything, I think he kept turning, kept his back to me.As soon as my door was locked, I grabbed my gym bag, and stuffed it full of every clean piece of clothing I could find. Then went toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant.Then came a knock on my door.I froze, heart smacking my ribs.Then came his voice, still and terrible.“You want to leave.”It wasn’t a question.“That wouldn’t be a very smart choice.” It continued.I wasn’t sure what I could have done, no words came to mind, everything was blank. There was nothing I could do but listen to that still, dispassionate, almost artificial voice.“You should have been honest with Jen, years ago.”I clenched my fists, my teeth, my whole body tightened, against my will.“It weighs heavily.” The voice stated. “So very heavy.”I felt hot, flushed, every muscle tensed as I sat and listened.“It’s important to talk.”There was nothing I wanted more than to be somewhere else, anywhere. I almost considered diving through the window.“It would be best if you confessed.”I shut my eyes, willing my roommate to leave, to give me a chance to get to my car.“Then, I will go now. I have some things to see to. But I am very willing to listen when you return.”The outer door slammed, suddenly. I jumped, almost cried out, as all that tension suddenly bled away. I have no idea what the fuck he was talking about. He’s been gone a while now, and I’ve finished packing my stuff. I’m going to leave now, get as far as I can tonight, then I’ll give Dick a call, sort out work. Looks like Jen’s blocked me on everything. I guess I might have to go talk to my parents.",

      "content_preview": "After polishing the last, (completed, walk away from) draft of my haunted house script, some creepy, weird and pretty much, random things started happening. I don’t usually buy into coincidences, but these moments strung together in such a way that I couldn’t help noticing.The first instance came from a single line of dialogue that just wasn’t working. It felt off, like it didn’t belong in the scene no matter how many times I rewrote it. Rewrites weren't solving the problem so I tried something else...Example (not from the actual script):SYD Took you long enough.BEIB What’re you talking about? I haven’t seen you since seven.I cut Beib’s line and ran it through an AI text to voice generator that I’ve used for a couple of years. Normally, it’s smooth and reliable. But this time it played the line up until: “What’re you talking about? I haven’t seen…” — then froze and drew out this long, unnatural sound: “Ooooooooo.”I thought it was a glitch, so I tried again. Same exact thing happened. The generator glitched at the very same point. This stood out because, in two years of using it, it had never once failed on me.The second occurrence came the next day. My father and I had gone out for a coffee, nothing unusual. On the way back, his car suddenly stalled. Just cut out completely.Strange, because his car has never given a moment’s trouble, not a flat tyre, not even a broken light. Nothing. Yet the morning after the AI glitch, the engine died without warning. It was as if the weirdness had jumped from the digital page and into real life.The third and most peculiar incident happened at 8 a.m. the very next morning. I was jolted awake by the sound of a Spanish guitar strumming above me. Not a recording, real strings being plucked, rhythmic and deliberate. The thing is, the adjoining attic room was completely unoccupied at the time. Then came noises like someone crawling around up there.I got up, opened the attic door, and what I saw was almost surreal. A blackbird perched above the stairwell, staring down at me with ink blotted eyes. It had somehow slipped in through a gap in the gutter. From there it had hopped over the guitar, pecking at random objects, and fluttered around the knick-knacks as though it was its natural habitatSo there it is. Three incidents in quick succession: the AI glitch, the stalled car and the blackbird with its eerie guitar accompaniment.Any one of them on their own could be brushed off. All three together though? In a row? This feels like something else entirely. Something deliberate.I can’t shake the thought that these moments are more than coincidence. Maybe... just maybe, when you spend enough time writing about a haunted house and the accompanying lore, that energy doesn’t stay trapped on the page.Perhaps when you’re writing scary stuff, it leaks out into waking life.I'll thread with care from now on.",

      "content_preview": "I need to tell you this. I really do need to tell you this.What do I need to tell you? Well this story of course!Why? Because you need to know what exists out there. Out there slightly beyond the boundaries of human existence.In the caves.In the woods.Underneath the concrete road which the cars travel on.When you finish reading this story I hope you remember everything. Remember everything and be careful. Because you really need to protect yourself.I will not detail where I am from and where I went. But I exited the city so I can go to my forest cabin out of the state for a week of relaxation in nature.The journey was quick. And I was a good driver too. In a single day I managed to bypass a huge amount of distance and I was already halfway there. Towards my cabin.I was surrounded by trees from all sides as I drove on the scorching hot concrete road. The sun giving a warm hug towards everything in 12 pm when I decided to drive 30 feet off road so I could relax and relief myself in the woods.Once I halted my car I jumped out and locked the doors. I went some 100 feet deeper into the woods so I can pee free from the gaze of the human eye.I peed and then looked out into the forest for 5 minutes. Admiring the beautiful scenery. I turned around and headed towards my car so I can drive again.When my car appeared in my sight I did not see anything unusual. But when I tried opening  my car that's where things went scary.I put my key into the hole and tried opening it.Nothing.I tried and tried but I did not hear the sound. Fearful I grabbed the handle and the door swung wildly.I did not leave the door unlocked.I looked inside of the door and noticed that the inside has been completely ripped off.No locking mechanism.No mechanism to keep the door shut.Nothing.Sweat started rolling down my forehead.I jumped into the drivers seat and I tried to start the car.Nothing.The car did not start.My heart jumped fast, I flung myself out of the door and opened the car hood.Everything had been ripped off.Nothing was left in there.I took three steps back stunned at what I saw.During my time in the woods I heard nothing which would indicate car parts being ripped off.I started looking around and that's when I noticed on my left I saw smoke rising towards the sky.\"Someone is in the woods?\" I thought to myself.I then turned towards the smoke and ran towards it.I came across a large old looking but strong cabin. And on its porch sat a man who looked like he was in his sixties in a rocking chair.I ran towards him and when I was 10 feet away I yelled out to him. \"Did you destroy my car?\"The old man replied, clearly confused by my question.\"What?\"I yelled but this time a little bit quieter.\"Parts of my car door were ripped off and I cannot lock it. And when I tried to start the car so I could drive it did not start. And when I opened the hood nothing was there. Did you do it?\"Suddenly chill was in the air and everything seemed to stop. No sounds from the forests were heard and all I felt was my rapid heartbeat.The man rose on his feet and said\"Son. Understand this. No human can do what has happened to you. Let me guess you heard no sound of the car parts being ripped off from your car? I will provide lodging for your safety. You do not know what you just came across. Come inside i will explain it to you.\"I do not know how to explain it, but I felt honesty and sincere kindness in the man's voice and I felt calmer. I complied and went inside his house.His house which was made out of the wood looked elegant inside and when I entered he shut the door,locked it and pointed towards a chair and said \"sit. I will explain.\"I sat on the chair and he took a long hard look at me before he said anything.\"What you just experienced was the attack of the monster. This monster cannot attack during the day but only during the night. It cannot enter any home and you must be wary when you are outside. Similar thing happened to a man yesterday and I provided lodging to him. He went out 5 hours ago into the forest and has not returned since. He went to reach a town which is 100 miles further down the road.\"\"Listen to me carefully.  Do not go outside until it is 7 AM when the sun is completely out, and go inside by 6 PM. And you will be safe. \"Those words struck me like lightning.I said to him while the fire raged in the furnace.\"I cannot stay here forever. I have to go home!\"He replied\"And that's why I will make a phone call to my friend.\"He then pulled out a brand new iPhone and talked with someone.He then closed his phone and said to me.\"In a week in 1 PM he will arrive and you will go to your location. Did you bring any stuff? If so let's go to your car and fetch it. You can put it in the basement. Don't worry. It's clean.\"I did not say anything and we both went out to my car and brought all my stuff to his basement.Then he dusted off his hands and said.\"My name is Jerry. What about yours?\"I then told him my name which I will not disclose here.During the day nothing happened. It was only when the clock struck  9 AM when I heard the voice of man screaming emanate from the woods.Me and Jerry ran out of our rooms and watched out of the window a man running out of the woods towards the cabin.\"Is that the monster?\" I asked. My question seasoned with fear.\"No that is not the monster.\" Jerry squinted his eyes. \"The thing behind him is the monster.\"I stared and saw something which was over 7 feet tall and humanoid looking run after the man. 10 feet behind him.\"We must help him!\" I headed for the door and Jerry grabbed my shoulder.\"We can't. That thing is too fast. It will reach him. Watch.\"We both watched as the man was only 30 feet away from the cabin as the monster launched itself and landed on top of him. He screamed even louder and the monster tore him into bits. It grabbed his mangled lifeless body and brought him into the woods.\"See? That is why you must be careful. And go in the house by 6 PM. The monster cannot enter this home.\"I had no questions except one for Jerry.\"Why do you live here?\" I meekly asked him\"To help others.\" He replied quickly with a tint of confidence in his voice.I went to bed that night. Thinking over the entire day. I fell asleep quickly.  I was tired.My pizza has just arrived. I have to go. I will tell you more about Jerry and everything that happened during my stay there in Jerry's home. I am so grateful for Jerry's friend John who drove me back home.",

      "content_preview": "People love watching haunted videos at 2 AM with the lights off, like fear is just entertainment. The podcasts. The Reddit threads. All those YouTubers with shaky GoPros chasing shadows in basements and acting surprised when a light flickers.But real horror? Real horror doesn't come with jump cuts and screaming thumbnails.Real horror doesn’t want to be shared.I know because it tried, once, to test me.It started three years ago, back when I ran a YouTube channel with my friends. We were idiots. The whole thing was just dumb pranks and fake haunted explorations. Low-effort content, low-effort brains. Me, Jack, Lee, and Jim. Four guys with no sense of consequence and too much night to waste.We heard about the old Halcyon Hotel from someone Jack knew—names changed, obviously, for reasons you’ll understand soon. It used to be the crown jewel of our town two decades ago. Now it was a withering husk on the edge of relevance, half of it under renovation, the other half dying of mold and neglect.But what really caught our attention was the rumor.No one,no one, was allowed to stay in the B Wing of the seventh floor.Not since 2008. Not since a string of incidents that had the hotel slapping padlocks on that hallway and pretending it didn’t exist.A suicide in Room 715.A woman was found hanging—but not by her neck. By herhair.She’d twisted a thick rope around the base of her bun, looped it over the ceiling fan, and stepped off the bed. When the staff finally broke down the door two days later, the room was humid and reeking, and the floor—sticky, wet, and red—was soaked with blood.Her scalp had torn halfway off. Flesh peeled back from her skull like wet paper, raw and glistening. Both her wrists were slashed wide open—blood dried in branching, arterial patterns across the floor, the walls, even the lampshade.No one else was in the room. The door had been locked from the inside.In the note they found, smeared in spots with blood and God knows what else, she wrote:\"My hair hisses like snakes. It whispers to me when I sleep. Tells me to do things. I think… I think it’s been growing without me. I just wanted silence.\"That was all. Silence.Room 712. A man, burned alive in his bed.No known cause. No faulty wiring. No lit cigarettes. No short-circuited appliances. Just fire—sudden, savage, and contained. The mattress was half-melted, the headboard scorched to charcoal. The room stank of burnt flesh and something unnervingly sweet—like cologne baked into the skin before it liquefied.By some stroke of luck, a night staff member happened to be walking that corridor and spotted smoke curling from beneath the door. He called for backup, and with two others, managed to break in and smother the flames before they could leap to the hallway.But nothing added up. There were no signs of what started the fire. No lighter or fuel. And no remains of theman. Just his shoes, placed neatly by the bed. His watch still ticking on the nightstand. Wallet, phone—untouched. No record of anyone entering that room except him.But there was no body. Only a heap of fine, grey ash where a person should’ve been. As if the fire had come only for him, and spared everything else.Room 707:Two guests disappeared.One was found in the ventilation shaft days later, body twisted like a pretzel. The other? Never recovered.There were reports of rituals, symbols carved into walls beneath wallpaper, and odd sighitngs. A child once said she saw “a man made of glass” waving from the hallway.And the final nail in that coffin happened in late 2007.A woman checked in one rainy December night with her three kids—ages five, seven, and nine. Said she was escaping her abusive husband. Staff felt bad for her. Gave her a discount. Around 2:00 AM, a man came in—skinny, twitchy, eyes like raw nerve endings—claimed he was her cousin. No questions were asked. He just walked straight up to her room.They checked out early the next morning. Just the two of them. One giant suitcase. No kids.Housekeeping entered the room a few hours later, and what they found broke something in that building.Burnt black candles in every corner. Ash across the carpet. Walls smeared with something red and drying. Bedsheets soaked and stiff with blood. In the bathroom—The tub was full.Limp, half-sawed arms. Ripped legs. Small ones. Three different body sizes. Burn marks etched across what was left. No heads. Just open, bleeding necks. And carved into the limbs—actualsymbols. Jagged ones. Like someone used a box cutter. Old-school satanic crap—sigils, spirals, inverted crosses drawn in skin.The blood on the wall, there werewordsscrawled in it. Latin, maybe. Maybe not. One cleaner said she saw the letters rearranging when no one was looking. She was probably hallucinating, but it was still creepy.The police swarmed the place. The investigation stretched on for months. Eventually, it came out—the man wasn’t her cousin like he claimed at check-in. Just her junkie boyfriend. The two of them were wrapped up in some twisted messiah delusion, obsessed with rituals and fire. They had sacrificed all three kids. Said they were “offerings to the fire gods” or some deranged variation of that.They were caught eventually. Faces blurred on the local news. But even after that, there was no real closure. Because what they left behind in that room? Wasn’t just blood. Wasn’t just rot.It was somethingelse. Something that didn’t leave when they did.The owner kept it hush-hush. But after that, they didn’t just lock the B Wing. They sealed it with a steel door. Acted like it never existed. No Entry. No exceptions.Until Jack greased the night crew.We slipped in through the back around 1 AM. One of the bellboys—Collin—let us in through the fire escape. Couldn’t have been older than nineteen, wiry frame, hoodie pulled tight over his head like he was hoping it might shield him from guilt. When he handed Jack the key to the seventh floor’s locked-off corridor, his hand trembled like he was trying not to drop it.We crept past the main reception, stuck to the shadows along the lobby wall, trying not to draw attention as we looped around to the elevator. Collin came with us, walking fast, glancing over his shoulder like the walls were listening.Right as we hit the elevator call button, he leaned in close to Jack and whispered, “Hey man… just—just be careful up there. I’ve heard stuff. From guys who used to work the night shift before me. They said that floor messes with your head. Like… rewires your brain or something. You start seeing things. Things that aren’t there—or maybe are, and shouldn’t be.”Jack smirked. “Like ghosts and demons kinda things?”Collin didn’t smile. “No. More like reflections that move before you do. Hearing your own voice whispering from behind. Hallucinations and stuff. I’m serious, dude. Don’t believe everything you see up there.”Then, quieter, his eyes darting to the far end of the lobby.“I once saw a man standing by the big window near the emergency exit. Long coat. Tall hat. Just staring. The steel door to the seventh was locked, but he wasthere. I swear to God. When I got closer… gone.”We went quiet for a second. Even the elevator seemed to take longer than it should.Then Lee laughed. “C’mon, man. You rehearsing that for TikTok or something?”“Yeah,” Jack chuckled, slapping his back. “Appreciate the warning, bro, but we’ll be out by four.”Collin didn't laugh with us.He just nodded, stepped back as the elevator doors opened. “I’ll swing back at four to sneak you out. Just… don’t let itseeyou.”",

      "content_preview": "Ride safe...Sam and I had been obsessed with bikes and racing ever since we were kids. We even built a tiny race track in our backyard. We had these wooden pedal bikes, and we’d race, fall, laugh… We always dreamed of touring the world on our motorcycles. We weren’t brothers by blood, but we were closer than any two brothers could be.At sixteen, we got our first real bikes. Sam had his first crash just two months after getting his. I was always more careful, but Sam—he rode like he’d lost his mind. The crash happened when he tried to do a wheelie. He went down at a hundred on the highway, and a car nearly ran him over. I warned him all the time, of course. Not just me—his parents, his friends… I’m pretty sure he even broke up with a couple of girlfriends because of it.That was why he ran away from home. His dad told him to sell the bike. I wasn’t there when it happened, but Sam fought back, and his dad gave him an ultimatum: sell the bike or leave the house. And well… you can guess which one he chose. He showed up at my place, saying we could finally live the dream we’d been chasing since childhood. Just the two of us and the world out there waiting. What could I say? That dream had always excited him more than it did me. My family… well, I don’t like to talk much about my family ties. Let’s just say we weren’t that close, and they didn’t really care when I left home.So we hit the road together. Sam said we had to share our journey, that we’d blow up on social media. At first, we toured our own city, then the rest of America, and soon we went abroad. We met incredible people, had fun, faced breakups, accidents, unfinished stories… During our trip to Ohio, I met a girl. She was amazing. Not really into bikes, but she adapted to me while I stayed there. When it was time to leave, she even asked me to stay. Sam wasn’t the kind of guy who believed in love, but even he said we were meant for each other. I remember him leaning against his bike, a beer in his hand, staring at me under the setting sun.“Why are you looking at me like that?” I asked.“You love that girl, don’t you?” he said.I didn’t answer.“You know, brother… I want your happiness more than anything. And when you’re with her, you really look happy.”I could’ve stayed and been happy with her. Maybe… But Sam and I had dreams, and I had made him a promise.“I gave you my word, brother. I’m not going to leave it unfinished.”Anyway… the past belongs to the past.As we kept traveling and uploading videos, people got curious, and our channel grew. Within a few years, we had millions of followers across different platforms. With followers came money, and we upgraded our bikes. (I cried when I sold my first one—it was more than just a machine to me.) We stayed in better hotels, ate better food.Sometimes we met up with our fans in the cities we visited. We were invited to motorcycle group gatherings. We even raced against other famous bikers from abroad. (We got into a lot of fights during those street races.) Once, we were invited to give a conference. We might’ve been good riders, but public speaking? Not so much. Sam and I basically stared at each other and at the 120 people in the room for three hours straight. Never got invited again. Pretty sure we never will.We had become professionals. Those two kids with a cheap phone camera were gone—replaced by two men filming with the best 360-degree GoPros money could buy. And we loved it. Sam and I had made a promise: we’d keep doing this, no matter what. Whether it was herniated backs or shaky old-man hands, we’d keep going—or until the day we met God on the highway.Once, I asked him, “What if one of us dies, and the other survives?” He told me if he died, he wanted me to keep going. And I’d want the same. But imagining the guy I’d been with all my life suddenly gone…He was everything. Sam, my bike, our channel. That was all I had. After I left, my family never even called me. Maybe they were even happy their screw-up son was gone. But I knew who my real family was. Family isn’t always about blood—it’s about the people you feel at peace with.Last August marked eight years with Sam on the road. Eight long years… So many new faces, new memories, new bikes. New scars… I remember when Sam broke his shin, and we had to stay in New Jersey for three months. Those were good times, beautiful times. But every good thing comes to an end. We just don’t like to think about itWe were halfway through our tour of Italy. It was a sunny day. Ducati, the pride of the Italians, had just launched a new model and we were riding back from the event. I still remember how much Sam loved that bike. He said that was one of the most beautiful death way in the world. And he wasn’t wrong.On the way back, we decided to take a detour through a mountain road. It was full of sharp turns and steep cliffs—the kind of thing we were looking for. A bit of adrenaline. Our bikes were built for straight asphalt, so as long as we took the corners slowly, nothing would go wrong. We were climbing uphill. Sam was in front, I was behind, both of us on the single-lane road. Through the intercoms, we kept chatting. I was telling him about a famous ice cream place in town we absolutely had to try before leaving. Sam joked that if they gave us a “celebrity discount,” he was in.Then, right after a bend, a pickup truck appeared in front of us. The road was too narrow, visibility too low to overtake, so we were forced to trail behind it for a long while, barely keeping our speed above fifty.Sam… he was always impatient. He liked making sudden moves. I watched him squirm in front of me, revving his engine, flashing his lights at the driver, trying to push him out of the way.“Take it easy, champ. Just hold on for a few more kilometers,” I told him over the intercom, afraid he’d do something reckless.“Damn it, can’t this guy move a little to the right?” he growled.“Sam, the road’s too narrow and we can’t see ahead. Don’t do something stupid, man.”“Come on, Brian, when have I ever done something stupid on these handlebars?”“Quite a few times.”“You bastard, Brian.”I chuckled, muffled through the helmet. I warned him again not to try anything, but in the end, his patience snapped. Before one of the turns, he gave the throttle a bit too much and edged left, hugging the far side of the lane. He was practically on the opposite shoulder.“Sam, don’t do this.”“I’m not a kid, Brian. I know how to take a damn curve.”The moment he came out of the bend, he opened the throttle—and right before he did, he yelled:“Watch me, baby!”I saw the oncoming car three, maybe four seconds before he did. Just as he opened the throttle, I screamed:“NO, SAM!”His front wheel shot up into a wheelie as he came out of the curve, only to see the Fiat heading straight at him. He yanked the handlebars and slammed the front wheel back to the ground, but when it hit, he lost control. The bike wobbled violently. He couldn’t take the corner cleanly and slammed straight into the guardrail separating the road from the cliff. The bike stopped. Sam didn’t. He was thrown several meters forward and, before hitting the barrier, he… went over the cliff.I remember my vision blurring with panic. I stopped my bike next to the wreckage of his, completely crushed at the front. The cliff dropped into sharp rocks and sea. I leaned over the barrier, screaming at the truck driver to call an ambulance, screaming Sam’s name so loud it deafened me inside my helmet. I thought the intercom was broken. I ripped off the helmet and screamed his name into the void below.Then I saw it—one of his gloves snagged on a branch-like jut of rock. But Sam himself… he was gone. I couldn’t see him. I kept leaning, searching desperately for a way down, but the cliff was sheer. Without proper gear, it was impossible to descend. So I begged him to answer me. The entire time I waited for the ambulance, I begged.I don’t know how long it took, but eventually they came with a rescue team. Within an hour, the police had closed off the road, cordoned the area, and the rescuers were lowering themselves down the cliff. I don’t remember how many times I told the story to the police, the paramedics, the officers… After an hour and a half, they finally found him. By some miracle, he had landed in a crevice in the rocks.They told me to step aside. His condition was bad. A female medic held my shoulder, sat me down, and deliberately stood in front of me as they brought Sam up on a stretcher. I wasn’t a kid. I knew. I pushed past her—and when I saw Sam… God… I can’t even describe it. Every time I try, I relive it. The nausea, my knees buckling, ripping off my helmet to vomit. His body was broken, mangled. I was terrified to even get closer.The medic guided me toward the police car to calm me down. I followed the ambulance. They took him into intensive care. The doctors said the chances were slim. Even if he lived, he’d be in a coma, or paralyzed, or tied to a ventilator for the rest of his life.Sam… maybe he even prayed for that not to happen. Once, he told me he’d rather die on his bike than live broken. I had smacked his arm, told him to stop being dramatic. And yet, in that hospital corridor, I prayed. I prayed for anything but death. Wheelchair, coma, breathing machine—I didn’t care. Just let him live. Please, God. Don’t answer that stupid prayer of his.But after two and a half weeks, his lungs finally gave out. They couldn’t save him.I was sitting in the hospital cafeteria when the doctor approached. He didn’t say much, just whispered a few words in our language:“I’m sorry for your loss.”Then he walked away. He hadn’t even looked me in the face. Maybe on purpose.I ran upstairs, asked the nurse, and she said the same thing in Italian:“I’m sorry. You lost your friend.”Sorry.The world was spinning. For the first hour, I couldn’t even grasp it. Every second I expected to wake up in a hotel room with Sam snoring beside me. And every second ended in disappointment. But deep down, I was sure. Sam wasn’t there. He’d never be there again.The first week, he haunted my dreams. Sometimes begging me for help. Sometimes walking toward me, trying to kill me. Sometimes we just rode on as if nothing had happened. Waking up was the hardest part.I went back to America—broken, empty, a wreck. It took me three weeks before I could even tell our followers what had happened. Because only then did I accept that Sam was really gone.God… Sometimes I’d still call out to him, tell him dinner was ready. Sometimes I’d ask him a question. A few mornings, I even asked him where he put my bike keys.“Did you steal my keys again, you bastard?” I’d laugh. But there was no answer. Just the voice in my head whispering:He’s dead, buddy.He’s gone.He’s dead.He’s just a dead man now.And every time I heard it, it crushed me all over again.We held Sam’s funeral in the town where we were born and raised. Just a week before the crash, we had talked about it, as if he’d known.“What if you go before me? Where would you want to be buried?” he asked.I joked back: “Who says I’ll die before you?”But he didn’t laugh. He just looked at me, serious.“Probably where I was born.”“Yeah, me too. And if we’re stupid enough to die together, I want our graves side by side.”I didn’t answer. I didn’t want to think about it. I never liked thinking about death or what comes after. I was the kind of guy who lived in the moment.“Hey, Brian,” he said.“What?”“If I go before you, promise me you’ll give me a proper funeral.”“Where the hell is this coming from?”“Shut up and listen. I don’t want it quiet and boring. I want bikes, I want noise, I want a whole damn choir of engines. I want it loud until the very end. Vroom vroom vroom…” He twisted his hand like he was revving a throttle and laughed. Even talking about death, he found a way to laugh.On the day of his funeral, riders came from all over the city, even other towns. And just like he wanted, the bikes never stopped roaring until he was in the ground.We even brought his wrecked bike. I’d had it fixed once we got back to America. It was the most precious thing I had left of him. One by one, everyone revved the engine for Sam.And finally, I stood in front of it alone. No one else would ever ride this bike again. I leaned close, whispered so no one else could hear—just for Sam:“I hope you’re happy wherever you are, brother.”...",

      "content_preview": "I used to work night shifts cleaning an old hospital. Most of the building was empty — a newer, modern hospital had opened in town. The patients left behind were mostly old, terminal, and waiting for their last days.But there was one wing no one touched. Hall 7.The staff that had been working there longer than I had, told me stories about Hall 7. We rarely had to go there, except when we had to get certain supplies. As I was the cleaner, when my supplies ran out, Hall 7 was the place I had to go to to refill.I usually avoided it as much as I could, but tonight I had no choice. My supplies needed a refill, so I went.The stories the staff had told me screamed loudly in my head every time I went for a supply run, so it did tonight as well. The stories of the old man that was hospitalized for a tumor as big as a basketball. His stomach had ballooned so far it looked ready to split, skin stretched thin and glossy, purple veins crawling across it like worms. Nurses whispered it was like watching a pregnant man, except the child inside was nothing but rot.One night, the man rang the bell but the new nurse working that night was so disgusted and afraid of the look of his stretched tummy, that she ignored him.He rang and rang, the bell echoing down the hall, until the nurse covered her ears. She couldn’t bring herself to look at him. After an hour the bell went silent.The hospital remained quiet until the nurse clocked out and went home, not checking in on the poor patient all night.The morning came, and so did the new staff that clocked in. A new nurse went to check on the man, and to her horror - the man wasn't laying in his bedShe found him on the floor. His abdomen was a ragged pit, flesh peeled back like wet wallpaper, the edges glistening with blood and pus. In his right hand — the scalpel. In the other — the tumor.The tumor was slick, pale, threaded with veins that pulsed weakly as if alive. It was round, obscene, a perfect parody of life. He grinned at the nurse, lifted it high, and slammed it to the floor.Splat. Splat. Splat.Each bounce sprayed red arcs across the walls, a rain of meat and fluid.The man had cut the tumor out himself. But he wasn't dead. The blood was pouring out of the wide open, gaping hole. The patient turned his head and looked the nurse straight in her eyes as he continued to bounce his tumor like a ball on the floor. The sound bouncing up and down was a gut wrenching -Splat. Splat. Splat.The nurse backed out the door screaming in horror as the patient's mouth widened. “I’m free now,” he whispered. “I’m human again.”A few minutes later, the man died.It's a horrifying story, that I always dismissed in hope that humans are way more caring for eachother than this. I just could not believe it. The workers that told me the story, were not employed when they claimed this took place. A urban legend.This story lingered - screamed - in my brain when I headed to the supply closet in Hall 7.The walk to Hall 7 was suffocating. The air reeked of disinfectant, pus, and death. With the vents broken long ago, the stench of wounds and alcohol clung to every breath.The stench so pungent making everyone who came in contact with it lose hope.I reached the end of Hall 6, turning right to the corridor leading to Hall 7. Turning again, now reaching the double doors to my destination.Hall 7 was dark, I ran my hand along the wall until I found the lightswitch. Lights turned on,flickering & unreliable. With the supply closet in sight, straight down the hall I began my walk. The corridor felt so long, but that was also the case. It was quiet, only the sound of the lights buzzing.Trying to keep my mind occupied on anything other than the story, I started to whistle the tune of “Stand by me”, a song me and my mom always whistled when I was worried as a kid, some kind of comfort in the pressing feeling of the hall. The windows into the rooms were dark, not operating in the same light system as the lightswitch.Everything was fine, until a loud bang rattled one of the rooms. My chest tightened. My breathing was loud, heart pounding as loudly in my chest.I tried to control my body as I slowly backed towards the wall.Another noise, now a clunking sound, sharp metal scraping on the floor. I was standing with my back against the wall, almost merging together with the concrete behind me. Facing the opposite wall - a patient room where the repeating sound came from , the large uncurtained window dark as night. I felt like a zoo animal, in the flickering lights above shining down on me with an unnerving sense of being watched.The sound got louder and louder, then it suddenly stopped. As I gained control of my body and started to walk away, just a few steps into my escape - I heard a loud thud on the window coming from the patient room. I turned my head - and that's when my stomach turned. In the window, close as can be stood a man. A man with his eyes wide open, staring at me - with the widest grin I've ever seen. His eyes were locked in on mine. He raised his hands, both holding objects. A sharp, glistering scalpel and a large, round, white gooey ball.My lungs burned, my body screamed to run, but I was nailed to the floor. The man lifted his left hand. Something wet hit the ground — splat, splat, splat. I couldn’t see it in the dark room he stood in, but I knew. He was bouncing it. The tumor.That sound broke me. My legs moved before my brain did. I bolted. The lights flickered once, twice — then died. Swallowing me in black. I ran blind, gagging on the smell that chased me all the way home.I left all my belongings there, certain I would never return to that hospital, or any hospital for that matter.I'm writing this, since I need help. Professionally, maybe?The psychiatrist I spoke with on the phone told me that I needed to come to her office for evaluation. That's out of the question, as I'm unable to leave my room.My bed is rotting with me. The sheets are stiff with sweat and feces. Plates of food fester on the floor, crawling with flies that buzz against the curtains. The air stinks of mildew and waste, but worse than that — I smell him.I can no longer work. I fear living, I'm not able to sleep. I take pills - really strong ones but they don't work. Nothing helps me from the repulsiveness, the barbarity of the scene that's been replaying in front of me every single day on the wooden floor of my bedroom. The eyes staring right into mine, the cutting, the sound of the large round ball hitting the floor when the flesh gives in as it detaches and rolls under my bed. Bleeding & crawling in under my bed -  the dead man shuffles around to find his ball. Rolling it out, grabbing &  holding it in his arms as his face turns with the widest grin -  “I’m free now,” he whispers, blood foaming at his lips. “I’m human again.”  And then it's over, for a couple of minutes until it all repeats again. It's constant.I cannot move. I'm living in my bed. To say I'm “living” is an overstatement. I haven't eaten since this happened. I can't leave my bed. I have my computer, my phone. I know that no one will believe me, but I'm really struggling for help. I sit here, tight in the corner of my bed pressed against the wall. I'm living in my own feces. I'm scared, embarrassed, confused.Please, I'm begging you. How can I make this stop?",

      "content_preview": "Hey there, everyone! Quick run-down here. Wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this in the past, or if maybe I’m just going crazy. I work in hospital security and have had some strange stuff happen in the last few months. Though I’d start my account of what happened and see what others have seen. Posting my journal entries and experiences. Hope to hear from y’all soon.\tMany nights are the same here, as I’ve spent years assisting the hospital's Emergency Department. People came in and out, ranging from gruesome suicide attempts to the casual cold. I thought I’d seen it all. This was until about a month or so ago, when I encountered some strange things that changed my perspective on how the living and the dead operate.The ER was as busy as it could be, considering it was a late 4th of July night. Injuries aplenty from those who drank profusely and decided to test their limits with explosives. In my routine, I would assist the life flight crew with any serious trauma patients and escort the crew and doctors to the elevator to the Operating Room. This same event happened that night, and I prepared all my necessary steps to ensure a smooth transition between the helicopter and the OR. A man, 72, had fallen 3 stories while working on some shoddy scaffolding, and upon seeing his body off the flight, the details of his face, eyes, and hair were hard to discern from one another. Numb to the gruesome sight, I helped move the man to the OR. Unfortunately, he was also attempting to speak the entire time since his arrival. Spewing blood in faces as he tried his hardest to finish whatever he was saying.To me, at least, I felt as though I was the only one who could understand him. “Convergence”. Weird to say the least, but it didn’t really pass my mind what he meant until later on. As far as the rest of my day. It ultimately went on without any more events. I finished my shift and quickly found myself at home. I fell asleep soon after. I dreamt what I can only describe as something beyond my understanding. The old man's face was so clearly stamped on my brain that I felt as though I stared at him for hours before. Although I knew it was just mere seconds. Convergence echoed through my thoughts as I found myself stuck in this nightmare. The flesh from his face horrified me the longer I was forced to look at it. The blood was pouring from what looked like a blossom of viscera. Two eyes found their way into the center, like the stigma of a flower. Meanwhile, the shards of teeth and tufts of hair visible look as if they’re trying to find a way out of that fleshy hell. After what seemed like hours, the dream ended with the scent of oranges. Something unexpected yet welcomed after the horror witnessed by my eyes.July 5th came. This time, an ambulance was called to dispatch. A woman, 19, a hiker who came across an unfortunate situation. Mountain lion attack. As soon as we loaded her onto the stretcher from the ambulance, we could see the extent of her injuries. Torn apart. Blood was leaking out of what ended up being most of her torso; her body was mangled and ripped apart. Face also found itself unrecognizable. I couldn’t help but feel uneasy. While assisting her to the OR, I was met with more words. They were almost clearer than the old man's.despite her condition being arguably worse. “The cycle of Convergence is near”. The words caused me to stop and wonder what was happening to me. She was completely unconscious until that point. After her words, she convulsed and began to go into shock. This brought me to call my supervisor and fake being sick to go home a bit early. I needed rest after what I witnessed. Of which I didn’t get.My home felt emptier than normal. Spaces felt tighter. So tight I felt like a cave diver with my lungs pressed up against the rocks, lack of real oxygen making my brain feel fuzzy and disoriented. I wasn’t someone who couldn’t stomach the imagery or gore. Especially after becoming desensitised to it after so long. I remember back when I started, I would find myself in the bathroom and vomit after seeing that. Heart racing and my mind ultimately finding itself a place right next to a panic attack. It was long enough ago, and now I’ve become numb to the horrors of it. After entering my room, the whole place made me feel like I couldn’t breathe, and my chest felt unable to expand with my breathing. Making me fly into a panic. Slamming my chest, attempting a strange ritual of CPR compressions. Trying to revive myself as if I were already dead. 30 minutes late, my breath came back in a harsh explosion of force. My ribcage battered and bruised, I managed to end my panic and began to calm down. My night was long. Except it’d only been about 45 minutes since I’d gotten home at 7 PM. I was exhausted. Soon, I fell asleep not too long after my self-repair.Again, a shocking dream came to me. One that felt all too familiar. I was on a gurney. Strapped in and unable to speak. Blurry vision and pain unimaginable all over. Tearing through me like a fire. My bones ached, and my skin felt loose and unfitting. I then realized as I cleared my vision slightly. I was the woman on the gurney from the night before. Doctors, Security, and Staff were pushing me to the OR where I’d find a permanent stay. I tried to scream out in either pain or to see if I even could. I soon came to a stop, and hours seemed to pass in the agony of it all. Then I saw it. A light. The one they talk about at the end times. When your life meets an end. Except this wasn’t the experience I expected, while I would pass.The bright light turned into a pathway quickly. My body restored as I made my way through it. Depictions of this place seemed horrifically inaccurate. I couldn’t tell if it was heaven, hell, or something in between. The arches supposedly made of gold were something entirely different. Made from what I could only describe as cobbled stone and eyes that never closed on their own. The floor wasn’t clouds or something even remotely resembling any flooring I’d encountered. Covered in what looked like sores and feathers. Disgustingly soft and delicate. The finale was upon me. The gates of the arches tore themselves apart. Allowing me entry. When all the eyes from the arches stared intently at me. Soon, a being made its way down from above. Its presence was something to behold. In a sky of reds and purples, a solid gold idol came down on feathered wings. Sphereacle yet sharp, rotating with eyes surrounding each part of it. A being that looked physically impossible found its way to me. It spoke a few words, “You’re not ready for convergence yet. You’ve still got much to learn.” I was then thrown back into the body on the operating table. I woke in my bed in a cold sweat. And so here I am writing this post a few months later. I’ve been keeping a dream journal to update everyone, once or if something else happens. Until then, feel free to ask any questions. I’ve done my best to write everything, but I’m aware that I also might have missed some things",

Please try to tell me what's happening.”T: “God fuck, the plant, it won't stop screaming!! It hurts so fucking bad!! Fuck, I should've just gone to the doctor!”Operator: “I'm sorry, a plant? What are you talking about? Could you please-”T: “THE PLANT IN MY ARM!! It's screaming- it must've called it here. And now it's breaking down the fucking door!”Operator: “Someone's trying to break down your door? Mam please try to relax and stay quiet-”T: “Stay quiet?! It's fucking impossible!! The plant won't stop screaming!!”T suddenly gasps, then falls silent for a moment. A loud crash is heard, and the constant shrill wailing continues.T: “I-it got in! Jesus fuck it got in!! PLEASE HELP ME!”T was now yelling through sobs, barely coherent. Loud bangs were heard, then the sounds of T’s screams. Among the cries of agony from T, and the unidentifiable high pitched squealing, was the clear grunts of an older man.Operator: “Mam?! Mam are you okay?! Hello?!Eventually, T’s screams were silenced. The screeching from an unknown source slowly faded away, leaving the operator in silence for a few moments. Then, heavy breathing.Operator: …mam?The operator sounded shaken from what they had heard. The heavy breathing was followed by a few short thumps, then a loud crack. The call ended shortly after.The police showed up to the residence of T and immediately contacted the FAA upon discovery of the seedbed. The victim's body had been mangled and used as soil for the ‘Red Radix’, an infectious and highly lethal pathogen long researched by the FAA.Red branches and roots sprouted from the victims flesh on every inch of their body. They had become a seedbed for the pathogen and would spread to the neighboring houses if not purged. The victim's house was destroyed with a controlled fire to ensure the extinction of the Red Radix seedbed.Red Radix is a long confidential Floraturgical pathogen, it grows in the flesh and attaches its roots to the host's nervous system and blood vessels.It takes mere days to grow to full size, branching out from the host's flesh and siphoning their blood. Once it has matured it will radiate a high pitched frequency, signalling the nearest Red Father.A Red Father is a powerful and incredibly fast organism that was once an organism hosting the Red Radix. Organisms chosen by the pathogen to become Red Fathers are often larger or more dexterous animals like bears or adult human males.Upon hearing the frequency from the budding Red Radix sprout, The Red Father will immediately locate the source for the signal and destroy the host, inseminating them with a Red Radix seedbed.At this point the Radix seedbed will choose to become a Red Father or Red Mother, the decision is informed by the host's physical capabilities. In the case of T, the seedbed was growing into a Red Mother, and had to be purged immediately.A Red Mother is a mess of splintering red branches, twitching crimson veins sprouting out of the host in all directions. It is unknown exactly what the function of a Red Mother is, given that Red Fathers singlehandedly spread the pathogen.What is known is that wherever a Red Mother is rooted, all organic life in the surrounding area seems to be inexplicably attracted to it. Dozens of animals and even a few human neighbors were found kneeling near T’s inseminated corpse and had to be dragged away.If you or someone you know has come into contact with the Red Radix, inform the FAA immediately and quarantine the subject in question.If you or someone you know feel that you have come into contact with any Floraturgy related Flora or have concerns regarding strange plants you may have seen, inform the FAA immediately and stay as far away from the Flora as possible.",

      "content_preview": "After it all happened, I could never explain just what about the little wooden jewelry box had caught my eye. It was simple and unornamented.When questioned about what was inside it, Maggie, the antique shop’s keeper, hesitated before speaking. “That’s a collection of old silver, mostly jewelry and coins.”I nodded. “So a few thousand dollars, I suppose?” I went to put the box back.“Actually, not today. Today it’s on sale. You can get it for about $700. It’s been here for quite a while and I’ve been trying to get rid of it.” That gave me pause.This story isn't easy to tell. My memories have proved to be somewhat fragmented. What follows might not be the most straightforward retelling of events, But it reflects what I lived. Everything started that day in the antique shop. Just bear with me, if you will.Maggie and I go back a little. I started visiting her shop a couple of years ago and over that time had purchased everything from a 1960s toy piano to some original Mackintosh parts from the 1980s. Occasionally, I had gotten discounts on random stuff supposedly for being a loyal customer.“Why so low?” I asked.Maggie smiled. “You’ve been coming here regularly for years. I think I can do this one small thing in return for your business.”Alarm bells are probably ringing for some reading this right now. But in truth, I found it hard to be suspicious of this woman. She was very particular about the things she accepted to sell. I know that because I've sold her stuff before. It never crossed my mind that the jewelry could be fake.I don't know if any of you have guessed yet, but I'm one of those people that buys things and sells them at higher prices. Typically, I like to find things in need of some restoration. If that doesn't cost me too much, I can jack up the price pretty significantly when I'm done with it and still feel like I'm giving enough to the buyer. But there were exceptions to this, like today. Several antiques made from silver priced at a mere 700 bucks felt like the best opportunity I'd had to upsell in a while.I opened the box to give what was inside a look. Several rings, two necklaces, a cup, and some irregularly shaped pieces of metal tumbled onto the checkout counter. It looked like silver. Surely it was real.I picked up one of the larger silver chunks. The thing was trying very hard to be a circle, but failing. On its uneven surface, I could make out a design of sorts depicting a castle and next to it the image of what I now know was a lion. Encircling these was a shield, which separated the symbols into quadrants. To the left of the shield was the letter P, and to the right was the letter D. The lower part of the shield contained a couple of other symbols.Maggie came up beside me. “Those are old Spanish coins. This one you see was their largest denomination, the eight reales. These were struck by hammers, so they're all a little uneven and some are cracked. It's quite rare to see any silver this old that looks like it was minted yesterday.” She laughed and dropped the coin back into the box.Later, I put on both necklaces and two rings. Most of the rings were undecorated. One of them had designs on it reminiscent of the Spanish coins. And another one just had some weird-looking shapes engraved in it. The necklaces were more strange. They were simple, thin silver chains, although the links themselves were hollow pieces of metal strung through with a cord. One of the necklaces was a cross, the other was a tiny pendant representing what on closer inspection appeared to be a man holding some sort of implements in his hands.It occurred to me that it would probably be best to put each piece up individually for sale. I'd recently been in a car accident, and both my car and my body had needed repairs that I was now slowly paying off. But surely I could enjoy wearing 300-year-old jewelry for a couple of days at least.I started to get compliments at work. For once, people wanted to talk to me. One guy, who I knew to be a silver collector mainly because he took any and every opportunity to talk about it, pulled me aside to say that if I were curious about the silver’s origin, I could bring him one of the coins. In the same sentence, he told me about a nice, fancy Italian place nearby that we could grab dinner at if I wanted. I wasn't very interested in that proposition, so I told him that I might take him up on that at some point in my life.A few days after I began wearing the jewelry, the dreams started. All I remember now are brief moments and impressions. Tunnels of some sort underground. Dark spaces illuminated by oil lamps and candles. Hammers, chisels, pickaxes, coughing. The shouting of workers. Distant sounds of earth shifting, maybe even falling. We chipped away at the rock that imprisoned us in hopes of something better. Over and over, these dreams repeated. I began to dread sleep.I found the silver cup on my counter right next to the coffee machine in the early hours of the second morning following the dreams. I must have left it there at some point, though I had no memory of doing this, nor did I have any recollection of it being there before that very moment. But what the hell? A person only lives once. One may as well take the opportunity to drink their morning brew from a silver cup if it is presented to them.The cup was one item that I hadn't paid much attention to. My fingers traced the floral designs on its rounded surface. It was cool to the touch as I lifted it from the counter, but began to warm almost immediately in my hand.The cup's design was like a goblet's, although it was not particularly tall. It was wide at the top, but tapered down to a stem for holding. Below that, the base flared out a bit to offer it more support. I could feel something engraved on the bottom. Upon closer inspection, it was a set of initials. I could see my reflection inside the cup, although the edges of my face were curved somewhat. A minute later, I had a steaming cup of coffee in front of me. A splash of milk went in, then some sweetener.As I brought the cup to my mouth, I had a strange flashback to that one gruesome scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where what's his name? Wallis? Donald? Whoever he is, he drinks from a cup which he presumes to be the Holy Grail only to end up in a pile of bone dust because the cup he had chosen was in fact not the Holy Grail.The warm, sweet liquid passed my lips. There are some psychopaths out there who slurp their coffee. I am not one of them. After a moment, I took another sip. This time, there was a little grit. Usually, this only made an appearance at the very bottom of the cup. Strange. I brought the cup to my lips for more.It was too late by the time I realized that the grit I was tasting couldn't be from coffee. It seemed somehow both earthy and metallic. I spat out what was left of it in my mouth and began to retch over the trash can. But there was nothing to be done. The grit clung to the insides of my throat.I grabbed the cup. The coffee inside was now clouded by flecks of what seemed to be a fine gray dust. As I took deep, heaving breaths, I could feel the smallest of particles from it enter my lungs. It would seem I chose — poorly.That night, I decided that maybe I could use some blackened chicken Alfredo after all. Silver Bro took one look at the coins I had brought and whistled. He called them cobs. “That’s Spanish silver.”“So it’s real?” I asked. I trusted Maggie completely, but it was good to hear this from someone else.“Oh, I’m pretty certain this is real.” The guy launched into an explanation of exactly why that was, but I stopped paying attention after the first five minutes. Usually, I like to learn about the things that I'm reselling. But with this silver, I just couldn't make myself care where it had come from and what its history was.Silver Bro kept making offers to exchange me something for a single piece of jewelry, or even one of the smaller cobs. I said no of course. His offers pissed me off for some reason, a lot. And I didn't know why.Then he showed me some cobs of his own. But where mine were perfectly preserved, his had turned almost black. He noticed this too, and remarked that it was very strange that in all this time there didn't seem to be any sign of corrosion on my silver.\"I must be lucky,\" I replied. But he wasn't. Although the guy certainly knew his way around silver, he didn't seem to know his way around much of anything else, so there was no second date.When I got home, I saw 2 missed calls from Maggie. She had left a voicemail. I'll just paste the transcription here.\"Olivia?\" Let's pretend that's my name. \"It's Maggie. That silver I sold to you. I was wondering if I might have it back? I'll pay you ten times what you gave me for it. I shouldn't have sold it. It's real and all, but it wasn't mine to give. If you could call me back or come in tomorrow, I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement. I’m very sorry about this.\" Just please call me back when you can. It's important. Thanks.\"No. Absolutely not. It was my silver now. I bought it at the price she had asked. It was mine, not hers. Did Maggie only just now see the value of what she had given me? I trusted her. Now here she was trying to take my good fortune away. Such betrayal.Another call came in the next day. Betrayal! And then another. I blocked her number.That night I had a new dream. I was flying far above snow-capped mountains. The air up here was clean. I could breathe. Spreading out below me was everything and everyone I'd ever known and would ever know. This is what the silver could do for me. I could have everything I'd ever wanted. I just had to let go of the tiniest fraction of it.But should I? This treasure was too perfect to let go. Maybe I'd just sell one item and keep the rest for myself. I knew that I would never have such magnificent pieces in my hands ever again if I let them go now.The following day was a Saturday, so I could look forward to doing nothing but snacking and binge-watching another season of Charmed. And that's exactly what I did for about three hours before I was interrupted by a knock on my front door.“I'm not interested!\" I called. The knock came again.\"There is no Jesus Christ in this house! I roll with Satan!\" Surely that would make them go away. But nope. The knock came a third time, and I could hear a familiar voice calling out my name over it. What the fuck? It was Maggie.I jabbed at the pause button on my remote, forced myself out of the recliner, and marched to the front door.\"Do you know what no means?\" I demanded after wrenching it open.\"Olivia,\" Maggie began. \"I'm just here to talk.\" If I hadn't been sleeping well lately, Maggie hadn't been sleeping at all. I could swear that there were more streaks of white through her hair than I'd seen a few days ago.\"I just need to warn you. The silver is dangerous. You should get rid of it as soon as possible.”\"Dangerous?\" I asked incredulously. \"It's a bunch of random silver that's older than you are. It won't bite.\" She was still trying to get it back from me.Maggie frowned. \"You need to understand! The person who sold the silver to me. I looked into his story. Something happened to him. And he wasn't the only one.\"I stifled a laugh. \"Like what? He wanted money? Yeah, that happens sometimes. And then you gave him money. So where's the issue?\" Maggie stiffened.“Can I see it?\" she asked timidly.\"Sure,\" I replied after a moment.I turned around and went back inside. The thought of fetching that box for her didn't even cross my mind. My silver necklaces jingled as I stocked into the kitchen. I searched through the silverware drawer. But it wasn't there. Of course it wasn't. I wheeled around and found the drawer with larger cutting utensils.There it was. A meat cleaver. I grabbed it and walked back. Without hesitating, I pulled open the door and brandished the cleaver at Maggie.\"Go,\" was all I said.\"Olivia.\" Maggie was whispering now. \"The silver is driving you mad!\" A hint of desperation had entered her voice.\"Yeah I'm mad,\" I started. \"Can't a girl watch Charmed in peace?\" Maggie's shoulders slumped.\"Death follows that silver wherever it goes. For your own sake Olivia, destroy it.\" With that, Maggie turned and left me standing alone on my porch, waving a meat cleaver at no one.She could have stayed. Maybe I'd have realized the truth sooner if she had. Then again, maybe not. She had to protect herself too, and looking back, I'm glad that she left.The dreams alternated over the next couple of days. In them, I both saw and felt two different worlds. Two different possibilities. I was destined to fly. And the other people, well, it really wasn't my problem what they were destined for was it?Nights were no longer quite so unpleasant. Yet I still found myself waking early in the morning. The days blurred past. From work to home, from home to work, and from work to home I went. Interspersed through all of that were long stretches of time when I found myself staring into the bed of silver at the bottom of that little box.A hundred little distorted reflections of myself looked back. Then, all at once, they coalesced into one. Those irregularly shaped coins had arranged themselves into a mosaic which reflected a strange and terrible image of myself at me. Although the coins were still uneven and the reflection was distorted in parts, I could see my gaunt face clear as day. There were dark circles beneath my eyes.It was those dreams. All those things I didn't care to think about or understand. They only made me restless. I really needed to see if there was a way to suppress them. No matter. I could surely pay for any help I would need. This realization put my mind at ease.I continued to ponder my newfound wealth as my reflection stared back at me. That is, the reflection of my face along with that of a man standing behind me. My chair fell back as I leaped to my feet and whirled around. There was nothing aside from the wall of my office and the bed where I slept.Then my eyes slid to a clock mounted on the wall. It was well past midnight. But my memories were vague from the time I'd finished dinner and come in here to make a couple of listings on eBay. My computer wasn't even open. Clearly, I needed rest.The man must have realized that time was running short. Because he spoke to me that night. He told me about the mountain that ate men. A place whose original name had long since been forgotten. It had been a place of worship once. Then the hungry ones came, one Diego Huallpa who served them discovered silver, and his masters in their disease and hunger sought to take the mountain's riches instead.Now its only name was Rich Mountain. Over the centuries, men toiled in its belly, and even as they sought to eat the mountain, just to carve a little piece of it out for themselves and their masters, the mountain ate them too. Untold numbers of boys and men were consumed even as the fruits of their labor were carted off on ships to a distant land and the mountain that once stood tall slowly bent under the weight of a thousand hammers and chisels.But the silver was cursed. Everywhere it went, misfortune followed. The hungry ones who condemned their slaves and subjects to death in that mine accumulated so much silver that the metal lost its value, and chaos rained. Like an accident of their own, the hungry ones’ empire crumbled to dust, leaving only remnants in its wake. But the hungry ones had left their former subjects with very little, and so it was that men and boys went back into the mine. By that point, the rich mountain had been so depleted of silver that the people turned to mining tin.Every miner signed a contract with the first strike of his hammer. The earth would allow them all to take some of its bounty, yes, but it would exact a heavy price from any who dared or was forced into such an agreement with it. The little fortune any man gained would be offset by an early end to his life. The only thing to be determined really was if a miner would be killed there and then in the depths of the underworld, or if they would only die later on the surface, when their lungs were so ravaged by those little fine particles that they could no longer breathe.Now the mountain was part of a nation populated by some twelve million people named after a certain celebrated liberator. There was no more corporation, crown  or state to impose on the miners. The mountain was in the hands of the people, on paper. But despite how much the world had progressed, things didn't improve much in the tunnels. Wealth grows with time, but only when one is lucky enough to possess it. Their wealth had been stolen.The mountain was still eating, even in its throes of death. And now foreigners came from far and wide to play pretend at understanding the life of a people born in circumstances alien to them. Through all of this, the silver never disappeared. It was still scattered all over the world, along with all of the greed and loss that had preceded it.Images flashed through my mind. Different people gazed into the box, each with the same gleam in their eye. Then, one by one, they were all killed, and the silver found its way into new hands. The circumstances under which these killings took place were always a little different. But the results were without fail the same. One person would acquire the little box, and another would grow envious. It was only a matter of time before blood was spilled, and the silver changed hands in an endless cycle of violence.The last image to appear to me was a terrified Maggie standing just out of reach of the meat cleaver I'd waved around so carelessly. I had been prepared to kill to protect something that was never mine. And there wasn't much I could say for myself. Really, there wasn't much any of the silver's victims, be they murderers or the murdered, could say for themselves. All the silver had done was awaken something that was already there somewhere deep inside of us.I became aware of myself, of the burning on my neck and fingers. The box was lying still open on my desk. The silver inside it glowed red-hot. I shot to my feet and grabbed the box. I tore out of my office and into the living room. I turned on and opened the fireplace. The box went inside first and began to burn immediately. Then I ripped off my necklaces with such force that the cords cut into the back of my neck as they snapped, and blood flowed down my back. The rings came off more easily. All of it went into the fire.The wooden box was reduced to ashes as I watched. But everything inside remained. Slowly, each piece melted down into globs of molten silver, before those fused together into an amorphous shape. The shape slowly gained more definition until it resolved into a humanoid figure. As I watched, the image of a man holding a hammer and chisel pushed its way out of the figure. It was the man who had spoken to me, and the man whose likeness I'd been wearing in miniature on my neck for days.The metal cooled, and as if knowing its job was done, the fireplace shut off on its own. The miner stepped out. He was covered head to toe in a fine gray dust. The silver no longer glowed; in fact, its entire surface had become tarnished. The miner turned to stare up at me. He didn’t say a word. He didn’t need to. The silver had been kept pristine by the suffering of those who extracted it. But the spirit inside had finally been released, and the silver crumbled to dust before my eyes.For the first time in a long while, I could think with clarity. My curse had been broken. I was no longer enchanted by the blood silver. But the mountain was becoming hollow. The people still worked and died within it for a pittance. Yet all these years later, the hungry ones were still hungry, and all the riches in the world wouldn’t be enough to satiate them.",

      "content_preview": "Let me take you back to early August 2005, maybe the first or 2nd Friday of the month.  My parents, my sister, and I had just started the first day our yearly vacation. If you don’t know of it, there is a small barrier island that hangs off the bottom of Maryland that is a vaguely popular getaway destination. It’s small, with a population of not a lot and can honestly be described as a kind of tourist trap of sorts. To us it was something special, in its own way. I suppose it still is now, even after everything.I still remember us pulling on to the island via the bridge that extends over the channel, hearing the cackling seagulls and the sight of boats bobbing in lazy waters - the heralds of our arrival to a week away from home. The sky was hazy that day with wide, gauze-like expanses of cloud cover. A constant breeze blew in through the truck windows as my parents argued lightly about why the island seemed so empty when we arrived that week.Dad had been saying that folks were probably afraid of the incoming storms or something, joking about those same people missing a great deal on rental homes. I found out later that the prices had plummeted substantially in the weeks leading up to our vacation and there was a lot of availability. Looking back now, I can see the signs of missing cars and less than crowded ice cream parlors. There were still a good number of other people on the island but there was a feeling of emptiness to the place. It made the laughter of the gulls seem all the louder, taking up the silence left by diminished traffic.We had picked up our house key and made our way to our home away from home, the usual course of action. It had some gaudy tourist-trappy name that had been daubed on a signpost at the end of the crushed shell driveway. Of the details I do remember, that isn’t one of them. All of the houses on the island had cheesy names, something to help lure tourists like us in, but it was a beautiful house. For some reason, I imagine it always will be despite whatever happens around it.It was painted in soft yet dark green (or was it grey?) color, making the brilliant white of the trim and railings stick out like veneered teeth across the two stories of the house. Natural, towering fences of hardy trees and ornamental grass separated everything but the backyards from the neighboring houses that stood a healthy distance to either side. It was a far cry from the crowded suburbia where we hailed from. Even then, the playful shouting and stomping of kids across a wooden deck next door could be heard as we stretched cramping legs.Like any other kids of our age, our assistance with unloading the truck lasted probably no more than 10 minutes. It didn’t take much for my sister, Maddy, or I to start darting from room to room to check out our home away from home that week. The spacious rooms, clean and tidy from the housekeepers who had vacated just moments before we arrived, all had the same smell of sand and artificial lemon cleaner. We tore through them, inspecting every cabinet or loudly which room was going to be ours, shouting like junior conquistadors from the 2ndfloor sundeck. Two boys in the backyard next door, imaginary peasants to our equally imagined royalty, had craned their necks up at us from their connected backyard as we drank in our temporary world.And from there we saw the backyard, from between the white posts of the railing. Through the glass double doors below us, past the back deck and down the path leading off of it, was a small pier jutting out past the marshy waters edge. We had never had one close to one of the previous rentals before. Our feet had dashed down the steps, excited pleas babbling to our parents to let us go look. They had let us go out with a tired bemusement on two conditions: that we would come back if it didn’t look safe and to not bring any swampy mud back inside. Most of it was directed to me, since I was older than Maddy by 4 years. We had agreed to those terms with all the eagerness of children who hadn’t listened to a word of it and fled into the hazy sunlight beyond the doors.The air smelled of cut lawns, saltwater, and low tide, all of it carried in a heady mix on the growing breeze. Tiny, choppy waves danced and ebbed into the seagrass that reached up past the edge of dry land. Fiddler crabs had scampered into their burrows our pounding approach across the planks of the pier. It was old but sturdy, salt rime and algae growth marking the heights of the tide on the posts sunk into the earth. There is a certain magic to looking across a body of water to the land beyond, to feel another environment take hold of your senses. Maddy and I had giggled and laughed as we looked down, pointing out the shapes of larger crabs and tiny fish that moved in the murky green-brown waters.It was then that I saw it there from the edge of the pier, maybe twenty or so feet away in the deeper waters to the left. I had to blink against the light shimmering on the surface to make sure it wasn’t just trash someone had dumped off of a boat.“Hey, is that a horse under the water?” the words sound stupid now but what else do you say when you see something like that? It was as if someone had dropped a carousel figure into the water, the general outline hard to mistake for much else. Maddy knew better though. She was a bit of a horse nerd back then, her room at our home sporting a sizeable shrine of books and toys. There were even a couple of shirts that I used to make fun of her for, some of them stowed away in her luggage back at the house.Maddy had stood close to me, getting up on her tiptoes to see before saying, “They don’t have horses here, Mikey. They only have ponies!”“Same difference,” I had mumbled, watching the strange sight before us. It sat there, seemingly grazing on the bottom of the shallow ocean bed, the head low and its form stationary. We couldn’t make much of it from our spot, the waves making it difficult to pick out details as they rolled and rippled. The ocean waters made the painted hide look green and sickly while strange, short spots and streaks decorated its pelt at random. Maddy had raised her hand in a wave and called out in a sing-song voice.“Hi, pony!”It didn’t move or if it did, we couldn’t tell at all.  I had laughed at her, forgetting that I also had been 9 years old once, and was about to tell her how dumb she sounded when someone spoke.“Whatcha looking at?”We had jumped at the voice, seeing two boys approaching us across the planking. Our focus had been solely on the curiosity before us and hadn’t even heard them approach. One was definitely older than me but the other clutched a green teddy bear under one arm as he walked in the shadow of his brother. He couldn't have been much older than Maddy.“There’s a horse- I mean, pony in the water,” I had told them, my words excited at showing off our discovery, “Want to see?”“Is that some kind of game you’re playing?” the older boy asked dismissively as he scratched at a cluster of acne on his face. My jaw tightened with teenage annoyance as he kept speaking, “Want to play tag or try and catch some crabs with us? We found some scoops and shovels under the porch.”“I wanna see a horsey, Henry,” the younger boy had asked meekly, tugging on his brother’s shirt. I had smiled at him and he raised his stuffed animal up to his chest, putting another ward between him and us. Maddy had her back to them, quietly focused on the pony.“It’s not a game,” I said, pointing out to where it was, “There’s something out there.”My olive branch in sharing the oddity in the water withered as Henry’s eyes rolled, perfectly synced with a dramatic huff. Regardless, he walked to the end of the pier with all of the confidence of a teen who knew when they were the oldest one present.“C’mon, David,” he grumbled, letting his brother shuffled behind him. I moved closer to Maddy, giving them space to occupy. It didn’t take long for their eyes to widen in surprise.“Holy hell! You’re not lying! Look at that stupid thing down there,” Henry had said, craning forward to see it better. David bounced on his feet, a grin spreading across his face behind his stuffed animals head. They began to wave and yell at the submerged equine, trying to get its attention. I had winced at both the sudden behavior and knowing how my parents felt about anyone swearing around my sister. These kids were not my kind of friends and I felt regret at even humoring the idea of them joining us in those moments. But I felt something else as I heard something.It was a plaintive whining sound, as if an RC car was held aloft while its tire spun. I knew it by heart and I spun in place. It was one that Maddy made when she was afraid of something. Her eyes were saucers staring out into the water, lip quivering as she continued her sad siren sound.“Mikey,” she started in a whisper, so low that I had to bend close to hear her words pouring out in a panicked rush, “That’s not a pony. Ponies need to breathe air. Why is it breathing water?”We’d been so distracted by the novelty of the idea that we never thought of the very basic requirements of nature. If Maddy’s words had made the warm breeze feel arctic against my skin, then the suddenp-tooshsound of something hitting the water made my blood freeze.Henry had found a stone. It probably was one lodged between the planks of the pier or one he had found fascination with and was simply carrying it around. I imagine it was one that any adolescent boy at would have been happy to find, of good weight and shape – the kind that fits into the curve of your hand. And with the thoughtless idea of cruelty that only children are capable of, he had let it fly towards another creature with no remorse. The water rippled in fading ring mere feet away from the pony, the stone well lost to the depths by the time it moved.It didn’t move like a pony should have. I still don’t know what a pony moving underwater should look like but it wasn’t that. It was too smooth, a soft gliding motion as it propelled itself towards us. Shadowy murk shed itself in degrees and a wake of water crested forward as it reached shallower and shallower ground, foot by slow foot. The arch of a back began to break the surface. Someone gasped in surprise. Maybe it was Maddy or one of the other boys. I don’t think I will ever remember, even it was me. All I recall seeing that thing and how everything was wrong.Bulging, bloated flanks of grease colored white and rotted brown pushed straining ribs against the skin of the creature, the bones rippling the waters surface as it moved. Small spines, not barnacles, dotted the pelt in an irregular pattern like fingers poking through cloth. Its legs were lost in the debris kicked up from the seabed. We should have run but I don’t know what would have happened if we had or if we even could. I now believe we were paralyzed by some combination of awe and animal fear in those moments and that if we had run, something else could have happened – something sudden and awful. Lost in that moment, all we did was look on as it stared back.Maddy had once told me proudly that horses have some of the largest eyes on land, able to see almost in every direction. That is one of those pieces of useless information that has been lodged in the recesses of my brain, a piece of popcorn kernel stuck in a mental gumline. It gives me anything but comfort when I think now of those tumescent globes of sight, fat and ripe with unknowable things, that regarded us as they cleared the surface, raised up by its twisted, stumpy neck. They seemed to fill everything in those moments.Those strange moments are like recalling something while in the throes of a fever. I felt floaty, the world becoming a waxy smear in my mind. Breezy words, or perhaps concepts are a more accurate term for it, weaved through the wind and chuckling lapping of tiny waves as it felt like the pier could drift away from under my feet as those tumescent eyes seemed to fill everything.  I could see that was Maddy drifting forward, a small foot lifting over the edge of the planks. But we all were moving too, heeding that call to… something. I remember the water seeming like an eternity below us and something else. Someone quietly whispering, “hey,” in a long drawn out voice.Everything seemed so slow and it wasn’t until those eyes sunk like twin eclipses into the syrupy waves, that the world caught back up to itself. The whispers became yells, the world becoming sharp and clear again in degrees. I grabbed Maddy, pulling her back as she tilted forward on the foot that was extended over the edge, barely keeping myself from toppling over either. Nobody was able to stop Henry from toppling over into the saltwater. He erupted into shouts as he flailed and sputtered. David wailed at the top of his lungs, strangling the non-existent life from his teddy bear in a death grip.My dad sprinted across the yard, sunglasses bouncing off of his head. He continued shouting, his words growing clearer by the moment in my ears. I don’t think I know the last time I had seen him run or in a panic before then. I don’t think a lot of kids realize how bad things are until they see a parent run like that. He had charged down the walkway and splashed into the water, grabbing the floundering boy and guiding him back to firmer ground as his own shoes sank into muck. My heart had leapt into my throat when he had done that, fearing that he was so close to the thing that had been calling to us.But when I looked there was no sign of the pony, just a scattering of sea foam and rippling water.With Henry back on firmer land, the two other boys had run back to their home at a tear. Their mother emerged shortly after, screeching like a banshee at my parents and us. It didn’t take long to figure out that they blamed my sister and I for what happened, regardless of what we had collectively seen. Thanks to mom’s more level-headed approach, my parents eventually calmed everything down to an easy to overhear argument. A resolution was reached, probably taking the mutual agreement that neither family interact with each other anymore during our respective stays. Whatever it was, I’ve never been able to find out. I never saw any of them again after that.We received a good scolding of our own once everything was said and done. Dad said he saw us looking like we were about to step off of the pier and into the water. As he regaled us with the dangers of the ocean, it occurred to me that I don’t think he saw the “pony” in full or at all. Maybe it was the fearful focus of a parent witnessing children do something dangerous or perhaps an unwillingness to admit to seeing something hard to reconcile but he shut me down whenever I tried to tell him about what we had seen. Mom took his side, having seen nothing more than dad run into the marshy waters. We weren’t punished, just told that we would be missing out on pizza that day and were given a warning about doing “childish stunts like that ever again”. Not that it mattered. Maddy and I both avoided the water for the rest of our stay. I still do now, all these years later.During all of this, Maddy hadn’t said anything at all and took the scolding in silence. I am fairly certain that she didn’t listen to any of it. She had instead stared off past my parents to the waterfront, never taking her eyes off of it. I think she knew that it wasn’t going to be the last time we saw that thing. And I hate how right she was.",

      "content_preview": "Hey y'all! I was trying to remember some good stories for y'all, a lot of the best ones are still under investigation, and remembered the first time I encountered a mimic. Nasty fuckers that, imo, should be wiped of the face of the earth.It was my second or third year at the reservation so I had a little bit of experience under my belt. It was a particularly cold winter that year, and I remember most of the guys had gone home for the holidays. I decided to stay on the trail to get some overtime. (The pay is incredible with overtime and holiday pay) I went on a standard circuit and was almost finished with it when I heard what sounded like a woman crying. I, as most of us, always heard the stories about people being lured away into the woods by what sounds like an injured woman, just to be jumped by a demon thing. However, my job was to go out looking for people and helping them get back to safety if they needed help. So I started off towards the direction of the sound.I followed the sound for probably 300 yards off the circuit. I was very very much considering just saying \"Fuck this shit, I'm out\" and hightailing it back to the circuit and finishing up for the day, but my curiosity and the pain I heard in the woman's voice drew me further into the woods. This part of the reservation is very thick with trees. These ancient oak and walnut trees that are much larger than most would think these species could get to. Turns out when you leave a forest to grow for a couple centuries without harvesting a single tree, these things get massive. The largest tree on the reserve is a truly colossal oak that, from what the scientist on the reserve can tell, is over 700 years old. All this to say, it was dark and very wooded.The cold didn't help the feeling that this was a horrible idea. Like I said it was an extremely cold winter around the middle of December. Ice cycles hung from the branches of the ancient trees, occasionally falling and shattering, as I went through the woods. Mind you, they weren't falling near me. (most of them) I could hear them crashing into the snow or lower branches off in the distance. My assumption at the time was that they had just gotten too heavy for the branches to hold them, but now I know better.I finally came up to a camp site that was NOT on our maps as one of the usual sites that trespasses you. This isn't uncommon. Dumb teenagers from around the area or tourists will make new camp sites in random places in the woods. Standard procedure for finding one of them is to mark them on your map and report to higher command. Of course telling whoever made the site to kick rocks. This site looked to be recently abandoned. There was no sign of anyone there, and the crying had ceased; the last time I heard it was about 10 yards before I found the clearing with the site. It appeared that a fire had been lit, but it was going out now. There were two tents set up near enough to the fire that they'd be warmed by it, but not near enough that it would be a fire hazard. I looked in and around the tents; strangely there was no sign that either of them had been used. No blankets, bags, electronics, or any personal items. It was as if someone had come out to the middle of the woods, set up a camp site, lit a fire and vanished into the woods again.I noticed there was what looked to be a trail leading away from the camp site. I saw footprints in the snow following the trail. They were small footprints of someone who was barefoot. Cautiously I followed the trail to the mouth of a small cave on the side of the hill. It looked like the cave had been dug out of the hill by hand. I don't mean by hand held tools. It looked like someone had painstakingly dug out a hole in the side of the hill with their bare hands. There were little trail marks in the sides that looked like fingernails had scraped them out. Inside the cave I saw what looked like four or five short, pale humanoid creatures. They didn't look human, however. Their limbs were misshapen, and it looked like they were shifting lengths as I watched them.After I'd taken a good look at the creatures, I decided to get the hell out of there. I tried to sneak away as carefully and quietly as I could back to the camp site, and from there retrace my steps back to where I'd left off on my circuit. About half way back to my circuit something fell on me from a tree branch. I fell to the ground and scrambled to throw whatever it was off me. I was a wrestler in high school so I knew how to get someone off my back, and the thing that had dropped on me was much smaller than I was at the time. I was able to get it off of me and pinned it to the ground with my knee on its chest. I saw a misshapen, small humanoid just like the ones in the cave. It was squirming trying to get me off of it, but I had probably 100 lb on it. Its face was gaunt, skin hanging off its skull like clothing rather than skin. As I watched, its face shifted and morphed disgustingly into something that resembled my face. It wasn't a perfect match, far from it, but it was close enough I could tell what it was trying to do. I decided that I wasn't going to give this thing another chance to get the jump on me. I pulled out my knife to slit its throat. It knew what I was trying to do and fought even harder to get me off of it. It ended up getting a few good scratches on my face and neck, but nothing to be too concerned about before I drove the knife into its throat, yanking it back and forth, sawing through it.Once I was satisfied the thing was dead, I got up and sprinted back to where I'd left off on my circuit. I didn't think about trying to complete it. I just made my way through the woods in the straightest path possible to the office. When I got to the door of the office, I slammed it open, hurried inside and slammed it shut, holding it shut with my body. \"Why the hell did no one tell me we have fucking mimics on the reservation!?!?\" I shouted into the room at no one in particular.\"Mimics?\" Anderson said confused.González looked up from the book he'd been reading, \"Mimics? As in something that can turn into something else?\" His tone was concerned.\"Yes! Fucking mimics, I was attacked by one in the woods!\"\"Fuck I though we'd wiped their nest out...\" González muttered. \"Alright Anderson, I'm going to go out with Warren to the area that he was attacked by the mimics and we're going to attempt to wipe out any nests they made.\"\"Hold the fuck on. Mimics... we have mimics in the woods\" Anderson seemed shocked and confused, a fair reaction. Seemed he didn't know about this either even though he'd been at the reservation for three years before I'd joined on.\"Yes, mimics. They're nasty fuckers and we need to wipe them out before they spread too far.\"I, as you could imagine, was pretty pissed off that I wasn't told about these things before, but that's kinda how things worked on the reservation. You found out about creatures from experiencing them. For the majority of the creatures on the reserve, you'd find out about them during your first year there, when you always went out with a more experienced ranger.I grabbed a shotgun from one of the gun lockers, a Mossberg 590 12 gauge 20\" barrel. González grabbed one as well, and we headed back up my circuit the opposite direction that I'd come from to reach the point that I'd found the camp site. It was a silent walk back. The only sound, the snow crunching under foot. We came to the point where I went into the woods to find the woman. \"Oh shit I never found her...\"González looked at me confused. \"Found who?\"\"There was a woman crying in the woods. That's what drew me off the circuit.\"\"Kid that was probably one of the mimics. They were trying to pull you further into the woods so they could kill you and learn your form.\" González said. Putting a hand on my shoulder. \"Now lets find these things and end them.\"We went down the same way I'd gone before, coming across the body of the one I'd already killed. González nodded at me approvingly, and we continued into the woods. We snuck upon the camp site, trying to be as quiet as possible. It was exactly how I'd left it before. The only difference being the fire was completely out now. I showed González the small trail that led to the mouth of the makeshift cave. We crept to the entrance of the cave. \"Alright son, let's do this quick so we can get out of the cold. These things aren't hard to kill, but if they get too abundant they'll become a problem. How many did you see?\" González said in a whisper.\"I saw four or five.\" I replied as quietly as possible.González nodded. He held up one hand counting down from 3, 2, 1. When he finished the count we rounded the corner and faced the entrance of the cave. There were four mimics in the cave, crouching around two bodies that were half eaten. 12 gauge buck shot rips through a deer extremely well. It's rips through humans even better than that. For the mimics, it practically turned the parts of their bodies that got hit into red sludge. These ones were extremely frail and small. It only took one shot from one of us to dispatch them.Once we were satisfied that they were dead, we walked into the cave. It wasn't too dark, but we both turned on the flashlights that were hooked up to our shotguns, still aware that more could be in here. Once we'd swept the entire cave, it was pretty small. We looked over the bodies that the mimics had dragged in here. We found ID's on both of them. I'm not going to put who they were for obvious reasons, but they weren't locals. It appeared they'd come in from out of state. González burned the bodies of the mimics in the cave. He asked me to carry the one I'd stabbed in the woods in there as well to make sure they could be taken care of all at once.We managed to find the belongings of the two people a little bit into the woods from the opposite direction that we'd come. We used the sleeping bags to wrap the bodies and drag them back to the office so they could be collected by the proper authorities. Once that was handled, González explained to me and Anderson that he and a few of the other older rangers had cleared out a mimic nest about a decade back. Clearly they'd missed one or two of them, and that's how we got to this situation. Anderson and I knew better than to ask too many questions about the previous incident. If you needed to know something you'd be told, but most of the things about the reservation are things that you'd prefer not to know if you didn't have to. I know it's ironic to say that since I'm documenting the events that took place here, but I'm pretty sure y'all have read or experienced worse.Anyway, I hope everyone has a wonderful day. I've got to get back the paper work I was neglecting by writing this down. Newbies this year are finding more and more idiots out in the woods so I have to do more paper work to document it all for our records.",

      "content_preview": "I took the night security job at Mount Green University's Spring Hill Campus because I needed the money. Simple as that. The pay was decent, the hours worked with my class schedule, and how hard could it be watching over a few farm animals and a weather station?I should have known something was off when they spent more time on the \"rules\" than actual job training.Spring Hill Campus isn't like the main university. It's about twenty miles outside town, just the veterinary program's practical facilities - a few buildings, some pastures, stables, and that weather station sitting alone in the middle of a field. Across the street sits Mount Green Corrections, a medium-security prison that's been there since the 70s. The whole area feels isolated, especially at night.My supervisor, Jane, was a no-nonsense woman in her mid-forties who'd worked campus security for six years. On my first day, she handed me a laminated card and told me to memorize it.\"These aren't suggestions,\" she said, watching me read. \"Follow every single one, every single night. No exceptions.\"The rules were:NIGHT SECURITY PROTOCOLS - SPRING HILL CAMPUSAlways keep your radio on channel 2. If you come across a life or death situation, switch to channel 4.The campus currently has six pigs, three horses, and three cows. Always do a head count during evening rounds.Always lock the gate to the weather station.There is no scarecrow in the weather station field. Go inside immediately if you see one.All animals are to be inside by 9pm. If you hear any animals outside after this time, ignore them.Do not take the dirt road from the weather station to the stables anytime after 11pm. Stick to the path with the lamps.If you hear a window break near the stables, immediately recount the animals.DO NOT use the bathroom next to the stables. You are not safe there.If you think that one of the animals escaped somehow, leave it. It's probably not one of ours. Rule 6 applies here as well.Our horses love alfalfa treats. Feel free to give them one per night! If they don't eat them, immediately lock yourself in the security office.\"What's with rule 4?\" I asked. \"Why would there be a scarecrow?\"Jane's expression didn't change. \"There wouldn't be. That's the point.\"\"And rule 8? What's wrong with the bathroom?\"\"Just follow the rules, Marcus. They exist for good reasons.\"I wanted to ask more questions, but something in her tone told me the conversation was over.My first night started quietly enough. I arrived at 10pm, did the evening walkthrough Jane had shown me, and settled into the small security office in the main building. The horses - Titus, Belle, and Daisy - were happy to see me and eagerly accepted their alfalfa treats. Good sign, according to rule 10.At 11:30pm, I started my rounds. First stop: livestock count. Six pigs snoring in their pen, three horses drowsing in their stalls, three cows chewing cud. All accounted for.Next was the weather station. It sat about 200 meters from the main buildings, surrounded by a chain-link fence in the middle of an open field. As I approached, my flashlight beam caught something that made my stomach drop.The gate was standing wide open.I stopped walking, suddenly very aware of how dark it was outside the small pool of light from my flashlight. Rule 3 was clear: always lock the gate. But it was already open, which meant either someone else had been here, or...I swept my flashlight across the field beyond the weather station, and that's when I saw it.A dark shape stood motionless about fifty yards into the field. Tall, thin, arms outstretched. Even from a distance, I could tell it wasn't quite right - too tall, too still, positioned at an odd angle.Rule 4 flashed through my mind:There is no scarecrow in the weather station field. Go inside immediately if you see one.My hands started shaking. I fumbled for my radio, but what would I say? \"Hey, there's a fake scarecrow in the field like you said there might be?\" That sounded insane even to me.The shape hadn't moved, but I wasn't taking any chances. I backed away from the weather station, keeping my flashlight trained on the figure. It looked almost human from this angle, like someone standing with their arms spread wide. But the proportions were wrong somehow.As I retreated, I realized I was heading toward the stables. The main building felt too far away, and I was starting to panic. Rule 8 said not to use the bathroom next to the stables, but surely hiding there for a few minutes was better than standing exposed in the open?I made it to the stable building and found the small bathroom attached to the outside wall. The door was tucked into a shadowy alcove, partially hidden from view. I slipped inside and locked the door behind me.Inside, I tried to steady my breathing. The room was cramped, with a small window that looked out toward the pasture. I pulled out my phone to call Jane, but there was no signal. Of course.That's when I heard the footsteps outside.Slow, deliberate, circling the building. Too heavy to be human, but with a strange, uneven gait. I crouched low beside the window and carefully peered out from the corner, staying in the shadows.What I saw made my blood freeze.A creature moved across the open ground near the stables, and it wasn't human. It stood upright like a person, but too tall - maybe seven feet - with a lean, muscular frame covered in dark fur. Its head was elongated, wolf-like but eerily uncanny, with ears that were too large and positioned far too low on its head. In the moonlight, I could see its eyes reflecting light as it turned its head, scanning the area.The thing moved with a strange, loping gait, sometimes dropping to all fours before rising again to its full height. It was clearly searching for something - for me, I realized with growing horror.It approached the window, and I pressed myself against the wall, heart hammering. From my position in the corner, I could see it but remain hidden in the shadows. The creature's snout had pressed against the glass, threatening to shatter it. I could see sickly, large red and yellow eyes darting around, but finding nothing. Its mouth hung open, revealing rows of sharp teeth that caught the light.The thing tilted its head, studying the window with an intelligence that terrified me. It raised one clawed hand and tapped gently on the glass.Tap. Tap. Tap.I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. The creature's mouth moved, and I heard muffled sounds through the glass - it was trying to mimic human speech, though the words were distorted and wrong.Then sirens started wailing from across the street.The thing's head snapped toward the sound, and in an instant, it was gone. I heard rapid footsteps - multiple sets - moving away from the building toward the road. Through the window, I could see searchlights sweeping the area around Mount Green Corrections.I didn't waste time wondering what was happening at the prison. I burst out of the bathroom and ran for the main building, not stopping until I was inside the security office with every door locked.I spent the rest of my shift in that office, jumping at every sound. When Jane arrived at 6am to relieve me, I was still clutching my flashlight.\"Everything okay?\" she asked, though her tone suggested she already knew the answer.\"The weather station gate was open,\" I managed to spit out. \"And there was... something in the field.\"She went to the window and lit a cigarette. \"Did you follow the rules?\"\"Mostly. I used the bathroom by the stables.\"Her face darkened. \"Max, that rule exists for a reason. That bathroom has a window. Windows aren't safe after dark here.\"\"What the hell is going on? Whatarethose things?\"She was quiet for a long moment. Finally, she said, \"Get some rest. You'll be back tonight?\"\"I... I don't know.\"\"The job pays well for a reason. Think about it.\"As I drove home, I kept checking my mirrors. I needed the money - student loans weren't going to pay themselves. But did I need it badly enough to go back?By 9pm, I was putting on my uniform again.I told myself it was just the money. But deep down, I knew I had to understand what I'd seen. What were those things? How long had they been there? And why did Jane seem unfazed by everything I'd told her?Tonight, I'd be more careful. I'd follow every rule exactly.What could go wrong?",

      "content_preview": "The world is a different place at 3 AM. It’s quiet. The city holds its breath, and the only sounds are the hum of your own engine and the lonely sigh of a distant train. I know this world better than I know the world of the sun. For the last two years, it’s been my office. I’m a rideshare driver, and I work the dead hours, from midnight to 6 AM. The hours when the city sleeps and the weirdness comes out to play.Mostly, it’s a grind. A few airport runs for red-eye flights. A couple of tired nurses or factory workers getting off a late shift. The money is barely enough to cover my rent and the ever-increasing cost of just existing. It's a life of constant financial anxiety, of checking your bank balance and feeling that familiar, cold knot in your stomach. But it’s a job, nA few months ago, the app I drive for offered me an upgrade. An invitation to their “VIP Navigator” program. The email was full of the usual corporate buzzwords: “enhanced earning opportunities,” “exclusive clientele,” “premium service tier.” It promised a way out of the grind. All I had to do was maintain a high rating and opt-in. I clicked the link. It took me to a long, dense page of terms and conditions, a wall of text in a tiny font. I did what everyone does. I scrolled to the bottom, ticked the little box, and clicked “I Agree” without reading a single word. I just wanted more money. I had no idea what I was actually agreeing to.For a couple of weeks, nothing changed. I was starting to think it was just another empty corporate promise. Then, the first VIP request came through.It was 2:15 AM on a Tuesday. The request pinged with a different, softer chime. The pickup was a standard downtown hotel. The destination was an address on the far, far outskirts of town, a street name I’d never even seen before. The fare estimate was… significant. More than I usually make in half a night. I accepted instantly, a jolt of excitement cutting through my usual late-night fatigue.A man in a crisp, dark suit was waiting under the hotel awning. He looked completely normal, if a little tired, like a businessman who’d just gotten off a long flight. He got into the back seat, gave me a polite, curt nod, and said nothing. I confirmed the destination, he grunted in affirmation, and we were off. I followed the app’s GPS, my car a silent little bubble moving through the empty, sleeping city.Halfway there, as we were cruising down the main highway that leads out of the city, the app chimed.New route suggested. 10 minutes faster.This was normal. The app often rerouted for traffic or accidents, though there was zero traffic at this hour. The new route directed me off the highway and onto a series of dark, winding back roads. I glanced in the rearview mirror. The passenger was just sitting there, a silhouette in the back seat, staring out the window. But something felt different about him. The shadows in the back of the car seemed deeper around him, darker, as if he were absorbing the faint light from the dashboard. And for a split second, as we passed under a lone streetlight, I could have sworn his eyes flashed, a brief, faint glint of something that wasn't a reflection. I blinked, and it was gone. Just a tired man in a suit. I told myself I was just tired, too. Trust the tech, I thought.The roads became more and more desolate. The houses gave way to fields, the fields to dense, black woods. The streetlights disappeared completely. My headlights cut a lonely tunnel through an oppressive, absolute darkness. Finally, the pleasant, robotic voice of the GPS announced, “You have arrived.”I stopped the car. We were in the middle of a dark, empty field. There was no house, no driveway, no landmark of any kind. Just tall grass swaying in the night wind and the endless, silent trees.A cold knot of unease tightened in my stomach. “Uh, sir?” I said, turning in my seat. “This is the spot. There’s… nothing here.”He turned his head slowly. He was smiling. It was a calm, placid, empty smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Thank you,” he said, his voice smooth and even. “This is perfect.”He got out of the car, closed the door gently, and without another word, he walked off into the darkness, disappearing into the tall grass as if the field had swallowed him whole. I watched until I couldn't see him anymore. I sat there for a full minute, my heart pounding, before the app pinged again.Ride complete.The payment came through. The fare was exactly what was estimated. And then, another notification.Your passenger has added a tip.A massive one. A tip that was three times the cost of the fare itself.I drove home that night with a sense of profound, chilling strangeness, but also with a wallet that was substantially fatter. I told myself it was just a weirdo. A guy meeting someone for a shady deal, or just a rich eccentric who liked being dropped off in fields. The money made it easy to rationalize. It made the weirdness a feature, not a bug.But then it kept happening. The rides became a strange, terrifying, and incredibly lucrative new routine.A week later, I got a ping from the old wharf district. The pickup was at the end of a long, foggy pier. The air tasted of salt and decay, and the only sound was the black water lapping against the rotting pylons below. A woman was waiting, a lone figure at the end of the pier. She was beautiful, dressed in a long, dark coat, but as she approached the car, she moved with a strange, fluid grace, almost like she didn’t have a skeleton. She flowed into the back seat. The reroute came almost immediately, taking us away from the city and towards an industrial wasteland of abandoned canneries and rusting warehouses. I glanced in the rearview mirror as she shifted in her seat. For a split second, under the dim interior light, her skin seemed to… ripple. It wasn’t a trick of the light. It was like watching a badly rendered special effect, a digital texture struggling to stay mapped onto an object. I snapped my eyes back to the road, my hands gripping the steering wheel. The drop-off was in front of a massive, derelict factory, its windows like a thousand empty, black eyes. She got out with that same watery grace, and vanished into the shadows of the building. The tip was, once again, obscene.A few nights after that, I was sent to a quiet, dead-end street in a wealthy suburb. The houses were all dark. A young man was waiting under a streetlight. He seemed agitated, constantly fidgeting. He got into the car with an awkward haste, and I immediately noticed a long, thick lump under the back of his coat, right at the base of his spine. My first thought was a weapon. But the shape was wrong. It was too long, too flexible. As he settled into the seat, it… moved. A distinct, serpentine twitch. It was a tail. He felt me see it, I think. He froze, then tried to adjust his coat with a pained, embarrassed expression. The entire ride, he sat rigid, his shame and my terror creating a thick, unbearable silence in the car. The app took us to the dead center of a massive, old bridge that spanned a dry, rocky riverbed. He got out, gave me a look that was a strange mix of a warning and a shared, cursed secret, and then walked to the railing and just stood there, looking down. I didn't stay to watch.The weirdest was the young girl. The pickup was a university library, just after midnight. She couldn’t have been more than nineteen. She got into the back and didn’t say a single word. She just sat there, smiling at me in the rearview mirror. It was a wide, constant, unblinking smile. As we passed under a streetlight, the light flashed across her face, and I saw her teeth. They weren’t fangs, not like a vampire in a movie. But every single tooth, from incisor to molar, was honed to a perfect, carnivorous point, like a mouthful of tiny, white daggers. She knew I’d seen them. Her smile widened, a silent, gleeful threat. The app led us to the gates of an old, long-abandoned asylum on a hill overlooking the city. She got out, and just stood by the gate as I drove away, her smile the last thing I saw in my mirror.I was making incredible money. More than I had ever dreamed of. I was paying my bills, saving, finally getting ahead. But the unease was growing into a constant, low-grade terror. I was a ferryman, a chauffeur for… something else. And the car wasn't entirely mine anymore.I found that out the hard way. One night, I had another silent man in the back, the kind whose presence felt like a block of ice. The app tried to reroute me down a dark, unpaved service road into the woods. I’d had enough. My nerves were shot. I ignored it. I stayed on the brightly lit main road.The car’s electronics began to fail.The radio, which had been off, burst to life with a deafening shriek of pure, white static. The headlights flickered, then died completely, plunging us into absolute darkness on the highway. The engine began to sputter, to cough, the car lurching and slowing. I pumped the gas pedal, but it was useless. The car was dying.From the back seat, a low, calm voice spoke for the first time. “I really wouldn’t do that if I were you.”I looked in the rearview mirror. The man was leaning forward, his face obscured by the total darkness. “The chosen road is always the safest path,” he said, his voice a smooth, cold whisper. “Straying from it can lead to… unexpected destinations. Unpleasant ones. For both of us.”A cold sweat broke out on my skin. I wrenched the steering wheel, turning the dying car back towards the turn-off for the service road. The moment my tires hit the dirt, the engine roared back to life. The headlights snapped on at full brightness. The static from the radio cut out. The car was fine. I was no longer in control.I made the turn. I completed the ride. I took the money. But something inside me had broken.I had to know. I couldn’t live with the not-knowing anymore.Last week, I got a request. A young woman, picked up from a downtown bar. The ride was the usual routine. The reroute, the silent journey, the drop-off at an abandoned, graffiti-covered factory. The huge tip. But this time, I had a plan. I had her name from the app.When I got home, my hands shaking, I typed her name into a social media search bar.Her profile popped up immediately. It was her. Same smiling face, same haircut. Her profile was public. I scrolled through her photos. There she was, in a picture posted just an hour before I had picked her up. She was at the bar, laughing with friends, a drink in her hand. The caption read, “Girls’ night! So good to be out!”I felt a moment of relief. She was a normal person. A real person. Maybe this was all just some elaborate, weird, urban exploration game for rich eccentrics.Then I scrolled further down her profile. And my world fell out from under me.The post directly below the picture from the bar was from her sister. It was dated the next day. But the year was five years ago. It was a memorial post. A collage of her smiling pictures, with a long, heartbreaking caption.“Can’t believe it’s been five years since we lost you. I still think about you every day. That night, after you left the bar… I wish you had just taken a cab home. I wish that drunk driver hadn’t run that red light. We miss you so much.”I stared at the screen, at the smiling face of the woman I had just dropped off at an abandoned factory, and at the memorial post mourning her death in a car accident five years ago.My mind shattered. The pieces clicked into a place I had refused to let them go, if she was dead, what about the others? The woman with the rippling skin? The man with the tail? The girl with the sharp teeth? Were they ghosts, too? Or were they something else entirely? Things from a place even darker than the grave, using my car, my app, as their own private taxi service between worlds?The money. It suddenly felt filthy. Tainted. It was the price of my silence, my complicity. I had to get rid of it. I had to sever my connection to this… this whole thing.The next morning, I went to my bank. I walked up to the ATM, my heart pounding. I was going to withdraw every single cent I had earned from these rides and donate it to a charity. Just get it away from me.I put my card in, entered my PIN, and selected “Check Balance.”I stared at the screen. My checking account. My savings account. They were both nearly empty. The same meager balance I’d had three months ago, before the VIP program had started.This was wrong. There should have been tens of thousands of dollars in there. I took my card and went inside, to a human teller. I explained the situation. She typed my details into her computer, a confused frown on her face.“Sir,” she said, turning the monitor towards me. “There are no large deposits on your account. The transaction history is just your regular paycheck and your usual small rideshare payouts. There’s no record of these ‘tips’ you’re talking about.”I rushed home, my mind a screaming wreck. I pulled up the driver app on my phone. I went to my earnings history.It was all gone. Weeks and weeks of VIP rides, of massive fares and obscene tips… they had been wiped clean. The app showed no record of them ever happening. It was as if I had imagined the whole thing.But I knew I hadn't. I knew what I had done. I had broken the rules. I had looked behind the curtain. I had read the terms and conditions the hard way.Don’t ask questions. Don’t get curious. Just drive.My payment wasn't money. My payment was my ignorance. And the moment I gave that up, they took the money back.The VIP rides stopped after that. Completely. The app went back to normal, feeding me the occasional, low-paying airport run. The silence in my car at night was no longer peaceful. It was heavy, expectant. I was back to being broke, but now I was broke and haunted.Yesterday, I came home from a long, unprofitable night of driving, and I found an envelope had been slipped under my apartment door. There was no stamp, no address. Just a single, folded piece of high-quality, cream-colored paper.I opened it. The text was printed in a crisp, clean, corporate font.NOTICE OF SERVICE TIER REASSIGNMENTDear Navigator,It has come to our attention that your activity has been in violation of the terms agreed upon in the VIP Navigator User Agreement, Section 7, Subsection C: “Discretion and Non-Disclosure.” All accrued premium incentives have been forfeited as per the contract.Your account has been returned to Standard Service Tier, effective immediately.We thank you for your service.And that was it. A corporate memo from hell. A pink slip from the underworld.I don’t know what to do. I’m trapped. I’m back in my old, desperate life, but now I know what the silence of the city at night really holds. I know what kind of passengers are waiting on those dark street corners. And I know there’s a secret, hidden transit system moving all around us, operating on rules I can’t begin to comprehend.I broke my contract. They took my money. But I can’t shake the feeling that they didn't take everything they were owed. I feel like I’m still on their books. And I’m terrified that one day, I’m going to get a ride request. Not as a driver. But as a passenger. And the drop-off will be somewhere dark, and desolate, and final.",

      "content_preview": "I’ve always believed certain places absorb energy. Not just haunted castles or graveyards, but places where a lot of people pass through—airports, train stations… hotels. Especially hotel rooms.See, I used to work night security at one of the poshest hotels in Dublin City. Five stars, marble floors, high-end clientele. That kind of place. You’d think nothing dark could touch it. But let me tell you, money doesn't stop the weird shit from creeping in.It started around 2:17 AM. I remember because I was mid-yawn, flipping through the camera feeds, when the front desk patched a call through to security.A man’s voice. Panicked. Breathless.“My wife’s in the bath. I think she’s not breathing.”I snapped upright. Me and this other guard, Mark, rushed to Room 237 on the 8th floor. The hallway was dead quiet. The kind of quiet that feels wrong, like the building itself is holding its breath.We pushed in. The guy was pacing around, soaked from the waist down. The bathroom door was wide open. I’ll never unsee that moment.She was in the tub, completely still. Water up to her shoulders. Eyes open, but not seeing.We dragged her out. Tried CPR. I was counting compressions under my breath while Mark gave breaths. Her skin was cold. Like—not just chilly—cold, like touching stone. I knew it was too late, but we had to try.Police arrived within minutes. The moment they stepped in, they told us to stop. One of the officers pulled me aside and said quietly, “She’s been gone a while. A couple hours, at least.”The husband told them they’d argued earlier. He stormed out, came back, saw her in the bath, assumed she was just soaking, and went to bed. Said he only got suspicious when she didn’t join him.No obvious signs of violence. No water overflow. No witnesses. They couldn’t charge him. But between us—staff, cops, even the paramedics—we all felt it. That gut pull. Thatsomething’s offfeeling.He checked out the next morning. Quiet. Calm. Not a single tear.Room 237 was locked off for three weeks.Housekeeping deep-cleaned every inch. Management said, “Accidents happen. Life moves on.” They reopened the room like nothing happened. No priest. No sage. Nothing. Just fresh linens and a new bar of soap.The first person to stay in that room after the death was this woman named Liz. She was a regular—corporate client, stayed at least once a month. She always asked for a high-floor room. She got 237 without knowing a damn thing.Next morning, 6:50 AM, she’s at the front desk with her suitcase and this look like she’d seen hell.I was walking past when she said, loud enough for guests to hear, “That room is haunted. I didn’t sleep a second. Something’swrongwith it.”She said she kept hearing dripping water all night. Not just from the bathroom—like it was coming from thewalls. At 3 AM, the taps in the bathtub turned on by themselves. Full blast. She walked in and turned them off, soaked her slippers. Then, five minutes later, the shower started. She swore she hadn’t touched anything.She said she kept smelling something… floral. Like old roses, but rotten. Like death wearing perfume.We offered her another room. She refused. Said she was checking out for good. Never came back.After that, Room 237 got a reputation—internally.Guests kept requesting room changes after one night. Some didn’t even last that long.There was this German businessman who called at 1:03 AM, whispering like he didn’t want someone to hear: “I think someone is in my bathroom.”I asked if he saw anything.“No,” he said, “but someone is coughing. A wet cough.”I went up. Bathroom was empty. But the floor was damp. Towels crumpled in the corner. The toilet had been used—seat up, water moving like it had just flushed. The guy hadn’t gone in all night. He checked out the next morning without breakfast.A honeymoon couple stayed there once. The woman came down at 4:12 AM in her pajamas, crying. She said she saw a pale woman standing at the foot of the bed. Dripping wet. Not moving. Just… staring.Her husband didn’t see anything, but he confirmed the room temperature droppedten degreesin minutes.I checked the thermostat. It was set to 23°C. The room was at 14.No windows were open.I started dreading that room.Even walking past it gave me this tightness in my chest. Like I was being watched. I’d make rounds and literally speed-walk past it.Once, I was reviewing CCTV around 2:20 AM—same time the original call had come in—and I saw something weird. The hallway camera outside 237 glitched. Just for a second.But when I paused the footage and zoomed in… there was a shadow. Not a person. A shape. Just outside the door. Like someone was standing there, pressed against it.I replayed it a hundred times. Mark saw it too. “It’s probably compression error,” he said.But his voice shook when he said it.Management refused to shut the room.They said we’d get sued if we told guests. “Unless you see something tangible, it's superstition.” So we kept assigning the room. But we started calling itThe Bathtub Roombehind closed doors.The cleaners hated it. They’d go in pairs. Even when nothing moved, the mirror always fogged up on its own. Once, one of the maids, Rosa, swore she saw the words“Don’t leave me”written in the steam. But when she called her coworker over, it vanished.Guests who stayed more than one night? Always complained of water sounds. Dripping. Running. Gurgling. Sometimes crying. One guy swore his sheets were damp every morning. Like someone had gotten in the bed wet.Then came the worst night. 3:08 AM. We get a call from Room 237. The guest was an old man, solo traveler. Very logical, very composed. He said, “Someone knocked on my bathroom door from the inside. Not once.Three times.”I sprinted up. When I opened the door, the room was empty.But the lights in the bathroom were flickering. Not just flickering—buzzing. And the bathtub faucet was trickling. Just enough to hear.That’s when I noticed it.There was water. Not just in the tub. It was on the floor. In a straight line. Like footprints. Leading from the bath… to the bed.But no one had walked. No one had opened the door.I put in my resignation a week later.Mark lasted a month more. He said he heard a woman humming in the elevator when he was alone. Hummed the same tune for three floors. When the doors opened, no one was there.Room 237 is still open, as far as I know.They just keep painting over the mold and turning the mattress.But something lives there now. Or maybe something never left.Not every hotel room starts off haunted.Some of thembecomehaunted.And I was there when it happened.",

      "content_preview": "I don’t know exactly what it is, but I am certain I am not alone. I don’t know how it got in; I locked all my doors, and my windows are shut. I ALWAYS check that before going to bed. So, logically, I should be the only one here. But I’m not. I'm certain I’m not.And it’s not my dog. He’s right beside me, asleep. Like I was just a few minutes ago. But something woke me up. It wasn’t a sound but a feeling. Am I still asleep? Is this sleep paralysis? No… I can move. I sat up in my bed. I am wide awake and alert. But I don’t know what has alerted me.All I know is that it’s not nothing. There is something in here. Some \"thing\". But I can’t see it. The light switch is right there. I could flip it easily. But I’m frozen. My entire attention is consumed by what is in front of me. But all I see in front of me is darkness. Emptiness. A void. I’m not usually scared of the dark. Well, not more than anyone else, I’d say. So is it the dark that I am afraid of now? No, there’s something IN the dark. Waiting.Do I see eyes? Eyes staring back at me? Do I see teeth patiently waiting for me to close my eyes again, to strike when I’m most vulnerable? Do I hear the breath of something sinister? Does it smell wrong in here? I am scanning all my senses for any kind of evidence to justify this feeling. And I’m coming back with nothing. So I should feel safe. But I don’t.I want to call out to it. But what then? I have no weapon on me. I know I should have kept a knife or a gun or a bat or a flashlight or… anything. For nights like this. And maybe there have been nights like this where nothing has happened and there was nothing in the dark except my own creations. But this time feels different. I don’t THINK there’s something there. I KNOW there’s something there.I’m trying to explain it to myself, but I keep coming up short. I know I’m not making sense. Half of me thinks I’m wrong, but the other half knows I’m right. And knowing is stronger than thinking. But what IS it? It’s nothing. It’s got to be nothing. The doors are locked, the windows are sealed, my dog hasn’t been alerted, and I’m just fucking crazy.Except my dog just woke up. He turned his head to where I’ve been looking for the past hour. And he’s locked to it. His ears are up, and they are pointed away from me. He is still. I knew I wasn’t crazy; he SEES something. Something that I can’t see. But he’s not moving either. I wish he’d just bark or chase it so that whatever is in this room with us would scurry out and this would be over and I could go back to sleep. But now I know that something IS out there. I already knew it too. And he knows it now too. And whatever it is, it’s something that has him frozen, too. Is he scared like me? What could scare him like this? What could scare me like this?Fuck, what do I do? If I reach for my phone, it could get to me before I even dial the first number. If I reach for the light, it could tear me to shreds with its teeth. If I make a move, it will certainly get to me, and I will be dead. But I have to do something. Fuck, I have to do SOMETHING.I steel my resolve. I’m going to do it. I’m going to turn on the lights. Fuck this game of cat and mouse. And fuck whatever is in the room with me. I can’t take not knowing anymore. I can’t take waiting. Nothing is worse than waiting. Anything is better than not moving. Going for the light is better than not breathing. The sounds I make leaning over to the switch are better than this sickening silence. The creak of the mattress is like an explosion, but it is better than the empty space between me and whatever my fate shall be. Waiting didn’t help me, and thinking about it only made it worse, so what else is there besides action?I start the chain reaction. My fingers are the first to come to life (they hurt as they creak to life). I move my arm (it is the heaviest it has ever been). I breathe in (how long has it been since my last breath?). My back stretches at an awkward angle towards the light switch (it is so much further away than I remember it being). Sweat beads on my forehead (I can taste the air). My dog’s ears twitch to the sound of my body gliding against the sheets (his gaze is still locked forward). I can hear my own heart (every beat takes forever).

      "content_preview": "Has anyone here ever heard of The Highland Houndsman? What about his dog, Ziggy? I’ve been searching all over the internet, scouring every possible corner I can over the past few days, and I’ve found nothing. Seriously, nothing, not even a hint. It’s bizarre. I’ve found adjacent legends like Cropsey, but not a thing about the Highland Houndsman.The only people who know anything about it are those I attended Camp Faraday with. It seems like he only exists in our minds, in our own urban legends told around the campfires and through word of mouth and scary stories.I remember those days. They were some of the best of my life.Camp Faraday was our private paradise for just one week out of the summer in the mountain woods of upstate New York. It was there that I created my fondest memories with my closest friends.Camp Faraday was set up for children who lost a parent. In my case, I lost both and was raised by my grandmother. Despite the tragic circumstances that led us there, what we found when we got off of the bus was a dream. In lieu of the family we lost to get there, we gained a new one in each other. I found my best friends in the world—my brothers. During that magical week, whatever troubles we took with us were abandoned at the edge of camp.Our different backgrounds didn’t matter, especially not back then when we were so young. We meshed together. We’d rip on each other and pull pranks to no end. We’d laugh until our stomachs hurt. We’d bond over our nerdy interests and debate which fictional character would beat the other in a fight. And most importantly, we’d be there for each other, a shoulder to lean on when it mattered most. We had someone to talk to long into the night, someone to confide in and share each other's pain with.See, my friends at home didn’t get it—not like the camp friends did. In those moments, whether you were a white kid from Connecticut like me or a black kid from Harlem like Deiondre, it didn’t matter. We were all the same. Our bonds ran much deeper than any of the ones with my friends back home. I could never explain it to my home friends. Their inability to understand made the camp bond all the more special.You'd think that seeing them once a year would mean we weren't as close as my other friends, but you'd be wrong. If anything, that made things more pure. When we saw each other, our eyes lit up and we picked up right where we last left off. They wouldn’t disappoint me. They were always there.But my memories of Camp Faraday would be incomplete without The Highland Houndsman. I can’t remember how I first heard about him or even where the rumor first came from but I know it existed long before I got there and long before my oldest bunkmates got there.Hell, even my counselor, Justin, knew about it, and he promised he’d tell us the story if we all behaved one night. We never felt so motivated. We quickly fell into line, and we corrected anyone who was misbehaving. Weneededto hear this story. Finally, when all was settled, when it was time to tell scary stories, we gathered around Justin as he lit up the flashlight under his face.“Do you know the real reason why you’re not allowed to go into the woods past midnight?” he asked.He revealed that it was because that was when the Highland Houndsman roamed around with his dog, Ziggy, he’d kill any camper who went far into the woods.Thatwas why we had to stay within the camp lines.Thatwas why we had a curfew. In truth, we were being protected from the evil that layout there.I remember the shivers all up and down my spine, but I was still intrigued to no end.What was likely told as a simple urban legend and a reason to keep us in line became our obsession. Soon we became lore experts. We demanded to know every little detail of the story, and when we didn’t have any, we would fill in the gaps.It’s all blurry now.What was part of the original urban legend that Justin told us and what we made up I'm not sure anymore. I now realize that half of the legend that I remember was essentially the result of a really, really bad game of telephone played by a bunch of hyperactive kids with wild imaginations. More than half, most likely.Who was the Highland Houndsman and who was Ziggy? Nobody knewfor sureand that drove uscrazy.Aside from the baseline, here’s what I remember all of these years later:I think the Highland Houndsman only had one eye. I don’t remember whether he lost one eye somehow, had a deformity at birth, or if there was another reason; however, I’m sure we had theories about it. I think he had a hat too. Whatever the case, he was scary-looking in my mind, that’s for sure. I think he may have had X’s all over his body, but that one may have just been us getting carried away with the details.Ah, who am I kidding? All of this was us getting carried away with the details.See, one of the other lore bits we came up with was that if you had three X’s drawn above your bunkbed, that meant that he was going to kill you. Not sure howthatbit started, but it led to a lot of fear and a lot of Xs above people’s beds in our bunk.Most of them didn’t even look threatening. They were drawn with colored pencils or whatever we could find. Yup, a lot of us became bad actors and drew above each other’s bunk beds to scare them. Looking back, I think that was just a way for us to A) prank each other and B) keep us involved in the action with the Houndsman as an active threat so that way we could keep the scares and the entertainment going without actually having to walk into the scary woods past midnight.There were also more rules we’d make up, or we’d pound on the outside of the cabin walls to scare whoever was inside, and then we’d say it was Ziggy or The Houndsman. I’ll admit, I took part in that one a couple of times.At a certain point it became more fun than scary. It wasfunbeing scared. It really brought us together.We’d come up with ways to “defeat” the Highland Houndsman and Ziggy too. Like there was this special wooden “artifact” I found in the woods that I decided was some sort of mystic Native American item or whatever that we could use to defeat him. It was probably just some old, rejected arts and crafts project that someone tossed in the woods, but it didn’t stop our imaginations from running wild.Or we’d find cool-looking rocks scattered throughout camp that we thought, when combined, would give us the power to defeat them. Crap like that.As for what the Houndsman used to kill us? Sometimes I remember picturing a hunting rifle—ya know, him being a hunter and all—but other times I remember him having a hook for a hand. Maybe he had both?Although now that I think about it, the hook hand was probably stolen from Cropsey—another more famous local urban legend. Cropsey was an escaped mental patient with hooks for hands who would kidnap kids in the woods. Then again, the whole legend could have been stolen from Cropsey.Like I said, a game of telephone.Ziggy was his “dog,” but I always pictured a giant, monstrous, grey wolf-like beast. Essentially, imagine a giant hellish evil zombie dog and its hellish evil zombie owner—that's who the Highland Houndsman and Ziggy were.Everything changed one night at the end of our third year. I was 8 years old. I was always the runt of the group. The others were 9, which meant we werebig kidsnow. We could do anything.For years, we talked about how we would sneak out past midnight, but there was always an excuse—we’d get in trouble, we had to wake up early—all just excuses. The truth was that we were scared. But this time I was determined.I felt extra brave and I asked others if they were feeling brave. Most weren’t but there were a few—just a few—that were. Deiondre, my best friend, was always up to the task. He was almost 10, and he was the biggest, tallest, gentlest giant. If anyone would have my back,hewould. Then there was Alfie, who I knew for a fact would be in. That kid feared nothing. He was the one person, I think, that was more excited than me about this. When I came in with enthusiasm, he matched it tenfold. Even if I wanted to quit, I knew he wouldn’t let me. Last came Jacob. If Deiondre was my right-hand man, Jacob was my left, and if we werefinallydoing this, then there was no way inhellhe’d miss out.After everyone was asleep, Justin stepped out to see his summer fling—another counselor named Mary. It was time to pounce. We got up and out of there!We rounded the corner behind the cabin, flashlights in hand, but we didn’t dare turn them on yet. Not until we were sure we were in the clear and that nobody in the cabin next door would see us. At that point, we were more scared of getting caught by the counselors than we were of the Highland Houndsman.Once we passed through, we walked a little further, and I felt the fear start to creep in. I started lagging to the back as Alfie plodded along, taking the lead, moving faster, not slower. I felt a sinking feeling sink deeper with every step as we passed the cabins.“Wait!” I whisper-yelled, but Alfie was already too far ahead. “Slow down!” I whisper-yelled louder. It was no use. Deiondre looked back to me, and then he got the others to stop.“What? You s-s-s-scared?” Alfie mocked me.At that point, I had to swallow it down. “No way.”Before I could protest any further, he was off. Deiondre looked at me and asked if I was okay. I swallowed my fears. I followed. Further into the woods. Flashlights turned on, finally.I was scared, sure, but I wasn’t about to be a big baby over it.We stepped closer and closer to the borderlines. It was okay. I had my friends with me. Soon we were over.Suddenly, we hit the woods and I felt a tingle in the back of my neck and those little hairs stood up. I had this chilling feeling that we were being watched.Alfie went further ahead, moving into some bushes and beyond them. If we were in uncharted territory before, now we were really going beyond. A point of no return.Jacob followed. I breathed in and plodded along, the flashlight trembling in my hands as my head darted around in search of whatever could have been watching me.That’s when I heard it.Some loud, inhuman sounds I can’t even begin to describe. Like an inner guttural shout mixed with I don’t even know what. Whatever made the noise, it didn’t sound like a dog or anything that I knew.Even now, I find it difficult to place the sound. I’ve tried over and over again to transcribe the sound but my words always fall short. So I’ll just leave it at that—the horrid sound I heard that night was downright indescribable, incomparable to anything I knew then and know now.Alfie’s scream immediately followed. My head jolted in his direction for a split second before I turned around and bolted.In that moment, everything else disappeared as my flashlight illuminated the path before me. I only prayed that Deiondre was following behind me as I sprinted back, my asthma kicking in. I wheezed until I hit familiar territory, then bolted further. Faster. Up the stairs. Into the cabin. Slamming the door behind me!The others stirred at the sound of the door and asked what happened, but my eyes felt blind and my ears deaf over my panic and wheezing.After a moment catching my wheezing breaths, the chilling realization dawned on me. I had left my friends out there alone with that thing. Were they dead? Had I left them to die?I looked to the closed door and pondered. I froze. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t leave them. I couldn’t decide, so I just froze. It took me years to gather the courage to go out there, but in an instant, at the first sign of trouble, I lost it and ran away without a thought, abandoning my friends.An eternity passed before Alfie and Jacob burst in the door, followed by Deiondre, who slammed it shut behind them and looked out of the window. Alfie collapsed to the floor in hysterics, hyperventilating, and crying. He was inconsolable, having a full-on panic attack as tears streamed down his face.“What happened?” One of the others asked. All joined in as Alfie cried in the corner. Deiondre and Jacob checked the windows.I looked to Alfie as he trembled with unimaginable terror. It was contagious. It was like whatever had been on the other side of his eyes had been seared in so deep that it forced tears to pour out like blood.Jacob screamed out for a counselor. So loud that I thought anyone within miles could hear.I scolded him. I didn’t want to get in trouble. Besides, bringing an adult in would just make it all more real and I’d rather have just begun pretending it didn’t happen.“I don’t care! Didn’t you see it?” Jacob’s eyes welled too. It wasn’t quite as bad as Alfie’s but beneath those tears lay a similarknowinglook. The eyes of someone who caught a glimpse of something that our child eyes were not meant to see.A neighboring counselor came in and comforted us—well, as best as he could. We tried over and over again to get Alfie to talk, to speak, to sayanything.To tell us what happened. But he wouldn’t. He also wouldn’t sleep. They took him down to call his mom.That was the last time I ever saw Alfie. Despite all of our begging and pleading, he never came back to Camp Faraday.I’ll never forget the fear in his eyes. It didn’t matter if what was in the woods was real. Hebelievedthat the threat was real, and as a result, we lost one of our best friends to a monster that likely doesn’t exist. It was all my idea. Sure, he was more enthusiastic, but I still blame myself.Rumor was that Alfie refused to tell anyone what he saw, even his mom, and that there were talks of lawsuits. Years later, he still hasn't told, that I know of. I could never find him on social media, so I never kept up with him.Jacob was the only other one who claimed to see something, but when pressed for details, he couldn’t give much. And Deiondre and I could only describe the noise.Wewere lucky. We weren’t the ones in serious trouble. Our counselor, Justin, was.We had a big camp meeting—from then on, stories of the Highland Houndsman and Ziggy were banned by all counselors. It was bad for business. No more pranks.That was fine by us. We had already lost one of our friends due to the pranks, and now we had also lost our favorite counselor. Justin and Mary were fired for negligence.Thus, our third summer hit more of a sour note, but by the end we picked up again. The rest of us made a promise that this wouldn’t taint our memories of this place and that we’d return next summer for a better one.During our break, things changed. I matured and thought about things as I recounted details to my mom, my family, and my friends. I mean, Alfie was always a drama queen anyway. I remember he cried when Benny accidentally knocked his ice cream cone out of his hands two summers before. He made a whole 30-minute ordeal out of it. Just imagine how upset he’d be over a stupid prank, especially after all of these years of buildup. And Jacob? He didn’t evenknowwhathesaw.The next summer it was business as usual, minus Alfie, which sucked, but we carried on like it was nothing. If anything, it drew us closer to each other. Toward the end of the first night, as we hit a quiet part in the night where we reflected, I came to an important realization.“So the last three years were all about The Highland Houndsman and Ziggy, and let’s be real, we all know they’re not real anymore. It was just a prank.”Everyone agreed. I suppose by this time we’dallmatured a bit. We all knew. We had decided it was time to grow up and stop believing in our childhood monsters. It was bittersweet; it had brought us a lot of great memories as well as some bad ones, but even then we came out stronger because of the bad ones. It was time to put it to rest.I still look back on that night, on that realization between all of us, as one of the moments when we grew up.“So what now? What’s this year’s monster going to be?” I asked.“Yo Mama!” Deiondre responded, and everyone burst out laughing. Even as I type this, now a 21-year-old man, I laugh at it. Such as a stupid, low-effort joke, but the way he said it will always make me laugh; I don’t know why.Now it hurts a little knowing that I’ll never be able to hear him say it again.My heart sank when I saw pictures of him and the accompanying words on Facebook. I remember dropping my phone when I first read the words ‘passed away.’ I let it slip through my grasp. Who cared that it hit the ground?My hand shook. The world fell still as I took a moment to gather myself.He was gone. My best friend was gone. I would never see him again. My first thought was regret. How could I let my best friend go? Why did I never reach out? I scrolled through our texts.The last one was a brief exchange years ago. I asked him if he’d be at New York Comic Con that year. He said he couldn’t make it. I said we’d meet up after but I got too busy. Oh well. Next time.Wealwaysthink there’s going to be a next time. We’re usually right, until one day we’re wrong, and we never know when that day will be.My mind sent me back to that one time on the rock. It was our favorite spot in the world. It was a big rock buried into the hill next to our cabin, between it and the edge of the woods. It was ours and we made damn sure that every other bunk on camp knew it. We would chase off any younger camper who dared to take control. Sometimes we were nice and let them join us, but there was no mistaking it—it wasours.The older bunks knew it was ours too and stayed away. In truth, they probably just didn’t care enough to fight for it, not like we did. To them, it was a rock. To us, it was more. We’d even fight each other over it in games of King of the Hill, endlessly running back up the hill after getting pushed off to claim the throne. Betrayals, alliances, and a whole lot of fun and fake violence.There never was a real winner.Most of all, it was our spot, where we could just talk.One day we got the news that there were only two more years of Camp Faraday before it would close down. We talked, we vented, and we were scared.How could it be over? What if we never see each other again? I told them with shameless tears in my eyes that I was afraid to lose all of them.Deiondre put his arm around me and spoke in his ever-comforting voice, “No matter where we are in the world, no matter what happens, I will always be there for you guys. Always. You’re my best friends in the world. You’re my brothers.” He was right. We were brothers, family, our bonds were deeper than blood.We promised we’d stay in touch even after camp ended. We’d promised we’d see each other every yearno matter what.Then reality set in. Life got in the way.And now death got in the way.Deiondre had been working a construction job when an accident occurred. He and several others were killed. I’m not sure of the exact details, but from what I hear, it was bad.Reallybad.As soon as I found out about his death, I reached out to every single friend from our bunk that I could find before the wake.Most got back to me. We talked, and it wasn’t the same as when we were on the rock; however, we wanted to keep in touch. I asked if they were going to the wake. Most couldn’t and that broke my heart, but I swore I’d move heaven and Earth to be there. The only other bunkmate who will be attending is Jacob.I’ll ask him for more details about The Highland Houndsman and Ziggy when I see him. I wish I could still ask Deiondre.While I’m at it, if any of you have a lead on Alfie, let me know. Poor kid. I just told his most traumatic story online, but I’m sure he’s over it by now. If not, that’s all the more reason to talk to him.Also, if anyone wants to fess up about playing the sound and pulling the prank on us that night, that would be great. In fact, more than 10 years have passed since Camp Faraday ended. You won’t get in trouble!Hell, you can even confess to me privately if you like. I won’t tell!Anyway, I’ve droned on long enough. If I find anything new about the Highland Houndsman and Ziggy, I’ll let you know, and I expect you guys to do the same.Oh, and one last but arguably more important thing: Reach out to that old friend or loved one. Tell them how much you love them.You never know when it will be the last time.",

      "content_preview": "Skulls sat there, teeth bared. I felt uneasy, staring at the main one —the skull of the Tyrannosaurus Rex, king of monsters. The light shone down onto it, in a ray, while darkness draped a veil of black all around the gleaming ivory. Darkness and dinosaurs, I shivered in dread.I've always had a bad feeling about dinosaurs, like, they are real, in my life. I know they are, I've always known. I thought the one in the movie was real, when I was a kid. Strange, when I saw one for real, it was just an animal, it didn't look real, somehow, staring at the real thing.I was taken, shoved into the van with two other children on the field trip. They'd stolen three of us, and I was the only one who didn't get eaten. I wriggled, tied, under the heavy bar fence. The dinosaur wasn't trying to get through, I doubt the bison fence would withstand the rage of the monster, if it wanted out of its enclosure.They tried to catch me, the weirdos in the dinosaur masks. Some kind of weird cult, led by a guy who looked almost exactly like a young Jerod Leto. He wasn't in a mask, and ordered them to catch me. I ran as fast as I could and escaped into the forests. I wandered out onto the highway, where I was picked up by the State Patrol after I stood there trying to hitchhike.I was sitting in the back of their vehicle, locked in, and witnessed what happened next. I had already had a harrowing and frightening experience, but I hadn't seen anything yet. I didn't actually see my classmates get eaten, or at least I don't remember seeing it happen. Somehow, I suspect the memory is buried in my mind, and I cannot remember seeing it happen, I just know they were devoured by the monster and I then panicked and also escaped.The two State Patrol saw two of my pursuers and one of them got out and gave chase to them on foot, back to their compound. When they were on the road leading in, the driver picked up the sweaty patrolwoman who came out the bushes on the side of the road waving us down. We then proceeded to the entrance of the dinosaur cult's compound, owned by some rich guy, who denied them access without a warrant.We sat there for three hours while more police showed up and then there was a warrant for immediate search of the premises for the missing children and suspected kidnappers. They found them, but the dinosaur cage seemed empty, and the rest of the cultists were gone, somehow. The kidnappers were arrested, their van impounded as evidence.It was then discovered that there was a back road, leading out to the forestry road, also known as Smuggler's Highway. We followed it, along the bumpy route, until we found where a collision between a four-wheel vehicle and the special cage truck for the dinosaur had occurred. There was frightening evidence of the t-rex everywhere, tracks and destruction. There was also blood, but what was scary was that we found no bodies. Everyone was missing.I thought, 'well at least it has eaten' but then we found that the smugglers were bringing a ton of cocaine on their vehicle. The State Patrol looked worried, seeing that a large animal had eaten a ton of cocaine.\"It's like in that movie, Cocaine Shark.\" One of them said.\"You mean Cocaine Bear, I think it was a remake.\" The other said. Before they could discuss the movies, the real-life T-Rex silently, without trembling the ground, moved in, leaned over, and ate one of them; its eyes were all dilated and crazed-looking.I was screaming in absolute dread and terror. The other State Patrol, she got out of there and hid, while the high T-Rex searched for her in futility. Every time it tried to sniff her out, it sneezed instead. Then it heard me screaming and took note.The smile on its face, I do not care for. It still haunts my nightmares. It was staring through the flimsy bullet glass, which wouldn't have stopped that thing, the reptilian dragon beast. It wasn't exactly like a t-rex should look or act, and not just because it was stoned, but because it was genetically mutated, crossed with something else, hatched from something else's egg. It vaguely looked like a crocodile, or perhaps a Fallout Deathclaw, or something in-between. Its arms weren't as t-rex like as they should be, and its face was too broad, making its grin unbearable.I was shrieking in insane hysterics of panic. Then the State Patrol started firing the assault rifle she had found near where someone was plucked from the ground and eaten in basically one vicious gulp. To that monster, a person was like a very large bite of steak, and it had to be full, I thought, but then again, it was crazed from its overdose.The assault rifle was emptied, and did little more than make the monster angry. I had always wondered what a gun would do to a dinosaur, since they never shoot any dinosaurs in the movies, making me wonder if dinosaurs all have some kind of plot armor that makes the use of guns impossible.My throat hurt and my eyes were blurred with tears, as the tail struck the car and moved it across the road. The jolt stunned me, so that I was looking all cross eyed at the goat State Patrol woman who had found a rocket launcher in the smuggler's vehicle. She let the t-rex have an anti-tank slug through one eye, which detonated on the inside of its skull and disintegrated its entire head. The poor animal never even knew what happened. One minute it was eating a psychedelic buffet of screaming cheeseburgers and the next - darkness.\"Got a little extinction on your face.\" She coughed out a one-liner, glancing around with the feral eyes of cooling adrenaline.She dropped the bazooka and got in the patrol vehicle. Shakily she backed up and we drove away, down the forestry road.I'm very glad to be alive, and enjoying life, glad I'm not extinct.",

      "content_preview": "You ever hear folks say the South don’t forget? They’re right. The land remembers, and it passes that memory on to whoever’s unlucky enough to inherit it. I didn’t believe that until I went back to Gran’s place in the summer of ’98, down in rural Alabama, where the blackberry brambles grow like veins across the clay. I hadn’t set foot there since I was thirteen, and at twenty-nine, I thought the memories would feel smaller—like how childhood streets shrink when you revisit them as an adult. But Gran’s place hadn’t shrunk. If anything, it seemed bigger, heavier. The house sat crooked on its foundations, deep in a clearing surrounded by pine and oak that leaned in too close, as if they were trying to smother the property. It was old even when Gran was a girl—wooden planks swollen from humidity, screened porch sagging with rusted nails, air that smelled like dust, mildew, and honeysuckle. Everything dripped. Everything clung. My mother never liked us visiting. She said the place was “too heavy with old sins.” That phrase stuck with me as a kid. At the time, I thought she just meant the house was falling apart and filled with bad memories. But as I got older, I realized she meant something else. She meant the land itself carried guilt. Gran died in late spring of ’98. When the phone call came, Mom said she wouldn’t be going back. She made me promise not to stay long. “Go, box things up, do what needs doing. But don’t linger.” She said it with a sharpness that left no room for questions. So I drove down alone.The first day, I wandered through the house, peeling back dust-sheets that clung like ghosts. The wallpaper peeled in curling strips, revealing older patterns beneath—layer after layer of vines, florals, twisting vegetation. Gran must’ve papered over the same walls half a dozen times, yet the motif never changed. Roots and leaves. Always roots and leaves. The air inside was thick and stale. I opened every window I could, though most frames swelled too tight to budge. In the kitchen, jars lined the shelves—pickled beans, tomatoes, and dozens of blackberry preserves, their lids clouded with dust. Gran had been canning until the end. That night, I slept in her old bed. The sheets smelled faintly of cedar and something sweeter, something cloying I couldn’t place. I dreamed of running barefoot as a boy, bramble thorns snagging my legs, juice staining my fingers. In the dream, Gran’s voice whispered from the thickets, low and rhythmic, like prayer.On the second day, I went to the shed. It leaned as though it might collapse, its boards warped and the padlock rusted but still hanging loose. I pried it open with a crowbar. The smell inside was earthier than the house—damp and sweet-sour, like rotting fruit. Tools lined the walls, all old—scythes, spades, clippers, a grinding wheel. In the far corner, a wooden box had crumbled into a pile. I bent to lift a board and it slipped, jagged nails catching me across the palm. The cut was sudden and deep. Blood poured quick, hot, and thick. My first thought wasn’t “hospital.” My first thought was the blackberry brambles along the fence. Gran always said blackberry juice could stop bleeding. When I was a boy, she used to crush the berries—thick and purple-black, staining everything they touched—and press them into scratches and scrapes. “The land heals you if you let it,” she’d whisper. And it always seemed to work. So I stumbled out to the fence, pressed my shaking hand into the thorns, and crushed a fistful of berries until juice ran sticky down my wrist, mixing with blood until I couldn’t tell one from the other. The sting was sharp, but the bleeding slowed. I wrapped my hand with a rag and told myself it was just an old folk remedy. That night, I unwrapped the rag. The wound had clotted, but inside the cut, I swear there were seeds. Little hard nodules, black and slick, embedded in the raw flesh. At first I thought they’d just stuck there from the juice, but when I tried to tweeze them out, my hand spasmed so violently I dropped the tweezers. The seeds sank deeper. By morning, the cut had sealed shut—not scabbed, not stitched, just closed, smooth as healed skin. But under the surface, I could see them. Tiny bulges, like something growing.Over the next week, the house grew unbearable. Every night, cicadas screamed like the earth itself was being split apart. The blackberry brambles crept closer, as though they’d grown several feet overnight. Their thorns scraped against the siding, tapping in the dark like fingernails. The smell of ripe fruit hung heavy, almost rancid, so sweet it made me gag. My hand itched. Not on the skin, but deep beneath it. When I pressed my palm against the bathroom mirror, the bulges shifted. Roots, thin and fibrous, stretched up my wrist. I could feel them tightening inside me, curling through veins. I searched the house for answers. In the bottom drawer of Gran’s nightstand, under rosary beads and wilted funeral cards, I found her journals. Mom had told me not to read them, but I was desperate. The handwriting was fevered, uneven, pages filled with talk of “feeding the land,” of “giving blood so the roots may bear.” One passage burned itself into my mind: “The wound is the gate. You must plant yourself, so the field remembers. Let the blackberries drink, and you’ll never be forgotten.” I slammed the journal shut, but the words stayed with me.That night, I dreamed of being a boy again. I was in Gran’s kitchen, kneeling on the linoleum while she pressed mashed berries into my scraped knees. Only this time, her hands were thorned. The berries pulsed like beating hearts. And when I looked down, my cuts weren’t closing—they were blooming. I woke drenched in sweat, with a mouthful of grit. When I spat into my hand, it wasn’t grit at all. It was seeds.On the third night, I woke to the sound of chewing. Not rats. Not insects. Wet, deliberate chewing. I followed it, half-dreaming, out onto the porch. The blackberry brambles were moving. Not swaying, not bending with the wind, but moving, like snakes twisting in the moonlight. The berries weren’t fruit anymore—they pulsed, glossy and slick, like clusters of swollen eyes. The chewing wasn’t coming from the thickets. It was coming from me. I looked down. My left hand had split open along the old wound. Not bleeding—blooming. Blackberry stems jutted out of my palm, tearing skin as they sprouted. Leaves unfurled between my fingers. Fruit swelled where knuckles should be. And my mouth—God, my mouth was full. Seeds grinding between my teeth. My tongue thick with pulp. I was chewing, swallowing, choking down blackberries that weren’t there. My throat ached with roots pushing up, winding tight. I tried to scream, but what came out was a wet burst of purple juice. That’s when I understood. Gran hadn’t been healing me all those summers ago. She’d been planting me. Every time she pressed those berries into my cuts and scrapes, she was seeding the ground that would claim me later. This wasn't an infection. It was an inheritance.By the fifth day, I could barely keep food down. Everything tasted of berries—metallic and sweet, thick on my tongue. My fingernails cracked as green tips pressed through the beds. My reflection looked less like me, more like something the woods might claim. I tried to leave. Packed the car, turned the key—dead. I swear I’d filled the tank, but the engine only coughed, as if choked. I started down the road on foot, but after an hour, the trees hadn’t changed. Same sagging fences, same clay ditches buzzing with flies. When I circled back, the house was waiting, brambles hugging its sides like an embrace. That night, the journals called to me again. I read until dawn, words crawling across the page like vines. “The land remembers what it’s fed.” “Those who leave are unripe.” “Fruit must return to the bramble.” By the seventh day, I didn’t dream anymore. Or maybe I never woke. The brambles whisper at night. They scrape the walls, hungry. They want me among them. My hand is no longer a hand—it is a stalk, heavy with fruit. My skin splits along my arms in purple seams, each one sprouting. When I breathe, it’s thick with pollen. I know now that I am not dying. I am being rooted. The house will not be cleaned out. It will not be sold. It will remain, wrapped in vines, fat with fruit that carries pieces of me. If you ever find yourself on the old back roads near Gadsden, and you see blackberry thickets strangling an abandoned farmhouse, don’t linger. Don’t touch the fruit, no matter how ripe and sweet it looks. Because the South doesn't forget. And once it’s got a taste of your blood, it’ll plant you too.",

      "content_preview": "It started with Diego. He’s been my best friend since middle school, the kind of guy who never shuts up during soccer matches. We were hanging out at his apartment, talking about a trip we might take, when he said:“Man, if we go to Cusco, I’m definitely bringing my drone.”I laughed, nodded, and kept scrolling on my phone. Not even thirty seconds later, he leaned forward, same grin on his face, and said:“Man, if we go to Cusco, I’m definitely bringing my drone.”Word for word. Same tone. Same laugh afterward.“Wait,” I said. “You just said that.”Diego looked at me like I’d grown a second head. “No, I didn’t. Are you okay?”That was the first crack.The next was my mom calling me by an old nickname she never used. “Nicocho”. She hasn’t said that since I was five. When I asked her why she suddenly brought it back, she froze for a second, then said, “What are you talking about? I’ve always called you that.”I brushed it off. Tried to.But it kept happening.Laura, my girlfriend, told me one night about this amazing beach we went to together last summer. The thing is, we never went. I remember working all through July. I told her that. She tilted her head, like a doll that doesn’t quite understand the question, and said:“No, Nico. Don’t you remember? It’s in the script.”I laughed nervously. “The script? What script?”But she just smiled, too wide, and kissed my cheek.It was the café incident that really shook me. There’s this place near campus where I always order orange juice. That day, the barista, a cheerful girl named Camila, came back with a black coffee.“Uh, sorry, I ordered orange juice,” I said.She looked straight at me, smile fading, and whispered:“It’s not in the script.”Silence. My stomach dropped.“What did you say?”Camila blinked like nothing had happened. “Orange juice, right? Sorry about that!” She rushed off, leaving me sitting there with a coffee that was still steaming.I started noticing patterns. Cars on the main avenue stopping at the exact same rhythm. Conversations repeating in the same sequence when I walked past strangers. Even the stray dog by the bookstore, scratching its ear at the same second every afternoon.One night, I confronted Laura.“I need you to tell me the truth,” I said. “What’s going on? With you. With everything. Is this real?”She was brushing her hair, sitting at my desk. Her hand froze mid-stroke. For a long moment she didn’t move. Then, without turning around, she said:“Don’t think too much, Nico. It’s not healthy.”Her voice was flat. Mechanical.I didn’t sleep that night.Yesterday was the breaking point. I woke up and found my dad sitting in the chair across from my bed. He wasn’t supposed to be there. He lives in another city.“Dad?” I said.He didn’t answer. Just stared at me. His eyes looked… wrong. Like glass.Finally, in a low, distorted voice, he spoke:“You’re reaching the limit of the environment.”I froze.“What the hell does that mean?”“This isn’t life. It’s simulation.”When he blinked, for the briefest second, I swear I saw a blue screen flicker across his pupils. Like a computer crash.I bolted out of my room, out of the house. But outside… it wasn’t the neighborhood anymore. It was white. Endless. A blank space stretching forever.And in the middle of it: a glowing door.I don’t remember deciding to open it. But I did.On the other side, I heard a voice—not my dad’s, not anyone’s. Deep, echoing, everywhere at once:“System reset. Subject will be reinserted into the simulation.”And then—black.I woke up in my bed this morning. Sunlight poured through the curtains. My phone buzzed with messages from Diego, joking about the soccer match that night. Everything looked normal.Except my dad was still sitting in that chair.I told myself it had to be a dream, a leftover hallucination from lack of sleep. But then he slowly turned his head toward me. His mouth moved, and I braced for the metallic voice.Instead, he whispered, almost gently:“Nico… you have to stop asking questions.”And then he smiled. Just a normal, tired smile.For a second, I almost believed it. Almost convinced myself I’d imagined everything.But then I remembered Camila at the café. The way her voice dropped, flat and lifeless, when she handed me the wrong drink.“It’s not in the script.”And I can’t stop thinking—what the hell does that even mean?",

      "content_preview": "'Time.'They say it's the purest form of giving without expecting anything in return. To be unconditional, understanding, and patient. Love can be the sweetest thing of all, but it can also be the most dangerous weapon in the world.As children, some have been taught to love, give, and share without expecting gratitude or compensation, and for the most part, I've done that. I've bent over backwards to please those that are around me, may it be friends or family, I believe I've done what I can—what I could to please, to make people happy.Of course, not all of my attempts or actions have been favorable; after all, I'm still human. We strive to live earnestly every day, some more than others. Those who wear their heart on their sleeves either get the short end of the proverbial stick or the most favorable, though maybe nothing in between.I've been deep in misery for the past few 'ridiculously elongated' days. Thinking a lot—wondering to myself amidst the relentless ticking racking in my head, that I've oddly gotten used to for the past few years.'How did I end up here?'Isolated yet never alone, needing affection, yet deflecting off like a hot mirror baking in the sun, cursed to burn whoever dares to touch.The feeling of joy felt like a luxury, something I couldn't afford at the moment. Recently, I've run myself dry from giving polite smiles and forbearing responses to customers while working my shift at the mall food court.But it wasn't always bad. After a long day, I'd find myself curled up in my room with a nice snack and a movie to watch, and fantasize about escaping into a world where maybe I wasn't a cashier rushing to different food shacks to ask for a change of coins.(Who'd be turned down due to 'company policies' regarding cash registers)As the customer relentlessly taps their foot on the tile floor, waiting for the change after paying ten dollars for a single bottle of water.During a short dopamine high from the feeling of watching a good movie, I'd envision myself living a different life—one felt worth living, I'd envision that I was an Italian swordsman ready to embark on a journey with my lover in the 1700s, or a wizard cursed with an everlasting wand, kept alive undyingly as long as the wand stayed intact.But alas, reality can quite often be... 'Disappointing.'I was once a boy with a dream, one who had hopes of becoming a professional baseball player. And I was on my way there. I had scholarships lined up for playing—offers from schools that saw potential in me, who believed I could go far. I trained every day like it was my last, threw every pitch like it mattered—because it did.That was before everything had changed.During a damp summer evening, I had woken from feeling the heaviest weight on my chest. It felt excruciating—throbbing painfully beneath my nerves as I watched before my eyes the skin and flesh right where my heart rests tear itself off, to form a ring of muscle resembling a crater oozing with blood and fluid around what looked like an organ forcing itself out of my body—an out stretched tissue that had began to protrude outside of the freshly formed opening in my body.Thinking back, I was lucky the lights were off at that time, nothing but the pale moonlight emitting from my open blinds, leaving just enough light for me to see, yet barely process the true color of the scene I was living in.Fresh blood pooled from the rim with each movement of protrusion, dribbling down my skin from the opened flesh before forming a stream of dark maroon on my sheets. The sheer taut tissue ripped itself from the middle like the skin of raw poultry being forcibly pulled in half—except I wasn't dead or a castrated chicken.I was completely and utterly alive.I felt every shred of nerve as I screamed in pure agony. I could barely look at my body and what was happening anymore, with my limbs thrashing against my bed until I fell off with a harsh thud. I coiled into a fetal position on the floor as the throbbing pain slowly numbed, with my head stirring to a clouded haze.Despite the excruciating pain, I knew that my mind was the only thing protecting me now, as it gave me blissful release from the pain by shutting down.I blacked out.The morning came in a normal routine; no matter what happened in the darkness of the night, morning always arrived, joyful and nescient. Light had peaked through my blinds, as I barely prompted myself off the floor. It took longer to get to the bathroom despite the proximity, but the moment I looked in the mirror, seeing my reflection, I let out a choked sob.'I had... a clock on my chest?' I thought.But the numbers didn't make any sense.'79:05:31'I pondered for what felt like an hour, staring into the mirror, touching the surrounding flesh that was bruising a deep purple around my unusually gaunt, pale skin, presumably through blood loss. Tapping the surface of what should've been glass, or a mockery of what it is.I felt my taps reverberate from the subtle pressure, as reality began to settle further into me—this is real.A translucent plate of keratin stretched across the newly formed body part, catching the faint light beneath it, a kin to the way a clock's face catches the glow of its numbers, prompted on a mundane nightstand.Though what I was looking at was anything but mundane—anything but normal. It glowed eerily like an anglerfish's faint light, buzzing to lure its prey. The plate felt nail-like; it felt too smooth to be skin, yet too brittle to be bone.It was completely unnatural, yet it existed with purpose—to protect the sensitive flesh beneath, while the heated glow of light settled behind peculiarly. The numbers flickered, the same numerical sequence ('79:05:31') unchanging and muted, yet the buzz and tick felt present in my mind.The device had settled on my flesh, like an organ sustaining itself from my own body, consuming energy to power itself—to stay alive.It took me a while to shake myself off mentally enough to muster up the courage to leave the bathroom. I tried my best to power through and had to call in sick to avoid work that day. And with whatever energy I had left in me, I cleaned the bloody mess that was my room, threw away the sheets that resembled evidence for murder.It's been almost a year since that day, almost a year since my life has completely turned upside down, where I'm now forced to live in a reality where I watch myself become a shell of the person I was—the person who I knew I was meant to be.It felt like watching a car crash I couldn't stop, I could only stand aside, breathe, and hope for the best, because baseball wasn't just a sport to me—it was the future I believed in, it was the only thing that made sense.And now... nothing ever does.Except, there is one thing that makes sense to me now, it took me a while to figure out, almost about a week or two since the device grew itself from my flesh—the numbers changed. For the next few days, I noticed it would change, apart from the first two numeric parts of the sequence.Within two weeks, the sequence would change from '79:05:31' to '79:05:17', and within two months, it would be reduced to '79:03:17'.It made sense to me the purpose of this... device. It was an indicator of time, of life—my life.Clear as day to me, it was a reminder of how long I've got left live. I felt a sense of ease at that thought, realizing I've got so much more time, yet as I psychologically deteriorated, the mundane, directionless path my days had been accustomed to, somehow influenced the numbers on my chest to change.On some days, it would be lower; I recall about '63:11:27' on the days when I simply didn't feel like getting out of bed, loathing to clock in to a job I never truly had any want to be in, apart from the money that could help sustain me on a day to day basis.And on harder days, it would go as low as '24:08:21'. Those were the days I'd find myself aimlessly wandering the empty desolate streets of my town, a throbbing sensation on the left side of my chest as I slowly became numb to the pain with a simple fix of throat burning liquor—the only sanctuary I could turn to help me with the numbing pain I'd feel.Though, sometimes I'd catch myself using the pain as an excuse to drink, when in reality I just... wanted to forget—for in those moments I find myself not wanting to be myself anymore.But usually after some time of self-loathing and sulking I could still find it in me to smile, even just a little. Seeing the local strays run around, nuzzle their kins after having a hefty meal provided by the neighborhood's favorite senior, 'Helena'. The older woman always seemed so happy—so content in the mundane and day to day life of peaceful normalcy, that seeing her at times made me feel silly for groveling with my own problems.It reminded me of everything I had been told growing up, to always be grateful for what I have, to never take the things I have for granted—and I don't, but that doesn't mean I can't feel negative about the things that are clearly wrong happening around me.Around the time the wound on my chest had begun to feel bearable months had already passed, I began to practice once again, to play—to do what I know I do best.Of course I didn't white-knuckle my way through recovery, charging straight toward the field like a minotaur seeing red, but I was hungry—starving even. So, I started small. It began with ball tosses against the wall, spent my afternoons playing ball until my upstairs neighbor 'Vincent' knocked on my door red as a cherry to the face, resembling a gradient popsicle stick with how thick his neck had gotten.A few light catches. The soft slap of the ball against the glove was almost comforting—until the motion tugged at the tight, healing skin across my chest.It wasn't pain so much as a warning, a dull, pulling sensation that sent a tremor of doubt through me every time I raised my arm. Still, I pushed forward, moving from gentle throws to tentative swings of the bat. It felt heavier than I remembered, the weight dragging at my muscles. My body didn't move the way it used to; every step was careful, hesitant, as if one wrong move would lead me to crumble like a heap of sand.Just the other day, the first time I tried to pitch again, the ball slipped from my fingers before I even reached full rotation, rolling pathetically across the dirt. The second time, I forced the motion, teeth clenched—and a sharp, searing pain shot through my chest, like electricity coursing through my veins, as all of my limbs felt the shock of the consequence I inevitably knew I'd make.I dropped the glove, clutching at the wound, and fell to my knees.The field around me blurred, and for a moment I couldn't tell if the wetness on my face was sweat or tears. The smell of the grass, once comforting, felt like a cruel reminder of everything I'd lost, and the slow hum, the mechanical tone repeated inside my head over and over again, it may have seemed incredulous to others, but it was real to me.'Tick''Tock''Tick''Tock'Where once I used to hear the sound of my heart, the calming rhythm of a heartbeat was now drowned out by the mocking tone of a clock, slowly but surely itching at my resolve.Right then and there I knew I had to do something, I couldn't hide... whatever this was on my chest forever, there was no use in thinking what others would think of me because of this, whether or not they looked at me like I was a freak, it didn't matter to me anymore—I just want to be normal again.I stayed there for a while, kneeling in the dirt, listening to the wind whistle through the empty bleachers. I had pulled out my phone looking through the nearest hospitals nearby that I could.. maybe seek refuge to—I was hesitant, but I was determined to take back my life, to no longer let circumstances win over.It may have felt like the game had already moved on without me, but I wasn't going to give up without a fight, even if I have to do it alone—even if to rip it out of my chest and hit with a swing to throw it as far as possible was the only way out.I'm going to survive, even if I have to die trying.",

      "content_preview": "Okay, I don’t really post much but I need to get this off my chest because I can’t sleep.We moved into a house on Redthorn Close earlier this year. It seemed like the perfect little cul-de-sac. Quiet, safe, family-friendly. We were excited for our daughter Sophie to grow up here.The neighbours at number 16 (the Hargreaves) introduced themselves on the second day. Older couple, probably late 50s. The husband barely blinks when he talks, and the wife smiles too much, like she’s rehearsed it in a mirror. They gave us a pie as a “welcome gift,” but it smelled off, almost chemical. We threw it away.That was the first red flag.After that, weird stuff started happening:At night we’d hear scratching inside the walls, like something was trying to get through.Our locks kept jamming, like someone had been messing with them.Sophie’s toys would disappear from our garden, then show up a few days later neatly arranged on the Hargreaves’ porch.I asked Mrs. Hargreaves if she’d seen Sophie’s missing doll once, and she just leaned in and whispered: “Children wander. Sometimes they don’t come back.”I laughed nervously but I haven’t forgotten it.At night we’d hear noises from their house thuds, dragging sounds, sometimes what honestly sounded like a muffled scream. My husband tried to call the police once when it got really bad, but weirdly the line was dead every time he picked up the phone. And their curtains always glowed red at night, like they had some kind of furnace burning.Then one evening, Sophie disappeared.The garden gate was wide open, and there was a trail of chalk drawings leading from our driveway straight to their house. I ran over in a panic and banged on their door. Mr. Hargreaves answered. His hands were raw and wet, like he’d been digging. He just said, “We haven’t seen her.” But I swear on my life I heard Sophie giggling inside.My husband lost it. That night he broke into their basement.What we found… I still shake thinking about it. The walls were lined with children’s shoes. Dozens of them. Some so old they looked like they’d been there for decades. Others looked almost new. There were shelves filled with dolls with missing eyes. And in the corner was a pit in the floor, covered with lime. Sophie was sitting at the edge of it, holding one of the dolls, absolutely terrified.When we grabbed her, we turned around and the Hargreaves were standing there. Just standing. Smiling like they’d been expecting us.“You wanted peace,” the wife said. “But Redthorn Close keeps its children.”We got Sophie out. We drove all night and we’ve never gone back to that house.Here’s the thing: I’ve Googled them. There’s nothing. No record. No photos. Like they don’t exist. And if you go to Redthorn Close today, their house looks perfectly normal. Curtains drawn. Garden neat. Like nothing ever happened.But sometimes… people still move into that cul-de-sac. Families with kids. And I don’t see them around for long.",

      "content_preview": "When the call came in, I was thrilled. A discovery in the deep Amazon—bones they couldn’t explain. Something massive. Something ancient. I’ve spent my life chasing fossils, and this sounded like the find of the century.I called Ben as soon as I got the news. We hadn’t been on a trip together in years. He was still active military, but always found ways to sneak off when things got interesting. “You in?” I asked.He didn’t hesitate. “Dinosaurs in the jungle? I’m packing already.”We met on a dig in Egypt fifteen years ago. He was security. I was the scientist. Since then, we’d crossed deserts, mountains, even war zones. He was more than a friend. He was like a brother.We flew out on a private military chopper. No logos, no names. Just us, a few scientists, and a small team of armed men. The government wanted this kept quiet.The chopper dropped us deep in the rainforest. The trees rose like walls around us. Thick, green, alive. I’d never felt so cut off from the world.We hiked for a day before we reached the camp. It was already set up. Tents. Equipment. A large tarp covering something big in the center.Dr. Carrillo, the lead scientist, greeted us. “You’re just in time,” he said, grinning. “Wait until you see it, its spectacular.”The small group of scientists began murmuring to each other in anticipation Dr. Carrillo pulled back the tarp. All went silent. What lay beneath took my breath away.The creature was huge—at least 35 feet long. Its body was like a theropod, but the head was different. Longer. Narrower. Almost... human.Ben in shock said. “What the hell is this thing?”“It’s not fossilized,” Carrillo said. “It’s preserved. Flesh, muscle. As if it died yesterday.”That wasn’t possible. But I could see it with my own eyes. No signs of decay. Skin like stretched leather. Eyes sunken, but still there.“Where did you find it?” I asked.“Cave system,” he said. “Uncovered after a rockslide. It was lying there. Like it had been waiting just for us.” he chuckledBen looked at me. “This is big. You know that, right?”I nodded. “Bigger than anything we’ve ever found.”That night, we celebrated. Opened some cheap whiskey. Sat around a fire and talked about all the places we’d been. All the things we’d seen. \"Remember that time you tried to steal a chicken? I remember your dumbass army crawling all the way to the coop from the tree line. When that old dude swung his door open with the shotgun saw you, the look on your face was priceless. Best 20 bucks I spent\" Ben said laughing\"Yeah those were good times man, KFC never felt the same after that\" i said jokingly“I missed this,” Ben said, tipping his flask at me. “Feels like old times.”\"Me too, when we get back we gotta hangout more\" I saidThat was our last enjoyable night we had together.I woke up screaming, covered in sweat, I couldn’t remember the dream. Just darkness. And a sound. A deep, gargling growl, like something breathing through water.Ben was already awake. Sitting up. “You too?”“Yeah,” I said. “What the hell was that?”We laughed it off the next morning. Just jungle dreams, we said. Nothing to worry about. But the air felt heavier. The camp quieter. Like the trees were watching.Carrillo seemed off. Tired. His hands shaking. “Don’t you feel it?” he asked me. “The pressure. And the ground is... i dont know..breathing?”I wanted to tell him he was being dramatic. But I felt it too. A pulse in the soil. A hum beneath our feet.Ben and I went to the site where the body was found. The cave was strange—deep and narrow. The walls inside were covered in carvings of Spirals.“Look at this,” Ben said, running his hand across the stone. “These symbols… they look ancient. But they feel fresh.”We took pictures of the carvings inside the cave, thinking they might be part of some lost civilization. At first glance, they seemed tribal—spirals, shapes, and jagged lines chiseled deep into the stone. But the longer we looked, the less they felt like art and more like warnings. Each symbol stirred a strange discomfort in my stomach, as if my mind refused to fully comprehend them. I could feel them watching me, crawling behind my eyes.“This isn’t just decoration,” I said to Ben, trying to sound calm though my voice trembled. “These are warnings. Ancient, maybe religious.” I traced one of the deeper spirals with a gloved finger. The rock felt too warm. Ben leaned over my shoulder and nodded slowly. “Or they’re instructions,” he said darkly, “for something none of us should follow.”We pressed deeper into the cave, our flashlights piercing the gloom. The passage dipped downward, curving like a snake’s spine. The air grew thick, cooler with each step, and carried a coppery tang. We hadn’t spoken for minutes, the silence stretched tight as wire. I felt something watching from the stone itself.Then we found it—another body. Unlike the dinosaur above, this one was humanoid but grotesquely twisted. Its limbs bent in ways no human body should, and its skull was stretched, deformed, yet unmistakably once human. It knelt before a cracked stone pillar covered in the same spirals. We didn’t speak. There were no words.Ben lifted his flashlight to the ceiling and swore softly under his breath. Dozens—maybe hundreds—of bodies were fused into the stone. Some looked like they’d tried to escape, their arms reaching out in silent agony. Others knelt like the one before us, locked in eternal worship. My stomach turned. This wasn’t a tomb. It was a shrine, built of flesh.We returned to the camp in silence, neither of us willing to speak about what we had seen. The forest no longer felt alive in the way it had before; now it felt like it was holding its breath. The wind had stopped, and even the insects were gone. The campfire that night didn’t feel warm. We sat close to it anyway, like cavemen praying to a weak and fading god.Carrillo was worse. His face looked hollowed out, eyes rimmed with red. He mumbled to himself constantly now, sometimes in English, sometimes in a language I couldn’t place. When I asked him what he was saying, he looked at me as if I should already know. “It speaks to me,” he said. “The sleeper... the forgotten one... it’s waking up.”Ben pulled me aside that night. “We need to leave,” he said, his voice low. “Carrillo’s lost it, and whatever’s down there, we’re not equipped to deal with it.” I wanted to agree, but something—some sick sense of obligation or curiosity—held me back. “Just a few more days,” I told him. “We need answers.”That night, I dreamed again. This time it wasn’t just shadows or strange sounds. I saw a temple deep beneath the earth, built from bone and sinew. A colossal shape stirred at its center, too large to see fully. Its skin was scaled like a dinosaur’s, but layered with countless eyes and feathered wings that turned inside out. It opened its mouth and I heard not a sound, but a truth—something that broke my mind.I woke up gasping, and so did Ben. We looked at each other across the tent, both pale with sweat. “You saw it too, didn’t you?” he asked. I nodded, too shaken to speak. “It’s not just in the cave,” he whispered.We decided to confront Carrillo in the morning. But when we went to his tent, we found only blood and torn paper. Symbols had been carved into the walls of the canvas with his own fingernails. His journal lay open, filled with sketches of the beast we had seen in our dreams. The last page simply read: “John 8:21.”Panic spread through the team. Two of the armed guards went missing within the hour. The others refused to enter the forest, claiming the trees whispered their names. One man shot himself after screaming that something had crawled into his skull. It was no longer just a research trip—it was a death sentence.Ben tried to contact the HQ for evacuation, but only static came through the radio. We decided to send a GPS Ping in hopes someone will answer. The jungle had sealed us in, like the jaws of a beast. The sky darkened hours before sundown. A foul smell, like rotting meat, began to drift through the air. I covered my face with a cloth, but it didn’t help.That night, one of the scientists began chanting. grabing a nearby knife, suddenly he plunged the blade into his stomach and began to gutt himself. We tried to restrain him, but he tore free with impossible strength. His eyes sunken faintly, his mouth hung open. he spoke. “We are the chosen.”  in a deep guttural voice. “there is no God beside me.” He dug his hands inside the laceration. he began chanting once again over. wet squelching sounds coming from his body as He began pulling out his organs. Ben looked away but I couldn’t. The scientist collapsed, and was pronounced dead soon after.Ben didn’t sleep. He sat by the fire with his rifle, watching the jungle. I sat beside him, clutching a notebook, scribbling down every detail I could before it faded. “Do you still think we should’ve come?” he asked me. I didn’t answer. But in my heart, I knew the truth—we were never meant to find this place.The next morning, the corpse was gone. Along side the massive creature under the tarp. No tracks, no drag marks. But we soon realized the ground where it laid was burned into an enormous spiral. One of the guards became frantic “Its gone !,” he shouted, “ it just woke up and took the kid with it !?”From that moment , all of us knew without a doubt we are being hunted. We didn’t see it, not at first, but we felt it. Every step we took echoed louder than it should. Every tree we passed seemed to lean toward us. The shadows between the leaves moved wrong, like they had minds of their own. Something big was out there, and it wanted us afraid.One night, we heard the screams. Distant, drawn-out, not entirely human. They echoed through the trees, bouncing off trunks and returning distorted. I couldn’t tell how far away they were—or if they were even real. But they never stopped. Even after we stuffed cloth into our ears.Ben finally said what we were both thinking: “We’re not going to make it out.” I wanted to argue, to hold onto hope, but I couldn’t lie to him. “Then we make sure someone knows what happened,” I said. He nodded, and we started planning an escape—not for survival, but for testimony.We left that night with only our packs, my notes, and Ben’s rifle. We didn’t look back at the camp. It felt like we were leaving graves behind. The jungle swallowed us within minutes. we entered its mouth, and now we were crawling through its throat.We moved fast during the day and tried not to stop. But time bent strangely. The sun would rise, then sink again moments later. Sometimes we saw stars in daylight. Other times, we heard voices beneath the soil. “Keep moving,” Ben would say. “Don’t listen to them.”Eventually we found a river, rushing and alive. We followed it, hoping it would lead to a village or a clearing. The water grew thicker, darker. Fish with no eyes swam backward. On the banks, bones stuck out of the mud like fingers.We rested in a hollow between roots. Ben took first watch. I drifted to sleep, in my dreams I saw memories not my own—civilizations swallowed, languages lost, prayers offered to something with wings ,scales and a hundreds of eyes. It did not love its worshippers. They were lambs in a wolfs Den.I awoke to gunfire and screaming. Ben was firing into the trees, yelling my name. I scrambled to his side, and he shoved me down. “Go!” he shouted. “Don’t look back!” But I looked anyway—and I saw it.It didn’t move like a beast. It moved like a thought—stretching through space in impossible shapes. Wings that split and reformed. Legs that shifted angles with every step. Its eyes opened in layers, each blinking a different direction. Ben fired until his rifle clicked empty.He turned to me, calm for a single moment. “Tell them,” he said. In a flash he was swept away. Pulled in to the darkness. I ran. I didn’t look back. I knew i couldn't help him. I can still hear the screams..I don’t remember how I made it out. Days passed, hours, no..years? I stumbled into a clearing where a rescue team had landed, drawn by our GPS ping. They said I was raving. Covered in blood and carving spirals into my own skin. But I was alive. I was the only one.They took me home. Drugged me up, sent me to a Therapist. Told me it was trauma. A hallucination. A mental break. But they didn’t see the notes I kept hidden. The drawings. The sketches. The truth.Sometimes late at night hear it, poorly mimicking Ben’s voice. Beckoning me back. “It’s still out there,” it says. “And it’s not done with you .” I believe him.I’m writing this down for whoever finds it. For the next team, or the next fool drawn by the promise of discovery. Don’t go into that jungle. Don’t follow the spirals. Don’t listen to the dreams. Because once you do, it sees you. And once it has you , it never Lets go.",

      "content_preview": "My name is Sameer. I was an engineering student until I wasn’t. I dropped out to chase acting, and I moved into this place because I needed my own hours. The rent is fifteen thousand a month, too cheap for Santacruz, and it came with fifteen rules from a landlord who never shows his face. I posted thosealready.I opened the diaryInside the front page a name was scrawled in block lettersShaanThe next page had something glued to it. A cut-out from a school ID card.A boy’s photograph. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Light blue uniform shirt, striped tie, the emblem of some school pressed into plastic. His hair was combed neatly, his eyes wide like he didn’t want to blink.17 October 2017Today is Diwali. The Festival of Lights. First time we lit rockets on the roof. Everyone counted down and the sky opened like a flower.I ate six kaju barfis. Dinner was puri with potato sabzi and kheer. I ate ten puris. Mom laughed and said run it off.My favorite firework is anar. The fountain that burns upward from the ground. I like it because it pushes light into the dark from below. It shows everyone’s faces.When it hissed and climbed I could see Dad and the uncles playing cards, Mom and the aunties laughing with bangles on their wrists, the watchman clapping once before pretending he didn’t.The air smelled of ghee and sugar smoke and the building itself seemed to smile.I went to bed smiling. Tomorrow is Sunday.18 October 2017A new man moved into 13B today. Dad said hmm, new guy, and Mom told me to carry flowers and a bowl of sweets.We went to greet him. He said his name is Ajmera. His hair was neat. He carried a tan briefcase.I thought he said he worked in fin… ninedance. Dad corrected me. Finance.He smiled at me. Mom told him if you ever need help, don’t hesitate. He said thank you and took a sweet. He chewed slowly, like he had to remember what to do with it.When he shook my hand it was cold. His palm was smooth and tight, like skin that healed wrong.19 October 2017Ajmera uncle called everyone to the community hall. He said he was holding a small prayer, a pooja, once a week. He told us prayers bring peace of mind, focus, and strength. He said prayer makes us powerful.We all sat cross-legged on the floor. He told us to close our eyes. His voice was low and steady and the words sounded like they were coming through water.I almost fell asleep.When it ended he gave us sweets. Black sesame and jaggery. They tasted strange, bitter and sweet at once, like medicine.He stood in front of each of us until we finished eating. I chewed and swallowed. Later I wished I hadn’t.20 October 2017This morning the water ran red.I woke to brush before school and the tap coughed brown, then red, and it stayed red. The smell was metallic. Like a coin in my mouth.Mom shouted not to touch it. Dad banged on doors and found out it was the same everywhere. The uncles and the watchman went to the terrace to check the tank.They found five stray dogs floating in the water. Throats cut. Eyes glassy. Their bodies swollen.I didn’t see them, but my friend’s father did. He came back without any words.They drained and scrubbed the tank, but all day the halls smelled of iron. At night the pipes made a wet sound like swallowing.In the evening I saw Ajmera in the stairwell. He stood very still, both hands wrapped around his briefcase as if he was holding a tray.He told me, “Bottled water only, beta.” He smiled as if he already knew.21 October 2017Ajmera came to our house today.Mom said he was doing a ritual for our health and well-being. She told me to be grateful, because such rituals are difficult and he was doing it free of charge.What job, I wondered. I never saw him leave the building.He lit too many incense sticks. He pulled a black jagged stone from his bag and placed it on a plate. We closed our eyes and prayed. My head felt heavy, drowsy.Before leaving he offered us prasad. The same black sesame and jaggery sweet.I put it in my mouth but spat it into the sink when no one was looking. The taste stayed. Like tar on my tongue.When he bowed goodbye, the cuffs of his shirt were damp.22 October 2017Sunita didi on the 14th was studying for her 10th exams again. She was kind. She always carried bags for the aunties and told me to study even when I hated it.Last week I gave her a chocolate for luck.Today Mom said I couldn’t visit. She has gone to God, she said. Later my friend whispered she had jumped.The aunties cried into their sarees. Their voices sounded like rain falling indoors.I looked up at the roof and saw a figure on the parapet. For one long second. A man. A briefcase in his hand.I blinked. Nothing there.The corridor smelled faintly of incense that didn’t belong to our house.23 October 2017School was closed. Everyone stayed in. Dad didn’t go to work.Police in brown uniforms stood at the gate and pulled tape across the entrance. I’ve only seen those uniforms in textbooks. Their shoes were too clean for our dust.They said someone died in 5A. My best friend Shiva lived there with his grandparents.I waited by the door.When Dad came back his face looked wrong. He whispered to Mom that all three had hung themselves. Mom broke in the kitchen. She tried to cry quietly, but I heard her.Ajmera was outside, speaking softly to the policemen. He poured them tea and stood too close to the tape.He said we are family. He said it twice, as if practicing.When he walked past me the smell of jaggery clung to him, heavy and old, with something like oil beneath it.His smile was too polite. Too long.I don’t want Mom to cry.______________________________________________________________The diary ended there. Blank pages followed. A pressed marigold hid between two sheets, its petals leaking a brown-orange stain into the paper like a wound that refused to dry.I shut the book and sat very still. The air in the flat felt thicker. The walls seemed to know I was awake.The building has a way of noticing you if you stare at it too long.Ajmera.I knew the name from when I was twelve, when the news shouted it over every channel. Dharavi ka Darinda.The Beast of Dharavi. Back then I didn’t understand.Now I was holding the words of a boy who had.The room was too dark. I walked into the hall for light.I pressed the switch. The bulb flickered once, then steadied. I tugged the fan cord without thinking, desperate for movement in the heavy air.The blades creaked into life, slow and uneven, and something swung with them.At first I thought the shadows were playing tricks.But then the shape turned, and my stomach turned with it.A boy was hanging from the fan. His body dangled by strips of cloth knotted around his arms and chest, dragging him upward into the blades as they spun.His uniform shirt was the same pale blue as the photo in the diary. His striped tie whipped against his swollen cheek with every rotation.The sound was worse than the sight. The fan groaned under his weight, each blade clipping the air with a labored wheeze. His shoes scraped the ceiling once, then swung back down.The smell hit a second later—incense gone sour, mixed with something metallic and rotten.His head lolled, eyes bulging, tongue black and heavy. And yet, as he turned with the blades, I swore his gaze locked on mine, just for a heartbeat each time he swung around.My knees gave out. I crashed to the floor, gasping like I was the one choking. I pressed my palms into my eyes, hard enough to see sparks.When I opened them again the fan spun empty. No rope. No boy. Just the creak of old blades and the echo of a smell that clung to the back of my throat.My heart was a drum in my chest. My vision blurred. I didn’t see the face properly, I told myself. I didn’t.But I knew. The jaw. The eyes.It looked like the boy in the photograph at the front of the diary.It looked like Shaan.My hands fumbled for my phone. I pulled up the landlord’s WhatsApp thread. The rules glowed back at me. I scrolled, desperate.Was there one about lights? About the fan? Who can remember fifteen rules when a boy is spinning above your head?As I was scrolling, my attention went to his profile picture And in my landlord's WhatsApp profile picture, the blurry one of the building at night… if I zoomed enough, I could swear the faintest light was shining from one flat.13B.It all endshere",

      "content_preview": "When I was just a girl, i used to play teacher with my dolls almost every day. I’d lay them in a row on the carpet, dress them in little uniforms, and position their little plastic bodies in studious, ready-to-learn positions. I’d strut around my room with a bedtime story in my grip, pretending like I was teaching them important life lessons. My fantasies could never compare to the real thing, though.Nothingcompares to the real life fulfillment of feeling like you’re making a difference in a child’s life- seeing the light in their eyes instead of the soulless plastic faces I was used to.  After I started teaching for real, I threw away all of my dolls. Couldn’t stand their plastic faces anymore, it felt blasphemous.I want to preface this by clarifying I remember each student I’ve ever had the privilege of meeting. It might take me longer sometimes to get my memory of them going, but eventually Ialwaysremember. I remember them all. And I loved them all (I still do). I can’t figure out why or how this is happening, and I honestly feel quite humbled. Maybe I don’t know everything and some things are better left unexplained. It seems like there’s nothing Ican doanyways, so maybe I should just live in a blissful state of blind delusion? It all comes down to one kid, anyways. One singular child who has caused me to question and doubt every basic law of human nature and existence. If i can get rid of him, or forget him, or make someonebelieve memaybe I can find myself again. I don’t know. It’s probably too late for that.It was my second year of teaching and my first year at the private school I’m at now. It was such a jarring switch from public school- perfectly wealthy families wrapped up with a pretty bow on top. I was there to teach them skills they’d probably never need beyond their schooling, because daddy’s company would immediately hire them post grad. It felt like my kids were always the sweetest ones. Bright-eyed third graders, ready and eager to learn. The school I teach at is Montessori-esque, basically a fancy word for hands on learning. It was very different from the conventional practice of teaching, but it does allow you to form a stronger bond with your students.Hedidn’t show up on meet the teacher day, or the day after. It was on the second real day of school. I thought he was a lost kid at first, and I was prepared to help him find the correct classroom. As the rest of the class played with their toys, I knelt down beside him at the door.“Hey buddy. Do you need some help finding your class?”He nodded.“Let me help you out, sweetie. What’s that piece of paper you have in your hands?”He handed it over, eyes never leaving mine.It was his class assignment sheet in perfect condition. Sure enough, it had my class listed as where he was supposed to be. It read:ROOM 406 FLOOR 4 MS. DEGONIA RALPH MANHATTANI looked it over, confused. I hadn’t seen his name on my roster yesterday, and with a last name like that - I was sure I would’ve caught it.“Well, seems like you’re stuck with me then… Ralph! Come on in, we’re just getting started.”Ralph stayed close behind me and followed me into the class. I finished my introduction speech and glanced over at my roster again. Huh. Ihadmissed his name yesterday, i guess. I made a note to self to email my supervisor about that later.Ralph’s first year in my class was relatively normal, besides the fact that he had a few quirks. He was extremely shy and quiet, always observing the other kids. He sat in the same chair each class, and would get there early just to have it all to himself. One thing I found fascinating was his big, red scarf he’d wear just about everyday as well. Just regular, loner kid stuff.I’d love to skip ahead to the later years, but there are some important things Imustmention before I move ahead.Ralph never had any parents listed as contacts in his file. There was only an address and a phone number. When brought to administrative attention in later years, this was often brushed off as parent neglect.Ralph has blonde hair, green eyes, and a large freckle on his left cheek.Ralph is an only child, and has no documented siblings.After Ralph’s first year, he showed up in my class the next. Under almost the exact same circumstances as the year prior. He came to my room, holding the piece of paper with my class name on it, waiting to be let in. This time, I had called the administration immediately, as there had to have been some kind of mix-up. They assured me that he had gotten held back to re-do the third grade at the request of his family. This was concerning to me, as Ralph never struggled with his studies, and was consistently at the top of his grade. Anytime I tried to push for more information, the answers only got more vague and passive aggressive. So, I dropped it. Maybe it’s his home life, or something religious? I didn’t mind another year with the kid, despite the unjust circumstances.Year two was almost identical to his first. He talked a bit more, but only to me and in one word phrases, mostly. Ralph played by himself and chose to nap most recesses. He hadn’t aged a day and was significantly shorter than his old classmates. His old “friends” would wave at him in the halls politely, acknowledging his presence in a friendly manner as they made their way to the fourth grade room. Things were fine.Year three was where things began changing. Ralph had transferred schools. I was sad to see him go, until on the first day of my third year- there he was again- outside of my door with that damn class assignment sheet. I was beyond perplexed and called my colleague over to try and clear things up.Tyler Capone, the other third grade teacher, was about as much help as you’d expect.“I thought Ralph had transferred” I questioned through gritted teeth.“He did” My colleague’s eyebrows twisted into a perplexing expression. Why was he staring at me likeIwas the crazy one?“So, why is he standing right here?”Ralph looked up at me, blank expression on his face.“Oh, that’s Ryan. They look kind of similar”I looked at the sheet again. At second glance and in the blink of an eye, the sheethadchanged.ROOM 406 FLOOR 4 MS. DEGONIA RYAN MANHATTAN“They have the same last name, too?” I spat out, eyeing the sheet as hard as I could.“They’re probably related or something, I mean come on, you got ‘em mixed up yourself, Brooke!”I stared Tyler down, face contorting.“Oh, my bad. I mean come on, you got ‘em mixed up yourself,Ms. Degonia.” He replied, misreading my expression.Taking my silence as an opportunity, Mr. Capone Led Ralph into my classroom.“Cmon in to Ms. Degonia’s class, kiddo. You’re gonna love it there.”I pulled Tyler aside after the kids had settled into their classrooms.“Okay, we’re away from the kids now” I whispered to him, becoming very serious. “You can be honest with me, what’s up with that kid?”Tyler chuckled underneath his breath and placed a comforting hand on my shoulder.“Brooke, you gotta relax. Families are weird.Kidsare weird. I’ve learned to stop sticking my nose where it doesn’t need to be. No one’s dying. Let’s just do our jobs, okay? It’s probably just some random rich people family drama.”I looked up at Tyler and sighed. Maybe Iwasoverdoing it. I had family drama. Some stuff is better left alone.“Yeah, yeah I’ll drop it. For now”I turned back to the kids. Theywereall happy. No one was in danger. This was fine.Iwas fine.This year there were a few major developments. From this point on, Ralph came back each year as a different “R” name paired with the last name “Manhattan”.  Year Four, he was Richie, Year Five, he was Roscoe, and so on and so forth. Something would physically change about him every year as well, but it was so small, if you weren’t paying attention- you’d miss it. His hair would be bone straight one year, then a violent afro the next. He had these obnoxious glasses one year. He went through a year where he had a face full of pimples (that one was particularly unsettling). There was ALWAYS something different and no one seemed to care or notice. This wasclearlya different kid, and I’m being pushy for asking.Another change was Ralph’s in-class behavior. Around years three and four, he became very disruptive. He’d bust into tears in the middle of class, begin scratching at his neck so aggressively he’d bleed, he’d shove other kids over in class, things typically classified as “bad kid” behavior. I wasn’t inexperienced with a disrespectful kid or two, and we usually had a rambunctious one in the class anyways so I wasn’t too thrown off. He’d sit in class, in the back, scarf wrapped around his neck tightly, a grumpy look plastered on his face. He only hung around and talked to me, so I was able to keep him at bay most days.But one day- something changed.Year Five, on the third day of class, he came into class so pitifully exhausted. Head slumped over his shoulders and eyes sunken in. I was immediately concerned and nervously went over to talk to him. Was there abuse going on at home? Where evenwashis home? Who knows what this child is experiencing?I called Roscoe over to my desk.“Hey buddy. How we feeling today?”He remained silent and held his head even lower.“I’m tired of always coming back here, Ms. Degonia.”I was confused, but prepared to answer. Clearly, this kid doesn’t like school. I didn’t believe the whole “endless Manhattan relatives” thing, but (for the sake of my job)(and sanity) I had learned to stop asking questions at this point. I had assumed his condition was some kind of taboo learning disability some ultra rich parents wanted to keep away from the public eye. That, or he’s some freakish lab project.I had a speech prepared in my mind about the wonders of elementary education, and was reaching over to ruffle the hair on his head. As I placed my hand on top of his scalp, A few things immediately disturbed me.He wasabsolutely freezing. He waswet. He wassoft.Pressing down into his scalp was like sinking into quicksand, slowly delving into a deep and endless pit. He seemed unbothered by my hand, which had sunk several inches deep into his frontal cortex. I quickly lifted my hand out of his mop of hair, and suddenly realized my hand was covered in a black liquid.I mumbled curses underneath my breath and wiped off my hand on my blouse.“We need to get you to the nurse,now.”Year Five was a hard one for me. This was my breaking point where I realized the school was absolutely no help. Post nurse visit, Richie was discharged with a severe case of the Flu- Furiously, I rushed to the nurses to protest.When I brought my unnerving news to the nurses, she simply stared at me for several seconds. The subtle smile faded from her face, and her eyes went glassy.“It’s a classic case of the Flu.”“Do you think I’m stupid? This is some fucked up stuff going on. Have we contacted his parents? Does he have any? Ralph, Richie, Roscoe… whoever this kid is, he’s not, you know, the way a kid is supposed to be!” I felt like the room was spinning. Was I insane? I looked at the black stain on my hand. No, this was real.The nurse said nothing. The resting smile returned to her face and she continued on with her day as usual.I was yelling at full volume now.“I don’t know what thefuckis going on, and I’ve tried to keep my damn mouth shut, but I’m not doing this. There is something wrong about that kid, and I don’t want any part of it. Keep your money, I want out. I quit!”I had assumed that would work. Despite the fact that I would be losing the job I loved, i felt free that afternoon driving home from work- freer than I had in years, and freer than I would be for years to come.The next morning I woke up in my classroom, at my desk. My class was in front of me- faces smiling and ready for the day. My immediate instinct was to stand up, bolt for the door or window, and scream for help. But, I couldn’t. It was like my body was forcing me to get up and step over to the white board. I picked up my pen and began to write the agenda for the day. I gained control of my body for a brief moment and forced my head to turn back around at the class.Hewas in the corner, staring back at me. Black, beady eyes burning into my head. His legs were stretched and decomposing, and his arms were almost deconstructed. It looked fake. Like a glitch on a computer game. I thought it might have been my imagination at the time, but his foot was merging with the floor itself .That being said, none of it compared to this face. It was stiff, stretched back, and pale as a sheet of paper. The slits of his eyes peeled open permanently and his mouth hanging slightly ajar.He looked downright plastic.Evidently Soulless.And yet, I couldn’t resist looking at him.END OF PT. 1",

      "content_preview": "Since I was a boy, I’ve moved around a lot. It’s because of my work.I'm a preacher. I go from town to town to spread the word as far as I can. I love my work, and I wouldn’t change it.But I sometimes do miss the small town I grew up in. To be honest, it was so small I’m not even sure it qualified as a town.In a place like this, you feel like the world is leaving you behind. Like you’re frozen in time as everything happens around you.But there are a lot of good things about it that I feel get overlooked. I’ve never felt a sense of belonging like I did in my home town. Everyone knew each other, and everyone was a friend. We had a sense of love and community that made life so much more colorful and beautiful.We worked, celebrated, grieved, and endured together as one people. In the good times and in the bad.We didn't have many of the things we do now, especially in a town like that. But we never felt that we needed them anyway.We walked to school and to church, and we entertained ourselves with endless adventures in the wilderness.But nowhere is without its dangers. And my home was not an exception.Most families here were very religious. And with that, most of them were very superstitious. The dead were never to be disrespected. And spirits were feared.I grew up on ghost stories of La Llorona’s cries and El Silbón’s whistles.But it wasn’t like horror movies. We didn’t live in constant dread of oppressive demons and monsters. We treated them as part of the land.Parents would warn their children of spirits the same way they warned us about wild animals or storms. A danger, yes - but not always a fear.Still, my parents didn’t take risks with me. I was an only child and, looking back, I can see that both of my parents lived to ensure my future.It was a long walk to school from my house - about an hour and a half one way. But my father would wake up early to go with me to make sure I was safe. We left before the sun was up, and those talks we shared under the desert stars were some of the best times of my life.But one morning sticks out to me in my memories among the rest. Like a crooked piece of paper in an otherwise neat filing cabinet.It was dark that morning, clouds obscured the heavens and filled them with thick ink. The desert seemed quieter too. No yipping coyotes or cooing owls.Still the trip was not abnormal otherwise. Until about halfway through, at least.We walked along the dirt road as we always did, our boots crunching in the dust as we talked about anything and everything. I was always full of questions - mostly about our faith. I was always interested in the spiritual. Even as a boy.I wondered about what any child would wonder about: “Do dogs go to Heaven?” “If angels have wings, why don’t we ever find feathers?” “If I pray really quietly, does He have to lean in to hear me?” My dad answered them all with patience I worry I may never have.Our conversation was interrupted by footsteps.They were quiet at first, but rhythmic, almost like a march. Crunching, scraping steps from the other side of the road. Coming from the direction of the town towards where we had started.They were quiet at first, but rhythmic, almost like a march. Crunching, scraping steps from the other side of the road, moving steadily toward us from the direction of the town. Then I saw them - a group of maybe ten people, dressed in baggy work clothes. Most wore wide-brimmed hats that shadowed their faces, and none of their gazes turned from straight ahead. Their steps never faltered, not even on the loose stones.I raised my hand to wave, but my father caught my wrist before I could. His grip was tight, harder than I had ever felt from him before.I turned to him with a confused expression that he read even in the dim light of dawn. He answered my question before I even asked it, “I don’t recognize those people. They’re not from here.”I wanted to protest. We had always been welcoming of outsiders before. My parents had even hosted a few needy foreigners in the spare bedroom. I knew my father was wiser than me, but I wanted to point out to him that ignoring foreigners was not what the Bible said to do.But he dragged me down the road by the wrist until the crunching of their boots had faded. At that point, my father got to one knee to meet my eyes. I seldom saw such intensity on his face. He spoke quietly, yet his tone was as hard as iron, and it left no room for debate,“In a town like ours, everyone knows everyone. Those people… I didn’t know a single face. Tell me, son, what business would strangers have walking toward nothing in the dark of morning?”His words confused me, but he bypassed this with a simple command he knew I could follow.“If a stranger like that ever talks to you, never answer. Don’t even look at them. Just keep walking. Understand?”I swallowed my defiance and nodded. My father stood, and we kept walking. But even now, all these years later, I can still hear the crunch of those boots behind us, steady and unbroken, as if they never stopped walking that road. It wouldn’t be the last time I heard them.Years went by. I was around 12 at this point. But, like I said earlier, time stands still in places like this. My routine was the same. I got up, walked to school, walked home after, and did chores. It was normal for kids my age to walk to school alone. But my father was still a protective man and usually went with me.But this morning he had fallen ill. He was the kind of man who worked through fevers without complaint. So when he said he needed to rest, my mother and I didn’t question him. He was so pale, and I had never seen him look so weak. Normally, he was like an immovable foundation. But lying in that bed, he seemed fragile. It was an alien feeling to see him vulnerable.Before I left, my mother put my lunch in my bag and handed it to me. She took off her necklace - a thin golden cross that her mother gave to her - and put it around my neck. This, other than my dad being sick, was the only change in my morning routine.She said a quick prayer over me, kissed my head, and sent me off to school like she always did.I stepped out into the cold desert morning air. It bit at my cheeks and ears. It was a beautiful morning, and the silence of the desert was almost spiritual. I walked silently. Not out of fear. Rather, I did not want to disturb the peacefulness I was walking through.The moon was still up, a crescent of light guiding my way in tandem with a billion glittering diamonds.That morning, I kept my questions to myself, saving the more urgent ones for my dad. I was so deep in thought that I didn’t notice the first few scraping steps behind me. By the time I did, they had already fallen into rhythm with my own.By the time I did notice, they were already in view. A group of what looked like laborers, walking to nowhere in the dark hours of morning. By the time I remembered my father’s words, “Don’t even look at them,” it was too late. I had been practically gawking at the leader of the shuffling crowd.I saw his head pivot, the brim of his hat turning to meet my gaze. I looked away as fast as I could, but I saw. For the smallest fraction of a second, our eyes met. And that was enough.My father’s words echoed in my head: Don’t even look at them.But then it came — a sound worse than their march.Silence.Every boot had stopped at the exact same instant, scraping dust one last time before falling still. The desert air felt suddenly heavy, the way it does before a storm. I didn’t dare look, but I could feel them. Dozens of eyes pressing against the back of my neck. I kept walking. I prayed under my breath that they would just keep walking. That they'd leave me alone.They did keep walking. Slowly, and in the wrong direction.Every crunch of my boots was answered by theirs, as if we were reflections walking side by side, separated by a river of gravel. I didn’t look, but I felt them there - ten figures in perfect step, only a few feet away.That’s when I heard the first voice.“Hey. Come over here. I need to show you something.”I forced my eyes to stay where they were. And I walked faster. Then another voice,“I need help. Please help me.”Yet a third,“Im lost. Can you give me directions?”And then a choir. Of questions. Of begging. Of demanding.“Your father told me to come get you.”“Don't you remember me?”“I found something shiny. It’s yours if you want it.”I ignored them. I walked faster. They matched my pace. Their voices picked up intensity, snowballing into anger, despair, pleading, screaming and wailing.“I'm hurt! You can't leave me like this!”“I know where your house is. If you don't come here, I'll go kill your Mamma.”“STOP! LOOK AT ME! COME HERE!”Beginning with the desperation of a dying man, weeping like a widow, screaming with rage, yelling with fury. It was unbearable. But still my eyes stayed down. I clutched at my mother's cross, praying softly that they would just leave me alone. That they would just leave me alone.It went on this way for another mile, until I reached the city.The moment dirt gave way to tar, they fell silent. Every voice stopped mid-word. As one, they turned, shuffled back the way they had come, their boots scraping gravel in perfect rhythm. Not one of them looked at me. Not one of them stumbled.It was as if I had never been there at all.And the desert was silent again.I never took off that cross again.I saw them again. Many times until I moved out of my parents house.But never again did I look at them, never again was I tempted to speak to them. I kept my eyes forward and walked. And they did the same.I don't know what would have happened had I listened to their demands. Nor do I know what unreachable destination they're walking to.But I do know that my father's words should be abided by.If you ever see faces you don't recognize, just keep walking.",

      "content_preview": "When I first moved into my new apartment, I honestly thought I’d hit the jackpot. It was cheap, in a quiet neighborhood, and close to work. The building was old, yeah, but it had that vintage charm—creaky wooden floors, brass doorknobs, the kind of place that felt like it had stories to tell. The elevator was slow and groaned like it hated its job, but I didn’t care. I was just happy to finally have a place to myself.The first night, though, something felt… off. The air inside was heavy, almost damp, even with the windows open. It felt like the apartment didn’t want the outside air coming in. I brushed it off—moving stress, I told myself—and went to bed. Around midnight, I woke up to footsteps above me. Slow, steady steps. Except… I was on the top floor. No one lived above me.I tried to rationalize it—old buildings make noises, pipes shift, wood expands—but deep down, I knew it was different. There was a rhythm to those footsteps. Like someone was pacing. I stayed in bed, covers pulled up to my chin, and eventually fell asleep, but I woke up uneasy the next morning.Over the next few days, little things started happening. The bathroom light flickered every time I walked in, even after I replaced the bulb. The hallway mirror—God, this one still makes my skin crawl—would sometimes lag. Like, I’d move, and my reflection would take a split second to catch up. And once, as I was leaving for work, I swear I heard someone whisper my name from the stairwell. It was soft, almost playful. But when I turned around, the stairwell was empty.By the third night, the footsteps came back, louder this time, and there was humming. A soft, low lullaby that made my stomach drop. I sat up in bed, frozen, just staring at the ceiling, listening until it faded away with the sunrise.A couple of days later, I finally met my neighbor across the hall, an old woman named Mrs. Greene. She seemed nervous when I introduced myself. She didn’t even smile, just looked at me with these tired eyes and grabbed my arm. Her grip was surprisingly strong. “Keep your doors locked at night,” she said, her voice shaking. “All of them. Even the ones inside.” Then she just turned and went back inside, leaving me standing there like an idiot, trying to laugh it off.That night, I made sure to lock everything. Front door, bedroom, even the closet. Around 3 a.m., I woke up to the sound of a door creaking open. I sat up, my heart pounding, and saw that my closet door—locked—was open. Just a sliver. Dark as hell inside, like the kind of darkness that eats up light. Then I heard it. That same humming, soft and deliberate, like it was coming from the closet. I couldn’t move. It felt like the room itself was holding me down. I just sat there, frozen, until the sun came up and the door slowly… closed.The next morning, I didn’t go to work. I turned on every light in the apartment and sat on the edge of my bed, shaking. When I finally worked up the courage to check the bedroom door, there were scratch marks on the inside. Long, thin lines running top to bottom, like someone dragged their nails across the wood. They hadn’t been there before.I called my landlord, desperate for some explanation. He just sighed and said, “That place has… history,” and hung up.After that, Mrs. Greene wouldn’t talk to me. She wouldn’t even open her door when I knocked. One time, though, I caught her peeking through the chain. She looked terrified. “It likes attention,” she whispered. “Don’t listen when it calls you.” And then the door slammed shut.By the end of the week, I wasn’t sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, I’d wake up somewhere else. Once in the kitchen, once sitting in the hallway with the front door wide open, and once—this one still haunts me—standing in front of the mirror, my reflection grinning while my face stayed blank.I set up my phone to record one night, just to prove to myself that I was imagining things. The next morning, I played the video. Hours of silence, then, right before it cut off, this low, guttural whisper: “Stay.”That was it for me. I packed everything in a frenzy the next day. I didn’t care about sorting or organizing—I just wanted out. As I dragged the last box toward the door, the whole apartment… changed. The walls groaned, every light flickered, and then—bang—every door in the place slammed shut at the same time. The air went freezing cold. I could see my breath. And then I heard it. My voice. From somewhere inside the apartment. Calling my name. Over and over.It got closer. Louder. Twisted. “You can’t leave,” it whispered, right behind my ear. “You’re mine now.”I don’t remember unlocking the front door. I don’t remember running barefoot down the stairwell, screaming. The next thing I knew, I was standing in the street, shaking, the city sounds wrapping around me like a blanket.I never went back. I left everything—furniture, clothes, even my phone—and checked into a motel across town. Eventually, I found a new place. New building. New neighborhood. No history. But sometimes, late at night, when it’s quiet and I’m alone, I hear that humming again. Soft, patient. Like it’s just waiting for me to come home.",

      "content_preview": "I should never have let him in. I knew it then and I damn well know it now, but hindsight’s a bitch. I keep telling myself that if I had just ignored the banging on my door, if I had just stayed my ass in bed…well, maybe none of this would be happening to me.But guess what I did?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It was around 3am, a few nights ago, and I was lying in bed doom scrolling as usual. You know, typical night owl behavior. I live alone in a one-bedroom near Dallas: nothing to write home about, but it’s been home for about 3 years now, peeling paint, busted blinds and all.I had just decided to put my phone down and try to get some sleep (for probably the 10thtime) when the banging started. Not knocking, mind you, butbanging. Desperate, frantic, as if someone were throwing their whole-body weight against the door.The first thought that crossed my mind was “oh shit, someone’s being chased!”The second was“why me?”But that sound…that banging? You can’t really fake that type of frenzy.So against the better voices in my head, I got out of bed, walked out into the living room and opened the door.Standing outside on my “unless you have pizza, go away” door mat was a guy probably around my age: mid-twenties, maybe. He was pale, gaunt (in the sense that he could use a pizza himself…) and his eyes were bloodshot as if he hadn’t slept in days.The clothes he was wearing looked…odd, to be PC about it. He was wearing torn boots laced with wire, a jacket patched by hand, stitched together with varied pieces fabric that didn’t go together at all, and on the sleeve was an insignia which looked military in nature, half-burned away as if someone tried to erase it and only partially succeeded.He startled and stared at me as ifIwere the one causing a ruckus in the middle of the night on a Thursday.“They said I’d land inbefore,” he rasped, his voice sounding cracked and in need of hydration. “Is this before?”“Erm…” I laughed nervously, peering outside to see if someone were filming this as some sort of weird tiktok trend. “I’m sorry, before what? Do you know what time it is?”Without warning, he pushed past me, barreling into my apartment, and I immediately went intooh shitmode.“Hey, whoa my guy! You can’t just come in here. Who the hell are you?”As he was scraping past me, I caught a whiff of him and boy did he smell. Like a mixture of smoke and iron…but not any sort of iron I’d ever smelled before. It was a chemical-y smell, acrid, like burnt circuitry mixed with wet earth and something coppery…blood, maybe?He peered around my living room like an awestruck tourist, his body shaking, though I couldn’t tell if it were from fear or some weird kindof excitement. He went around the room, touching my lamp, my phone charger, even a pile of assorted junk mail sitting on the coffee table.He stopped and looked at me, a grin slowly spreading across his manic face. “Still work,” he whispered, more to himself than to me. “There’s still electricity, still light.”I cleared my throat and repeated myself, asking who he was and if he were in some sort of trouble or danger.He froze, his eyes filling with tears, and then he smiled. A broken, horrible smile.“You don’t have them yet. They haven’t come.”“What don’t we have?” I asked, starting to get annoyed.He was bouncing with what I assumed was happiness at this point. “The Flags.”He stopped, his voice dropping into something barely audible.“You’ll know them when they come…same flag on every house, in every classroom, waving in every patch of sky they can reach. They watch you through it, your every single move. The flags aren’t fabric – it’s aneye, somehow…you look at it once and you can feel them looking back, watching.”My stomach twisted, and my annoyance grew.But he continued, seemingly impervious to the look of irritation I knew was written on my face. “They…they take the children first. One morning, buses came and picked them up, but never brought them home. Feeds on all security cameras went dark. They said the kids were beingre-educated. That word means something terrifying there.”Then he grabbed my wrist, his grip ice-cold against the warmth of my own skin. He held my wrist so tightly that I couldn’t pull away.“Don’t let them tell you that safety is worth obedience,” he whispered, his voice dropping even lower. “That’s how it all starts. Curfews, registries…neighbors disappearing until people simply stop asking questions. And then—”He stopped, mid-sentence, a look of renewed horror etching itself upon his face. His whole body began to shudder and shake violently, to the point I thought maybe he was OD’ing or having a seizure or something. His mouth remained open, but no words came out.At that moment, the lights in my apartment begin to flicker and buzz but not like some normal power surge. The bulbs dimmedred, twice, like some sorta fucked up electrical heartbeat.He panicked, and blood began to pour from his nose and down his face, dripping onto his clothes and then onto my carpet.“hey! Oh my god, are you okay?! I’m going to call 911—”“NO!”He gripped my wrist even tighter, trying to pull me closer to him. My flight-or-flight instincts began to kick in, and my body was wanting to choose fight. I balled my fists, preparing to defend myself if need be, though I’m no fighter by any means and was more or less counting on him being weak due to his size.“Let me go, now.”“Oh god, no!” He was ignoring me now, due to  the skin blistering around his mouth as if he’d touched something corrosive to his lips. He began clawing in his jacket, fumbling around for something when he suddenly pulled out a small black cube, about the size of a car key fob. Coming from the cube was a humming noise, as if it held a trapped insect of some kind.He shoved into my hands roughly, his skin literally cracking and burning where it held the cube, but he didn’t let it go until I took hold of it.“If it hums again,don’t answer it, no matter what!” he commanded, his voice all of a sudden resolute. “Curiosity may get the better of you, and you may think it’s me. But it’s not me. They wear us like clothes.”“What the fu—”Without waiting to answer any sort of questions or to elaborate (as if anything he’d said up to this point made a lick of sense), he turned to my front door, closed it, turned and looked at me, blinked twice, then opened the door again and stepped through it.Only…he didn’t step outside.Instead, I swear to all that’s holy, I saw spacebendaround the frame of my front door and beyond, as if the air were water and he was slipping beneath the surface. And the sound was like the tearing of fabric. But then he was gone.I stood there, dumbstruck, sure that maybe I was the one on drugs (though I definitely was not) and this was just a really strange trip.A solid five minutes passed before I caught myself and slowly walked over to the door and poked my head through it, looking uneasily around the empty corridor.He was definitely gone.For a brief moment I thought maybe I’d just had some sort of waking dream and that everything that just happened were a figment of my imagination. But I looked down at my hand and I was still clasping that little black cube, which had fallen silent.Just for shits and giggles, I looked outside one more time and then slammed the door shut and locked every lock on it, and then sunk to the floor, my back resting against it.“What the actualfuckjust happened?”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I didn’t get any sleep that night. The smell of the guy lingered in my apartment until well past dawn. No amount of febreezing helped.I put the cube on my coffee table and left it there. It’s actually pretty heavy, unnaturally so, for its size, and the edges are sharp…sharp enough to cut you if you hold it the wrong way. It hasn’t made a single sound since the man forced it onto me and then vanished. But as I’ve sat and watched it, sometimes I think I hear a faint scratching sound, like fingernails on glass.I don’t know what to do with it. Google’s been unhelpful in identifying it and chatgpt says I should either destroy it or take it to the cops. I thought about hiding it away and just forgetting about it, but I don’t know.Part of me is intrigued by it.And then part of me wants to believe that it was just the ramblings of some random, insane dude who, for whatever reason, happened to stumble into my apartment building (which is code-locked now that I remember…). Maybe hewason drugs of some kind or maybe he was in the grips of some sort of manic paranoia.But I can’t stop thinking of the way the world looked when he just disappeared. And his words still ring in my ears, leaving tinges of fear and uncertainty:“You’ll know them when they come.”----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This all happened a few nights ago...and for the first couple of days, the cube was just that: a cube. Silent, still, just a weird thing taking up space on my table.Then, late last night...it hummed. I heard it from my bedroom. It was just once, but it was enough. The sound was low, like a bass note I could literally feel in my teeth.I slowly walked into the living room, wielding a plastic cosplay sword (you know, to do some damage if need be) but the living room was still.I looked at the cube from a distance, but didn't touch it. I somehow felt that would result in my \"answering it,\" which the dude explicitly instructed menot to do.But as I was looking at it, I think for a split second I saw something shift across its surface. Not a reflection but almost as if...something inside were pushing outward.Oh and that scratching sound I was hearing? Yea, it's gotten louder now. I can't tune it out no matter what I do.I don't know what the fuck is going to happen when/if it hums again, and I'm almost sure that I definitely do not want to know...",

      "content_preview": "The street split open under me in Mid-Wilshire.The day I retired, my captain told me I’d earned it. He was wrong.What I’d really earned was a wrecked back, half a lung, and a pension that barely covers rent on a Koreatown one-bedroom where the ceiling fan threatens to decapitate me every time the Red Line rattles underneath.So I drink burnt coffee, watch pigeons fight on the fire escape, and try not to replay the Wilcox fire. Spoiler: I fail. Every day. The flashover, the screaming, the radio static. The order I followed instead of trusting my gut. The half-second that cost Emma’s mother’s life.Emma won’t talk to me anymore. Can’t say I blame her.Outside, LA did what LA always does: honked, screeched, smogged. The air was thicker today, carrying that metallic taste that meant the drilling crews were working overtime. For months now, the city’s been punching holes deep into the earth, chasing geothermal energy like it was the answer to everything. The scientists promised it was safe. Same thing they said about the building codes before Northridge.That morning’s plan was modest: buy groceries, maybe call my sponsor, and finally fix the cabinet hinge in the kitchen that had been loose for six months.I stared at Dave’s number. Two months sober, but some days the bottle still called louder than common sense. Today was one of them.By the time I left, the drilling noise from the Mid-Wilshire site had gotten worse. They’d been at it for weeks, tapping into something six miles down. The ground vibrated constantly, a low thrum that made my teeth ache. Mrs. Kim from downstairs stood by her jacaranda tree, frowning at cracks that had appeared overnight in the sidewalk.“Not good,” she said, pointing. Her English was sparse but her worry was clear.The corner market’s radio was tuned to a call-in show. The host grilled one of the DWP engineers about the drilling project. The scientist kept insisting the borehole was stable, hitting temperatures right where they’d predicted. The host kept pushing: what happens if you hit something unexpected?“The magma chamber is stable,” the engineer said. “We’re nowhere near the active zones.”Famous last words.I grabbed eggs, bread, and the cheap coffee I’d grown accustomed to. The kid at the register looked nervous, glancing out the window every few seconds. Even the pigeons seemed agitated, circling in tight, erratic patterns.Walking back, I felt the first real tremor. Not the usual drilling vibration. This came from deeper, rolling up through the soles of my boots like the earth was clearing its throat. Mrs. Kim’s tree swayed without wind.My coffeemaker rattled across the counter when I got upstairs. Then came the sound — a deep groaning, like metal under stress, but from everywhere at once.I’d heard that sound before. Not from earthquakes. From structural failures. When a building decides it’s done holding up.Except this was the ground itself.The crack appeared with a sound like a rifle shot. A black seam split the asphalt outside my window, running straight down Wilshire toward the drilling site. Steam rose from the gap — not water vapor. Something sharper. Sulfur dioxide.I knew that smell from hazmat training. It meant volcanic activity. In Los Angeles.The delivery van went in first. Front wheel caught the edge as the crack widened, axle snapping, cab tilting nose-down into the gap. The driver was trapped, screaming, while yellow steam poured out around him.I should have walked away. Not my job anymore. The department made that clear when they forced my retirement. “Psychological unfitness for duty,” they called it. What they meant was: Jack Morrison makes bad calls under pressure.But twenty years of running toward disaster don’t just switch off.I grabbed my boots — the ones I swore I’d never need again — and hit the stairs.The crack was wider now, three feet across and growing. Heat rolled up from below, carrying the stench of sulfur and something else. Something organic. Burning.The van’s cab dangled over the edge, metal shrieking with each tremor. One more jolt and the whole thing would drop. I could see the driver inside, hands frozen on the wheel, eyes wide with terror.Just like Sarah Morrison had looked, trapped in that bedroom while the Wilcox fire ate through the floor beneath her. While I stood in the hallway, following orders instead of trusting what I knew.Not this time.I lunged for the van’s door handle, hauled myself up onto the tilting frame. Heat blasted my face as I yanked the door open. The driver — young, maybe twenty-five, wearing a wedding ring — stared at me like I was a hallucination.“You can’t spend it if you’re dead.” I grabbed his jacket, braced against the door frame, and pulled. We tumbled backward onto solid asphalt just as the van’s front end gave way with a scream of tearing metal.The kid rolled away, coughing but alive. I lay flat, staring at gray sky, my lungs burning from the sulfur. My heart hammered like I was twenty again.That’s when I heard it. The roar.Not from above. From below. A sound like a freight train bearing down, muffled by six miles of rock but getting louder. The drilling had found something, all right. Something that didn’t want to stay buried.The eruption wasn’t the Hollywood version. No graceful fountain of molten rock. This was violent. The street split wider with a sound like the world cracking open. Superheated gas blasted out, carrying chunks of debris that hit like shrapnel. A glowing mass of rock and metal — what used to be the van — shot skyward and crashed into a storefront.Ash began to fall. Real ash, volcanic ash, turning morning into dusk. It stung exposed skin and made every breath a struggle. The air tasted like metal and sulfur.Then I saw the city bus.It had stopped maybe fifty yards away, passengers pressed against windows, driver frozen at the wheel as a new crack raced toward his front tires. The ground under the bus was already sagging, asphalt turning soft from the heat below.Twenty-three people on that bus. I counted them through the windows.Same number that died in the Wilcox fire because I waited for orders instead of acting.My legs moved before my brain caught up. The bus driver was shouting into his radio, trying to back up, but the crack was too wide now. The front end tilted forward, hydraulics screaming.A woman in scrubs — mid-twenties, composed despite the chaos — was already pushing passengers toward the rear exit. Smart. But not fast enough. The bus was going down.I reached the front door as it tilted past the point of no return. “Everybody out! Now!” The voice that came out was the one I’d used for twenty years, the one that made people move without thinking. “Back exit only!”The nurse caught my eye through the glass. A moment of recognition — two people who knew what they were doing in a world gone insane. She nodded and kept pushing passengers toward safety.The bus folded in half as I pulled the last person free — an elderly man who kept apologizing for being slow. It tumbled into the crack, swallowed whole.Ash fell thicker now, and the roar from below grew constant. The drilling site had become a wound in the earth, vomiting fire and rock into the sky. Car alarms wailed. Windows shattered. Someone was screaming for help.Mrs. Kim stood by her broken tree, soot-covered, looking at me with something I hadn’t seen in anyone’s eyes for a long time.Trust.The nurse appeared at my elbow, hair gray with ash, stethoscope around her neck like a talisman. “What do we do?” she asked.Behind her, the survivors clustered together — the bus passengers, neighbors who’d run from their buildings, the van driver. Fifteen, maybe twenty people. Looking at me like I had answers.Like I was still a firefighter.The truth was, I didn’t know what came next. The ground was still splitting, still vomiting up the contents of the earth. No sirens yet. No help coming.Just us. Just me.But for the first time since Wilcox, I wasn’t paralyzed by the choice. Sarah Morrison was gone. These people weren’t.“We move inland,” I said. “Away from the drilling sites. Find high ground and wait for rescue.”The nurse nodded. “I’m Rebecca. I can handle medical.”“Jack. I know evacuation.”As if on cue, another section of street collapsed, taking out the corner market where I’d bought coffee an hour ago. The Korean owner ran toward us, clutching a cash register, looking stunned.Mrs. Kim barked at him in Korean, then looked at me. “He asks if you know the way.”I glanced back at the growing fissure, the column of ash and fire climbing into what used to be a clear morning sky. Los Angeles was tearing itself apart, one street at a time.“Yeah,” I said, surprising myself with how steady my voice sounded. “I know the way.”For the first time in two years, it wasn’t a lie.",

      "content_preview": "PART 1.PART 2.- - - - -I’m aware that this recollection has been a bit…meandering. I want to apologize for that. It wasn’t my intent. This was supposed to be a warning and a confession; nothing more, nothing less.As a means of narrative restitution, allow me to provide the punchline a little early:CLM Pharmaceuticalsused me, and I let them do it. Hell, I think I practically begged them to. As much as I’d like to hate them, as revolting as their methodologies were, as grossly misguided as their endgame was, I have to admit:They’ve designed a beautiful machine.At the outset of my first two reports, I carved out space to wax philosophy regarding a pair of cognitive misconceptions: the narcissistic self-deceit of temptation, and the weaponized dreaming of assumption. These preambles may have seemed out of place. In fact, I don’t even blame The Executive for describing those passages to be, in his words:“grandiose, high-falutin, and profoundly, profoundly dumb”.I acknowledge the criticism, but I promise I’ve found the point.It was the laying of a foundation. Mental groundwork for something much larger. A curated tour through our shared deficits that can only progress forward to a fated destination, the inescapable terminus of our species - something so powerful, so endless, so godamnned cancerous in its will to live, that it has pulled us up from the depths of the primordial slurry just as much as it will eventually push us back under the surface. What goes up, must come down.Belief. Belief is the hand of God and the key to all of this. Everything else is just cannon fodder.Objective domains - logic, mathematics, physics, science, rationality, ethics, decency - none of these things govern the world. They have a seat at the table, yes, but when push comes to shove, they all answer to belief. Weshouldbe objective. Objectivity will keep us alive. It aligns with nature. It’s predictable. Reliable. And yet, objectivity would claim we shouldn’t exist. Our propulsion to the top of the food chain is a one-in-a-billion phenomenon. Add in the birth, maturation, and maintenance of a global society? Those odds become one-in-a-billion-billions.It’s genuinely unfathomable, but I supposethat’sthe point.We fathomed it.Webelievedwe could survive. Our oldest ancestors rebelled against the objective odds and the constraints of nature, the guardrails erected to prevent one particular set of genetics from becoming king, and now, here we stand. It was a lie so potent that reality bent under its weight, changing its shape to accommodate our demands. We grew. We thrived. We ascended to Godhood. We took the earth like we owned it. Like it was madeforus.It was an impressive dynasty while it lasted.After all, what does a conqueror do when there’s nothing left to conquer? They find something new to dominate, some new way to expand, some new foe to defeat, and, inevitably, their growth becomes unsustainable, and they collapse under their own weight like a neutron star. A dying cancer that’s outgrown its vascular supply. Without the fight for survival, they become slaves to their own vanity.  And they only get to that place by continuing to sculpt reality to fit their heroic, larger-than-life, self-obsessed story.Temptation, assumption, belief.But enough table setting.Before The Executive’s narrative intrusion, we left off in May.At the time, I believed I was a chemist. Believed I was a loving mother to an unclear number of children. Believed I lived with Linda, my wife of ten, or twenty, or thirty years, somewhere within city limits, trekking to theCLM Pharmaceuticalscompound on the outskirts of that city to work my well paid, dream job.There was only one fact that defied meager belief; something that was undeniably, objectively, infallibly true.I ate the oil.It crawled inside me, and we were unified.I just didn’t know what happenedafterthat.Or, more accurately,I believed I didn’t know.- - - - -May 30th, 2025 - EveningLinda and I first met in the half-darkness of a rundown dive bar, both mentally in our twenties, though physically much closer to our thirties. One of us was tending the bar, but I can’t recall if it was me or her.God, she was radiant. Smart as a whip, too. Half-way through her PH.D. dissertation, she informed me. That’s why she was there, I think. Drinking to cool her mind, which had been overheating from the stress. Or maybe she was working there to pay her way through grad school. Or perhaps I was working there to paymy waythrough grad school.I suppose it doesn’t matter who was on which side of the sticky, wooden countertop: minutes before the bar closed, we kissed under the sharp glow of the Christmas-colored fairy lights strung along the ceiling, and that was that. The exchange was transcendent. We were in love.Decades later, things were different.Prior to accepting the position, if anyone was brave enough to ask about the state of our marriage, I’d ice over my features and volunteer an overly generous one-word answer.“Strained.”And that wasbeforeLinda began materializing in the empty space created by my company-mandated meditation sessions, face horrifically melded with one of the compound’s security cameras, a single cyclopean lens staring longingly in my direction, her lips contorted into a knowing smile. Shit put me on edge, but it felt irrational to blame her. She wasn’tactuallyinfiltrating my subconscious, like some Freddy Krueger to an all-femaleElm Streetreboot. No, I was tormenting myself. Attributed it to unresolved angst regarding her incessant hovering after the affair.Still.I couldn’t stand the sight of her, and I was only getting more bitter as time went on.Her eyes followed my every movement as I prepared for another fruitless day in the lab, badly pretending to appear occupied with a newspaper or a book. When I called her out, mentioned how much I despised the surveillance, she'd deny it, claiming I was paranoid. If I acted evenslightlyoff, the barrage of questions that inevitably rained down on my head felt liable to give me a concussion. How are you doing? Are you feeling all right? Headaches? Neck pain? Nausea? Vomiting? Itchiness? Dysentery? Numbness and tingling? Urinary frequency? Blood seeping from anywhere? Blood seeping fromeverywhere? And that wasn’t even the worst of it. One night, I could have sworn I caught her watching me sleep, standing motionless at the end of the bed, looming over the mattress like an omen. That said, I don’t recall confronting her, which leads me to believe it was just another odd manifestation of my ailing subconscious.Given her relentless supervision, you might assume she’d go nuclear if I actually expressed concern. Maddeningly, this turned outnotto be the case.“Linda -“I started, sitting at the edge of our bed in the middle of the night, breaking a long streak of selective mutism while in her presence,“- do you ever hear strange noises coming from the front of the house, early in the morning?”Her body sprang upright from under the covers with a shocking amount of force.“How do you mean, sweetheart?”she rasped.I’d believed she was deep in the throes of sleep, but, judging by the snappiness of her reaction, she must have been wide awake when I posed the question. She startled me, but I tried not to let it show. Being forthright with any emotion, any reaction, any piece of myself - no matter how trivial - was distance from her I was unwilling to concede.“I don’t know…they’re like…soft thumps. Creaking. Movement of some kind. I hear them every morning as I’m…getting ready for work.”More accurately, I heard them as my daily meditation was coming to a close, but I never disclosed those obligatory sessions to Linda, and she always slept through them. Just another few inches of precious distance from my wife that I refused to forfeit willingly.I braced myself for the onslaught of follow-up questions. Harsh tension swelled in my shoulders. After a slight pause, she replied.“Eh, I wouldn’t worry about it.”Linda flopped down like a deactivated animatronic and turned away from me.“Just go back to sleep. You have work in a few hours, right?”I don’t know how long I remained at the edge of the bed, gaze fixed on an oddly shaped crack in the wall. The plaster was perfectly smooth, save for the crack. A craggy oval no bigger than a thumbprint. She was right, of course. I needed to lie down and sleep, but I couldn’t look away. My eyes traced the defect, looping through its contours, over and over and over again, running a seemingly endless race. Where did it come from? Why was it there? Something about it spoke to me, even if I couldn't understand what it was saying.It was, in the end, my liberator, my canary in the coal mine,My dear Ouroboros.- - - - -May 31st - MorningThe vibrating of my phone’s alarm ripped me from sleep at 4:30 AM. I reached under my pillow, silenced it, and lumbered out of bed. A wide, cavernous yawn spilled from lips. The cool touch of the floor triggered a wave of goosebumps across my uncovered calves. I clasped my hands, deposited them in the hole created by my crossed legs, took a breath, and emptied my mind.For whatever reason, I found myself dreaming of our first kiss. The smell of stale beer, which I both detested because it caused me to gag and adored because it reminded me of better days, coated the inside of my nostrils. The twinkle of the fairy lights knocked against my closed eyelids. Her lips felt warm and perfect.Before long, however, tiny flecks of pain began to accumulate in my chest. Quickly, sparks became flames.I couldn’t breathe.Instinctively, I tried to pull my mouth away, but I felt myself pulling Linda’s head with me. That’s when I realized our lips were tightly sealed together. Our melded flesh was inseparable. A scream bubbled up my throat, but, having nowhere else to go, promptly rattled down Linda’s throat. The exact same scream seemed to echo back into me, I’d scream once more, and the cycle would continue.Suddenly, I thought of my eyes repeatedly tracing the crack in the wall.I experienced a massive, nigh-cataclysmic head rush, powerful enough to send the back of my skull crashing into the bedroom floor, releasing me from that hellscape. Multiplethumpsmade their way to my ears: one was most certainly the collision, but the remaining - who could say? As I recovered, gripping my temple and quietly groaning, the conversation I had with my wife the night prior started trickling into my mind’s eye.For the first and only time, I called out of work. Tried to, at least. When I phoned HR to report my“illness”, all I got was an answering machine.A few hours later, I watched Linda prepare breakfast from the kitchen table, boiling over with rage, those five words she’d said seeming to create a real, physical pressure inside my head.I wouldn’t worry about it.I wouldn’t worry about it.I wouldn’t worry about it.But why the fuck wouldn't I worry about it?“You know, I heard those thumps again this morning!”I bellowed. I meant for the statement to sound pointed, but I didn’t mean to shout it. Linda jumped at the sound, the grease-tipped spatula flying from her hand.She caught her breath, bent over with one hand to her chest while the other braced the countertop. Then, she spoke.“Honey, honestly, I wouldn’t -”I cut her off. For her own benefit, mind you. I think if Linda completedthatsentence, I truly would have gone ballistic.“You know what I think? I think we should install some security cameras. Actually, no, notshould*, we’re*goingto install some security cameras. Someone may be trespassing in our home, goddamnit, it's not safe. I’m going to run to the hardware store. Today.”She placed the sizzling pan of bacon aside the stovetop, sighed, and spun towards me. Before she could say anything, we were both distracted by the sound of a frenzied stampede upstairs. Multiple pairs of child-sized feet thudded across the ceiling. We followed the sound as it moved towards the top of the stairs, unaccompanied by giggling or singing or anything appropriately child-like. Abruptly and without ceremony, the stampede concluded. I stared at the bottom few steps from my position at the table, waiting, slightly dumbfounded. Nothing and no one came rushing down the stairs.Without warning, Linda blurted out:“I’ll do it!”I turned to face her. She was sweating. Her grin was wobbly and awkward.“What?”I muttered, feeling newly disoriented.“I’ll…I’ll do it. I’ll go to the hardware store. You’re sick, right? That’s why you called out of work? You should rest.”For some reason, that was enough. I found myself both sufficiently placated and extraordinarily wiped out. I trudged upstairs without eating, made my way down the hallway, intermittently leaning against the walls for support. The bedroom was an icebox. I slipped under the covers and tried to sleep. I’m not sure whether I was successful. If I was, I dreamt of tracing my eyes along the oval-shaped crack in the wall.By the next morning, someone had installed cameras around our front door.And I suppose that was also enough.Because I arrived atCLM Pharmaceuticalswith a smile on my face.- - - - -June 15th - Evening“Linda, show me the recordings,”I growled.She paced frantically across the kitchen tile, forming small, crooked circles with her feet, one trembling hand clutching her sternum like she was on the verge of an asthma attack, the other holding a crop of frizzy blonde and gray hairs taut above her head. The woman appeared to be unraveling. I felt a dull shimmer of sympathy somewhere inside me, but it was buried under thick layers of confusion and anger and profound frustration.I would not be dissuaded.“Sweetheart, Ipromiseyou, I’ve reviewed them all, and there’s nothing to be seen…”she begged, rejecting my attempts to make eye contact.“I. Want. To see it. For myself.”The words were blunt and drawn out, as if poor comprehension was truly the issue at hand.Abruptly, she paused her manic spinning. Her eyes darted back and forth across the floor, her hand now clutching her forehead instead of her chest. It was the same expression she adopted when she was forced to do long division in her head. The internal calculations continued for more than a minute. I let her computing go on unabated, assuming she was on the precipice of finally agreeing to let me see the footage around the time of the unexplainedthumping. Then, as abruptly as they had ceased, the crooked circles started once more.“Okay, it should be fine,”she remarked, pacing,“but let me just make one quick call beforehand…”I’m not proud of it, but I exploded at my wife.“Who?Who???Who could you possibly need to call,and why?”I screamed.She couldn’t conjure a response to the question. It barely even seemed to register. My anger grew, and seethed, and writhed, and just when I thought I truly was about to erupt, just when it felt like I was dissolving to ash under the emotional heat, my anger died out. Suffocated in an instant, like a lit match plunged into the vacuum of space. What remained in its absence was a hungry, gnawing disappointment.This isn’t the woman I married. Not anymore- I thought.I steadied my breathing, smiled weakly, stepped towards Linda, and placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. She stopped moving and turned to me.“Listen - if you don’t show me, I’m gone. I’ll leave, and I won’t come back.”There was another prolonged instance of calculation - eyes drifting cryptically around their sockets - but eventually, she nodded.Linda returned to the kitchen twenty minutes later, holding her open laptop tight to her chest. I reached out to take it from her, but her free hand grasped mine before I could. Finally, she was looking at me dead-on. We stood frozen for a few seconds, eyes and hands intertwined, and then she repeated herself.“I promise, Helen, there’snothingon the recordings. It’s important for you to know that beforehand. It’s critical that you believe me,”she whispered.I didn’t understand, but I would not let that fact stop me, either.“Okay. I believe you, love. I just need to see for myself.”She relinquished the laptop with palpable reticence, and nervously watched as I sat down at the table to review the recordings.To my surprise, she didn’t appear to be lying.Every morning was the same. The camera posted above our doorbell recorded dawn’s arrival to our sleepy city street, isolated from the bustle of downtown. No intruders coming or going. No people at all, actually. No explanation for thethumpswhatsoever. Something wasn’t right, though. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I felt a tickle in the back of my skull that wouldn’t go away. So, when I was finished fast-forwarding through all fourteen recordings, I started again.I watched them a third time. My unease festered. What was wrong? What wasn’t I seeing?There was a fourth viewing, followed by a fifth, followed by a sixth.That tickling sensation had progressed from mild discomfort to a full-on feeling of impending doom. I was on the cusp of something, teetering. To keep looking, to keep inspecting, to keep my eyes rolling across the proverbial crack in the wall - change was guarenteed.I had a choice to make: close the laptop and try to move on, or peel away the veil.In the end, I continued.What goes up, must come crashing down.My eyes went wide. A trembling finger paused the recording.I rewound it and played the clip once more.It happened again. I hadn’t imagined it.The camera was pointed toward the east. In the footage, the sun rose over the horizon, but there was a point in the recording where its position appeared tojump. It was subtle, but undeniable. The ball of fire skipped up a few inches in the sky, like some time was missing. I checked the next day: same phenomenon at the same moment, about five minutes after my “meditation” was due to end every morning.Same with the following day, and the day after that, and then, finally, as I looked deeper, the facade began to unravel.On the next day’s footage, the city block disappeared. It was there when I reviewed it before, but now, it was gone. In its place, I saw a poorly maintained asphalt street, and beyond that, an empty field.I moved on to the day after that. The street was gone and there was a fence in the distance, but where chain-linkshouldhave been, there were panels of reflective glass.At that point, I couldn't stop myself.I'd seen too much.And when I had seen enough, when the sun’s trajectory through the sky became smooth and unhampered, when the veil was fully pulled back, I sawthemleaving my home.Naked. Gray, translucent skin. Men and women. Clumsy, arthritic-looking movement. They exited, pulled the front door closed behind them, creaked across the driveway, onto the street, and eventually, out of frame, always to the left.I slammed the laptop shut and shot up from the table. Unexpectedly, I collided with Linda. She had been silently hovering over my shoulders for God knows how long. I pushed her away with all the force I could muster. She crashed into the wall.From across the kitchen, I stared at her, and her face began to twist and contort.“No, no, no…”I whimpered.Her gray hairs multiplied. Her left eye swam up her forehead until it was significantly above her right. Her skin rippled quietly like the surface of a lake, settling after someone had thrown a rock into it.“Who…who are you?”She smiled, revealing a mouth saturated with pegged teeth.“I’m Linda. I take care of Helen. I make sure Helen goes to work. I’m married to Helen. Helen and I have children. Helen and I are supremely happy. I make sure Helen doesn’t leave. I love Helen.”I couldn’t take anymore. I sprinted past her and down the hall, grabbing my car keys, spilling out the front door. Although the scenery outside my home now matched the recordings, I was relieved to find my car in the driveway. I threw myself onto the driver’s seat and jammed the keys into the ignition. For a moment, I became paralyzed, overwhelmed, shaking violently, wheezing and sobbing.I pulled myself together.Grief could wait.I needed to drive.My bare heel collapsed onto the gas pedal. At the same time, I glimpsed a flicker of approaching movement in the periphery.I had no time to brake. That said, I don’t know that I would have even if I had the time to consider the ramifications.The ghoulish Xerox of my wife leapt onto the car. She hammered a fist into the windshield, then into the hood, and then she toppled over the front, disappearing under the wheels.There wasn’t a sickening crunch.No soggy squish of eviscerated tissue.The maiming was eerily silent.I felt the vehicle rise and fall without protest,like driving over unplowed snow.Eventually, I did brake, tires screeching against the asphalt. It was reflexive. On cursory examination, I had just run over my wife, although the truth of the matter was much more perverse. I placed the car in park. Wearily, I slid out to see what remained of her.I shouldn't have done that.Her body had been trisected, wide incisions made at her knees and her rib cage. Splotches of grayish foam littered the area.The inside of her chest was completely hollow and lined with gray, rippling flesh. Same with her abdomen.The top third of her was, somehow, still talking.“I’m Linda. I take care of Helen. I make sure Helen goes to work…”She fixed her eyes on the overcast sky. I couldn’t tell if she was speaking to me or for her own benefit, reciting her directives in a sort of dying prayer.My cellphone vibrated in my pocket.I couldn’t take myself away from the carnage, but I managed to answer.Static hummed on the other end.Eventually, they spoke.“You must know I didn't want this for you. It's a real shame. Come to the compound. We have some matters to discuss.”I turned my head, looked down the road, and saw it.A dome-shaped building that narrowed at the center and extended high into the atmosphere, only a ten-minute walk from where I was standing.The line clicked dead. I slipped the phone back into my pocket and turned back to Linda.She wasn’t speaking, and her head wasn’t to the sky.My wife was motionless, eyes glazed over but pointed straight at me.Her expression didn’t strike me as truly happy or truly sad. It was conflicted, but resolute. She lived and died for me, as she understood it.Bittersweet is probably close.When I couldn’t stand to look any longer, I turned away and began walking towards the compound.I thought about driving there, but I found myself unable to get behind the wheel again.I couldn’t stomach the bright red flashing of the brake lights or the bright green icons on the car’s dashboard.They reminded me of the Christmas-colored fairy lights.I imagine the venom of that nostalgia would have killed me outright,and I still had things to do.- - - - -Final entryto follow.",

      "content_preview": "I don’t want sympathy. I’m not looking for theories about sleep deprivation or campfire smoke messing with my head.I just want someone to tell me I’m not crazy.Because I know what I heard in those trees. I know what I saw just outside the firelight. I know what it left behind.You can say I’m mistaken. That’s fine.Just don’t tell me it wasn’t real.It was my friend Marcus’s idea. It’s always Marcus’s idea—winter hikes, off-trail shortcuts, rafting when the river advisories say don’t. I usually give him a hard time and go anyway. But this time I pushed back more than usual.“Where is it?” I asked.“Old service road, maybe an hour off the highway.” He was scrolling on his phone, showing me a satellite view. A smear of green, a thin silver line, and then nothing—no campsites, no picnic icons, no little tent symbol. “Guy on a hunting forum flagged a clearing way out past the marked trails. Said it was quiet. No trash. No sign anyone’s camped there in years.”“It’s posted?”He shrugged. “Land management map says public. Nobody’s going to be out there.”I should’ve said no.We left early Friday—tents, water filters, a hatchet, lanterns, my old Polaroid camera because I liked the way photos feel when they develop in your hand. The truck rattled up a rutted road and died in a patch of gravel and weeds. Past that, the trees closed in. No cell service. No noise from the highway. Just us.We cut through knee-high ferns and ankle-grabbing roots, worked our way deeper, and deeper, until the forest swallowed the ribbon of sky behind us. Marcus checked his grandfather’s brass compass every twenty minutes, tapping the glass like it would balk if he didn’t remind it of north. He had flagging tape—bright orange—looped around his wrist. Every hundred yards he tied a strip to a branch.“Belt and suspenders,” he said, nodding at the compass and the tape. “No one’s getting lost.”Four hours later, we reached the clearing.It was bigger than I expected. Not a meadow—nothing as soft as that—but a broad circle of flattened grass surrounded by tall pines and black spruce. The ground sat strangely level, like someone had shaved the ridge and pressed it flat with a giant hand. No fire rings. No bottle caps. Not even old ash kicked into dirt. The place felt untouched.And very, very quiet.No wind. No birds. Not even the invisible hiss of insects that usually fills the spaces between trees. It felt like the forest had paused mid-breath to listen.“Feels dead,” I said.Marcus grinned. “Feels perfect.”We set camp at the edge of the circle—two tents, a low fire pit scraped to mineral soil, food hung in a bear bag high on a limb. The light slid down the trunks and pooled at the base of the trees until it all went the color of copper. I snapped a Polaroid of the clearing—the pale grass, the two tents, the orange tape flickering on the perimeter like desperate little flags—and tucked the picture warm into my jacket pocket.We ate beans and jerky cross-legged by the fire. Marcus told a story about his grandfather giving him the compass and telling him never to trust a trail that looks too easy.“Like this one?” I asked, nodding toward the opening we’d carved into the brush.He poked the fire. “This isn’t a trail.”The shadows stretched thin and long. The trees’ silhouettes leaned over us until the circle of sky was a coin you could cover with your palm. I tried to name constellations. They seemed wrong. Shifted. The stars looked too sharp, like points punched through a black sheet.When the fire burned down to heart-coals, we crawled into our tents. The nylon mushed the world into soft shapes and softer sounds. The zipper teeth muttered closed. I lay on my back and watched my breath fog the beam of my headlamp.Sometime after midnight, I woke to a sound.Not twigs popping. Not the light patter of a deer stepping cautious through brush.Breathing.Slow. Heavy. In and out, like bellows. Not close, not far. Just past the reach of the firelight, where the clearing pressed against the dark. It paced, measured, circling. The breaths didn’t match the rhythm of mine. They didn’t match Marcus’s, either; I could hear his soft, regular snore through the fabric. This was deeper. Deliberate. Something that enjoyed the drag of air.Then the scrape.Not on rocks. On bark. The long whisper of something hard and pointed drawn down a trunk. A pause. Another trunk. Another pause. Around us.I held my breath until my chest hurt, until my body insisted on air and I let a little out and drew a little in, trying to move the tent as little as possible.The breaths went on.At some point—with no sound marking it—the air felt different. Thinner. Cleaner. The breathing wasn’t gone, exactly. It was… sated. Or amused. Or something I don’t have a word for.When I woke again, it was gray morning and my mouth tasted like I’d been sucking pennies. Marcus had the camp stove going and kept glancing over my shoulder at the trees.“You hear anything?” he asked.“Breathing,” I said.He nodded once, like that was an answer he’d been waiting for and didn’t like. “We’ll check the treeline after coffee.”We followed the orange tape we’d tied the day before, shaking night from our legs. Fifteen feet into the trees, there were marks on a spruce: four parallel grooves, deep as a thumbnail is wide, scored from shoulder height down to the roots. The cuts were clean. Not bear. Not anything with a claw that tears and splinters. It looked like someone had carved meat from the wood with a blade that wasn’t smooth.We found more marks. On three different trunks around the clearing, all at the same height. All pointed inward.“Cougar?” I said, even though I knew that wasn’t right.“Cougars don’t do that,” Marcus said. His fingers brushed the grooves and came back with resin shining. Fresh.We left it. We had a day to fill, and pretending things are normal is an easy way to move your legs. We took the stream trail Marcus swore he’d seen on a topo map. It wasn’t a trail, exactly, but it was a depression in the duff that suggested other feet had once passed through. The forest opened a little into a place where light caught in the needles like dust and the water ran in a black vein across stones.On the opposite bank, I saw them.Carvings, in a dead oak that leaned over the creek. Dozens, maybe hundreds of little figures razor-cut into the bark, each no bigger than a matchbox. The same symbol over and over: a human shape bent backward so far its spine made a circle. Thin arms extended, thin legs braced, head tipped to the sky or where the sky should be if there weren’t trees.Every one of them faced the direction of our clearing.“Hey,” I said, pointing.Marcus stared for a long time. “Those weren’t here last time.”Last time. My skin tightened. “You’ve been out here before?”He didn’t answer. He crouched and wetted a handkerchief in the stream, then scrubbed the closest marks. The water ran gray and then pinkish. The carvings had bled; whoever made them had cut through live cambium. He touched the pocket with his compass like he was checking it was still there.We said very little the rest of the day.Back at the clearing, we rebuilt the fire and stacked extra wood within reach. I swapped dead batteries for fresh. The first stars blinked through. I took another Polaroid, more to busy my hands than to make a record: tents, fire, Marcus’s profile in the orange light, the ring of trees beyond.The smell came just after full dark.Sweet and wrong. Not garbage, not skunk, not rot exactly. Like fruit syrup that’s been heated and left to sit until it turns. It moved before the breathing did, a soft ribbon of scent that slipped over the circle, tasting us, then slid back to the black.Marcus’s knuckles were white around the haft of the hatchet. “Stay put,” he said, like I was thinking of wandering off.The breathing started again.Closer this time. It drew around us like a tide around an island. In and out, slow enough to count. Something scraped wood—lightly at first, then with pressure, then lightly again, like fingers testing grain.My lantern stuttered. Not out. Just a slow dimming and brightening like a pulse syncing to the breaths.The laugh came after.If you can call it a laugh. Sound shaped wrong. A lung pushing air and catching on something to make it rise at the edges. Amusement without a mouth.It froze me harder than the breathing.The shadows at the edge of the clearing leaned; that’s the only way I can say it. The dark pushed itself closer, not by walking but by sort of reorganizing where it was. The fire had to decide how far it reached, and it chose us and nothing else.Something stood just beyond that reach.I saw the outline as a cut in the dark, not because it reflected light but because it refused it. Tall. Much too tall. Arms long and loose at its sides. Shoulders pointed. Ribs like the slats of an old barrel. A head tilted the wrong way, like a listening dog that doesn’t understand you.I brought the Polaroid to my face and pressed the shutter.The flash punched a hole in the night.When it collapsed back in, the edge of the clearing was empty. The smell thickened.We didn’t say a word. We didn’t sleep. Every noise meant the same thing so words weren’t useful anymore.By dawn, mist hung knee-high over the grass. Everything that should have felt like relief just felt like a reprieve.I checked the Polaroid as we packed.The clearing wasn’t there. No trees. No tents. No auras of firelight. The whole frame was a wash of whiteness like snow with no texture. Centered on it—perfectly centered—was a little figure, bent backward into a circle.Smiling with a mouth thin as a cut.My first thought was that the camera was broken. But when I lifted it, I could feel the warm square still developing under my thumb. The lens was intact. The shutter had worked, and something had worked back.“We’re leaving,” Marcus said. His voice was raw from not talking.We should have made it back in three hours. It took us nine.The forest we entered wasn’t the forest we left. The orange tape we’d tied on the way in hung in different places—higher on some trees, lower on others, and on one trunk it was threaded through a ring of gouges like someone had looped it into a smile. We reached places we didn’t remember passing and didn’t reach places we should have hit. The compass needle trembled in a slow circle no matter how often Marcus tapped the glass.By mid-afternoon, I saw our own footprints in a patch of damp loam where a seep ran across the path. I felt a rush of relief—proof of a loop we could break if we only turned—but when I pressed my boot into the print it didn’t match. The tread pattern was right. The size was right. But the angle of the heel, the depth of pressure, the place where I scuffed my toe—none of it lined up with the way I walked. It was like the forest had traced my step wrong, or decided to try wearing it.We stopped at a low rise to drink. That’s when I noticed the cairns.Little stacks of rocks, no higher than my knee, circled the knoll. The top stone on each pile was a thin, flat piece carved with the same figure as the tree—the bent spine, the ring, the narrow arms—scratched with something sharper than a knife. Every cairn faced the direction we were traveling. All of them were new; their bases sat on leaves that hadn’t browned or curled. One stack had a feather tucked under the top stone. The feather was wet with something sweet and sticky.Marcus’s face had gone a strange color. “We need to step off,” he said. “This is bad sign.” He said it like a phrase his grandfather had taught him along with how to hold a compass and how to clean a fish. He cut left, deeper into a tangle of young fir. I followed because going a different way from the only person you came with felt like volunteering to be the lesson the woods wanted to teach.It got darker in the fir. Sound deadened. Our breath sounded too loud. The air felt warm in a way that wasn’t temperature. It felt like the woods had been warmed once, long ago, and remembered it now.We broke out of the fir into another clearing.Smaller than the first. Oval. The grass here was different—shorter, slicker, like hair on skin. The trees around it leaned inward a degree or two, enough to notice if you stood still. The sky above it pressed closer than it should.In the center, there was a ring of wood. Not a structure, not a fence—just logs laid end to end in a perfect circle, bark peeled, pale wood exposed. Each log’s inner face was etched with the same figure as the tree, as the stones, as the Polaroid. On the outside of the circle, in the grass, were little arrangements of things—bird bones wired together with thin twine, teeth strung like beads, ropes braided of something that looked like fibers and looked like hair.I didn’t step into the ring. Every part of me that still believed in being untouched by things like fear and consequences refused all at once.Marcus edged along the perimeter and crouched. The pale wood wasn’t dry. It was damp. It smelled sweet.“Let’s go,” he said.We didn’t argue about direction anymore. We went away.The forest let us.By the time we reached the campsite, the sun was low and the clearing had that orange glow that makes everything it touches seem like a memory of itself. We didn’t see our tents until we were right at them. They looked… wrong. A little too tall. A little too narrow. The lines weren’t exactly the lines we’d pitched.The bear bag hung on its limb, fat with food. The knot I’d used to tie it off was a knot I don’t know how to tie.“Did you—” I started.“No,” Marcus said.My Polaroid was on my sleeping pad, face down. I hadn’t left it there. When I turned it over, it was a photo of the clearing, at night, with two figures standing at the edge where the trees begin. They were taller than the trees. They were bent backward in that circle way, arms too long and too slack. Between them, hanging on nothing, was something that might have been a smile.Our fire pit had been rearranged. Not scattered—rearranged. The stones were stacked into a ring taller than my calf, maybe twenty inches high. There were marks on the inside of each stone—burns, but not from fire. Smudges, like something had exhaled on them until they turned black.“Pack,” Marcus said. The word sounded like it hurt to push out. “We’re not staying another night.”We moved fast. I shoved the Polaroid under my shirt because my pack felt too far away from my skin. I didn’t notice right away that the bright strips of orange tape on the perimeter branches were no longer bright. Their color had leeched to a pale, dull peach, like a photo left in the sun.We should have left then.We didn’t.We were slow because there were more things to look at than our hands. We were slow because we didn’t want to turn our backs to the trees. We were slow because the world was the size of a circle and there was more outside it than there had been when we walked in.By the time we had everything in place, the light had dipped into that last band of day when you can pretend you’re not about to be shut in. The forest’s quiet had grown teeth.“It’ll be worse in the dark,” I said.“I know,” Marcus said. He said it like he was agreeing with gravity. He swung his pack up. He didn’t look at me. “Go.”We went.We didn’t get very far.The tape we’d put up wasn’t ours. It still sat on the branches where we’d tied it, but the knots were too tight, the tails too even. On one tree, someone had braided the tape into a little rope. On another, the end had been cut clean, not torn, the edges heat-sealed like plastic cut by wire. And on another, the tape hung in two strips like a pair of lips—one long, one short—and someone had scratched the bent-back figure into the bark between them where a mouth would be.We walked faster.The forest walked with us.When we stopped to breathe, everything else stopped too.When we started again, we didn’t know we had until a branch cracked somewhere to our left and the crack was answered by a crack to our right the same distance away. Like something pacing us at the distance of a thought.Full dark fell in a way that felt more like being closed in than losing light.The breathing came immediately.Not outside us. Around us. The sound didn’t come from a place; it unrolled like a coil and we were in the center of it. Inhale. Exhale. Slow. Measured. Not the rhythm of an animal moving under its weight and air. The rhythm of something counting.We kept going because stopping meant choosing a position to die in.I don’t know how long we walked. My hands hurt from where nail met skin. My breath made small clouds that turned to black faster than they should.Somewhere in the middle of that, I realized Marcus wasn’t beside me.I turned.My headlamp picked out trunks and brush and the white flash of the tape. There wasn’t a sound of me and there wasn’t a sound of Marcus. The breathing went on like we were nothing in it.“Marcus?” I said, not loud. That word didn’t belong in the breathing.No answer.“Marcus,” I tried again.The breathing stopped.The forest held absolutely still.Then something in front of me moved that wasn’t me, wasn’t wind, wasn’t anything I have a word for. The dark rearranged itself. My headlamp found two points of pale that weren’t eyes because there weren’t eyes there, just the places where eyes would be if something had them and closed them, and above those the suggestion of a forehead and above that too much nothing.I took a step back and my heel hit a root.Something brushed my sleeve.Not a hand. Not fur. The memory of a hand.I ran.Branches slapped my face and cut my lips. The tape flashed in little funerals of orange that didn’t help. My headlamp caught the white flare of exposed wood where something had rubbed bark away and made it smooth. The woods stopped being a place and became lines of dark I had to not run into.When the breathing stopped again, I fell.I don’t remember landing.I don’t remember getting up.I remember crawling. Dirt under my nails. The smell of earth and that other smell, the sweet one that makes you think of sugar and heat and then turns in your throat. I remember a shape in front of me that was lighter than everything else and then cool air on my face and the tight, unsteady miracle of stars.I was at the edge of a road cut into a hillside. A narrow ditch ran along it. The ditch held a trickle of water and the reflection of my headlamp looked like a startled animal. The road’s gravel was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.I don’t remember how I got back to the truck. The door was open. There was dirt on the seat I don’t remember dragging in. The keys were in my pocket where I don’t remember putting them.I woke up in my apartment two days later. The sheets were muddy. My mouth tasted like I’d been breathing through metal. My Polaroid camera sat on the kitchen table next to a glass of water I hadn’t poured. The photo of the clearing with the single bent figure lay under the glass like I’d put it there to keep it flat.Marcus’s pack wasn’t in my living room. His boots weren’t by the door. His jokes weren’t in my head where they should’ve been.His number was disconnected.His socials were empty. Not deactivated. Not private. Scrubbed.The orange tape I’d tied and retied around my wrist that first day sat on the counter, pale as old scars.And then someone slid something under my door.It made a soft whispering sound when it came to a stop. I thought it was junk mail until I saw the knot.It was a strip of pale leather tied around a bundle of hair.Hair braided the same way Marcus used to braid his sister’s hair at her soccer games when she asked him to “do the rope one.” I recognized the pattern. He’d shown me once, leaning over a picnic table, laughing at how serious I looked while I tried to copy him.The braid was cut clean at one end. The cut had been heat-sealed.There were markings burned into the leather. Not letters I knew. Not any runic alphabet my desperate Googling would later suggest. Little figures in a line, each a perfect version of the one before: the bent body, the ring spine, the praised sky, the long thin limbs.And on the inside of the leather, pressed into it like someone had used a brand smaller than a thumbnail, were five words in English.YOU WERE MEANT TO WATCH.They weren’t crooked. They weren’t shaky. They sat straight and clean like something had pressed them one after the other with care.I stared at the braid so long my vision went white at the edges.When I blinked and the room came back, the Polaroid camera had moved.It was closer to me by a few inches. The lens faced my chest. The strap hung off the table like a tongue. I hadn’t touched it.I picked it up. My thumb found the shutter because that’s what hands do when they don’t know what else to do.The flash went off in my face. The apartment lit white and then collapsed back into itself.I put the camera down and waited for the photo to develop.The square stayed gray longer than it should have. Then an image came up like bruises emerging.It was the clearing.Not the way my eyes had ever seen it. The grass was too smooth. The trees leaned in too far. The tents weren’t tents. The ring of stones around the fire pit was taller and the black on the inside of each was wet.Two figures stood at the edge of the frame.They were bent backward into rings. They were taller than the trees. Where their faces should have been were the places for faces. And between them, on nothing, a thin smile hung the way a strip of leather hangs when it’s been tied and then slipped.In the bottom right corner, smaller than my thumbnail, a third figure stood between the first two like a child between adults crossing a street.Its face was Marcus’s.I’m not posting this for attention. I don’t care if you believe me.I’m posting it because sometimes, just before dawn, I hear breathing in my apartment walls. Not mice. Not air through vents. The slow, patient draw of something that likes reminding me it doesn’t have to hurry.And because the orange tape that I keep finding tied around my cabinet handles and my bedpost is getting paler.And because I woke up yesterday with resin on my fingers and four parallel grooves scraped into the wood of my kitchen table at the exact height my shoulder is when I stand there.And because the Polaroid I left face down on the counter last night was on the floor this morning, and when I turned it over, it was blank white except for a thin ring in the center, burned so lightly into the paper that you only see it if you tilt it to the light.I don’t need sympathy.I just need someone else to admit the woods aren’t empty.They breathe.They wait.And if you camp in the wrong circle, they smile.",

      "content_preview": "My mother died last night. I should've called, I should've visited her more often, made sure she was okay. She's had early onset dementia for a while and spent the last few years of her life just fading away in that nursing home.The gut wrenching grief that struck me overcame the stinging pain of the plant in my arm. I preferred it when it was just physical pain. The lifetime of memories she had made, all just slowly faded away.It was stupid of me to think she would remember how to remove this plant, towards the end of her life she couldn't even remember my name. I already possessed most of her belongings, though I couldn't stand to look through all of them.I wish I had sooner. My brother was born much later than I, and didn't know mom as much. I was gonna leave it up to him to look through Mom's stuff since he offered, but with her passing it felt wrong not to at least look.I found the boxes stashed in my basement, gritting my teeth when the plant scraped the wall as I carried the box upstairs. Among the belongings, photographs and pictures, memorabilia and mementos, was a singular notebook.It was a rather small notebook, I took it for a random sketchbook or journal that my mom had stashed away. Until I opened it up. Scores of inky black streaks tore across each page, incoherent scribbles and scratches filled the notebook.Some pages formed words, none of them sensical or comforting. “ITCHING! PAIN! HURTS! TENDRILS! THE ROOTS! THERE IS NO GOD!” My face contorted in concern as I flipped through, it looked like the inscriptions of a madwoman.“NO ESCAPE! DEEP IN YOUR SKIN! ONE WITH YOUR FLESH!” The notebook went on and on and on like this. Until one of the last pages, where a word I didn't recognize was written.“FLORATURGY”. It was written across both pages, bolded and circled. “Floraturgy…?” I said out loud. The instant the word left my mouth, I felt an ache in my arm.The red plant began twitching and vibrating, and I winced in pain. It writhed and danced like a tree in the wind, pulling and dragging my arm around uncontrollably. From the ends of its dozens of branches, it split open, blossoming like a bouquet of grotesque flowers.Then, it shrieked. My face contorted in shock as the blooming flora emitted a high pitched wail. It went on for minutes, I panicked and tried suffocating the plant under a pillow just to shut it up.The twisted burning pain of the red vestiges pulling on my muscles and tendons made me grind my teeth. Finally, it stopped shrieking. I removed the pillow gently to discover that the plant had closed back up.Had it been a coincidence that it began fussing as soon as I uttered that word? ‘Floraturgy’? I wouldn't take that risk. I returned to the notebook, deciding I wouldn't say whatever strange words were written out loud.There wasn't much of use in the remaining pages, only more incoherent and indecipherable ramblings like “IT HEARS”, “RUN AWAY”, “ITCHING BURNING”, “ALL WHO ARE CONNECTED HEAR”, “IT HEARS”.The last few pages had odd and frightening drawings, my heart twitched when I saw them. The drawings were diagrams of people, with branches sprouting out from all over their body, engulfing them completely.Was it really my mother writing all of this? In any case, my mother's notebook was a dead end. It confirmed that my mother at least knew about the red plants, but I was no closer to removing it than I was before.My Doctor's appointment is tomorrow, hopefully they have a solution for this. Until then I hope that the plant doesn't start making noises again.",

      "content_preview": "When I was a kid, from around the ages of 2-10, I always watched the same show after school.“Dandy’s Wondrous Adventures.”It was a show that I had kept tabs on ever since I was a baby. It had been with me since the beginning, and for good reason.Even as an adult, I can point out the many lessons the show taught me as a boy.How to tie my shoes, how to properly eat, how to keep up conversations, etc.It was a much needed show for a kid of my upbringing.My dad had died before I was born in a botched robbery, and my mother worked as a surgeon, meaning she was gone most of the day, coming back home around 9-10 at night.So, most of my youthful lessons were taught by the show.Every episode entered the same: Dandy, an anthropomorphic dandelion, and his sisters Rosie, Daisy, and Blue Bonnie, would run up a hill, click their heels (which were leaves,) face the viewer, and ask how their day had gone.They’d wait for about 5 seconds, and would respond.If the episode was oriented around something happy, they’d all smile and say “That’s terrific!”If it was oriented around something not happy, they’d all share a small look of unanimous dissatisfaction and say “Well ain’t that a shame?”Every time I came home from school, I’d divulge into the characters on how my day went.I always would be disappointed when my response didn’t match theirs, and it never did. I tallied the times I matched their response with mine, and I was down by 47 marks to my 0.Regardless, it was nice to see whatever my favorite cast of characters had in store for me that day.However, this static stream of constant enjoyment changed one afternoon.It was a rainy April day, and I had just gotten home after the torrent of watery sheets had ended its assault on me.I had no homework for the day, and after finishing all of my chores, I galloped upstairs to turn on my TV and pay a visit to my friends. Once again, the episode entered the same way, with Dandy and his sisters dancing up the hill, stopping, and asking me how my day had gone.My day had gone pretty poorly. At school, I had a teacher named Ms. Carol. I was the quiet, nerdy type in elementary school, so Ms. Carol saw me as easy pickings.She’d berate me day in and day out about how weird I was, how I had no friends, and how I was a loser. Any time I tried to report her, no one believed me. Usually I didn’t respond, but today hurt a lot worse.One of my classmates told her about my dad, and used the newfound information as ammunition against me.She’d never hit me, but it felt like she did.It hurt.I confided with Dandy on the issue.How much I hated her, how rude she was, and my anger towards her for being such a jerk.In my endless tirade about how much I deplored her, it had slipped my mind that Dandy hadn’t said anything. It had gone well over 5 seconds, but they didn’t speak.No interruptions.No exclamations.Nothing.Silence.Even the music had ceased.Once my rant had subsided, I turned to look at the TV.Their expressions were not the usual ones they wore.They didn’t look happy or mildly sad.No.They looked mad.All of them wore this expression of intense grimace, like someone had just told them off, or stole something and gotten caught doing it.Dandy looked the angriest.“How rude.” He said, his speech sounding as if his teeth were clenched.Blue Bonnie stepped up to the screen, her arms crossed, staring dead at me like a hawk.“People like that are just so bad, right?” She proclaimed.“You said it!” They all announced. Slowly, their expressions of disdain faded.Dandy spoke up again “Well, it's a good thing we’re talking about bullies today, huh?”They all shook their heads in approval.The episode transitioned to a school area, where they all gathered in what I would guess was the cafeteria. It was rosily colored, with hints of bright pink, yellow, green, and red across all the furniture in the room, ranging from tables to art. Common colors for a kids show.Rosie pointed at another flower. He wasn’t a part of the usual cast, but they all regarded him with some level of knowledge.“That’s Ms. Wiltkens. She’s the worst!” Rosie exclaimed.“She’s the school bully here. And worst of all, she’s a teacher! Everyone is scared of her.” Daisy said.Dandy took his place in the center of the screen.“To get a bully off of you, sometimes you have to teach them a good lesson. Give them a reason to think twice before messing with you. Right guys?”They all unanimously uttered and “mhm” before turning all at once to the screen.Blue Bonnie looked at everyone else.“But won’t you get in trouble for something like that?” She said.They all looked at her before turning back to face me.“To get a bully off of you? It’s worth it.”Their expressions then changed to one of a kinder look, smiling warmly at me before returning to the hill.They all joined in unison to wish me good luck for tomorrow, as they always did, before the credits rolled.I was stunned. It was like the universe had aligned at that exact moment to help me with my problem.But it was the wrong solution.As much as I despised her, it wasn’t worth it to get in a whole load of trouble for fighting a teacher.What good would it do to help my problem anyway.I’d have to do some serious damage to her for the bullying to cease. A simple hit to the nose would just make my problems worse.It honestly felt like the advice they had given me was, for the first time……bad.By that moment, the constant pitter patter of rain had lulled me into a drowsy mess, so I decided to take a quick nap and recuperate.My head touched the soft, comforting surface of my pillow, and I slipped away into my dreams.Around 7:30, I awoke to one hell of a wakeup call.“WAKE UP.”It was violent. Aggressive. Booming. As though a prison warden was waking up an inmate.There was no friendliness in the command. No leeway.Just rage.I popped out of my bed like a meerkat that had sensed an impending threat, but when I did, I saw that the TV had been turned on.And there he was.Dandy.However, strangely enough, his sisters weren’t there.The background was dark, nearly pitch black, with only the moon present in the frame. The grass that was usually bright had turned sickly, adorning a new, yellowish color.“So you won’t listen?” Dandy said, his eyes furrowed into a deep, burning glare.“We are trying to help you with a problem, like we have for years.”I didn’t know what to say. It felt as if my body was stuck. Was this sleep paralysis? Was it a dream?“Do you not like us anymore?”Before I could find the courage to stammer anything out, his sisters came into the shot.“Because we don’t like you. We never liked you.”Their words burned, while my throat felt like it was held in place with barbed wire.Dandy moved forward.“Maybe she’s right. Maybe you are a loser.”They all began to snicker, until it eventually devolved into laughter.They shot out snide remarks, comments about my hair, face, and anything they could latch on to.They even bit into my dad’s death.“He probably did it on purpose. Who would want to have a son like you?” Rosie said.“I bet he faked his death to get away from you!” Blue Bonnie said.“Or maybe he did it himself out of disappoin-” before Dandy could finish what he was going to say, I shut the TV off.I was a hot mess of tears, snot, and fear. Balled up on my bed, I couldn’t bring myself to move until morning came.It was a Saturday, and mom was at work still. She was the hospital’s best surgeon, meaning there were quite a few weekends where she’d be gone for half the day.I wanted to get up out of bed to get breakfast, but I was still in shock after the incident the night prior.Was it a dream? Was it just my imagination?No. It couldn’t have been.I felt everything.All those words, insults, and crude remarks.I felt them all.After much thought, I finally crawled out of bed, and went downstairs.The sky had cleared since yesterday, with a bright, beautiful hue of blue and yellow beaming down for all to enjoy.After eating a healthy bowl of cereal, I returned to my room, and decided to see if I could get some gaming in. I usually gamed during the weekends anyway, as my mom didn’t let me play during school days.After a couple hours on the console, a familiar, yet mellow voice snapped my attention back to the TV.“Hey, friend.”It was Dandy again.In the past, that voice would be a source of comfort.Now, it frightened me.I stood still, my head not daring to look back at the character who had become just as oppressive as my teacher.“Look at me. Please.”Dandy’s voice wasn’t violent this time. It had the same warm aura it had had before the previous night.He sounded apologetic.I slowly looked over my shoulder.They were all there this time. Dandy, Bonnie Blue, Daisy, and Rosie.But they weren’t standing. They were sitting on the hill.The background had returned to its entrancing bright blue color, and the grass looked healthy again.Everything had returned to normal, apart from the characters.Their faces now expressed a look of regret.A deep regret.“We’re sorry, friend. We didn’t mean to lash out like that.” Bonnie Blue said, her eyes sporting a much brighter, kinder look.“It isn’t you. It’s us.” Daisy said, her leafy hands clasped together in her lap.“We know you still like us. Really, we do!” Rosie exclaimed.Dandy then took his turn to look at me, his character near the leftmost part of the frame.“We had an issue like you once. Ms. Wiltkens would treat us badly. She hated every kid she saw in that school, but for us? She hated us the most.”I moved from my chair to stand right in front of the TV, my ears, eyes, and mind completely intertwined with the screen in front of me.It was unbelievable.“She said that we were troubled children who deserved to be alone.” Daisy said.“We had no parents of our own, so we relied on her.” Dandy said.“One day, Ms. Wiltkins said that she had enough with our behavior. She dragged us into the drawing room, locked us in, and left us there.” Bonnie Blue proclaimed.Dandy looked up from his lap, his eyes a constant of sadness and misery.“We never left.” He said.“We don’t want the same for you.” Rosie announced.“You made us happy. So we want you to be happy. We just got scared that you might move on the same path.” Dandy said.I smiled at the TV, beaming happiness through their kind words.It was still a show at the end of the day, so I thought that this was their way of teaching courtesy and openness.“But we think it's time for us to say goodbye.”My smile quickly dissipated into a slightly open mouth, my eyes wide with surprise.“You’re getting old now. Big and strong, just like your dad!” Daisy exclaimed, her smile replacing mine.“We’ve taught you all we can, friend.” Rosie said.I grasped the TV, words slowly bubbling into my throat of pleas for them to stay.“We always cared about you. Even when you were with us back there.” Bonnie Blue said.They all stood up, and took each other's hands, and smiled the widest smiles I’d ever seen them showcase.My head was pressed up against the glass panel separating me from them, my eyes a waterfall of emotion and distress. I begged for them not to leave.“Thank you for tuning in with us, friend!” They all said.Slowly but surely, the screen faded to black, and in big white letters, the words “The End” covered the TV.Then, it cut to static.All that remained was me.Weeping, and shattered.Years later, on my sixteenth birthday, after a big party with my closest friends, of whom I had many of at that point, my mom called me into the living room.I thought that maybe there was another present waiting for me, so I eagerly waltzed into the room, with an immense pep in my step.But my mom did not share my enthusiasm. She looked sullen, and tense.“Sit down, please.” she said, her voice controlled and centered, yet anxious.I complied, my own appearance visibly moving downwards into a look of paralleled seriousness.“I know that it’s your big day, but we need to talk about something. Something I’ve been meaning to tell you for a while.”What proceeded to be said to me shook the core of my world forever.My mom told me that, while it was true that my dad had died in a botched robbery, he wasn’t truly my real dad, and that she wasn’t my real mom.I had lost my original family a year after I was born in a car accident on the freeway after a truck had lost control, and slammed into the side of their car.They died on impact.I was lucky, as I had been at daycare, which they were coming to pick me up from.I had no extended family, so I was put in the foster care program, and adopted by a woman named Ms. Wilkins, who was a boarding school teacher in her past.According to mom, she was an extremely cruel woman, who would regularly beat her adopted children for the littlest of reasons, ranging from breathing too loud to having a cough.One day, however, she went too far, when 4 of her children, after supposedly protecting me from a vicious beating, were locked in a room for a week.They didn't come back out.The other kids, including myself, were not let out of the house after that to avoid any of us telling another person what she had done to them.Eventually, the neighbors noticed how we weren’t ever leaving, and called the police.Ms. Wilkens was sentenced to life in prison.I was stunned, unable to move, as though I was locked in place by my feet.“Take as much time as you need to process this. I'm right here.” My mother said.As my mind began to make sense of it all, I started having sparks fire off in my brain.Ms. Wilkens…I could’ve swore I knew that name from somewhere.Wilkens.Wilkens.Wilkens…And then, it hit me like a boulder rolling down a hill.Ms. Wiltkins, the teacher from the show.I rushed out of the living room, up to my bedroom, and threw my computer open with almost lightning fast speed.I looked up the case, typing everything I could in, praying I could find something.4 of the 5 searches propped up generic results of other heinous foster parents, but then, on my fifth search, I found it.“Boarding school teacher charged with 4 counts of first-degree murder after locking children in room.”I scrolled through the article, and everything aligned with what my mom had said. There was no mention of my name anywhere, but the presence of them defending another kid was in the article. Along with it, photos of the drawings they made while locked inside were posted onto the article itself.All pictures of them as flowers.At the bottom, it listed the names of the deceased children.My heart sank, and my jaw followed its motion.Rosalina MatthewsBonnabel LeeDaisy McMullenDaniel MorelloI had no words. I had no movement.It felt as though the world itself had spun upside down, and I was bearing the brunt of it.Snapping out of my haze, I looked up the cartoon.I searched for what felt like hours.Nothing.Not a single mention of any show titled “Dandy’s Wondrous Adventures.”It made no sense.What the hell was I watching then?Did I imagine it?Was I going through some sort of trauma induced hallucination?It shattered what little grip on reality I had left at that moment.Their names, the show, the antagonist of that one rainy day.It all neatly funneled into this one case that I had apparently been involved with when I was just a toddler.And yet, it only added more complexities.And more emotions.Fear.Confusion.Sadness.Empathy.And finally, courage.I’m 28 now, and I have been an animator for over 8 years. Recently, I pitched the idea for Dandy’s Wondrous Adventures to the board, and just yesterday, it was approved.I did it for them.Whether or not the show I watched was real, this one will be, and I want it to help people just like me.Just like them.I’ve never told anyone this story, and I never planned to.Until today.As of writing this, I received an envelope at my door from an anonymous writer.All it says on the front of the envelope is “From: Your Friends.”Inside the envelope was a crumpled, old, worn piece of paper. It looked as though it had been set out in the sun for years.On one side of the paper was a drawing, as though it was made by a kid.Or rather, a group of kids, as the styles are all different.It looked fresh, completely out of place with the worn down canvas that had been used.On the drawing is them.The characters.They all adorn beautiful white wings, and halos above their heads, while a small, pretty purple butterfly guides them towards the sun.All of them are hand in hand, just like the last time I saw them.On the back, in four corners of the paper, in yellow, indigo, red, and white, was the same phrase, again and again, yet the meaning and significance of the phrase remained constant.“Thank you.”In the middle, a heart presented itself, with it colored in quadrants, the same colors used for the messages.…Thank you too, friends.",

      "content_preview": "Hello reader. For privacy reasons, I will be referred to as Laurence. And this is a story of when I lived next to Lake Lanier. For context, I am 5'6 Caucasian Male and I was 20 at the time when this happened. I was living in a 4 story house. Well, if you want to count the attic as part of the stories, otherwise 3 story. My neighborhood was peaceful and lots of good neighbors that usually keep to themselves. I lived with my brother, sister, Dad, and our roommate who did the cooking most nights and helped out with other things. My brother and sister were born 12 months apart and the same year but my sister is usually a year older than my brother till the final month. Now lets get this out of the way so I can tell you my story of how it all began.It was on my day off during the Summer of 2020. I was driving my younger Brother and I to the park that was at Lake Lanier. For privacy reasons, we will refer to my brother as Eli.\"So Eli,\" I asked him. \"Are you ready for some quality brotherly time?\"\"Yeah.\" Eli said, some sort of monotone to his voice.Don't get us wrong, Eli and I get along very well for brothers. Sure in our childhood we had our little fights and nit picks but we were just kids and it's kinda natural for siblings to have their little disagreements. Eli, while 3-4 years younger than me, was definitely taller than I was. Almost 6'0 I can safely say. But He'll always be my younger Brother that I love dearly.\"Okay wanna take the fishing poles or the bags?\" I asked him.\"I can take the bags.\" He said, carrying my backpack and some of our snacks.\"Wonderful.\" I said, grabbing the poles and my phone out of the car before shutting it and locking. If you are wondering, my car is a Chevy Impala 2014. It gets me around awesomely from Point A to Point B. My silver Steed if you will.Where we arrived, there was a mini beach, a safe area for swimming, lots of picnic tables, and plenty of woods to hike. With me being...well .. me... I never liked to swim in the waters. Why? Lake Lanier is supposedly haunted and many people including professional swimmers lose their lives here. I wasn't ready to be on headline news. I was just here to fish.\"Have any ideas for a spot Laurence?\" Eli asked.\"Hmmm..\" I was scanning the area and spots around that didn't have too many people. I'm not really a people person to be honest. To some it's me being anxious. But for me, I absolutely can't. Especially when you have kids screaming at the top of their lungs. \"How about over there?\"My brother nodded and we walked over in that direction. We have passed a guy who looked to be in his 40s and someone maybe in his early 20s I assumed was his son. They had just caught a huge largemouth bass. It was quite a sight. My brother and I had reached the spot and took a seat, setting up our fishing stuff. I had chosen a night crawler and him artificial bait. His resembled a crawfish.\"So you've picked that one?\" I asked Eli.\"Yep. It's more realistic than flip flop designs.\" He had that weird grin and then faced the lake, holding his arm back to cast. I watched him almost like flick his wrist to send his line far out. If I had a good guess, it was about maybe 50 feet. I would normally say it's impressive but that was truly incredible. \"Try that one out Laurence.\"\"You're on!\" I laughed then took a deep breath, casting out to the waters. Not as far as He did, less. But I gave a nervous grin as I admitted defeat. \"That one was rigged.\"\"Sure it was.\" He said and stared out at the lake.It felt like hours when in reality it was minutes. My brother's line started twitching then jerked. He pulled back and started reeling in the line. I got excited and sat my rod down quickly to watch him fight with whatever got the bait. The end of the pole was holding on as it bent downward and once it came into clearer view, He had caught a largemouth. It looked to be maybe 18 pounds. I didn't doubt my brother would lift it. He was stronger than myself after all. He laughed a little.\"Hey let me get a pic! Dad will be amazed!\" I picked up my phone that I had left and opening the camera, positioned it to face him. He had a neutral expression like many photos he was in. I'm not one to tell you to smile. Whatever expression you want to use, I'd accept. \"Great catch dude!\"\"Thank you.\" He said, looking at the fish.But as we celebrated his catch and him slowly going through the process of gently and respectfully releasing the fish, I happened to catch something unusual off in the distance. I couldn't gauge how far it was, but something... Or someone... Was peeking from behind a tree. Pure black, like a shadow, with 2 white dots that might've been the eyes. Wild hair like a cartoon individual that had been shocked by lightning. It stood there. I had to rub my eyes, squinting. It remained.\"Hey... Eli?\" I asked.\"Yeah?\" He said. \"What's up Laurence?\"\"Do you see that? Just ahead.\" I pointed behind him in the direction of the thing.\"Huh?\" He turned around and looked back at me. \"No. I do not. Are you ok?\"I will admit I have been feeling very anxious lately. Down. Depression even. I had recently been broken up with by my ex girlfriend of 4 years who we will call Bridget as well as the passing of our family cat Carl. He has been my buddy since I was 10. And for him to suddenly be gone before christmas, a week before, was hell for me. It was so much weight for me to carry over my shoulders. Perhaps this was my negative emotions playing tricks on my brain? It has to be that...\"Laurence,\" Eli said. \"I know your breakup with Bridget and the death of Carl has been weighing you down. And I can't tell you to shrug it off. But please, try and ease up.\"\"Right...\" I looked at the thing that was still there. Maybe it was grief in the physical form of my struggle to let go. \"You could be right. I'm sorry.\"\"I love you buddy.\" He said before walking us back to our spot. It was only one more turn of my head before I realized the thing vanished but that's when it began. I clutched my chest and started breathing heavily. My sound got his attention and He looked at me. \"Laurence?\"I had fallen to my knees, wanting to cry but nothing came out. The figure didn't disappear but moved. It was now closer. Like maybe the distance of 2 school busses parked behind the other. The figure was more clear to me. Still black as a shadow and those two bright orbs I assumed were the eyes. Even as my vision blurred and I gasped for air, having symptoms of a combination of night terror and severe anxiety attacks, I saw the figure was feminine. So for this purpose, we'll say it's female. She had no mouth or nose. But those eyes were wide. For better description, research shadow people and you'll see what I mean. She walked closer and by some driving force of fear and potentially adrenaline, I got up fast and looked at my brother.\"Eli, we have to go to the car Now. Grab our things and let's go I can't stay here longer.\" I said and quickly collected our bags, running to the car. I turned back once to see how far he was. The figure didn't seem to stop to my younger brother but was advancing towards me still. She was after me. But why?\"Laurence what do you see? Is your glucose out of control?\" Eli called out. But I was already in the car, waiting for him.I couldn't answer. She was still following. But walking slowly. I could easily outwalk her. She was playing with me. What did She want? I shoved the key into the ignition and cranked the car. Once Eli had entered, I was ready to put the knob into reverse but the moment I touched it, It was to my realization that \"She\" was already there. I slowly turned my head to my window and saw her staring through it. She tilted her head and waved slowly, dragging her finger down the glass silently. I gasped again and couldn't breathe, gripping the stick shift and trembled before loosening my grip, the world going black and the last thing I heard was my brother calling 911 before I eventually passed out.I had awoken at the house and Eli was at the foot of my bed. So was my sister Allison. My Dad walked in.\"Laurence what happened out there?\" He had asked.\"Eli... Are you sure you didn't see her?\" I gasped.\"Who?\" He had confusion written on his face. \"It was just you and I in the car. There was nobody there except the ambulance that later arrived and the police.\"\"It was some shadow...\" I stuttered. I had described everything to them what I saw and the way the figured moved.\"Laurence you're still stressed out and you're most likely having hallucinations from the stress Overdrive.\" My Dad said. \"Just rest for now and you should be better.\"\"Eli...\" I looked at my brother. \"What were my vitals? Was I okay?\"\"They said your blood sugar was fine and your vitals were good. Maybe it's stress. Please... Relax.\"\"Alright.\" I wasn't one to argue unless I felt I was absolutely accused. But maybe they were right. I was overstimulating and panicked over it.It felt like minutes before I had passed out again. It went from dark to a clear view of the sky. The skies were without clouds and it looked just like the ones you see in very old VHS looking movies. There was a castle sitting on the giant hills. The castle looked quite fancy a bit with a mixture of Transylvania. The camera panned down to show my brother and I in my car driving through the dark woods. Blue skies in the day time but the woods are dark because of the very tall pine trees shading us. It was me being the driver as usual. The trip was quiet. It was going smoothly until I saw the figure again. Only this time is very different. This one's shape was odd. A shorter individual, same weird spikes looking like hair struck by lightning on TV, but wearing a witches hat, all black. Same big bright white eyes. The figure was darting around in the woods stalking my brother and I.\"Hey Eli?\" I asked. \"Did you see that?\"\"See what?\" He asked, confused once more.This was de ja vu. It's strange I even had that memory from the real world. This was a dream. This shadow was a munchkin. But equally giving me those same shudders and feelings of absolute fear as my body forced me to slam on the breaks. But why? Why was I unwillingly doing the opposite of the  natural responses of escaping danger? My hand shakingly reached for the knob and putting it in park, I rolled down my window and stared out, waiting. Waiting for what?\"Laurence?\" Eli's voice sounded like it was coming from the distance. He was next to me though. What was going on? His face then slowly distorted and became enveloped in darkness, his entire body becoming a shadow as He ripped his own clothes off, his regular hands becoming clawed. Again, no details. Only darkness. My body was stuck in some sort of trance as the claws dug into my neck as the face formed a mouth. A white one. The eyes looking like scribbled circles. The munchkin had joined in with the shadow that had taken my brother's form previously and opened it's mouth to bite down on my neck. The feminine shadow from reality appeared, ripping my door off and putting her humanoid hand under my chin, turned me to face her. She then opened her mouth to let out a deafening shriek of horror but at the same time felt my soul leave my body as I awoke with a scream.\"Laurence!\" Allison came in, shaking me. \"Brother what's wrong? Are you ok?\"\"Wh-where is Eli?\" I asked, eyes looking around frantically. \"He hasn't turned has He?\"\"Kid,\" My Dad walked in. \"Eli is okay. You're okay you're okay.\"My Dad was a softy. He hugged me and held me. I was shaking. I felt so embarrassed as a male to cry. It was so horrifying. My Dad didn't need me to overdo it. He said It's natural to cry. Usually when I wanted to cry, I had to be alone. But usually Carl would be by my side, kissing me and rubbing against me. He wasn't here. It broke me more. I spoke his name a few times.\"Hey, buddy.\" My Dad let go. \"There's nothing to hurt you. Nobody is gonna hurt you. I promise. You're safe here with us.\"\"Yes big brother.\" Allison hugged me. \"We're here for you. Bridget is a nobody. Don't let her get ahold of your thoughts.\"I turned my head to look at the window. I saw a mother bird with her babies, feeding them a worm. I slowed down my breathing, trying to ease up. It was difficult but eventually I was good again. I felt my phone vibrate on my bedside and I picked it up to see it was a message from Bridget. I shook my head as my heart sank. She texted me again. But what for? I read the message.\"Hey Laurence I'm checking on you to see if you were okay.\" Was what she texted me. Wiping my eyes, I texted back.\"Yeah. I'm fine.\" I gave her a short answer. When I'm upset with someone or don't want to be bothered, I give a short answer. Not even a minute later she responded. It was shown she read it the moment I sent her a text.\"Are you sure? I can tell something was wrong.\"\"Don't worry about me. What do you want?\" I finally texted her. You can say I'm mean for this. But she did kinda break my heart. So, it's fair to me.\"If this is a bad time, I'll come back later to check on you. I just wanted to see if we could call.\"\"Bridget why don't you talk to one of our mutual friends? Like Abigail? She's female. Your talk could be something she can help you with.\"\"Listen, I just wanna talk to you. I've known you the longest and I feel more comfortable with you with what I need to get off my chest.\"\"Fine.\"I was the first to press that call button. It was instagram ringing. 1 ring. 2 rings. Then that familiar sound of the other end picking up. There she was. As much as it hurt to see her, Bridget was still a very very gorgeous woman. She had occasionally changed her hair color but right now it was strawberry blonde. Her emerald eyes behind her cute glasses. It was like looking through one of those scopes that jewelers look through to see if a diamond was real. That's my comparison at least. Her precious face. But instead of her smile, it was her crying. I've only heard her cry once. This was the second time. She was panting and I just looked at her dumbfounded. See, I'm not great at expressing or processing my own emotions. It hurt a bit to see her cry.\"What's wrong Bridget?\" I tried to sound sincere. But my own heart break over her was winning.\"He and I had broken up.\" She cried. I kept a straight face. In my mind, I wanted to tell her 'it sucked didn't it? To have your heart broken? Now you know how I felt' But no. I just nodded.\"I'm sorry. Is this what you wanted to call me about?\" I asked her, sighing.\"I miss him so much. I wish things would go back to how they were.\"That shattered me all over again and I trembled. Not just from hurt. But anger. Not because He left her. Screw that. She barely knew him for a year for what it seems and she's crying over him versus us knowing each other for 6 years and being together for 4 years? It was inconceivable. But then as she cried to me, babbling some of the same words, my heart stopped as I turned my head to look behind my desk. There was an arm wiggling like a snake. It was waving to me like a greeting and slowly peering out, was the shadow woman. Her head almost touched the ceiling, her own body casting like a real shadow. Her arms outstretched, she loomed over me and I felt myself shake again, like a seizure.\"Laurence?\" Bridget calmed enough to get my attention. \"Laurence? Hey.... What's going on?\"I couldn't move. Couldn't answer her. My body had its attention towards the shadow woman. Her head rotated slowly but in a taunting manner too. There was nobody to help me. I could see her step out of the wall and walk towards the foot of my bed, becoming 3 dimensional. Her claws on my sheets, leaving visible claw marks. My eyes glued to her, I started sweating and trembling, gasping for air but nothing coming in or out.\"OH MY GOD LAURENCE!\" Bridget screamed. This was loud enough for my brother whose room was across mine to barge in and stare in shock. Could it be He's actually seeing this?\"DAD! LAURENCE IS SEIZING AGAIN!\" He yelled.\"Eli is that you?!\" Bridget yelled. \"TELL ME THAT LAURENCE IS OKAY!\"Eli couldn't move. I think He was finally seeing something that I was trying to explain. Dad ran upstairs to my room and stopped at the doorway too. He saw her too. Everyone was at the doorway. The woman was silent as a mouse as she climbed onto my bed on her knees.\"GET AWAY FROM HIM!\" My brother yelled, running to tackle the woman who fell out the window, my brother clinging onto the window. My Dad rushed in to grab his hand and pull him up while all I could do was sit there in terror. I was too afraid.The woman got up slowly and cracked her neck back in place as I saw 2 more white eyes. No... 4... 6 total. The munchkin and the one who impersonated my brother. Both the extras from my nightmare. No... Not a nightmare... A precognition... Only this time instead of in the forest, in my own home.\"Laurence come on we gotta get out!\" Allison yelled, trying to pull me out. I couldn't. Fear had taken over. \"PLEASE! THEY'RE COMING!\"It was too late. They had made their way upstairs and the doorway. My 2 jack russel mixes were too afraid. Too shocked. These creatures scared them this much too. The munchkin grabbed onto my Sister while the bigger one pinned my brother and Dad to the wall. The woman walked towards me and impaled my arms with her claws, she stared into my face and slowly opened her mouth. She was grinning at the same time. I had enough cognitive to fear my end was here. But then.... There was barking. My dogs had sensed me being harmed and they ran upstairs to confront the shapes. The boy bit down on the big shape holding my brother and Dad while the girl bit onto the munchkin, pulling what seemed to be skin. But misty black. Both figures released my family and were trying to shake my dogs off.\"No more....\" The female figure whispered hauntingly and grew teeth, biting onto my face.\"LAURENCE!\" My family screamed. I could have sworn my life was flashing before my eyes. All hope seemed lost. I felt her needle-like teeth scraping and slowly digging into my flesh. I knew I bled cause it was warm and wet. I thought I was done. But there was a sound that made her take her mouth off my head and stare at my face. My eyes turned enough to see a bright light. It was fluffy and had bright green eyes as well as a gold shine to it and the shape meowed.\"C-carl...\" I stuttered. It was my first words since the paralysis. My buddy had his shape and fluff he had the day my late Mom brought him home. He meowed again and trotted to the bed, jumping up and staring the creature down. \"Buddy....\"He stared the creature down and I could've sworn I saw flakes of her peel away and disintegrate. She let out a very loud deafening scratch as she swiped out at him only to find her body burning from his pure energy. He let out a hiss and She screamed, exploding into a dark mist. The other two creatures also bursted, sharing a scream before it echoed. I looked at him and He looked up at me, nudging me. I felt a wave of security and love as I held him. My family couldn't see Carl but I could. My buddy then hopped off and I watched him walk the stairs to heaven. I let out a tear and muttered.\"Thank you...\"Once He had gone home to reunite with my late Mom, I was surrounded by my family. They held onto me.\"Laurence I'm so sorry...\" Eli held me. \"I thought you were overreacting.\"I was at loss of words. No disappointment. Maybe... Maybe it was that those creatures made themselves visible to the real world when my emotions and anxiety got so bad that they could actually interact with me. But perhaps Carl knew what was there. I looked up where the stairs were and cried. Not of sadness. But joy. He had come to say goodbye and moved on.Years later as I write this, I think back. On my very shelf, sat Carl's pawprint. I held on to it like a treasure. My siblings had moved out and I remained with my Dad and Stepmom and Stepmom's Mom. With their Dog as the addition to the family, 3 humans and 3 dogs as well as my recently bought 14 fish I call my children, I can say for sure those were my demons. Every one of my worries and thoughts manifested as figments of my imagination into reality. Realities that wanna do unspeakable things to me. To this day, I can see that shine that Carl had on the dogs and fish. Like Angels. Perhaps they were Angels to not only comfort me but love me like Carl did. In fact He was my miracle. Just as these beautiful creatures were. I thank God everyday for them.Guys, let me tell you it's okay to cry. It's okay to miss the deceased. But just know, as long as you accept they linger in your hearts, then they have never left. Don't let your demons win. And remember: Keep your family close.",

      "content_preview": "When I was younger, I had this friend named Bats.I met her at a janky little carnival that was only in town for one weekend. At the time, I’d been in the police academy for two weeks, and another cadet had taken me there on a date.There was nothing wrong with the guy, especially compared to my last boyfriend. But it felt wrong. As the date stretched on and night fell, I realized I didn’t want to be there with him. I didn’t want to be there at all. I wasn’t ready. Not for the date, or the way he kept leaning in, and definitely not for the way he kept looking at me.And that’s because of Jason.Jason was my last boyfriend. One night, about two years prior to that evening at the janky carnival, we went to bed. In the morning, I woke up.Jason didn’t.He was a side sleeper. When he died, that side of his face folded into rills, almost like a curtain rolling upward. It froze that way. That was bad. The emptiness of him was worse.Under the best of circumstances, there’s this quality, a hollow, asymmetrical slackness that's unique to death. The morning I woke up and he didn’t, that’s how he looked. Hollow, asymmetrical, and slack.That’s how I remember him, no matter how hard I try to change it.So fast forward a few years to that rundown carnival.As night fell, I started losing it. By the time the stars came out, I couldn’t look at my date without seeing his face as though he were dead: slack and hollow, with cold skin rilled up like a curtain call.He didn’t notice because he was fixated on a game booth. Among the array of prizes was this gigantic stuffed dragon that he was hellbent on winning for me. I should have been flattered. I should have been having fun.But I couldn’t have fun, not with the way his face kept going slack. Not with the way his eyes kept clouding up. Not with the way the side of his face kept rolling up like a flesh curtain.Watching him play this shitty carnival game for that shitty stuffed animal under the blazing lights was too much. Too much light, too much noise, too much greasy funnel cake smell coating my throat every time I breathed in, too much him, and far, far too much me.Just  as he finally won that stuffed dragon, I started crying.It was the worst kind of crying too, the kind where tears come before you even know you’re sad.And even though it makes no sense, I panicked. I didn’t want him to see me cry. Couldn’t stand for him to see. That was the only thought in my head:I can’t let him see.So I spun around as tears fell and the lights broke open and flooded the world the way things do when you cry, and stumbled away.Of course, he came after me. Why wouldn't he?I started running.Three seconds later I collided with someone so hard I actually ricocheted a little, and I burst into tears.The next thing I knew, the lady I’d run into was holding me tight and telling my poor date to fuck off before she called the cops.“I am the cops,” he said.That made me laugh, but I was crying so hard it sounded like a sob. That sent my savior into overdrive. Every cop-related slur on this earth erupted out of her, so loud she drew a crowd. Or maybe the funnel cake stand was drawing the crowd with its sticky sweet grease smell, and she was just the entertainment.She screamed until my date finally left.It was impressive. It was also embarrassing when, about two minutes later, I felt the need to tearfully confess that I was also a cop.She patted my back, bracelets jangling as they caught the lights. “All cops are bastards, including you. But bastards need friends too, especially little ones who still have time to grow and shed their bastard skins.”“What?” I asked nervously.She pinched the sleeve of my jacket and pulled upward. Her face lit up so brightly that I was sure she was mocking me. “Look! Your bastardness isn’t even a skin yet. It’s still a coat, which means there’s plenty of time to fix you. I bet the mirror would prove it.”“What mirror?”“The mirror in my favorite place in the world, which is a shitty little night club. It and the mirror are magic. It shows you who you really are on the inside. Want to come see?”“No.\"“Good, because you’re not ready, and when you’re not ready, the mirror drives you insane. I’ve seen it. We’ve got to fix you first. So let’s get fixing.”And that’s how I met Bats.So as a kid, I always felt like I’d been born with a moat around me.In my mind’s eye, this moat was huge and deep, full of jagged rocks waiting to kill you if you tried to dive, and circling sharks ready to eat you if you tried to swim. It felt like the water was lapping closer every day, threatening to wash the ground out from under my feet and carry me out to the sharks and the rocks. I felt like I either had to wait to drown, or take a running leap and pray I’d jumped high enough to clear the moat and reach the solid ground on the other side.And I did exactly that...but barely.In my imagination, I was pinwheeling for balance on the edge of the moat while soft ground crumbled under my feet, threatening to spill me into the water.I still feel like I’m pinwheeling.Anyway, I think Bats had been born with that same moat, but she didn’t try to jump across. Somehow she just danced on the water, dodging rocks and sharks like it was nothing.I don't even know what I'm trying to express here, except to say that Bats was everything I wanted to be, which is everything I’ll never be.Bats was lanky and somehow withered even though she wasn’t much older than me. She had dark hair and eyes that were almost yellow. In low light, they were bright as molten gold. She wore stacks of antique bracelets and billowing bright scarves that contrasted with her clothes, which were mostly black and generally outrageous. Her voice carried the telltale rasp of someone who’s played a little too often with substances, and her laugh was grating but wonderful. She worked the dish pit at a chain restaurant and lived two blocks from me.Her apartment was a cluttered riot of color and light. She hated lamps, so string lights in every shape and color crisscrossed the ceiling and the walls like giant spiderwebs.Her place wasn’t just cluttered with light and junk. It was cluttered with people, too. Young, old, wealthy, homeless, whole, broken — people of every kind, whose only commonality was that they belonged to Bats somehow.I became one of them.When Bats decided you were hers, she never let you go. Some people love you by putting you at peace. Others love you by breaking you open.Bats broke me open.She was the first person to notice I had an eating disorder. She didn’t shame me for it or romanticize or fetishize it, either. What she did was ask what my favorite cookies were.“Oatmeal,” I said.“Fucking gross,” she answered.Instead of oatmeal cookies, she baked a giant batch ofherfavorite: double chocolate chili cookies, and made me eat.It worked. It shouldn’t have. It wouldn’t have if Bats hadn’t made them. But she did.So it worked.Don’t get me wrong. Bats was far from perfect.People who collect human problems always have problems of their own. Bats was no exception. One of the ways her problems manifested was by treating some of the people she broke open like they were pets.She treated me like a pet she wanted to train. It’s probably not a surprise, but her training methods were weird as hell. Most of them focused on what she called my “bastard coat.”“Bastard coats are the outsides we put on to disguise our insides,” she told me. “But the problem with bastard coats is they eventually replace your insides. We have to teach you how to shed your bastard coat and wear your insides out before you become a bastard forever.”Weirdly, she kept dangling the promise of her favorite club —the one with the supposed magic mirror — over me like a reward.“Once you shed your bastard coat, I’ll take you to the club to see who you really are in the mirror. I promise.”But see, I didn’t care.Only Bats could think standing in front of an antique mirror at a crappy club was a reward. For that matter, only Bats would think of survival — because that’s what the police academy was for me, survival — as a bastard coat.And only Bats would make it her mission to change someone like me into someone like her solely through the power of love.I’ll be honest:I used her.The care that she showed me — the love she gave as freely as breathing — was something I’d literally never experienced. It was like a drug. Itwasa drug.I became a junkie.I had no intention of doing any of the things she wanted me to do. Breaking myself down and putting myself back together. Changing my life path, leaving the academy. Shedding my bastard coat and wearing my insides out. I literally didn’t even know what she meant when she said these things.But pretending was the price of her adoration, so I pretended.I shouldn’t have, and not just for her sake. For mine, too. The way she treated me reminded me of Jason. Like him, she was always pushing me to be something I wasn’t. Pressing me to be what she thought I was, instead of learning who I was.But I didn’t care.Not when she baked entire batches of chocolate chili cookies for me to graze on through the day. Not when she rearranged her shifts to pick me up after work so I wouldn’t have to walk home alone. Not when she told me that underneath my bastard coat, I was the sweetest person alive. Not when she told me there was nothing I could do to make her let go of me. Not even when she exerted every bit of power she had over me to make me to stay in her dark, bright, cluttered apartment with her other problem people.Soon I spent more nights at her apartment than mine, curled up in a blanket nest on her bedroom floor under a web of purple string lights.I wasn’t the only one. At any given time, there were several other people crashing on her couch or her floor. She was closer to all of them than to me.Just as an example, she took these other friends out every night. They always went to the club with the magic mirror that supposedly reflected who you really are inside. The mirror I wasn’t ready for.And I wouldn’t even have been able to go. I had to be up at six every morning for the academy, and six is about the time Bats finally stumbled home after her nights out.But that’s not what mattered. What mattered was she was the person I was closest to, butIwasn’t the personshewas closest to.Bats was the only person I’d ever been able to spill my heart to, but she was the kind of person who spilled her heart to everyone. So she was special to me. I wasn’t as special to her, though.We all eventually learn that we don’t mean everything to someone who means everything to us. I’m pretty sure most people learn that as kids. But this was my first time, so I kind of hated Bats for connecting with everyone the way she connected with me.Still, there wasn’t enough hatred in the world to make me give up the love she gave.So I contented myself with the role of her little pet.Here’s the good thing about that: People don’t want anything from pets except good behavior. Up until that point, everyone I’d ever been close to had wanted something from me, whether I knew it or not. But all Bats wanted was good behavior. At the end of the day, good behavior is a performance. It’s just pretend.I pretended, and got the kind of love no one else ever gave me in return.That didn’t stop the jealousy.And I was so jealous.I was jealous of the other people Bats loved, of course. But mostly I was jealous of Bats because in every way that mattered, she was who I wanted to be.I told her that once.She laughed and threw her arms around me. “Underneath your bastard coat, you’re exactly like me, stupid. Why do you think I put up with your bastardness? It’s because I know who you really are.”“Sure.”“It’s true! You can’t spell ‘bastard’ without ‘bats,’ you know. You just have to pull out the extra letters and rearrange what’s left.” She smiled and drew me in for a hug. “Just like you have to shed your bastard coat and rearrange what’s underneath. Outside you’re definitely a bastard. But inside, you’re definitely a bat. You’ll see once I turn you inside out.”None of that makes sense now, but it made sense to me back then.What also made sense was my fear.Maybe Iwasa bat inside, but I was more than my insides. I was my outsides, too. We all are. And Ineededevery last one of those extra letters that grewbatintobastard. Ineededmy bastard coat. What I knew — and what I could never tell her without risking her love — was that the world is safe for bastards. It isn’t safe for bats.And more than anything, I wanted to be safe. That’s why I loved Bats so much: Because she made me feel safe.Except when she talked about her favorite club and its creepy mirror.I don’t know why it bothered me so much, but it did. It even got to the point where any talk of that club kind of scared the shit out of me.According to Bats, this club was only for people who’d accepted who they really were. The bouncers were good at figuring that out (“Creepy good,” Bats told me, “and trust me, I know because one of them loves me”).But just to make sure, they brought every new patron to the Mirror Room first. The mirror in the Mirror Room was magic, and it reflected who you really were. If your reflection matched your outsides, you were good. But if you didn’t know who you were, the reflection came out wrong.And when that happened, it drove you crazy.It sounds like a particularly stupid urban legend, but Bats swore up and down that it was true. “It’ll drive you crazy. I’ve seen it. That’s why I can’t bring you to the club yet. I can have a bastard in my house, but I can’t have acrazybastard. So you have to wait until you can wear your insides out.”I know this all sounds insane.But it all starts to make more sense when you understand that Bats had a chronic substance abuse problem. She functioned pretty well, but you could always tell when she was high. One of her tells was that she wouldn’t shut up about this mirror.Finally I got sick of it, and one night on her way out to the mirror club with her friends she was actually close to - the friends who were actually her friends, not her pets - asked to come along.She told me no. “It’s a place for people who have accepted who they are. And you, my little bastard, are nowhere close.”Then she kissed the top of my head while her friends who were friends and not pets tittered. Then they all trouped out in a cloud of scarves and body glitter and shimmering eyeshadow.No matter what I said, I wanted to go with them.But I couldn't.The biggest problem I had - the real problem - is that people like Bats ruin the lives of people like me.I grew up as a trailer trash foster kid with no past and no future. Just another dead end kid trapped  in the center of a deadly moat. A kid who had to decide whether to drown, or take a running leap and pray to God I cleared the water.I’d taken the leap.I’d cleared the water, but barely.Just barely.My heels are still stuck in the bank, and it's crumbling beneath my feet while I pinwheel for balance.Bats, meanwhile, was dancing on the water behind me, calling for me because she thought I was like her, that I was born to dance on the water too. But she only thought that because I pretended so well. Because I wore good behavior as surely as I wore my bastard coat.That was the real problem, the true problem:No matter what Bats thought, I was nothing like her.And as I watched her and her friends who weren’t pets vanish into the night, I knew it.They were bats, fragile and unsafe, winging through the night. I was a bastard, safe and warm and armored in my coat.Or at least that’s what I told myself as I microwaved dinner and went to bed.I dreamed of her club that night.In the dream, tall shadows with blue eyes like stars stalked a bottomless pit that echoed with atonal music and the low, awful laughter that has, for my entire life, suffused my nightmares.I woke as Bats stumbled into the apartment, smiling and glittering and smeared with makeup, her outfit pasted to her skin with sweat. A cloud of perfume trailed behind her, settling over me as she stepped over my blanket bed.I watched her, feeling like a particularly stupid, ugly little girl.She saw me watching. Bats always saw me, even when I didn’t want her to.Finally she dropped down beside me, a glittering phantom, and stroked my hair.“It was an amazing night,” she said. “I wish you’d been there. And you will be soon. You’re so close to shedding your bastard coat. Then I can turn you inside out, and you can finally be you.”She was wrong.Weeks bled into each other. I grew more confident. My academy graduation drew closer. I made friends with other people who had taken the running leap to clear their moats. People who encouraged me, people who liked me. The ground beneath my feet stopped crumbling quite so fast.And my bastard coat got heavier by the day.Sometimes in my nightmares, I actually saw that coat. It always melted into my skin and settled over my bones. Instead of me wearing my insides out, my coat was wearing its way inside.One day after work, my sergeant walked me out to my car. She saw Bats waiting for me and said, “Take it from me: People like her will ruin your career.”That made me angry. It was so unfair. So untrue.Except maybe it was true.Maybe I knew it.And maybe that’s why I clung to Bats — because I wanted her to dance up and pull me off the crumbling bank and into the shark-infested moat.Except I didn’t want that. I didn’t.So I began the process of un-clinging.Only Bats didn’t allow it.I’m not saying that’s healthy. I’m just saying that’s how she was.And I lapped it up, like always.I couldn’t help it. I felt at peace when I was with her. I felt loved. I felt like I was home.I wasn’t, and IknewI wasn’t. But I pretended. Sometimes pretending is all we get.So I pretended Bats was my family. Actually, that’s not completely true. Shewasmy family, or at least the closest thing I had. But I pretended I was her family, too. And that really was pretend. Bats loved me, but she didn’t love me like family. She didn't love me best. She just loved me like she loved everyone else.But that was more than I’d ever had, and I took it without giving anything back except fake good behavior.A few weeks later, I graduated my academy. Bats refused to come to the ceremony on principle — “that’s too many bastards in one place for me, the smell alone would kill me —” but she took me to mini golf after.She was high and the sky was a blazing, hazy, smoggy riot of color so beautiful it could’ve come out of a nightmare. Everything was hot as hell and miserable until the sun went down, at which point it turned hot as hell and perfectly pleasant. Like the air was a warm bath.After our game, we bought the biggest drinks we could at the 7-11 and wandered to the park, where we laughed and yelled and danced like we were drunk. We weren’t, not at all. Except we were.Once we slurped the last of our soda and crunched the last pieces of sugar-stained ice, we plopped down on the grass and looked up at the sky. There were no stars because of light pollution, but we pretended.She said, “I’m taking you to the club tonight.”“Why?”“Because right this very minute, your bastard coat is slipping off and your insides are shining through. You have to see for yourself. Then you’ll shed your coat for good.”She pulled me to my feet and led me home, where she issued instructions: “Dress however you want. But leave your bastard coat open so everyone can see who you really are underneath.”I don’t remember what I wore, only that the night was so oppressively hot that I sweated through them immediately. But not in a way that made me feel disgusting.In a way that made me feel like I was sparkling.When we reached the club, there was a line winding down the sidewalk. Music inside echoed. It didn’t sound like club music, which was a relief, somehow.The line inched forward with aching slowness because the bouncer took so much time inspecting everyone. He raised their coats, patted them down, made them turn around and around. Normally this would have gotten my hackles way, way up, but this wasn’t normal. Somehow, there was something completely, primally right about what he was doing. For some reason, that sense of utter rightness unsettled me as much as if he actually had been predatory.“I’m glad it’s him tonight,” Bats said happily. “He’s the one who loves me.”To pass the time, I studied the people in line. With unease, I noticed a few faces I’d seen on my recent rounds in the county jail. My mentor’s words wound through my mind like a poisoned current:People like her will ruin your career.Finally we reached the bouncer.Bats swept forward. The way he looked at her proved her right: He adored her.He checked her over and waved her in with a smile that enchanted even me. Bats crossed the threshold and spun around, smiling at me from her cloud of glitter and shadows.Then the door swung shut, and it was my turn.As the bouncer’s eyes turned to me, I suddenly felt heavy. So weighed down, and terribly, terribly hot. Like I was wearing the biggest, heaviest coat on earth.He swept my hair back, turned my head this way and that, tugged the strap of my dress.He had no smile for me.Finally he said, “You can’t come in. Your bastard coat has become your skin.”The world kind of stopped.I felt so stupid. So embarrassed. So I did what I always did when I was upset, which was laugh.Then I spun around and marched home. To my home, not hers.That night I dreamed of the club again. Of its wide-smiled doorman marching me to the magic mirror. The glass swirled with darkness and blinding light and dozens of eyes, each and every one locking onto me. Terror drowned me, followed by panic. I twisted and flailed against the bouncer, who flung me in front of the mirror.I knew, deep in my heart, that I couldn’t look at my reflection. That I couldn’t inflict whatever waited there on the world or myself.So I closed my eyes.Then I woke up and got ready for work.Bats was waiting for me when my shift ended. I tried to avoid her, but Bats didn’t know how to be avoided.And I didn’t know how to stay away from someone who loved me.So I got in her car and she drove us back to her apartment. Back home.Back when I was in foster care, I always dreamed of coming home. In reality, going home only ever felt sad. But in my dreams, stepping across the threshold into my parents’ home felt like a relief so profound it was heartbreaking.Stepping into Bats’ apartment felt like that. It always felt like that. That’s why I couldn’t ever stay away from it, or her.I know it wasn’t fair. I’d never been fair to Bats. From the very beginning, I always took more than I gave.But something about my experience at the club — about the bouncer’s face when he told me my bastard coat had become my skin — made me take even more from her.And the more I took, the more she seemed to love me.So I kept taking without giving.And I wasn’t the only one. Just look at who stayed in her home, who she spent her time with, who she sought out, who she protected. Bats loved people who needed her, and she gave everything to people who took everything.So that’s what I did. I thought it would be okay. Well, no. That’s not true. I just never thought about it.She did, though.One day while making another batch of those chili cookies, she said, “I think you only love me because I give what no one else ever has. And I’m glad because that means you’ll never let me go.”Then she hugged me, in the process powdering me with flour and cocoa and cayenne pepper.I felt the weight of my bastard coat sinking into my skin. Sinking deep. Turning my insides into itself.“I’d never let you go anyway,” I lied.She didn’t answer. When Bats didn’t answer you, it meant she didn’t believe you.And honestly, that pissed me off.So I decided to do something about it.That night, like most nights, she took off with her friends who weren’t pets to go to their magic mirror club. I stayed behind. As I got ready for bed, I put my pajamas on inside out.When Bats stumbled in at five in the morning, she didn’t notice.When I got up for the day, I put my shirt and my pants on inside out and made breakfast.She staggered into her tiny kitchen a little later, bleary eyed and so smeary with makeup she looked more like an impressionist painting than a person.It took her fifteen minutes to notice my clothes were on inside out, and when she did she laughed until she hiccuped. “You’ll shed that bastard coat soon, don’t worry.”The thing is, I think I could have shed my bastard coat right then and there. I could actually feel it, heavy on my shoulders, off-center and slowly sliding off.Almost without realizing, I shrugged my shoulders up, just like you do to keep an actual, real, oversized coat in place.Nothing important happened for a while after that.More work, a couple of magical outings with Bats sprinkled between dozens of outings with my new work friends, more nightmares about the club with its mirror.And like any junkie presented with an endless fix, I kept taking more from Bats than I gave.This sounds crazy too, but taking from her made me feel stronger. More stable. Moreme.Like the ground was no longer crumbling beneath my feet.Bats, meanwhile, seemed to shrink. She diminished, somehow. And she was always so cold. Even when she came home from the club, she was no longer a furnace giving off sweat-damp heat. She was cool and clammy. Like she was sick. Or like something was eating her.Knowing what I know now, I think something was.And I think that something was me.She came to the same conclusion because she woke me up one night, drunk and staggering.“I’m sorry I’m drunk,” she slurred. “I know you hate it, but I had to get drunk because that’s the only way I can say this to you. I don’t want to say it, but I need to. You know how that feels, don’t you? When you need to do something even though it’s the very last thing you want?”“Yeah,” I said cautiously.She gave me a broken smile as her eyes misted with tears. “Your bastard coat’s trying to shed, but you keep putting it back on. And you keep using me to help. I can’t do that. You need to be who you want to be, whoever that is. But if you want to be that — if you’re fighting to turn into that — you need to do it somewhere else, with someone you’re not using.”The bottom fell out of my world. Anger immediately welled up like blood in a wound, buoying me.“Other than my sister,” Bats said, “there’s no one I’d rather be around than you. You’re my favorite. I’m your favorite too. But you’re my favorite because I love you. I’m your favorite because you use me.”That was the end.Even though she could barely walk in a straight line, she insisted on escorting me back to my apartment. I was selfish, so I let her.On her way back home, she got hit by a drunk driver and died. The guy is still in jail. I know because I check every year.My world shuddered on its axis and collapsed, leaving me to cling to the rim of reality. To the soft wet edge of that moat as the ground crumbled beneath my fingers.The weeks following were half hazy living nightmare, half starkly boring monotony. Everything was far too real even though nothing was real enough.For some reason, I started running.Before work, after work, all day on my days off. Sometimes I’d wake up in the middle of the night and just go out for a run. Flying blindly through the night in darkness thick and warm as syrup.I don’t even remember it. I remember that Ididit, but don’t have any actual memories. Just a dreamy, endless impression of my feet on sunbleached concrete and ribbons of buckled asphalt and tired yellow grass in the park.Hour after hour, night after night, I ran. Almost like I was looking for her. I think I was. I think part of me was trying to catch her, somehow, before she got hit by that car. Hoping I could turn back time or change the future, or maybe just slide into a world where she was still alive. Maybe the very same world where crossing my parents’ threshold was a joyful homecoming instead of the latest step in our dysfunctional dance of separation and reunion.I was running through a living nightmare of my own making to chase down a dream.And one night — just as the weather began to turn, still warm but with the taste of in the air  — I woke up.Reality rushed back in, brightly lit and dark-skied and irretrievably broken, and I found myself in front of Bats’ club.The line wound around the block, full of people coated in multicolored lights.I went to the back of the line and joined them, snaking forward step by maddeningly slow step until I was finally face to face with the bouncer, bathed in every hue of neon.It was the bouncer who’d turned me away before. The one who loved Bats. I expected him to denounce my bastard coat and send me on my way.Instead he waved me in.The inside of the club reminded me of Bats’ apartment: Dark walls draped with color and tangled webs of string lights. The cramped floor was dotted with mismatched tables. There were only two doorways: The one I’d just entered, and a wildly ornate door with a wooden sign that saidMirror Thru Here.At the back was a stage so tiny I couldn’t figure out how the band fit on it.Their music filled the place. It wasn’t club music. I couldn’t tell you what genre it was. It was soothing and unsoothing, happy and heartbreaking, home and somewhere faraway all blended together into invisible smoke.I took a seat at one of the mismatched tables — one that reminded me of the nicked, scratched, paint-splattered folding table my grandma kept in her old house — and watched the band.When the set ended, I stood up just as someone touched my hand.I looked up and saw the bouncer. He looked back with resignation.Then he slid into the seat beside me. “She told me you were just like her,” he said.I didn’t need to ask who he meant.“Can I see if that’s true?”I nodded because I didn’t know what else to do. He gave me a smile — a small, pained one, nothing like the magic one he reserved for Bats — then pulled me to my feet and across the floor.I felt like I was in a dream. Not just any dream, but the dream where Bats was fine, where I’d never hurt her, where going home to my mother felt like joy instead of another disaster. A dream where the ground no longer crumbled beneath my feet.The bouncer led me through the ornate door.Bats was there.Bats, laying on a table, motionless and slack and asymmetrical, bruised and broken, torn into pieces in the special way vehicles break human beings into pieces.Terror drowned me, the strongest, deepest fear I've ever known, flooding the bounds of my moat and threatening to pull me back into the current.But it receded, slowly.And once receded, I approached the table.Bats was dead, but not dull. Her skin shone dimly and unevenly, like a guttering flame. In places where her flesh had been ravaged and road-rashed into nonexistence, her insides glittered through like powdered glass.Around her was a shimmering, multicolored storm of activity.People surrounded the table. A few I recognized from the shining, smiling pack that drifted in and out of her apartment. People who were her friends, not her pets. People who danced on the water with her while I watched bitterly from my crumbling shore. Most I didn’t recognize at all, although a few felt familiar in ways I can’t explain.Two of those were angling a large mirror over her body. They were built strangely — thin, spidery, almost spindly, and terribly graceful. They weren’t frightening or ugly, but looking at them too long made my stomach flip flop and clench the way it does when I see a horrific injury.Their mirror caught and magnified Bats' chest, then turned sideways so that the bouncer and I could see. My breath caught:Where her heart should have been was a ragged, gaping hole.“We’ve been trying to wake her up since she got here,” the bouncer told me. Every word wound through my head, gentle and hypnotic. “But she’s missing something. You can give it back.”I looked at Bats' reflection, at the way different colors rose and fell and danced across her skin, like light on dying embers. At the empty cavern where her heart should be.I understood what the bouncer was asking.And in that moment, I was dying to give it.I grabbed my own chest, expecting my fingers to sink into my skin the way my bastard coat did in nightmares, or maybe for everything to already be cut open. It's insane, but somehow I really thought I’d be able to reach into my own chest cavity to pull out my heart and put it in her chest. I wanted to. I was ready to.The bouncer took my hand again. “It’s not that easy. First, we have to make absolutely sure you’re just like her.”Then he turned me around to face another, much smaller door across the room. It was half open. Darkness bled out. Etched into it were the wordsMirror Room.Bats’ magic mirror.The mirror that shows what you really are. That proves you’re who you really are, or drives you insane.The thing, I realized, that I feared more than anything.The bouncer took me by the arms like an insolently graceful dance partner and led me to the door.Unlike my nightmares, I didn’t fight or flail, and he didn’t fling me down. He only pushed me inside gently, then shut the door.The darkness was absolute and my terror overwhelming for one endless second.Then the lights snapped on, heavy as syrup, hot as the sun, illuminating swirling storms of dust and the massive mirror across from me.I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Just a glimpse. It was enough to make me panic.I covered my eyes and stayed that way for a long time, sweating under the lights with my hands pressed to my face.At some point, I realized I was shaking.That opened the door for other perceptions, each more painful than the last. The heat. The sweat cutting rivulets down my painfully hot skin. My clothes clinging to me like oily film.And over it all, thick and heavy and maddeningly itchy, was a coat.The heaviest, itchiest, most awful coat I could have ever dreamed of.My bastard coat somehow brought into reality.It wasn’t just itchy, it was painful. I felt like it was sinking past my sweat-soaked clothes and straight to my skin where it just kept sinking. I could feel the individual fibers, a thousand white-hot filaments, cooking their way into my body.My outside, eating its way in.I finally parted my fingers to bare one eye. I kept it squinted, ready to snap it shut at the first hint of insanity, and glanced at the mirror.All I saw was me.I covered my face again and took a deep breath. I steeled my spine, squared my shoulders. Then I dropped my hands to my sides, and opened my eyes.My reflection was only me.Only me in a ragged, sweat-drenched coat with a funny motley pattern. It hung wide open, so huge it threw most of my body into shadow. My skin glimmered strangely underneath, not with sweat but something else. Not anything beautiful. Something eerie and upsetting, the visual equivalent of the bone-chilling music I always hear in nightmares. But it wasn’t a nightmare. It was me.Just me in a big ugly coat.Relief crushed upward like a reverse avalanche, and burst out of me in peals of laughter.My knees went so weak that I lowered myself to the floor amid the storm of swirling dust. The coat tented over me as the syrupy hot lights dimmed. The room was still oppressively, terribly hot, but softly so. Like the mini golf course after dark. Suffocating but pleasant, like a hot bath.The door creaked open.Soft footsteps approached. Someone knelt beside me and slid their hands under my coat. I tensed up as a dozen ugly memories of even uglier touches threatened to crash over me, but those hands only went under my arms to raise me gently to my feet.It was the bouncer, apologetic and gentle and so, so sad.“You’re not a match for her,” he said.Another reverse avalanche crushed upward, this time exiting in the form of sobs. I’d failed her. I’d used her until it killed her, then failed her.He put his arms around my shoulders the way Bats used to do. “Don’t be sad. She’d want it this way. You’re not the last person she wants to take from, but you’re close. This is better. I promise.”He led me into the room where Bats lay slack and asymmetrical on her table. As we passed, I took her hand one last time, focusing on the feel of her broad palm and long fingers while people I couldn’t bring myself to look at angled the mirror over her missing heart.But I caught a glimpse of her face in the mirror. Her reflection at least didn’t look slack or asymmetrical. She was horrifyingly beautiful and monstrously lovely, the worst yet most welcome thing I’ve ever seen.The bouncer walked me out, past the mismatched tables and the band and the glittering, shimmering people in the shadows, and all the way back onto the street, where he straightened my coat and smoothed my hair back. I noticed, for the first time, that he was wearing a coat, too. It was a different color and pattern — stripes, not motley — but cut exactly the same. Unlike mine, his fit perfectly. Beyond perfectly.Like a second skin.“It’s okay to wear a bastard coat,” he said. “You don’t have to wear your insides out, just as long as your outsides don’t wear in. She didn’t understand that.” He gave me a sad and enchanting half smile. “I’m glad you’re not a match. It would have hurt me to take you apart.”Then he sent me on my way, with my bastard coat dragging on the ground behind me.I staggered home just like Bats used to, stumbling through my apartment in a haze of shimmering sweat. I collapsed on my bed as the room spun gently.As I fell asleep, I noticed I couldn’t see my coat anymore. I couldfeelit, heavy as ever on my shoulders. But I couldn’t see it.I haven’t seen it since.I know it’s there. I feel it sometimes when I focus, but it’s not heavy or too big. It just feels like a second skin.Anyway, I didn’t learn anything from that.I didn’t become a better person. I didn’t change my ways or have some kind of stoner-ass Ebenezer Scrooge awakening.I just woke up the next morning, standing on the edge of my moat while the ground crumbled under my heels, and missed her.I don't know what else to say, except I'd give a lot to go back and change it.Or at least to give her a fraction of what shegave me.",

      "content_preview": "Knock. Knock. Knock.I awoke before the sound came, as I always did. The noise was never loud—only sure. Three soft raps, spaced just so, like a memory knocking on bone. The hush that followed was heavy, not around me but inside me. My heart beat fast in the dark, as if warning me of something I hadn’t remembered yet. Something had followed me out of sleep—not just the knock, but a shadow. A nightmare. Or the echo of one.I could still feel it clinging behind my ribs, wet and cold like a newly thawed spring. There’d been crying. Or maybe screaming. The details slipped through my fingers like cornmeal—the more I reached, the faster they scattered. But I was certain of one thing: the nightmare and the knocking had surfaced together. They shared something. A rhythm. A root.I lay still, waiting for my heart to slow, and breathed through the silence. The room smelled of extinguished fire and cedar from the wedding chest at the bed’s foot—carved by hands that never came home. I sat up slowly, one palm to the mattress, one to my knee until it popped. My fingers ached with morning, though it was just past midnight.The quilt pooled at my waist, seams worn thin by decades of tugging it close—of holding warmth in a house that had forgotten what warmth meant. Down the hallway, the parlor clock ticked through dust. Its walnut case dulled to dried tobacco, edges nicked by generations of touch. Cobwebs veiled its corners like lace. The pendulum swung behind clouded glass, slow and hesitant. Age carved into wood and woman, but still, they ticked on.I didn’t bother with the lamp—an old relic with a blackened chimney and brass base, lost to time. I moved through the house like I belonged—not as mistress or guest, but as memory. In the parlor, the photograph still stood—untouched. A barefoot girl in muslin leaned into a boy in Confederate grey, his smile nervous, his cavalry hat askew, as if rebellion followed him from battlefield to altar.We’d posed nearly half a minute, stiff and still, hands grazing their sides. I had been breathless—not from nerves, but awe. A photograph—a miracle. When the shutter clicked, I’d believed they’d captured eternity. Now it was no miracle, only a testimony to loss. A frame of grief dressed as memory.I paused. Listened. Then moved to the window. The lace curtain, yellowed and thumbtacked where the rod had long since failed, stirred faintly. I lifted a corner. Frost had come— I felt it in my joints and saw it threading the pane like tiny roots. The yard stretched wide beneath the moon. Five elms stood crooked along the fence, cloaked in moss. They’d been planted before sorrow replaced the love in these walls.Beneath the tallest elm—the one planted last—something shifted.A shadow. Small. Still. Watching.The knocking hadn’t come again. It never did. Just once—three measured taps at 12:37—and then silence. The kind that presses on your chest and dares you to breathe.“Maybe it’s the wind,” I said, though my voice didn’t sound like my own. “Or ghosts?”I lingered at the window. Far past the elms, beyond the orchard and brittle fence line, I could smell it—a storm. Not yet arrived, but coming, thick on the air like bruised peaches and burnt iron. The kind that made floorboards groan to break free. I felt it in my pulse, but the wind whispered not yet; the house waited with me.Seven nights. Seven knocks. The idea of closing my eyes again without knowing what called from within the elm was inconceivable. I turned from the window, and the hallway was ringing with silence, like a bell toward some unholy hour.I found the axe where it had always been—leaned crooked behind the cellar door. The handle was splintered, the blade rust-flecked, but it would do. It had to.I stepped into the yard barefoot. Wind clawed at my nightgown, cold biting my bare soles. The night opened before me like a letter I’d once read and buried—and now had no choice but to read again.The axe ached in my grip—not from weight alone, but from muscles long atrophied. My shoulders winced with each gust. Cold gnawed through my joints; my lungs burned with night air, but I held on. As one does a duty. The elm loomed ahead, the only thing making a sound in the vast yard. A slow groan from within—like wind trapped in wood. It had been there for seven nights. Calling. Beckoning. Pleading for my undivided attention.I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and pushed forward — pain temporarily and hastily tucked behind memory.Three mornings ago — on the fourth knock — I’d forced herself into town.It had taken everything I had. I reached the chapel just as the last of the congregation filed out into Sunday light. There he was—the pastor, standing stoically in the doorway. Middle-aged. Soft-spoken. Startled. Not with recognition, but the pause a man gives a ghost.“Ma’am… You’re from the Peach Plantation, ain’t you?”“I’m Willa,” I said, voice low, hands trembling. “I need help. There’s something in the elm. Something knocking. I see shadows in the orchard. I feel them in the floorboards. I—” my voice cracked then steeled with resolve, “I need the house blessed.”“Miss Willa,” he said at last, gentle but careful, “ain’t nobody lived there but you since the war. Folks say even the workers stayed out the house.”“The land’s mine,” I whispered. “But not what stirs inside it.”He nodded slowly, unreadable. His eyes lingered — uncertain, unsettled. They reminded me of someone. Not the preacher he was, but the boy he might’ve been?  Had I known him, back then?A boy playing in the orchard before brother killed brother in the name of country?“Maybe it’s the wind,” he said finally, voice steady and soft.He hadn’t offered prayer—only a slow, pitying glance.“Of course,” I replied, barely more than breath. “The wind.”He opened his mouth—maybe to call after me, maybe not—but I’d already turned away.“You were right,” I murmured, not looking back. “My senses have dulled with age.”I wasn’t sure he heard. Wasn’t sure it mattered. I knew it wasn’t the wind.That was three days ago. Three more knocks since.I opened my eyes as I reached the elm. “It wasn’t the wind,” I muttered, teeth clenched. “And I aim to know what it is.”The elm rose before me like a gallows. Its limbs twisted heavenward, draped in Spanish moss that fluttered without wind. The air was thick, the sky bruised and waiting. Each gust carried warning. I paused at the base, hand trembling—not from fear, but something quieter. Solemn sadness.“I gotta know,” I whispered.I lifted the axe. The first swing struck crooked, skimming the bark. The blade bounced back, jarring my elbow with a crackle of old bone. My breath caught, fingers slipped—but I grit my teeth and steeled myself for the next blow.The second swing landed better. The third, better still. A deep gash yawned in the bark, weeping syrup-dark sap. In the flash of lightning, it gleamed—not just sap, but tears. My own, withheld with every swing, now falling through the tree instead.On the fourth swing, the handle gave way with a splintering snap, and the broken shaft gashed the thin, translucent skin of my palm. I let out a strangled cry—more shock than sound—and crumpled beneath the elm. My knees buckled in the frozen mud. My body folded like damp parchment, soaked and too brittle for another blow. The axe fell. I no longer knew if my tears were from pain or defeat—only that I couldn’t hold them back, not after seeing myself bleed echoing the fate of the damned tree.The tree was bleeding. I was bleeding.The tree was weeping. I was weeping.I am dying. Was the tree dying too?I feel it now—the truth settling in my ribs like wet cotton. Death is close. I hear it pacing behind the storm, waiting for me to surrender. But I won’t. Not yet. Not before uncovering the truth beneath this cursed, groaning tree. Not before learning what haunts me. Or who haunts me?I reach for the broken haft, hands slick with mud and blood, and begin to dig. If I can’t fell it, I’ll unearth it. I will not be turned away. Thunder cracks above, sharp as judgment as I claw through roots and decay—and then, I see it. Even in darkness, I see it. Confederate Grey.A scrap of fabric, water-stained, tangled around something round. Familiar. My chest constricts. The storm roars louder, and the years dissolve.The wind howls as it had that night—the same frantic moaning through the shutters, the same thunder rattling the house to its bones. I’d been alone then, too. Heavy with grief. The silence around me so thick she had nearly drowned.My husband had died in Virginia. The letter was full of apologies, folded too many times, stained by someone else’s fingers. I buried it in my wedding chest—and my heart alongside it.The wounded soldier came in the misty fortnight that followed, limping and ghost-eyed. I nursed him in the parlor where my wedding photo still stood. A sentinel overseeing my every sinful move.His gaze never lingered and he never touched me—until that last night. Rain was thick on the windows. No words. No protest. Just what we both desperately needed: comfort, compassion, companionship in a long night of sorrow and loneliness.He had left before the ground dried, but his presence had already taken root.I hadn’t known. Not really. The signs meant little to a girl raised on silence and obedience. No midwife. No mother. No whisper of what to expect when life began to sprout inside me. I only understood when the pain dropped me to the parlor floor—when the storm outside matched the one inside, and he had come into the world with thunder as his first lullaby.He was beautiful. Startling blue eyes. Strong lungs. A cry like a trumpet that could’ve woken the whole plantation. I tried to feed him. Tried to hush him. But the storm grew, and his screams grew louder and louder—until the house itself felt like it would burst.I was afraid.I was ashamed.I wrapped him in the only thing nearby—the Confederate Grey blanket from the soldier’s forgotten trunk. The same one I now held in my trembling fingers. I had pressed him to my chest, crying and whispering apologies into his damp, dark hair as I silenced his cries beneath the fabric. He had looked up at me, his small eyes wide— not in fear. Not in anger. In confusion. In concern.Just like the pastor.The fabric slips free, sodden and delicate as old parchment. Confederate Grey, dulled by soil and sorrow. Threads unraveling like veins in my hands. Beneath it sits something small. Round. Porcelain-white under a slick of mud. I blink, but the storm lights the saturated ground again.Bones.A piece of skull, no larger than my palm. Nearby, smaller fragments—a curve of rib, the faintest suggestion of fingers. I don’t scream. Don’t cry. I bow. Not in reverence, but in collapse. My forehead presses into the soil, the storm soaking me through. My breath coming in heaves, but the air feels clearer, as if truth has punctured the weight I’ve unknowingly carried in chest all these years.“I remember,” I whisper. “God help me, I remember.”The wind howls louder, and through it I hear him. Not the infant he was, but the boy he might’ve been- laughter in the orchard, unsteady footsteps in the hall, a man’s voice in the dark, “Mama?” I reach out with mud-caked fingers and gather what I can to cradle against my chest. The pieces are cold and crumbling, but to me they feel reverent and precious. Because they are. Because they always had been.I know the knocking will never come again—not after the earth gave up its truth and revealed my darkest secret.Now, only silence and thunder will echo through the elms.",

      "content_preview": "\"We haven't stopped in awhile,\" said the woman across the aisle.She'd never said a word to me before.It's funny how that works. We shared this commute through the city every morning, and all I knew about her was that she liked paperback thrillers and wore a mauve peacoat when it was chilly out. We even got off at the same stop. I always headed left towards the shopping district while she disappeared into one of the corporate office buildings across the plaza.I looked up from the word puzzle on my phone, startled. \"Pardon?\"She took off her sunglasses, her dark eyes fixed on mine.\"Why haven't we stopped yet?\" I looked down at my word search. I'd completed three entire rounds. Usually I barely got through the first before our stop.Glancing up at the destination sign did nothing to calm my rising confusion. It flickered on and off, displaying North Fifth Street and Winston Ave interchangeably.\"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"Weird.\" The woman snapped her novel shut and stood up with a huff, gripping the guard rails and weaving between other commuters as she made her way to the driver. He didn't turn around.\"Sir,\" she said, raising her voice over the shuddering of the bus. \"You missed our stop. I have a meeting with a client that I can't be late for. Can you hear me?\"The driver said nothing. The woman stood there, arms folded, then dug her phone out of her coat pocket.\"This is ridiculous,\" she said. \"I'm reporting this to your company.\" I'd thought it was a bit of an overreaction at the time. I returned to my mobile games.I heard her wait on hold, transfer to another line, wait on hold some more, then finally lodge a complaint with the bus company. All the while, we still hadn't stopped. I noticed that other passengers were beginning to look uncomfortable and irritated as well. A couple of teens in school uniforms were huddled together in the back corner, whispering. The young mom bouncing her baby on her knee began to glance out the window, her brow furrowed. An older balding gentleman near the front tapped his cane against his seat impatiently, then stood up.\"Listen to the lady, gosh darn it,\" he shouted up to the driver. \"We've all got places to be!\"I didn't know if that was true. I wasn't exactly yearning to get back to boxing to-go orders at the noodle place downtown during lunch hour. If anything this odd little diversion from my routine was a good excuse for a much needed break. Plus, it would make for a good story to tell to the guys at the shop tomorrow.When the driver still remained silent, the old man made his way to the front.\"Alright, what's the big idea?\" he said. \"Look at me!\" he grabbed the driver's shoulder and tugged.At this point, the driver turned around. His face was pale, almost slimy. He looked ill, his eye sockets sunken. His hair was long and greasy, hanging in strips that fell into his glassy eyes.He gave a wet choke that sounded like a curse, spitting up dark blood onto the old man's face.Then, the driver fell into the aisle with a thud, narrowly missing mauve peacoat woman, who had just hung up on the bus company. He lay there with open, empty eyes. Dead.Pandemonium broke lose. Everyone was screaming. The high schoolers pulled out their phones to document the situation. A businessman by the doors heaved like he might vomit. The baby started wailing. Some people shuffled out of their seats while others pulled their legs in, desperate to get as far from the body as possible. The bus gave a sickening lurch, throwing everyone off-balance.I felt my breakfast rise in my throat and swallowed, heart hammering in my chest.In the midst of the chaos, the woman in the peacoat stepped around the body, clutching the guard rails. If she was as terrified as I and everyone else on the bus was, she didn't show it. She looked around with narrowed eyes.I approached her. She noticed and ran to meet me in the middle, heels clicking down the blood-spattered aisle.\"What do we do?\" I asked breathlessly. She seemed to be the only one not actively losing their mind to hysteria. I trusted her judgement more than my own.\"Who's steering?\" she barked.She was right. Somehow, we hadn't crashed yet. I paused, standing up straight. The bus was now rolling down a smooth path while its passengers braced for a collision which that would never come.I looked out the window. Outside, the city blocks had given way to wider roads. I saw an exit sign coming up ahead.Simultaneously, the woman and I looked up towards the driver's seat. It was mostly obscured by the panicking crowd. We crept our way back up the aisle, avoiding the body.Someone was sitting in the driver's seat. I went up ahead to see who it was.The old man with the cane was steering the bus now, humming to himself. I was both relieved and perplexed. He looked over at me with a smile, his face still flecked with the dead driver's blood.\"You look like a responsible young man,\" he said. \"Take over, will you?\"\"I can't.\" I had never operated a bus in my life.The old man jumped out of the seat and scurried off.I dove into the driver's seat and grabbed the steering wheel, panicking as the bus lurched once more.I fumbled and got it under control, taking all of my will and concentration to keep the massive vehicle heading straight down the lane. The man had directed us onto the freeway. Cars zoomed by on both sides. I don't believe in God, but in that moment I began to pray to something, my sweaty palms slipping on the wheel.In the wide mirror above the windshield, I could see the back of the man's shiny bald head as he stepped to the aisle with open arms.\"Will you all SHUT UP?\" he bellowed with a surprising ferocity for his frail form. \"Losing your heads won't change a thing.\" The chaos paused, everyone turning to look at him in shock.I kept my eyes on the road.\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the tour of a lifetime,\" said the old man with the bravado of a ring-leader. There were noises of protest and confusion. The baby began to fuss softly.\"What is this?\" the businessman spoke up boldly, breaking the tension. \"A terrorist attack?\"A wet crunch echoed through the near-silent bus, like a watermelon smashed on pavement, followed by a chorus of shrieks and gasps. In abject horror, I realized that the old man had stepped on the dead driver.\"I already told you,\" the old man said. He sounded impatient. \"It's a tour. How dull can you be?\"I wanted to leap up and do something, anything, but all I could do was drive. The old man cleared his throat.\"Now, first things first. If we're going to get to know each other on this little trip, we can't be buried in our cellular devices. I see you all typing, sending little messages. Can't have that. Give them to me, please.\" I heard a shuffling as most people complied out of abject fear.\"Please.\" He said more insistently. Glancing in the mirror again, I saw that he'd drawn a gun from his waistband and was pointing it at the women in the mauve coat.She sat there, unsmiling. He cocked the gun.She handed her phone over.\"Anyone else? Last call!\" No one moved. Satisfied, the old man moved to stand at the front again.\"Now, let's go around. Everyone share their name and, oh what the heck, one fun fact about yourself.\"While this was happening, I considered the bus's brake system. The thought crossed my mind: if I could just stop the bus, maybe we had a fighting chance. Or, better yet, if someone could distract him while he was giving his spiel...\"I'll go first,\" the man was saying cheerfully. \"Call me Frank. Fun fact, I used to be a pastor before I found my true calling.\"I scanned the freeway for a safe spot to pull over to the shoulder. Where would we even go if we made it off?It was at this point I remembered: Frank hadn't confiscatedmyphone. As I tried to subtly fish for it in my back pocket without losing control of the wheel, I listened.There were thirteen of us in total, not counting our kidnapper.The woman in the mauve coat was a lawyer named Natalie.The businessman, Ed, had three daughters at home.Kim, the woman with the baby, was a forensic student at the nearby college.The rest of the passengers continued to introduce themselves, but I tuned them out as I opened the message app on my phone and began to type one-handed, glancing up intermittently to avoid swerving.I struggled with how to give our current location to emergency services aside from the general name of the freeway. I scanned the roadside for any kind of signage.Then I saw it:Rest Stop, 1 Mile.I sent my message to 911, hoping for the best.Behind me, one of the high schoolers, Jackson, asked a question.\"Where are we going?\" There was a long, measured silence. I gripped the wheel with white knuckles, waiting for the worst.\"A party,\" said Frank. \"A birthday party.\" For who, he didn't say.The rest stop came into view.Now was my chance. As smoothly as I could manage, I switched lanes. I took the exit, tearing into the large vehicle zone. It was midday by now. The rest stop was relatively busy, with families and truckers ducking in and out of the main building to use the restroom and buy refreshments.I engaged the brake with a deafening screech. A roar of panic rose as everyone was thrown by the sudden stop. Once things settled, people immediately began to clamber from their seats, slamming against the closed automatic doors and clawing at the emergency exits.I saw something flash in my peripheral. Frank had turned the gun on me. I was cornered in the driver's seat.\"If you all leave, this man dies,\" he said calmly. I shook my head violently, dizzy with fear.If the group sentenced me to death, they had a chance at freedom. If they spared me, who knows where we would be headed. He was offering a literal trolley problem.I stared into Frank's weathered gaze, trying to seem braver than I was. One of his eyes was pure black, like an eight ball fracture. Somehow, I hadn't noticed that before. It seemed to be leaking a dark, viscous substance.I noticed something else there, too. Desperation, I realized. He didn't want to kill me.I opened the doors.As I did, Ed, the businessman, tackled Frank from behind.The gun went off.I felt a searing pain across my face, my ears ringing from the pain and noise. I crumpled back against the window, head throbbing. My vision swam as I surveyed my surroundings.The two men wrestled in the aisle. There was a bottleneck at the doors, but some people had managed to escape by now.What follows is perhaps the least explicable of all the events I'd witnessed so far.Ed grabbed Frank's head, shoving him to the floor. As he did, Frank's head simply... gave way.It crumpled like a rotten pumpkin, splattering more of that viscous liquid across the seats and his suit.Ed screamed, scrambling back and wiping the sick contamination from his body. A steam began to rise from his skin and suit.Wherever the liquid had touched him, circles of pure, raw red were opening up on his flesh. In a matter of seconds, the tiny pockmarks turned to open sores which deepened like tunnels, until it looked as if he had been burrowed from the inside out. The air smelled rank, like turned meat searing on a grill. I was reminded of a shipment of bad pork I'd had to toss in the dumpster behind the restaurant, how the surface swelled with maggots. My stomach churned.As quickly as Frank's head had come apart, it began to reform. Like a time lapse in reverse, the skull and skin rearranged themselves, shards of bones clicking back into place through some unseen means.No longer restrained, Frank went for the door mechanism, forcing them shut again with a hiss.I couldn't fight back. I didn't want to risk touching that walking mass of disease. He was sick in more ways than one.I crawled from the seat as Frank took the wheel again, trying to avoid touching the pools of stinking liquid now leeching from Ed's twitching body.I found my place on the bench and lay there to catch my breath. Natalie sat across from me, her knees tucked in. I wanted to say something, to apologize for not taking her seriously that morning. I didn't have the energy to muster up more than an apologetic look. She turned away, looking out the window. No one felt much like talking.Next to her sat two of the high-schoolers, Jackson and a girl whose name I didn't know. At the back of the bus sat an old white-haired woman with a shopping bag, who also hadn't managed to make it out before the doors shut.Five people, two bodies. One driver who I am now certain is not human, at least not anymore.The bus lurched back onto the freeway, careening towards an unknown fate.We were nothing more than its passengers.__This happened two days ago. My temple is still throbbing where the bullet grazed my skin, but it's stopped bleeding. I have all but given up on emergency services coming to our aid. It's as if we've entered into some strange dimension where nothing can reach us.Nothing but Frank.We have only ever stopped to get gas or supplies a few times. There is a decrepit, filthy toilet system in the back alcove of this bus. The only food on board were the old woman's groceries. They quickly ran out among the five people. Now, we divide up whatever miscellaneous scraps Frank throws our way. He doesn't want us to starve. It's like he needs us to stay alive, for whatever reason.When he leaves, the bodies watch us. Propped up in the aisle with vacant, glass stares.I have seen them blink.The other day, I heard Frank muttering to himself about directions. I think we might be close to our destination. The birthday party. I have a prickling in my stomach, almost like excitement. Maybe it's just my yearning for clean air untarnished by the smell of rot.I can't be sure if my messages are making it out of this hell at all. I'm bored out of my mind, to tell the truth. I've never been one for road trips. So, here I am, shouting into the void to pass the time.Just in case: it's a blue bus with silver stripes, plastered with some beauty advertisement on one side and an anti-smoking PSA on the other. Bus 6. If you see hands pressed to the glass, please set us free.We're so very far fromhome.",

      "content_preview": "It’s never easy creating something artistic, music is no exception. I still find myself struggling, even though I’ve found “success” literally overnight. I no longer have a home, I no longer feel safe, and yet, I’m one of the most desirable DJs to exist in North America, if not the world at this point. It spread so fast.Someone needs to know what’s going on, and may this be the only thing you listen to that came from me.Five weeks ago, I had just sent off my rent to my landlord and was left with less than one hundred dollars to my name. My clothes were perforated from working my landscaping job, and I would have to wait a week until I got paid again to afford new pants that might just tear within two months' time. My stomach rumbled; it was time for another round of instant ramen.Keeping it blunt, I was a starving artist.I had no gigs lined up. I worked long hours for shit pay, but that gave me a lot of time to think about my music career at the very least.When it wouldbecomea career anyways. I was a dreamer, an idealist, no matter how much some of my friends and even my parents said that being a DJ was a pipe dream.My tracks on SoundCloud brought in two hundred views, Spotify even lower than that. I wasn’t going to give up that easily.My resilience paid off a few days later. A supportive friend of mine had sent me a link to a virtual plugin I could download. Getting new tracks, beats, and instruments always broadened my horizons.The website itself was pretty standard, it didn't seem like I’d get a virus by staying on one page for too long. There was something that piqued my interest when I was about to begin downloading:FREE PROMO EXPIRING SOON: CARNAGE COLLECTIONI wasn’t going to say no to two free plugins. The Carnage Collection had roughly twice the amount of samples and effects that the original plugin I intended on downloading had. Oddly enough it had zero ratings, but it looked legit enough. I pondered it, why would they give away free plugins, was it garbage?Really, what did I have to lose at this point? I got both downloaded and went to town trying out both plugins.I leaned heavily towards the Carnage Collection samples. Something about it tingled my brain in all the right ways. I spent the entire weekend making a track, something I never was capable of doing.It was as if the new plugins cheered me on, seemingly guiding me to make the best song possible. Funny enough, I still don’t remember making most of the song.Sunday night, I posted my new single–Tear It Up–on Soundcloud, Spotify, and a snippet on my Instagram page that had a mere 110 followers.I woke up, ready to go back to work, when my notifications on my phone changed my life forever:Tear It Uphad 600,000 plays on SoundCloud, 610,000 on Spotify. I had promoters and event organizers in my inbox asking for gigs. Willing to pay good money, too. They only acknowledged my new song. Their proposals were to play my new hit five times in a row. I thought it was bizarre, that’d be way too easy.I accepted a gig at the second largest venue in my city. They paid me high five-figures upfront! I had enough money to quit my job and sustain myself for the rest of the year. I worked one more week, then quit.Funny enough, my coworkers also loved my song. They said it made them energetic, and that listening to it made them want to break stuff. A bit rowdy, but good for any EDM artist to hear I suppose.I had come up with three new tracks over the course of my last week of work. None of them were to my memory, but playing them invigorated me. I felt my heart rate increase, my fists clenched to the point that I struggled to unclench them. I chalked it up to not sleeping well, and how could I? My first big gig was the next evening!It had been months since I got on stage. I had no graphic team to design high-quality visuals, so behind me were solid blocks of my logo:DJ CJ.The crowd screamed in excitement when I stepped to the mixer. I was slotted in right before the headliner, so I figured the crowd was already turned up. I was too nervous to even speak, so I just smiled and began playingTear It Up.I never imagined seeing the crowd go so feral for me. It made me think my next stop would be EDC, Chasing Summer, The Veldt, hell even Coachella.That’s when I noticed something was off, the mosh pit that formed in front was violent. During my fourth round of the song, security jumped in and got just as pummeled as the other ravers were. I could hear screaming and crying even through the music.A stagehand gestured for me to cut the music. I obliged.The crowd got angry, and began roaring at me in tones that didn’t even sound human. It sounded more animalistic.“We’re all here for a good time!” I called out. “Go wild, but don’t kill each other, you got that!?”The crowd went silent, but in near unison they apologized. The rest of the night went without a hitch, although security had to haul out some of the bloody and pulped.I got another large chunk of cash at the end of the night. I went home feeling satisfied, but a little unsettled.Tear It Uphad reached 900,000 on both of the main platforms. I had four times the amount of gig opportunities lined up in three days. I decided I’d give myself a bit of time to relax, and my next show was in four days.My other new songs–Hammer DownandEuphoric– were also beginning to climb in popularity. They each had around 300,000 plays, and I was given the green light to play those ones, too. All of them were made mostly with Carnage Collection.I managed to hire a graphic artist, Clarissa, to give me new visuals. She was…eccentric, but her portfolio was amazing. She insisted on blood and violence themes, but none that would disturb the public.I would hear my songs blaring from Clarissa’s earbuds constantly every meetup we had. The fans were also a bit strange, many of them would smear themselves in what I could only assume was fake blood.I began getting recognized in public. My fans were fidgety, eyes bulging wide when talking to me. They were all polite, but looked like they were about to snap on each other at any given moment. Still, a part of me welcomed the stardom, even if I only played one show.The next show was at a larger venue across the country. I’d never left my province before, so this was huge. Clarissa joined me, still playing my songs on loop through the entire flight there. Three songs on loop for nearly four hours, I couldn’t even do that.“I really am grateful to be here,” she said, left eye twitching rapidly despite her warm, attractive smile. She put her hand on my shoulder, that’s when I noticed the massive scabs on her knuckles and her crudely chewed nails.“I would’ve beat my boyfriend to death if I couldn’t.”Something in the way she said that made all the blood run to my feet. It was an awkwardly quiet time getting everything set up afterwards. I had cold feet, literally. A part of me knew something was off, and I wanted to cut the show.My mind blanked, and before I knew it I was on stage. The crowd easily tripled the size of my last gig. The sun was setting, making the LEDs and the glowing accessories worn by the ravers pop.“Who’s ready for something Euphoric!?” I called out. Rabid cheering answered.Euphoricwas a much slower song, and I noticed the crowd behaved a little more normal. Even Clarissa, who was up on stage with me, was bopping her head casually. For a moment, I felt relaxed, maybe my nerves really were getting to me.Until I playedHammer Down.Multiple fights broke out at once, and what was initially a rave became a literal riot. Men and women of all ages began duking it out. Clarissa eyed the crowd, her whole body twitching. I worriedly shot a look to the stagehands, who began ignoring me.Fuck it, I began switching tracks.I swore I swapped back toEuphoric. Instead, even louder,Tear It Upplayed.That’s when I noticed the crowd really changing. Many of the rave goers began foaming a deep red substance from the mouth. Some jumped higher than most athletes could, and the noises sounded more like wailing banshees than human beings. I tried shutting off the track, cutting power to the mixer.Nothing would stop my song from playing.Clarissa jumped into the crowd, bloody foam arcing through the air as she did. The song wanted this to happen. My legs quivered.Then, something flew from the crowd onto the stage, landing to my right with a sickening squelch.A severed head.Dried foam at the corners of the mouth, eyes wide, the skin was red enough to look burnt.The crowd began cheering like normal again, all while I stood in shock. I backed off the stage slowly. I covered my ears and began to weep as I went to the backstage lounge. Fortunately it was soundproof at this location. The other guest DJs and patrons were evidently concerned, and the show was called off.My “success” grew larger. I had enough money to buy a remote property in remote Ontario. I planned on moving there ASAP. I sent thousands to my family, warning them not to listen to my music for too long, and explaining that I’d need to hide. I actually had to. The following days, I realized the danger I was in.The fans would charge any sort of vehicle they suspected me to be in. Many would be so insanely eager to meet me, that they’d violently guard my posters in public, attack people that criticized the music, and they even ravaged my old coworkers so badly they destroyed some of the landscaping equipment.And that was when my music wasn’t playing.I managed to pull a few strings and get a helicopter escort to my property a week after hiding in remote hotels and sleeping in the armpits of the country. The first week at the property was blissful for a while, no internet, no music, no madness.I miss my family. I miss my friends. I almost miss being poverty stricken, because at least then I wasn’t watching over my shoulder for a rabid fan. I know they’re coming. The obsession, the mutations, all because of my desire to make music and that fucking demonic program.Who knows how much of the world is in this state now, because of me. I can only blame myself, and my ambition to have more than a pipe dream.They may know I’m out here, now. I’ve seen trampled bushes, claw marks on trees several kilometers off the property, even a dead moose that looked like it was beaten to death, not mauled. Did they track my spending records? Or do they justknowI’m out here?And what’s worse, in the distance I swear I can sometimes hear my songs echoing through the trees. I think they’re getting close. Looking for their next hit from me.If you ever see a plugin called Carnage Collection, do not download it. Success is not worth the suffering and fear that follows.",

      "content_preview": "My name doesn’t matter. My town’s name doesn’t matter either. It’s one of those dusty, forgotten places at the edge of the desert that you only end up in if you were born here or your car broke down on the way to somewhere better. I was born here. I’m a mechanic. I like the predictable logic of it. A car comes in broken, I diagnose the problem, I apply the solution, and it leaves fixed. Cause and effect. Clean, simple, and honest. My life is built on that same principle. I have a routine. I like it. It keeps the chaos of the world at bay.At least, it used to.The chaos started about three months ago. It began quietly, without any fanfare. One night, they just… appeared. Six perfect, silent spheres of soft, white light, hovering high in the night sky above the desert flats. They didn’t move. They didn’t blink. They didn’t make a sound. They just hung there, a perfect, geometric arrangement against the brilliant, star-dusted canvas of the desert sky.The first night, everyone in town was out on their porches, just staring up, a collective, silent awe settling over us. It was beautiful, in a strange, unnerving way. The second night, they were back. Same place, same formation. And the third. And every single night since, without fail.After the first week, the novelty wore off for us locals. They became just another part of the landscape, like the mesas or the coyotes. But the outside world took notice. The internet started buzzing. First came the UFOlogists, with their fancy cameras and their intense, wild-eyed theories. Then came the tourists, the new-age crystal crowd, the Instagram influencers looking for a weird backdrop.Our quiet, forgotten little town was suddenly a destination. And it was a nightmare.These people were a plague. They’d block the roads with their RVs to get a better view. They’d wander onto private property. They’d come into my shop, not for repairs, but to ask me a million stupid questions. “Have you been abducted?” “Do you feel any strange energies?” “Can you point me to the best place to make contact?” It was a constant, infuriating disruption to my routine, to the clean, simple logic of my life.Then, about two weeks ago, one of them disappeared.He was a typical “seeker.” A guy in his thirties, drove a beat-up van covered in esoteric bumper stickers. He’d been in town for a month, spending every night out in the desert, trying to “communicate” with the lights. One morning, his van was found abandoned at the edge of the flats, his equipment still set up, but he was gone. No note, no sign of a struggle. He had just vanished.That’s when all hell broke loose. The county sheriff, the state police, news vans from the city—they all descended on us. The town was crawling with them. The search parties were a joke. Dozens of people who didn’t know the first thing about the desert, trampling over everything, yelling, shining their lights. The chaos was a constant, grinding noise that was shredding my last nerve. My business was suffering. I couldn’t work with the constant interruptions, the blocked roads, the general atmosphere of a three-ring circus.I decided I’d had enough. The police weren’t finding anything. The volunteers were useless. I’m a mechanic. I solve problems. And this circus was a problem. I figured, if I wanted it to end, I had to find a solution myself. I know this desert. I know its rhythms, its silences. I thought, maybe if I go out there alone, away from all the noise, I’ll see something they missed. A simple, rational explanation. Maybe the guy just got lost, fell into a ravine. Find the body, the circus leaves, and my life goes back to normal.So, last night, I closed up shop, filled a cooler with water, grabbed the most powerful flashlight I own, and headed out in my truck. The official search was focused on a ten-mile radius around the guy’s abandoned van. I went in the opposite direction, deeper into the flats, directly towards the lights.The desert at night is a different world. The silence is so absolute it feels like a pressure on your eardrums. I drove for an hour, the six lights my only guide, a silent, celestial chandelier hanging in the infinite darkness. They seemed to hum with a quiet energy, a feeling that vibrated right in my teeth.I was on an old, forgotten service road when I saw it. One of the six lights, the one on the far right of the formation, seemed to… detach. It didn’t fall like a meteor, burning a bright, fast streak across the sky. It descended. A slow, controlled, silent glide downwards, as if it were being gently lowered on an invisible string. It dropped below the horizon, disappearing behind a low, flat-topped mesa about a mile ahead.My heart started pounding. This was it. This was something. A deviation from the routine. I stomped on the gas, my truck kicking up a cloud of dust as I sped towards the mesa. This was the answer. A downed weather balloon, some experimental drone… a logical, physical object I could find and present to the world. A solution.I parked my truck at the base of the mesa and got out, the powerful beam of my flashlight cutting a sharp, white tunnel through the darkness. The air was cold, and the silence was deeper here, more expectant. I scrambled up the loose rock of the mesa. On the other side was a small, shallow basin. And in the center of it, shimmering in the moonlight, was a pond.That was weird. There are no natural ponds out here. I walked closer. The air grew thick with a foul, chemical stench. I realized what it was. An old, abandoned mine had used this basin as a drainage pond decades ago. It was a pit of stagnant, polluted water.I swept my flashlight beam across the area. There was no orb. No wreckage. No strange lights. Nothing. Just the filthy, still water and the smell of industrial waste. A bitter wave of disappointment washed over me. Had I imagined it? Was I so desperate for this to be over that my mind was playing tricks on me?I walked to the edge of the pond, my boots sinking slightly in the damp, contaminated soil. I shone my light onto the surface of the water, hoping to see something submerged. The water was a thick, black, oily soup. It was so murky, so polluted, that the surface was barely reflective. But I could just make out my own silhouette, a dark shape cast by the powerful flashlight in my hand.I stood there for a long moment, ready to give up, to go home. And then I noticed it.In the faint, distorted reflection on the water’s surface, my silhouette wasn't alone.There was another one, right next to mine. It was the shape of a man, and it was under the surface. And it was moving. It was thrashing, frantically, its limbs flailing in a silent, desperate panic. I watched, frozen in a state of pure, uncomprehending horror, as the silhouette beat its fists against the underside of the water’s surface. It was like watching a man trapped behind a one-way mirror, a pane of glass separating his world from mine. He was pounding on the wall between us, screaming for help that I couldn’t hear.My first thought was the missing man. Was it him? Trapped somehow? Was this some kind of bizarre projection? My mind, the mechanic’s mind, was scrambling for a logical explanation and coming up with nothing but static. The sheer, naked terror of the thrashing silhouette was paralyzing.I felt a morbid, terrible urge to get closer, to understand what I was seeing. I knelt down at the water’s edge, my flashlight beam still fixed on the two silhouettes. I leaned forward, my face just a few feet from the foul-smelling water. And as I did, my view of the reflection widened. I could now see the reflection of the night sky in the dark, oily water.I saw the stars. And I saw the lights.I counted them. One. Two. Three. Four. Five… Six.A jolt of pure, electric ice shot through my veins. I ripped my gaze from the reflection and looked up at the real sky. I counted again, my heart hammering against my ribs. One. Two. Three. Four. Five.There were only five lights in the sky.But there were six in the reflection.I don’t know what came over me. It wasn’t courage. It was a kind of horrified, fatalistic curiosity. I had to know if it was real. I had to know if the surface was solid. I reached out a trembling hand, my fingers extended, and I touched the water.The second my fingertips broke the surface, the world ended.A force. An immense, impossibly strong, impossibly cold something wrapped around my wrist from inside the reflection. It was a vise grip of pure, malevolent energy, and it pulled.I screamed, a raw, terrified sound that was swallowed by the vast desert silence. The pull was incredible. I was being dragged forward, off my knees, my face towards the filthy water. My mind flashed with an image of the thrashing silhouette, of being pulled through that dark, oily surface into whatever hellish, watery prison lay on the other side.Panic gave me a strength I didn’t know I had. I dug my heels into the dirt, threw my entire body weight backward, and roared with effort and terror. For a horrifying second, there was a terrible, stretching, tearing sensation in my arm, as if I was being pulled apart. And then, I was free. I flew backward, landing hard on the rocky ground, scrambling away from the water’s edge like a terrified crab.I lay there, gasping, clutching my wrist, which was numb and aching with a profound, bone-deep cold. And then the pond began to glow.A soft, white light emanated from beneath the surface, growing brighter and brighter, until the entire, filthy pond was a blazing, incandescent orb. The light was silent, but it felt loud, pressing in on me, scouring the landscape clean of all shadows. The surface of the water began to boil, but with a cold, silent energy.And then, a perfect, massive sphere of pure, white light erupted from the water. It rose into the air, as silent and graceful as it had descended. It climbed higher and higher, a new star in the night sky, until it took its place in the formation, back in the empty spot on the far right.They were six again.I didn’t wait. I scrambled back to my truck, my mind a blank slate of pure, animal fear. I drove, and I didn’t look back.I’m home now. I’m safe. But I’m not. The horror isn’t out there in the desert anymore. It’s here. It’s in my house. Because I understand now.They hide in reflections. Any reflection.I haven’t been able to look in a mirror. I spent all of yesterday with a towel covering my bathroom mirror. I can’t look at my own TV when it’s turned off. The dark, reflective screen feels like a deep, black pond, and I’m terrified of what I might see looking back at me from just beneath the surface. A puddle on the street, a shop window, the reflection in a pair of sunglasses… they’re all doorways. They’re all potential prisons.The man who disappeared… he’s not dead. He’s not lost. He’s taken. He’s in there, in that watery reflection, thrashing against the other side, and maybe one day, the thing that took him will get bored and let another one out.I live in a world without mirrors now. A world where I have to be careful of every shiny surface. I almost got pulled in. I almost became another silent, screaming silhouette trapped behind the glass. And I can still feel the cold in my wrist where it touched me, a constant, chilling reminder that the world I thought was so logical, so full of cause and effect, has a dark, predatory reflection, and it is always, always waiting for you to get too close.",

      "content_preview": "I found the diary in a box at a yard sale.The woman running the stall had a smile that looked stapled on, stiff at the edges, as if she hadn’t truly smiled in years. When I picked up the diary, she froze and stared at me. Then she whispered, almost breathless:“Two dollars.”It was worn, bound in leather, with a brass clasp that no longer locked. The pages smelled faintly of mold and smoke. And they weren’t empty. They were full.The handwriting was messy but steady, all scratched out in black ink. At first, I flipped through it casually. But then my stomach tightened.Because it wasn’t just anyone’s diary. It was mine.It had EVERYTHING. My scraped knees as a kid. My weird crushes in grade school. The time I stole a dollar from my mother’s purse and stuffed it into my sock.  Every thought I had kept private, every shame I never told a soul, written down.At first, I laughed nervously, convincing myself it had to be coincidence, some bizarre prank. But when I got home, something froze me to the core. The last page wasn’t about my past.It was about now.August 28, 10:47 p.m.- He sits at the kitchen table, staring at these words, pretending he isn’t afraid. He swallows hard. Checks the front door, though he already locked it. Twice. He doesn’t know if he’ll hear the scratching in exactly three minutes.The book slipped from my damp hands. I don’t know why I did it, curiosity, maybe, but I stayed there, watching the clock. Listening.At exactly 10:50, I heard it. A slow, deliberate scrape at the front door. I didn’t sleep that night.The next morning, I told myself I imagined it. But when I opened the diary again, my blood turned to ice.August 29, 8:02 a.m.- He tells himself it isn’t real. Tells himself he only imagined the sound. But if he listens carefully, he can still hear it, a faint scratching at the edge of his memory. He eats a piece of toast. He doesn’t notice the shadow in the hallway.I snapped my head toward the hallway. Empty. But the feeling lingered, something had been there, watching me.That night, I tried an experiment. I left the diary closed on my nightstand. When I woke up, it was open. A fresh entry filled the page. It described my dream. Word for word. The one where my dead father sat on the edge of my bed and whispered in a voice like broken glass: “You can’t shut it.”***The entries didn’t stop.They no longer waited for me to open the book. The diary wrote itself. Sometimes the ink was still wet when I touched it. And then… it went further.Not just recording. Not just reflecting. Predicting.August 31, 6:44 p.m.- He thinks he’ll order takeout tonight. He won’t. Instead, he’ll cut his finger while chopping vegetables. The blood will drip into the sink in slow, deliberate beats, and he will stare at it for a very long time, hypnotized.I laughed, grabbed a knife, and started slicing onions. Just to prove it wrong. The blade slipped. I watched a drop of blood swell at the tip of my finger—thick and red—before falling into the sink.On September 1, I couldn’t take it anymore. I decided to burn the damned thing.I carried it to the backyard, threw it into a metal trash can, and struck a match. But the second the flame touched the page, the words began to multiply. Ink bled across the paper like veins, racing faster and faster, filling line after line until the whole book trembled in my hands.The fire went out. Cold. And there was a new entry.September 1, 9:03 p.m.- He tries to burn it. He can’t. It writes faster when he’s afraid. It feeds on him. He doesn’t understand he will never destroy it. The more he resists, the stronger it becomes.I hurled it across the yard. It landed open on the grass, and the pages began to turn by themselves, as if invisible hands were rifling through them. The sound was like a hundred whispers all at once.I ran inside and locked the door. I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this.The diary doesn’t just predict anymore. It shows me things. Things that haven’t happened yet...but will.Last night, it wrote:September 2, 12:14 a.m.- He won’t hear the window slide open. He won’t see the pale hand pulling back the curtain. He won’t know she’s already in the room until it’s too late.I didn’t sleep. I sat in the corner of my room clutching a knife, staring at the window. Nothing happened.But this morning, when I opened the diary again, the entry had changed.September 2, 7:40 a.m.- He sat in the corner all night with a knife. Thought it was enough. He didn’t notice the footprints in the carpet leading to his bed.I looked. God help me, I looked. And they were there. Wet, pale footprints. Stopping inches from where I had been sitting.It’s writing now. Even as I hold it. The words are appearing while I write this to you. I can barely keep up. It’s describing me, writing, word for word, letter for letter as if it’s inside my head before my fingers even move.I don’t know if posting this will help. Maybe if someone else reads it, it will break the cycle. Maybe then I’ll finally be free.But the diary says otherwise.It says:September 2, 9:58 p.m.- He thinks posting this will save him. He thinks someone out there will help. But all he’s done is spread it. Every person who reads his words has already opened their own diary. They just haven’t found ityet.",

      "content_preview": "When I woke up, I found myself in a storeroom that I didn’t recognise. Stumbling through boxes I stepped outside. It was a long hallway of an old house.I headed to the main door, trying hard to remember how I got here. The whole thing felt like a dream, how my house was burning, how he chained me and dragged me out of my house and everything after that was a blank. If I got abducted then why was I roaming free?I opened the main door and took a step outside. As soon as my feet touched the ground it was like someone flipped the light switch and everything went dark. After a few moments, I was able to see again but something was not right. I was standing in the storeroom.Freaking out I ran straight to the main door trying to escape but to my horror as soon as I crossed the doorframe I stumbled into the storeroom, again. I could not believe what was happening to me. I felt like the whole reality was warping around me. I tried to escape from the backdoor of the kitchen, windows, toilet exhaust, air vents but always ended up in the storeroom.Not knowing what to do, I saw a phone hanging in the hallway. I immediately grabbed it and tried calling my husband. He answered but could not hear my voice. I tried to call my parents, friends, even the cops, but none of them were able to hear my voice. I thought the phone might be broken.Feeling helpless I went to the window. I looked outside and there were people walking. Feeling they could help me I just started screaming. Nobody reacted. I got frustrated and began banging on them. Few of them actually stopped after hearing bangs but did not proceed to do anything. It went on like that for hours and suddenly I heard the garage door opening. I ran to the main door and stood there hoping someone would come.The door opened with the creek. I saw a tall old man step inside with his wife trailing behind him. I felt so relieved. I leaped towards him and began crying for help, not able to formulate a coherent speech. But as you might have guessed, he did not react to anything.In anger I tried to jolt his arm and to my horror, my hand just passed through his arm. At first I could not believe it. I thought I might have just missed it and I tried to touch him again. I stretched my hand towards him and they went right inside his chest. I stood there shaken as he hung his coat, removed his shoes and walked right through me.I screamed. I screamed so hard my throat hurt and I just fell on the floor crying.After about a week I was wandering in the hallway, trying to rationalise whatever was happening to me. At that time, my best theory was that I had died and became a ghost and somehow I was tied to this place. Being a ghost was not that different. It’s just you cannot interact with certain things and the living beings, most of them, can’t see, hear or feel you. It also depends on the time of the day. Because if you try to move something in the daytime it is impossible to do it, but if you try this at night, based on the weight and size of that thing, you will be able to move it. But it will be more like you pushing the water. Your hand will still pass through it but there will be some resistance. That’s how I walked through thin walls and was able to bang things.I also got to know the family. The tall old man was the father, around sixty years old. His wife was also of the same age. They had five children, three sons and two daughters. Oldest and youngest sons lived with their parents while the rest of them left home to work outside. I don’t know what father and sons did to earn, but I occasionally saw the older son wearing an apron and a belt on top of it with a bunch of tools hanging. They also had a grandmother who always stayed in her room and rarely left it. They also had a dog. It was pretty annoying since it was the only one who could see me. Every time it saw me, it would start barking. If I moved somewhere else, it would follow me. The only thing I could do is to just go upstairs in the attic or in the basement where it could not enter. Apart from the dog I felt like grandmother could also sense me but on as much as the dog.I would have these intense emotional episodes. After failing so many times trying to escape and not understanding why and what had me tied up in here, I would get frustrated and crash out. I would wail for hours. I was experiencing panic shocks where I would suddenly feel intense dread. It was so strong that it would start radiating. I could see the family getting affected. They would also start feeling unease, sometimes they would clash out and fight among themselves. It was infectious. One time I screamed so hard the window started shaking and everyone stared at my direction like they heard something. That’s the closest I got to communicating with them.One mid-night, It was around 1 AM when I started feeling sharp pain in my stomach. I fell on my knees and clutched my belly. I got nauseous and began vomiting black liquid. Rather than spilling all over the floor, the liquid started moving and clumping together. It formed a pillar which stood tall well above my height and began taking the shape of something I recognised.It was that hooded figure. The one who had kidnapped me. I recognised those bulging eyes and velvet blue skin with sharp teeth hanging from its mouth partly covered by its red lips. It quickly covered its face and body under black cloak. My heart was pumping so hard I thought my chest would burst. The room also began heating up. I felt the same dread which I felt seeing him the first time. It stared at me with a blank face for a few moments and then left the kitchen.I could not move. I was too afraid, almost paralysed from fear. I could hear him going inside the master bedroom where parents slept. I could hear him speaking in a strange tongue. It went on for a while then I heard the bedroom door open. I quickly got up and ran into the storeroom and hid in the closet. I could hear his footsteps coming down and going in the kitchen. After a brief silence a deep growl came from the kitchen. I could feel he was not angry, but frustrated. He started running and I could hear his footsteps coming straight to the storeroom. He came inside and stood right in front of the closet. He knew I was in there.He flung open the closet and grabbed my mouth with both of his hands. It stretched it wide open and its body began melting into a fumes, flowing directly inside my mouth. I stood there until I completely swallowed it. I felt sick.I realised why he kidnapped and locked me in this house. I was just a door through which it entered the house and left, whenever it wanted.The next day the old man fell sick with high fever and they took him to the hospital. The next day his wife also got sick in a similar manner and got admitted to the hospital. After a few days, the old man died and on the same day the wife also passed away in the same manner.The family began preparing for the funeral. The old man did not have living family members outside their children and mother, same with his wife. Some neighbours and friends came to pay their respects. The three siblings living outstates came home. Losing both the parents on the same day was tragic for the children. Knowing that I played a part in it, even though unwillingly, was devastating. Visitors came to visit the family for a week and after that they stopped coming. The daughters left soon after completion of all proceedings. The middle-son stayed with his two brothers. All of them were taken back by what happened but nobody thought something paranormal was at play. I distanced myself from them, it was hard enough for them without me infecting them with more sadness.The scars were not healed yet and it happened again. This time I was in the attic, sitting at the window looking outside while the same sharp pain ran through my stomach and chest. I pressed my mouth by hand, trying not to vomit. I was not letting him out again. Pain grew more and more until it became unbearable. My chest and neck felt like they would burst if I did not let it go. I threw up. There he was, standing tall in front of me still taking shape. I was exhausted due to resisting too long. I tried to stop him by grabbing his cloak but could not hold it longer and my hand slipped. He descended into the hallway and headed towards the youngest son’s room. This time, I followed him.Stumbling on the hallway I reached the bedroom and I saw him. The figure was hovering above the son, mumbling in strange language.There has to be something that I can do, I thought to myself. Suddenly an idea struck me like lightning. I gathered all my strength and ran back to the living room. I couldn't find what I was looking for. I searched the kitchen, hallway, everywhere but met only disappointment. There was only one place left to search which I usually avoided to visit. It was grandma’s room. I went and slowly opened the door, and there it was, sleeping peacefully in the corner, the dog.I crouched and tried to wake it up. I put my hands inside its chest and tickled its insides. It woke up terrified and shaken. Seeing me it started barking and I ran towards the son’s room knowing very well that the dog would follow me.When it went inside the room and saw the hooded figure hovering, it started barking louder. My plan was to wake up the son before that filthy cloak finishes whatever he is doing. It worked and the son woke up.He opened his eyes and unlike me, he was able to see that cloaked figure. He froze out of shock. He tried to scream but his throat didn’t make any sound. He was paralysed with fear. The dog kept barking louder and it woke up other members in the family.But sadly before they could do anything the hooded figure had finished the ritual and it jumped right into my throat, trying to escape. He stretched my mouth beyond its capacity and broke my jaw. He tore my skin, and it started bleeding. After a hard struggle I swallowed it. I was so weak I fell on my knees and lied there.The son was traumatised. His body was boiling hot and shivering all the time. They gave him sedatives to calm his nerves but still he did not talk to anyone and kept quiet. Doctors kept him at home for some reason rather than going to hospital. Seeing him I could not help but wonder if I made things worse by waking him up. I knew he saw that figure and I wished before death took him, he could tell what happened to him to any family member.My wish was granted. The next day grandma would appear with some incense, red cloth and a tiny bag. She went inside the son’s room and began doing some cleansing rituals. I could not hold my happiness, finally someone was thinking in the right direction.Remember when I said I had a feeling that grandma could sense me. It was because whenever I was sitting or wandering in the room. She would stare in my direction. Even if she passes by me accidentally, she would come back and assess the whole area. It became so uncomfortable that I just avoided meeting her. After the old man’s death, she began doing remedies as per her old methods. It made my existence harder because whenever I went near her, I would have an aching feeling all over my body. It was like a thousand needles poked my skin.After getting done with all proceedings she sat beside him and began praying. After a while the boy’s shivering got slower and he slowly opened his eyes. His fever was still unaffected but he seemed more in control and at peace. He told everything that happened that night to the grandma. She was visibly shaken. She immediately went outside and told other family members, the remaining four siblings.The next day grandma created the shrine of some deity. It was placed in the middle of the living room. All members gathered and started offering their prayers to the deity. Though it was forbidden to worship if someone recently died in the house, they still went forward with the prayers. I can understand what they were going through. Those who left us, were not coming back, but those who are with us, we should protect them. The whole family prayed that day without a break.Even though it hurt, I also sat and prayed with them.(To be continued)This is Part-2 of an ongoing series. To read part-1,click here",

      "content_preview": "It was the sound of scratching that almost woke me up. My first thought was that it was snowing outside. But it was my half-asleep, stupid mind talking. It never snows in my town. Through my half-closed eyelids, I saw shapes shifting against the window. My vision was hazy, and I wasn’t sure what was out there. But I could see the green light flooding through the window of my room, dancing across the ceiling.I remember thinking:Someone is scratching against the window.But that didn’t make any sense either. It terrified me.They must be leaves, I thought.Dead leaves.I tried to move my arms and legs, but they seemed to have gained weight overnight. At that moment, they were at least ten times heavier.My eyelids were opening and closing of their own will. It felt like I had lost control of them. But still, the world wasn’t completely cut off from me. I remembered the wind had been rustling before, but now it washowling.This must be a dream,I thought.It has to be.For a moment, there was darkness, and the next, the room seemed to swim before me in slow motion. Still, I tried not to close my eyes, anyway.I tried to turn my head to the left to look at the digital clock on my desk. But my neck felt tight, like a cork in a bottle of wine. I tried to move my arms and legs again. They didn’t move an inch. My heart started pounding in my chest. It felt like even if I got back up, I was doomed to fall back into my bed.The back of my T-shirt was drenched in sweat, and beads of sweat were forming on my forehead. My attempt to turn my head to the left succeeded after what seemed like a really long time. I’m not sure if it was seconds, minutes, or hours, though, as the sense of time in sleep is skewed, just like near a black hole.That was when I saw the numbers of my digital clock racing through all the combinations of numbers, like a stopwatch. A lump was forming in my throat, and I remember reassuring myself:It’s just a dream. I will wake up soon. I will wake—The green light from the window started flashing on the wall above my desk. But that’s not what made me try to scream. It wasn’t the numbers on the clock racing, either. It was the sight of my digital clock rattling on my desk. Then I heard a loud, rumbling noise.I remember opening my mouth to scream, but all that came out was a weak groan. My heart was beating with an unusual slowness. I could feel the muscles around it tightening. The green light kept flashing on the wall, and my body seemed to sink deeper into the mattress. The terror of it all must have been the reason I drifted off to sleep.Or maybe I justpassed out.*   *   *When I woke up the next morning, it was still dark outside. I ran the palm of my hand over my forehead, expecting a fever or something. But my skin was as cold and dead as a corpse. When I touched my feet, a chill ran down my spine. They were damp. I must have been sweating profusely the night before. The dizziness was gone, but my shoulders ached a little.Then the images came flashing through my mind, in bits and pieces: the green light; my digital clock rattling on the desk as if an earthquake were shaking it; and the numbers racing like—I jerked my head to my left, looking for my digital clock. There it was, glowing at 5:30 AM in red against its black screen. Almost exactly where it had been last night. Well, I’m not sure. Maybe it had slid across the desk a little. Maybe I hallucinated it. Maybe I hallucinated all of it. At that moment, it felt like everything that had happened was born out of my imagination.I jumped out of bed, rushed to my desk, and yanked open the drawer. Lying on top of a mess of coins, pens, and crumpled slips was my mobile phone. I keep it there every night so that I don’t waste my time staying up late. I clicked the power button. The clock on my lock screen was ticking at 5:31 AM. I glanced at my digital clock and back at my mobile phone. Both were ticking at 5:31 AM.Well, maybe it was just a dream, I thought. Suddenly, the numbers on the clock vanished. I smacked it, hoping it would start working again. But it didn’t.Maybe it wasn’t a dream. Maybe what I saw was real.I swiped open the lock screen of my phone, and this warning popped up on the screen:Shutdown warningWarning! Battery temperaturetoo low, your device will be shutdown.As far as I can remember, I had never seen a warning about battery temperature on my phone before. The battery icon in the top right corner of the screen was no longer green. It was red. My phone’s battery was 2%. But here’s the thing. I have a habit of fully charging my phone before going to bed. When I used it last night, it was 95%.I searched for my phone charger and found it. When I was about to plug it in, the screen went blank. The battery was dead. I tossed my phone on the bed in frustration. I turned the switches on in my room. The ends of the tube light shimmered for a few seconds. It made a popping sound, and then it was dead, too.I looked at the window of my bedroom. There was no green light that I could see. I didn’t hear any scratching noises. Droplets of water were streaming down the windowpanes. I reached under the bed, grabbed my torch, and lurched toward the window. I swung it open and shone the light outside. It was drizzling, and one word described perfectly what I saw: chaos.A branch of the oak tree across from my house was dangling; the dense undergrowth in front of my house, across the road, was beaten down; the shingles of the roof of my house lay on the ground. I looked to my right and saw that the roof of my pickup truck's shed was gone. It lay a few meters left of my house, covered in litter.It’s real. I was not hallucinating.I left the bedroom with my torch and hurried downstairs.*   *   *I was squinting, still in a daze, trying to come back to my senses. The hallway was quiet, except for the sound of raindrops pattering outside. But that wasn’t all. There was a thumping, which seemed to emanate from deep within my house. I couldn’t hear it, but I couldfeelit, you know? I could feel it in my chest. I could feel it in my feet, too. I walked toward the door, and the oak floor creaked beneath my feet. I took my raincoat from the hanger and put it on.When I was on the porch, a gentle breeze was blowing, slanting down the course of the rain. The sweet smell of grass was in the air. There was another smell, too. A familiar one.Where did I smell that before?I thought. The wind blew stronger this time, filling my nostrils with an unmistakable stink.Petrol, I thought.Diesel, maybe. But it's still different, though.I stepped off the porch and onto the wet soil. The torch started flickering too, so I smacked it and it began working again. I began scanning the ground with my torch. Then I saw something. It was a blue liquid. When the light hit it, it glittered like something I’d never seen before. I let out a deep sigh and didn’t like the sound of it. I could feel the veins on my forehead pulsing.I kept walking, and I saw patches of it all over my path. The only sounds were my footsteps and the rain drumming inside my ears. I felt an urge to look over my shoulder, but I didn’t.I’ll only scare myself more, I thought. I quickened my pace, following the trail. I felt the ground beneath me ripple a little in perfect beats. The trail of the liquid finally led me to the back of my house, where the door to the basement was.As I got closer to the basement door, I could feel the ripples intensify. I figured it must be the same thumping I’d felt earlier in the hallway. I had kept the basement door locked up all these years, but now I could see it was open. The lock was on the ground, broken.Someone is inside, I thought.Who could have done this? A burglar?I pointed the torch at the stairs leading down to the basement. The blue liquid was on them.My instinct told me to go back to bed and sleep tight, but my curiosity was stronger. I started to descend the steps one at a time, clearing the cobwebs with my hand. I was careful not to step on the liquid.When I was on the basement floor, I saw faint ripples of blue light coming toward me in widening circles. It wasn’t just light. It had a strange, solid quality to it. A baseball bat was leaning on the wall to my left at the end of the stairs. I grabbed it, my fingers tightening around the grip. I tried the switches, but the lights didn’t work here either.I began walking toward the source of the ripples thumping beneath my feet. There was a lot of stuff down here in the basement, mostly cardboard boxes and old furniture. A musty smell mixed with a faint, oily scent hung in the air. Taking cover behind the boxes, I walked a little further. That was when I heard a metallic noise.I peered over the cardboard box and saw a device that was similar to a tripod. It was the length of my palm. Its legs looked like those of a spider, ending in sharp points. At its center, it held a small cylinder that was sliding up and down. It emitted a blue light from a sapphire-like stone. Dust puffed into the air as it slid up and down, emitting ripples of deep blue.My eyes bulged in their sockets as I stared in horror.Someone is here!I gulped, and my throat made a clicking sound. There was a coppery taste in my mouth. I peered a little more, and I saw the thing next to the device.The cardboard box I was peeking over fell, and I gasped. I raised my baseball bat at the thing, clenching my fingers tightly around the grip, and yelled, “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?” I shuddered in disbelief.It suddenly clasped its right arm with its left hand and pressed something with its index finger. The deep blue ripples shifted to a faint green. I dropped my baseball bat and stood there frozen, like a moth caught in a spider web.My body, which was in a fight-or-flight mode just moments ago, began to relax. My racing heart calmed down. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, then let out a sigh. When I opened my eyes and looked at the device, I knew it was the green ripples that had done this to me.And there it was, right before my eyes, leaning against the wall.It had a round, helmet-like head with a black visor. It had arms, legs, and a torso, just like a human. It was made of metal and had a white paint job, by the look of it. The white paint was scraped in many places as if it had been in use for a long time.“I am E7-Delta from the planet TRON-12b,” it said in a weak, robotic voice. “There’s no need to worry. I won’t harm you.”“I—I don’t believe this is happening,” I said. “So, you’re an alien? An alien robot?”“You call us robots?”Faint white lines scrolled across its black visor. Beep. Beep. Beep. The lines vanished.“Such a machine built to resemble a human being or animal in appearance and behavior,” it said. “Merriam-Webster.” It turned its head away from me and looked to its right as if it were thinking. Then it looked at me again. “No, you are mistaken. We have a life of our own.”I felt a strong urge to raise my torch and peer into the deep blackness of its visor. I pointed my torch at it, expecting it would turn out to be nothing but a con artist trying to fool around with me. The light couldn't pass through it. It didn’t flinch like normal humans do when a bright light hits their eyes. There were no eyes behind it. I couldn’t see any face either.I glanced at the device next to it for a few moments and understood that it was beyond the capacity of humans to make. I looked at the blue liquid leaking from its back onto the wall, then back at it. Not taking my eyes off of it, I placed the torch upright on the concrete floor. The whole basement lit up in a faint glow.By then, any suspicions I had that it was human were gone.“How can you speak my language?” I asked, bewildered.“My life support accessed the databases on your planet and fed me over 7,000 languages,” it said, pointing at the device. The ripples were more intense here compared to what I had experienced in front of the basement door before. Every time it spoke, white lines scrolled across its visor. I guessed they were letters.“How did you get here? Andwhyare you here?”There was a bitter taste in my mouth.“On a spaceship. I was abandoned here. There’s not much I can do here. I’m... terminating,” it said in a fragile voice. “Your heart rate is rising again. But it will stabilize soon. There’s nothing to fear.”I understood that it was talking about death. One look at it, and you could tell it was at its end. But wouldn’t analyzing my heart rate without permission only scare me more?Suddenly, it slumped against the wall and sat back on its haunches, making a low-frequency hum. I dropped to my knees and watched it closely.“Are you okay?” I asked, a little concerned. “What's happening?”“My life force energy is leaking out,” it said. “I can't do anything now.”I figured the liquid must be its fuel. The oily stink was overpowering. I couldn't help but feel sorry for it. “Can I do anything to stop this from happening?” I asked.“No. You can't. My time has come.”No one can stop death when it comes, I thought.Even stars die when it's time.“Who abandoned you?” I asked.“The overlords of TRON-12b,” it said. “I’m a worker on my planet, by your definition. Mining industry. But they call us ‘Diggers.’ The overlords are on a hunt for other planets with rare elements. I was on their spaceship, serving food to one of them. He didn’t like it. So, he kicked me out.”I saw a dent in its chest metal plate.Only metal can dent metal, I thought. By the look of the dent, I tried to imagine how massive the foot of its overlord must be. My mouth went dry.“The green light,” I said, looking at it. “I thought I was dreaming or something. I thought maybe it was a storm that did it,” I said, pointing toward the mess in front of my house. I still couldn’t believe all of this was happening. I couldn’t believe it at all.“I’m sorry about that.”“Never mind. It wasn’t your fault,” I said matter-of-factly.“I'm sorry about what happened to you.”It nodded. I’m not sure if it got that from the database or not. The nod seemed genuinely human.“I tried to use my life support to draw in life force from nearby energy sources if I could detect any,” it said. The energy here is just not enough to revive me.”I remembered the dead battery of my phone and the tube light in my room.Electric charge driving life?It must have consumed all of it. I wondered if my phone was alive, too.“When were you made?” I asked, assuming it wasn’tborn. At least to my eyes, it didn’t look like the work of nature.“Cycle 5, phase 4,” it said. “In other words, twelve Earth years.”Whatever it was—sitting in front of me—it was thirteen years younger than me. A twelve-year-old in the mining industry?Suddenly, the hydraulic pump-like tubes from its back, connecting to its neck, started hissing. I jerked, got on my feet, and took a few steps back. It pressed a small button on its thigh. The hissing subsided significantly, but it didn’t stop.“I’ve got nine minutes till termination. You can ask me anything if you like,” it said. “I’m just glad I’m with a fellow being in my last moments.”Fellow being, it said. Notalienor something else.I was hesitant to walk forward because of the hissing. It noticed and said, “It’s safe.”I stepped back to where I had been before.“Aren’t you scared of death?” I asked. “Aren’t you scared of what comes after?”“Death? What’s that?”Beep. Beep. Beep. The lines scrolled and disappeared.“Oh, I get it now,” it said. “No, I am not scared of it. Because I know there’s no such thing as death. My Spark will be transferred to another living being in this universe when they are born or created in another world. I’ll forget what I did in this life for a long time. But I’ll remember—again.”“Spark?”My eyes widened as I heard it. I realized it was talking about what we humans call “Soul.” I had read about the afterlife many times before, but I never truly believed in it.“What about the others?” I asked. “Beings like you?”“The same thing happens to them,” it said.I was trying to process what it had told me. My jaw dropped as something clicked in my mind. “Are you telling me that you can talk to people from your previous world again?”I asked.“Is that possible?”My mouth was shivering a little.“Yes. But my Spark has passed through 316247 lives. I’ve got exactly 3794964 friends. Acquaintances included. It would be 3794965, including you,” it said. “Most of them have forgotten me, I guess. They don’t talk to me anymore.”My stomach turned up as I heard it. 316247 lives. 316247 worlds. Unbelievable. I had gotten the answer to one of the biggest mysteries of the universe.“Hurry up, time’s running out,” it said.I didn’t have to think a lot to ask the most important question any human being on the planet would ask an alien if it were friendly. “Is there any threat to Earth from your planet?”“As of now, no. But I’m not certain. You must never disclose what happened here. If the people of Earth find out about me, it could be dangerous for Earth.”I nodded.The blue liquid was pooling around my feet. E7-Deltatried to move its legs, but it settled back into the same position as if it were in pain.“Two minutes to go,” it said. “Any more questions?”“Can I do anything for you in exchange for revealing one of the biggest mysteries of the universe to me?” I chuckled, but there was a dull pain in my throat. It felt stupid to ask if I could do something for a being from a civilization far more advanced than Earth.“Just don’t forget me,” it said. “Like the others.”I was holding back tears. “I won’t,” I replied.It looked at me and uncurled its fingers. I understood immediately and clasped its hand in mine. The cold touch of its metal fingers sent a chill down my spine.“Ninety seconds to go,” it said. “I’ve got nothing much to say. But if death smiles at you, don’t be afraid of it. Smile back. It’s peaceful. I know, because you and I are not so different, after all.”I nodded, my eyes welling up with tears.Its metallic chest let out a deep whirring sound, and fumes began to rise from it. I knew that this was it. It was dying.“Get away from me. Now!” E7-Delta shouted.I turned away from it and lurched toward a big table. Taking cover behind it, I peeked over it. Its metallic hands and legs were trembling, and it raised its hand into the air as if to say it was okay. I raised my hand back at it, too. That was our final goodbye.BOOM!I shielded myself with my hands. The blast was so loud that my ears began to ring. I felt the heat coming off in waves. A few seconds later, the ringing stopped.When I looked back again, the white fumes had turned black. I could see the smoke charring the ceiling. A deep humming sound came from it, and the white lines on its black visor flickered, then vanished. Its head lolled to the right and finally came to rest against the wall.The green light of the device—its life support—glimmered, then winked out like a dying star. The spider-like legs curled inward, the cylinder holding the sapphire-like stone slid back, and the whole thing turned into a compact cylinder. Then it rolled towards me.I picked it up and marveled at it. It was a deep silver. I slipped it into my pocket. The fumes had stopped, and it looked like it was all over.What should I do now?I thought. Metal plates lay scattered all over the basement floor, revealing a mesh of black wires in his chest. It seemed so fragile in that position, lying there in my basement. It was a shame it had to meet its end like this. Here, in another world. But I guess I was by its side.I looked at the dent in his chest again.Who could do that to a twelve-year-old?I thought maybe age didn’t matter in their world.Would I bury an abandoned twelve-year-old kid who had no one in the world, and died like this in my basement? I guess I would. So, I did.*   *   *I covered it with a tarp I had found in the basement. I carried it in my arms and started climbing the stairs. It was unbelievably light. I have no idea what element or metal it was made of. I saw the faint blue glow of the morning sky as I reached the basement door. The rain had stopped. Everything was quiet except for the soft twittering of birds.I placed it on the cargo bed of my pickup truck. Then I grabbed a shovel from the basement, set it beside E7-Delta, and drove to the woods.I walked into the pines. Sunlight passed through the dust motes, forming golden beams. Crickets chirped steadily in the background. I chose a spot where no one would ever find it. I dug about six feet into the soil, laid it to rest, and shoveled the soil back.“Goodbye, fellow being,” I said in the quiet wilderness of the woods.I lit a cigarette and started driving back home. The sun was low in the sky, glowing yellow, and the grass along the road swayed gently in the wind. I thought about all that had happened as I cruised down the road. Lines from a poem by Dylan Thomas came to my mind.I was thinking about many other things too. Oh, yes. I had a lot to think about.*   *   *It’s been twenty-five years since that incident. The life support device I kept with me began glowing again four years after I buried it. But I didn’t know what it meant. So, I stayed silent.In the meantime, I started teaching physics at the local college in town. I have two kids, a boy and a girl. Most of my students are around twenty-one years old.Today, as the bell rang, the students began to leave the classroom. Only one of them stayed behind. He had that dead look about his blue eyes.He raised his hand as if he had a question. “Sir, can I ask you something?”“Yes?” I said.He walked up to me and held out his hand.“E7-Delta. Does that ring a bell?” he said, smiling almost puppet-like.",

      "content_preview": "I’m not sure what woke me up. Maybe it was the sun beating down on me, or some spider crawling across my cheek – spindly legs jittering, touch both unwelcome and unwanted. I opened my eyes, blinking into late morning. The steps swam in my vision – our steps, the same ones June Howard posed on for her photo.Our front porch.I’d slept through the night out there.I didn’t remember leaving the driveway, but I must have. Somehow being closer to the house felt wrong, like I’d been dragged there in my sleep, pulled against my will toward the dark. Left there by some unseen hand.I remembered staring at the street last night, watching headlights come and go. Hoping each pair belonged to Jess and Win. Hoping and hoping… then nothing. And now this: waking up on the porch like something had picked me up and set me down again, forgotten.I rubbed my hand over my face. Prickling pain. Sunburn. My back ached from sleeping against the door. Dirt streaked my jeans from the dusty stone.I’d been dreaming. I couldn’t hold onto the shape of it, only the feeling—like I’d forgotten how to breathe. Everything was dark, too dark, and my lips wouldn’t part. They weren’t made to. In the dream I wanted to scream, to call out for Jess, for Win, for anyone. But I knew that to scream I’d have to split myself open, tear my mouth apart. And I knew something worse, too: even if I did, even if I ripped myself wide, there’d be nothing inside me to come out. Just silence. Just empty.I was still caught half-way in the dream when I heard it: tires crunching gravel, a car door shutting. A voice, low but unmistakable.Jess.I craned over the hedge. Our car was in the drive. Jess bent into the backseat, reaching for Win. My heart jolted hard. My legs were stiff, my back screaming, but I forced myself upright – fast, like I’d been caught doing something wrong.The porch light buzzed overhead, whispering. My mouth was dry and tacky. My pulse skittered as I lunged for the front door, fumbling the handle, nearly tripping over my own shoes. I stumbled halfway inside, caught myself on the knob, praying she wouldn’t think I was drunk—passed out like some stray dog left outside overnight.But I was too late. They were already making their way up the walkway to the front door, and I was there, caught out in the open. On stage, a soiled puppet of the night before.“Jess,” I croaked. My throat was raw, baked by the sun.She looked up, catching a glimpse of me. She froze, startled, seeing me there on the porch. And only then did I realize what I must have looked like through her eyes – sunburnt, clothes rumpled, hair matted with sweat, filth from the porch clinging to me.Her arms tightened around Win. She went rigid.“Robert,” she said, steady but clipped. “I wasn’t expecting you to be out here.”“I –” my voice cracked. “I waited for you. I stayed out here all night, watching for you to come back. I thought…”Win stirred against her shoulder. Jess kissed her temple, turning so Win couldn’t crane her head to look at me. Then she met my eyes again. She wasn’t angry – not the way I thought she’d be. Her gaze was measured, arms protective, locked around our daughter.“Don’t wake her,” she whispered.I stepped down one stair. My legs shook beneath me. “Please. Just come inside. Both of you. Come home.” I reached my arms out, my hands shaking, beckoning to them both.Jess shook her head, gently at first. “No. Not right now. Not like this.”Her eyes flicked over me, really taking me in. And I saw the decision before she said a word – saw it in the way she held Win, in her refusal to take one step closer to the house, to me.“I’m not bringing her inside. Not right now. I want you to go back in, Rob.”The words knocked the air out of me.“Jess –”“Go back inside. Sit on the couch. Get yourself something to eat, something to drink.”“Please, Jess, just –“She talked over me, pulling Win closer to her. “I’m going to come back, okay? I’m taking Win to my mom’s, again,” she sighed, “and then I’ll come back here. By myself.”“But—”“I can’t have her here. Not when you’re like this, okay? Do you understand?”It felt like a hand was closing around my chest. I looked around, wandering for a brief self-conscious second if any of our neighbors were seeing this. I lowered my voice. “You don’t feel safe with me? Jess, it’s me. I’ve just been here. I’ve been waiting.”Her jaw trembled, but her voice stayed steady. “Rob, I don’t feel safe for her. I don’t want her to see you like this. We can’t…”She broke off as Win stirred in her arms. Jess hugged her tighter, shushing, rocking. Then she looked back at me, imploring, eyes wide and glassy.“Please, Rob,” she said. “Just go back inside. You can call me. Text me. I’ll let you know when I’m on my way back. I’ll go as fast as I can. I just… we have to.”I nodded. Despite it all, I understood. I hated that I did. I hated that this was where we were.“Okay,” I said. Hoarse. “Okay.”Jess turned. The car door opened and shut. The engine caught. Gravel shifted.And just like that, she was gone, down the road. Again.I stood barefoot on the porch, my hand pressed to the wood of the door behind me, holding myself upright. The dream had left me, and the bare reality – in the glare of the sun, in the silence – shook me harder than anything in the house could.Behind me, the house waited. I was aware of the door looming closed – the threshold of my nightmare. For a moment I thought I’d wait out there again, I’d wait for them outside where nothing could fuck with my head – no seam, no toybox, no toys. Just me and the day; I’d watch it shift around me, I’d watch the sun rise and set and fall and then soon after Jess would be home with me again and we could just…But I knew standing out here would just make me look worse. I wanted to be right, I wanted to be okay enough for my family to let me in again. So, despite what I knew lurked in the house?I went back in.**I didn’t know what to do with myself once the door shut.The house felt larger without my girls, and emptier – but not the quiet kind of empty, not the calm that settles when peace is rich. The walls leaned close. The air thickened, pressing in on me, waiting for me to move. I couldn’t sit. I couldn’t stay in one room.So I walked. From the living room to the kitchen, to the hallway, to the stairs. Each pass the same, each corner slower, as though the house was keeping time with me. My eyes snagged on every dark patch where the light didn’t quite reach. My body was exhausted, but my mind was rabid. Every shadow felt like it had been placed there on purpose, leaning toward me. I snapped my gaze over them in turns, one after another, in circles over and over.I could almost feel the seam upstairs just as I could picture it. I couldn’t get it out of my head, and it pulsed in my memory and at the front of my thoughts like a second, secret heartbeat. The toybox, too. I told myself I wouldn’t go up there, that I’d just…wait, but the pull was constant. I felt like I could hear it: the sound of it – wood flexing, groaning like a beam under too much weight – threaded faintly through the silence. A voice that wasn’t a voice.I thought of Milkshake. The lump doll. The basket in the garage where I’d locked them away. The thought came sudden and hot:I should burn them. Should’ve done it already. Before it was too late.I stumbled through the kitchen, out the back door, to the garage. I yanked the chain to flick the light on. The laundry basket sat in the half-gloom against the wall where I’d left it.Empty.I felt the room shrink around me with the sudden shock. I dropped to my knees, pawing through the corner like they might have just spilled out. Nothing. Just a smear of dust.But then again, was it all that shocking? Was it all so strange that the toys wouldn’t be there?I staggered back into the house. My pulse roared in my ears. They had to be here. I had put them here. I had put them here. I had to have, I had to have, I had to have.I started searching. Room to room. Closet by closet.The coat closet first, tossing aside old boots, the vacuum. Letting the picture we found of the two girls – Candace and Marie – fall to the floor between piles of unhooked coats. I searched under the couch, shoving my head into the shadows until my throat caught from the dust. I tore through Win’s dresser drawers. I got down on my hands and knees, pressing my cheek to the carpet to look beneath her bed.More than once, I thought I saw something – a bit of thread trailing under the doorframe. A gleam like a button eye. A corner of fabric just beyond reach. I lunged after them, but when I pulled the door wide or flicked the light on, there was nothing.The house was playing with me. It was hiding them. It had to be.I looked in the same places again, feeling more and more like I was going to catch one. Like I was going to find they were shuffling hiding spaces – a silent, miniature game of musical chairs. The closets, our bedroom, Win’s room, under the couches and then…again. The closets, our bedroom, Win’s room, under the couches. The nook. The nook. The nook.I was panting by the time I pulled down the attic stairs, sweat slicking my back. I dug through every box I’d shoved up there –candles, winter coats, old holiday decorations. I ripped them open one by one, hurling their contents onto the insulation. The mess grew around me until the attic looked like a rat’s nest, a trash heap for scattered memories.Ignoring the seam. Ignoring the Lonely Way the whole time. Not looking, no, not looking. No matter how it whispered I did not look.Still nothing.I wandered back downstairs, to the living room, not sure what to do with myself. I sat back on my heels in the center of the floor, my chest heaving, the dust burning my lungs. The silence pressed in, heavy. I realized what I must look like – crawling through the wreckage of my own house, tearing it apart for ghosts.I whispered to the dark, hoarse:“Where are you.”No answer. Just the groan of the house, deep and low, like it was biting back laughter.I pressed my palms into my eyes, hard enough to make sparks bloom in the dark. When I opened them again, I was staring across the living room floor – and there it was.The doll.The one with the blue eyes. The one I had tossed away, that I couldn’t find when I had gathered up Milkshake and the lumpy girl. It was here now, almost exactly where I’d thought I’d left it after wrenching it from Win’s arms that night. Half-hidden under the feet of the couch, half-exposed, its button eyes catching the faintest glimmer of light from my phone as I switched on its light. Watching me. Waiting.I crawled toward it, my breath shaking, the weight of dust settling into my lungs. I reached out and pulled her free. Heavier than it should’ve been. Cold as always. The blue eyes stared flat into mine, tiny sapphires stitched into felt. I thought I saw myself reflected there, bent and warped.A tremor ran through me.I knew what I had to do.I carried it through the kitchen, out the back door. My hands gripped it tight, so tight the tips of my fingers began to ache pushing into that strange rugged thread. Behind the shed, I piled sticks, newspaper scraps, anything dry enough to catch. I found the pack of water-proof matches on a shelf in the shed and took them to the pile of catch, striking until one flared.The flame caught, spread, licked up the wood. I held the doll over it. For a moment I froze -- I thought I felt its little limbs flex against my hands, a strange warmth that was alien to the toy seep into its body even as I held it away from the fire. Then I dropped it.The flames took quickly – cloth darkening, curling, collapsing inward. I stared down, transfixed, my face burning in the heat as I stood above the makeshift pyre.At first, there was nothing but the crackle of fabric. But then there was a hiss. A high whistling, like water boiling off wood. I almost laughed at the sound, told myself it was just steam, just damp heating.But then it climbed. Sharpened. A shrill note, piercing the air, rising past what was natural. The whistle broke open into something jagged, something too close to a cry. A memory came back to me, sudden and sharp: driving my first car home on a country road, never seeing the rabbit that jumped out of the brush until my tire crushed the back of it into the pavement, crushing its legs. The sound it had made…it was too close to this, too much like hurt, like horrible, overwhelming pain.My stomach dropped. I stumbled back, hands to my ears. My pulse throbbed in my teeth. The sound didn’t stop – it keened and shrieked, a high, awful wail folded into the burning.“No way,” I muttered, staggering, “no no way. It’s nothing. It’s just wet.”The sound went on until the last scrap blackened, until there was nothing left but a brittle mound of ash. The air stank of scorched fabric, acrid and sweet, like sugar gone bad. Heady mildew and smoke.I stared into the embers until they went dark. My throat worked, but no sound came out. My hands were shaking, raw from where I’d gripped the doll.It was gone. And the quiet after the screaming of the thing was worse.I went back inside with the stink of smoke in my hair and the taste of ash in my mouth. For a second, I told myself I’d done it – I’d fought back, I’d taken one from the house, from whatever it was. I’d protected us. But the feeling never settled. It curdled. My chest felt scraped hollow, my stomach turning like I’d swallowed the ash myself. Each step deeper into the house was heavier, sicker, until I couldn’t tell if I’d won something or…Or what? It was just a toy. It had just been a toy.I drifted up the stairs on heavy legs, the house pressing in closer with every step, whispering from its seams. At the top, I lingered in the hall, staring at the half-open door to our bedroom. The bed inside looked too big without Jess, without Win curled in the middle like an anchor. I went in anyway, because I couldn’t bear the emptiness of the hall. The room still smelled like her: lotion, her coconut shampoo, the perfume I’d bought her on our honeymoon in Madrid – the same bottle I got her every year again for Christmas. I missed her so much I could feel it in my ribs, a constricting ache. I lay down on my side of the bed, pressed my face into the hollow of her pillow, and let the weight of it all drown me – the doll’s smoke still in my throat, the toybox humming low in my bones, the sucking absence of my loves. My eyes slid shut before I could reckon with any of it, and the house moved in around me as I began to go away.**I was in the upstairs hallway, drifting towards Win’s room. The wood bent under my weight, not creaking but bowing – pliant, like flesh. I wasn’t walking so much as being carried. Pulled.Then – no door, no turn of the knob – I was inside.It was Win’s room, only in appearance. The air pressed down, heavy, the furniture fixed in place like bones set in mortar. The stillness was absolute. Even the dust hung motionless, waiting. My breath caught in my throat. I tried breathing again, but my lips barely parted. It felt like they’d been sewn shut in my sleep.At in the back, the nook gaped wider than it should have. The toybox leaned against the wall, lid hinging so far back it seemed it might snap. Its mouth was open wide, waiting.Inviting.I wanted to turn and flee. Wanted to run down the stairs, out the front door, and down the road, screaming until my voice shredded my throat raw. But the thought of opening my mouth, of splitting my lips to let the scream out, brought another thought with it: that nothing would come. No sound. Just emptiness.I stepped closer. My shins pressed to the rim. The dark inside wasn’t shadow – it had weight, a palpable viscosity, a surface tension that almost reflected me. Almost. The longer I looked the more I swore I saw myself in there, but reduced. A face pale and smooth where features should be.My leg lifted. And, without really willing it, I stepped in.The surface yielded around my thigh, colder than water, softer than cloth.Another step, the dark sucked at my waist.Another, and I was up to my chest.I held my breath, terrified of what would happen if I opened it. Like diving into the deep end. Like my lungs might never rise again.It’s for you.The voice was everywhere. Echoing, close enough I felt it inside my chest, vibrating against the ribs.I blinked.Win’s room and the toybox were gone. Instead, I stood in a hallway.The walls were made of warped planks, the same unfinished wood from the back of Win’s closet, but stretched too long, grain pulled taut like skin. Names had been scratched into them – June, Candace, Marie – but the letters were split apart, warped, the letters crusted with something dark and wet, like the names were healing, like they were scars scratched open too many times. Doors lined the passage, discolored, splintered. Each lined with puckering seams.The hallway stretched ahead forever, lit not by any lamp but by a sickly glow leaking from the wood itself – pale and faint, an uncanny illumination. At the farthest point, the shadows thickened until they became solid.Waiting.The farther I walked, the less it felt like walking. My legs moved, but I couldn’t feel my feet striking the floor. The boards rose to meet me, flexing under my steps, giving like a mattress, or muscle. The wood groaned low and wet, the sound of tendons stretching.The first door was warped, its bottom edge sunken into the floor as if the hall had swallowed part of it. I reached for the knob without thinking. My hand hovered an inch away before the mottled brass pulsed – warm. A shiver ran up my wrist. I jerked back. The metal had left a print on my palm. A circle like a brand.I kept going.The walls leaned closer the deeper I went, bowing inwards until the corridor was no wider than my shoulders. I felt the walls brush me as I passed – the wood breathed. In. Out. The air filled with the smell of wet cloth left too long in a basement.Something flickered at the edge of my vision. A toy, maybe – a doll – hung crooked on a nail in the wall. Its face was sealed over with black stitching, thick knots pulling the fabric shut where eyes and mouth should have been. I stopped, staring. The thread shivered once, a subtle tug, as though something on the other side had plucked it.Then it jerked. Hard. The half-formed doll snapped upward, vanishing into the dark above. The motion was too fast, too clean – like a suture being reeled through flesh. I craned back, heart hammering, but there was no ceiling for it to hit. Only a vast, rippling dark that swam like water overhead.I forced myself to keep walking.My hand scraped the wall to steady myself. When I pulled it away, there were splinters in my skin. But not wood. Thin black filaments. Thread. They wriggled, trying to knot themselves deeper. I shook my hands, trying to beat them off. They fell away without a sound.Another door. This one rattled on its hinges as I passed, shivering like something inside was clawing to get out. A faint sound leaked through – a whimper, thin and muffled, like a child crying into a pillow just inches from your ear. I froze, breath locked in my throat. But the moment I pressed my ear to the wood, the sound was gone.The hall narrowed further. My chest scraped the boards on one side, my spine pressed to the other. I felt the grain biting through my shirt, scratching against my skin. Thin needling splinters.The glow grew dimmer. The air colder. The silence heavier.And still ahead, the dark. Not absence but presence. A fullness.Something waiting.The walls closed until I was nearly crawling, scraping my shoulders raw against their seams. Each inch forward cost me a little more breath, the air thinner now, harder to draw in. The glow faded until there was only a pallid shimmer leaking from the cracks between the boards.Then the hall ended.Not with a wall. Not with a door. With an opening.It wasn’t shaped right. It wasn’t square or round or anything that belonged in a house. It was an absence in the wood, a tear in the fabric of the hall itself. The edges were frayed and splintered, and as I drew closer they pulsed with that same faint pale light. Like the glow was seeping out.I couldn’t see inside at first. It wasn’t black – it was something else, a color my eyes couldn’t name. My throat went dry. The longer I stared, the more the opening seemed to lean forward. Like it was hungry.Something brushed my ankle. A thread, slack and soft. I looked down and saw them spilling from the threshold – dozens, hundreds of black threads, pulsing across the floor like veins. They moved without sound, without purpose, except to creep closer. One looped around my shoe, loose but deliberate. Another brushed my wrist. I slapped at it, heart racing, but when I tried to pull free the threads clung tighter, flexing like worming muscle.From inside the tear, something shifted. The glow swelled.I saw arms or legs – I couldn’t be certain – or maybe just lengths of cloth, great crimson curtains shimmering wet in the sickening light. I saw glistening buttons purple like wounds gone to rot. I saw seams splitting open, mouths yawning wider and wider, tearing and gnashing and screaming, gushing forth filthy thread slick and black and festered with filth.It was not one being. It was thousands. A mass of mouths and limbs, shrieking and weeping, collapsing into one another and then splitting apart again. A pit of bodies falling forever into a sheaf of brightness too foul to be holy, too searing to be earthly. They screamed, but the screams blended until they became something else – a fabric, woven out of agony.And it knew me. It knew I was there.The threads at my wrists tightened, tugged. My breath hitched. I tried to scream, but my lips were sealed, stitched from within.The light surged. The shapes writhed closer, folding and unfolding, maddening and shuddering and rippling. I understood then, dimly, in the vanishing part of me that could still think: if I leaned into that opening, if I let myself be pulled in, I would become part of it. A voice among the thousands. A seam. A button. A mouth.But my mind revolted. I pushed the terror onto the wrong shape, shoved it into the face of my daughter. The words in my skull spun like a desperate litany: It’s for her. It’s for Win. It’s coming for Win.The threads jerked. My chest seized. The glow grew until it felt like the whole hall was about to dissolve in its brilliance.**I woke with my cheek stuck to something damp. For a moment I thought it was sweat again, or drool, or both. I lifted my face, whatever was on my face feeling like glue. I rose slowly, wincing at the sharp prickling pain from my cheek as I carefully tore myself free.My eyes fluttered open to dim light. The couch. The living room couch. I was lying sprawled across it, my body twisted half-off the cushions. My jaw ached. My lips burned, stiff and raw.How had I gotten down there?“Rob?”I jerked upright, groggy. Jess was in the doorway, frozen, Win nowhere in sight. Her face was pale, her eyes wide.“Oh my god,” she whispered.She was staring at my face, her hand moving to her mouth. Confused, I raised a hand to my own face, wincing as my fingers brushed my lips. I probed my mouth…and felt it. Thread. Stiff, knotted.Pulled tight through my lips.The horror struck me all at once. I clawed at it with shaking fingers, tugging.“Mmm.mmm,” I moaned, eyes tearing as I tried to open my mouth. Pain exploded through my face as the stitches snapped, tearing flesh. My blood felt hot as it spilled down my chin, seeping into the front of my shirt.“Jesus Christ, Rob!” Jess lurched forward – then stopped, frozen. Her arms jerked like she might reach, but she held them tight against her chest instead. Her body was stiff, trembling, caught between saving me and running from me.I clawed the stitches apart, blood bubbling down my chin. My breath rattled. “Jess…”Her eyes were wide, wet. “Don’t talk — stop talking. You’re bleeding.” Her voice broke, panic pressed flat. “What did you do? What did you do?”I gagged. Spat red. “Why…didn’t you come home?”Jess blinked hard. “Rob, I did. I texted you. I told you I was coming as soon as I could.” Her hand shook as she pulled out her phone. “Look.”She scrolled. The screen lit her face pale blue. She froze. Her lips parted.“What?” My mouth ripped wider with each word, flesh tearing. “What is it?”She turned the screen toward me, her thumb trembling. Lines. Broken stanzas. The manic poetry, all sent from me.THREAD THROUGH ME SEAMED SHUSH ARMS ARE SOFTER I CAN BE FOLDED NOW I CAN BE HELD BABEJess’s breath hitched as she scrolled. Her voice was hoarse. “You sent me this, Rob. Over and over. All night.”I pressed my hand to my torn mouth, blood hot between my fingers. I tried to speak, to explain, but the words came out shards. “Not me. It’s the house. Please – you have to see. Please. It’s in the attic. It’s, it was hidden. It was lonely but it’s not hidden anymore.”Jess clutched Win’s new bear to her chest, the stuffed head tight under her chin. Her knuckles were white against the fabric. She didn’t come closer. She didn’t leave either.Her voice dropped, steady but thin as glass: “If I go with you. If I look. You’ll let me call someone? You’ll let me get you help?”Her eyes burned into me, demanding an answer.I nodded fast. Too fast. “Yes. Just come.”Jess pressed her lips together, her breath shaking out of her. She stood, arms crossed tight across her chest, as if to hold herself together. “Okay,” she said finally, her voice so quiet I almost didn’t hear.I rose, my body swaying, every movement ragged. The house seemed to shiver with us, like it knew we were coming. Like it was waiting.And together, without touching, we went upstairs.**The stairs to the attic groaned under my weight, the loose blood from my ripped lips dripping onto the wood. Jess lingered at the bottom, her arms at her sides, her hands ready, her face pale. She looked like she might bolt, but when I turned and whispered, “Please,” she followed.We climbed into the thick heat together. Dust hung in the air like a stale, kept breath. Jess’s hand brushed a beam once for balance, but otherwise she stayed a careful step behind me, watching.“Rob,” she said softly, “this isn’t safe. It’s filthy up here. You’re –”“Just look,” I cut in. My voice cracked, lips raw and glistening. I pointed toward the far wall, where the boards didn’t match. Where the house had a gash. My heart hammered in my ears. “It’s there. Do you see it?”Jess stayed where she was, her shadow stretching long in the dim bulb light. Her eyes fixed on the wall. She didn’t blink. Instead, she stood very still. Breathing in short, hard hitches.“Rob…” she whispered.I walked across the makeshift walkway, feeling off balance on the planks. Jess followed, just a few steps behind me, letting me take another before she followed. I stopped before the seam and dropped to my knees, pulling at the rotten wood, the black tear already slick against my fingers. “Here. Touch it. You’ll feel it. Just come closer.”Jess stood beside me, coming to stand close. Close enough to touch.I reached for her hand before I knew I was moving. She flinched but didn’t pull away fast enough, and suddenly my fingers were wrapped around hers, guiding her forward. Her skin was hot against mine, and I could feel her heartbeat kick under my grip – flushed and full of adrenaline. I pressed her hand toward the seam. Inches away. All she had to do was lean in.Jess’s breath hitched, sharp. “Rob – stop.”Her voice wasn’t angry. It was scared. For me, maybe. For herself.I froze, realizing what I’d done, how close I’d dragged her. I let go at once, my hand falling useless to my side.Jess stared at me, then back at the wall. Her expression was unreadable – fixed, taut. She was looking right at it, at the black seam yawning in the boards, but her lips stayed closed. No affirmation. No denial.And her silence was worse than any answer.I sat back on my heels, trembling. My throat worked around words that wouldn’t come. I wanted her to see, to admit it. To be with me in this. But her face was a mask, glassy with tears she wouldn’t let fall.“Jess,” I whispered, raw, “please.”Jess pulled her hand back from the wall, shaking. She turned to me, her eyes wet, her grip closing hard on my arm.“Rob,” she whispered, then firmer: “We’re done. You need help. We’re leaving this house, right now. I’m taking you to the hospital.”Her urgency cut through the stale air of the attic. I nodded, too quickly, desperate to calm her.“Okay,” I said, voice ragged. “Yeah. You’re right. I’ll come. Just… just give me a second.”She didn’t let go of my arm. She pulled me toward the stairs. I followed, step by step, her hand on me like I was already slipping away. Her voice turned gentle, coaxing, as if she could guide me down with words alone.“We’ll go now. We’ll get in the car. It’s going to be okay. I’m right here. I’m right here.”For a moment I couldn’t believe it. After everything – dragging her up there, showing her the seam in the wall, standing her right in front of it, leading her to touch it – all she had for me now was this: concern, pity, the gentle press of her hand at my back urging me toward the door. Not a word about what she saw. Not a flicker of recognition, or fear, or even denial. Just… nothing. As if it wasn’t there at all. As if I wasn’t there at all. Some part of me wanted to shake her, to scream in her face until she admitted it. But another part – the only part of me that still felt steady – told me to hold on. To keep moving. To stay with her, no matter how wrong it felt.Until we got downstairs, at least.We reached the bottom, moving through the house together. The walls seemed to lean closer, watching. My feet dragged against the floorboards, each step heavier, but she kept me moving, whispering all the while:“Come on, Rob. Twenty minutes. We’ll be there in twenty minutes. They’ll help you. They’ll help us.”At the door she fumbled with her keys, turning back to me with a pleading look. “Please. Let’s go.”I nodded, letting her step outside. She was already half-way down the stairs. I stepped forward –And slammed the front door shut. The lock clicked under my hand.“ROBERT!” Jess’s voice cracked against the wood. She pounded her fists, each blow shaking through me. “OPEN THIS DOOR! OPEN IT RIGHT NOW!”Her voice broke into sobs, then fury, then begging.“Please, Rob – don’t do this, don’t leave me, let me help you!”I’m calling the cops Rob, I’m calling them if you don’t open this door right now!”I leaned against the other side, shaking, the frame cold against my forehead. For a moment I almost unlocked it, almost let her drag me into the car and out of this place. But the truth pressed against me, heavier than her fists.It was never her. It was never Win. It was me, this was my lonely way.I walked back upstairs, my hands at my sides, the walls pressing closer, the floor carrying me whether I wanted it to or not.“ROBERT!” Jess’s voice cracked from the front door, reverberating from downstairs. “PLEASE—STOP!”I didn’t look back. Couldn’t. Her words frayed into sobs, muffled by the walls, then flared up again, ragged and raw, growing fainter and fainter as I walked towards our bedroom, towards the closet and the way to the attic. “Come back to me! Please, please come back!”**I don’t know how to explain it, sweetheart.I’ve been writing this all down because one day, when you’re older, you’ll need to understand. I’ve been sharing this with you, hoping you read it. Maybe you’ll come back here with your mom and find all these pages I’ve printed out. Maybe you’ll see this online someday. Maybe you’ll wonder why your dad wasn’t enough.It’s the house. It’s always been the house.I fought as long as I could, but the pull is too strong. I know what waits for me in the dark now, and I know what I have to do. I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you better. I’m sorry I couldn’t be more.I hope you got rid of those toys, Win. I hope you threw them away. Don’t take anything from that house with you. Leave it to the dark.I wish I could be with you now. I wish I could arrange your toys for you to wake up to. I wish I was holding you.I hope when you read this, you’ll know that none of it was your fault. You were my light. You were the one thing that kept me tethered.But I can’t ignore it anymore.I’m going into the seam, into that lonely way. If I don’t come back, remember this: stay away from the attic. Stay away from the box.I love you so, so much baby.Don’t follow me.—Dad",
