      "content_preview": "I don’t know if this is the right sub for this, but I need some advice on something.I’ve been in the psych ward for about a month now (voluntary before anyone asks). The days honestly aren’t that bad, nothing like the movies about sociopathic people lol. They smile at us, some play board games like monopoly and clue, and chat for a while about any and every topic. One of my favourite nurses, Zara, is expecting her 1st daughter soon, and has chatted with me about some baby names. The meals aren’t that bad, either, but they get repetitive pretty quickly. There’s a huge collection of books here that some of the nurses gave away for free. I’m on my 4th one now.I can’t stop thinking about how weird the night staff are, though.I didn’t even notice at first, you’re supposed to be asleep right?  Lights out at 10, doors locked, meds kick in, done deal. But I’ve had insomnia since I was a kid, and lying in bed at 3AM means you start thinking a lot. Like how the night staff always walk in sync, there’s never a misplaced footstep. Kinda like they’re dancing in a music video. I’ve never heard any of them speak, but I suppose that’s normal. They aren’t supposed to be loud while the patients are sleeping, but what weirds me out is the times they come in and check on us. You would think it’s every hour, but we have a clock on the wall and they always come in at 12:33AM, 3:33AM, and 5:33AM. Then the day staff come in at 7AM and the day resumes as normal.I told the day staff about the weirdness of it all, but they just brushed me off, told me to sleep earlier and that they’ll give me some melatonin if I’m having trouble. I suppose me being sleep deprived doesn’t help my imagination.I was chatting with one of the people in my ward about it the next day, Aaron. He’s a middle aged man, in the ward for a mental disorder or something. Not really my business. But anyways, out of nowhere he dropped this bomb in the conversation: “They don’t like it when you’re awake.”I just paused and was like, “what?” He glanced around and then whispered it again, before seeing a nurse coming over and starting to laugh loudly. I just glanced at him and the nurse, while she just smiled at me regretfully. Later that evening, when I was watching the channel they always had on in the lounge, I saw a nurse giving Aaron some medication. I thought it was slightly weird since Aaron only has morning meds but I guess he just got a new prescription.When lights out came, guess who couldn’t sleep? Me! I was staring at the ceiling, trying to count sheep or whatever, whenallthe doors down the hallway opened in perfect harmony. Then they all slammed against the walls behind them so loudly it echoed down the hallways. I shot upwards and stared towards the door, but no one and nothing was there. I stayed there for a while, the only sound being my shaky, shallow breathing. Eventually, my nerves were so fried that I passed out.The next morning, I was so tired one of the patients had to hit me with a pillow3 timesbefore I even stirred. I had breakfast with the others, but even above all the conversational noise, my thoughts were louder. I kept wondering about the doors slamming. Why would they slam like that? All the doors have a locking mechanism to make sure people don’t smack their heads if they decide to mess with them. And if they did slam, then how did no one else wake up to it? Aaron’s one ofthe mostlight sleepers I’ve ever met – and speaking of him, he wasn’t at breakfast this morning. His bed was bare and all the stuff that he brought (and was allowed) into the ward had disappeared. I asked Zara where he was, she just smiled at me like I was stupid and said “There hasn’t been anyone occupying that bed for a couple of months”. I’m dumbfounded to be honest because I played Last-Card with him the day before and he beat me 4 times.But, yeah. I really don’t know what to do as none of the staff will take me seriously and I can’t tell if this is all in my head or not.",

      "content_preview": "It's no secret that, when in need of money, someone is willing to go to extreme lengths. I'm not morally corrupt enough to murder, but I was still desperate to do things close to that. The divorce had been hard on me, and I wanted to get out of that house and just live on my own. For that, you need green, and my job wasn't paying enough for me to just wander off and change my address so quickly.In retrospective, maybe it wasn't so wise to look for a job on the dark web. Those pay the most, though, and I didn't want to spend my time caring for some kid or old lady, only to get paid 10 dollars an hour. I started browsing whatever forum I could find, and filtered my search so that I wouldn't have to kill anyone or sleep with anyone. After a while, I came across offerings of package deliveries and such things. Deliver this to this address, show up to this house, etc. etc. It was all right by me, but I didn't have a car, and I couldn't just walk for miles with suspicious boxes in hand.I finally came across this listing - museum worker needed, $100 / hour, temporary exhibition hosted somewhere in the suburbs. I checked the address on Google Maps and found some abandoned warehouse at the edge of town. I'd driven by it a few times, back when the family car was also my car. I thought I could give it a try. Maybe it was some contemporary art stuff, some voodoo statues or 'cursed' items. I didn't believe in any of that, so it really wasn't a problem to me.It said I had to be there during the week, from 11AM to 5PM, and Sundays were off. The exhibition would run for around 3 months. I quickly added up some numbers - $100 an hour, for 6 hours a day, for 6 days a week, for 3 months. That would certainly cover for a deposit and some second-hand car, I figured. That would be enough to help me get by.I ran through the possibilities of weird implications this ad might have. Maybe the museum was a front for human trafficking, drug dealing or other illegal things. I don't even know why I saidmaybe. That was surely the case. I just had to be careful and not look into things too much. Or maybe the exhibition was hosted by some eccentric millionaire who wanted to display his dubious antiques. Either way, 100 dollars is 100 dollars. I replied and got an instant response. Next thing I know, I was hired.With the little money that I had, I bought a bike and some headphones to help pass the time. I arrived to the warehouse one Monday at 10AM, eager to get the job started and get my money.I wasn't expecting it to be so... empty. The warehouse was huge on the inside, but the items displayed were very few. Mostly paintings, covering the walls and some wooden statues, extremely tall. They almost reached the ceiling of the warehouse and I couldn't really see their faces. All of them were sort of bent down, almost as if they were giants watching so as not to step on us.Some notebooks were on display, too. Most of them had drawings or scribbles. They weren't extraordinary. I really couldn't tell what I was looking at.I saw some unknown surgical equipment. It looked almost medieval. Next to it, a pair of ordinary scissors. I thought, at first, that it was ironic, or just a piece of art, but the washed out lady that had led me in there told me that those particular scissors were authentic and extremely important.I couldn't really tell what age the lady was. She was Asian, her skin clear and luminous - based solely off that, I could've guessed she was in her teens, but her eyes moved around a lot and had a certain darkness that you only gain with age. Contrasting to her face, her hands were wrinkled and stained. Her hair fell in long threads on her back and was tangled towards the end. It looked unwashed.The most interesting part consisted in the last three items, displayed on the opposing wall to the entrance. If I sat at my desk, near the entrance, the wall was almost invisible, hidden in shadows. I didn't understand why the lights were so dim - the lady explained that it contributed to the atmosphere of the exhibition.One of the items was a low, round wooden table. The plaque in front of it readThe Hunger.The table was chewed and clawed at the edges. I think it used to be square, but the wood had been bitten off and chewed to the point where the corners were rounded. The teeth marks on the table were human. I figured it must have been some art piece.The other item was a pair of shoes. The plaque readThe Shoes that Walked Home. They were old, made of leather, and worn out in impossible places, as if whoever had worn them had walked in circles continuously.The last item was an empty pedestal. Its plaque read:PAINTERDo not look when occupied.I stared at it a while. 'Such an interesting concept,' I mumbled, noticing the lady's unblinking gaze on me.'Yes,' she replied. 'Don't look when it's occupied, though.''How would I know-''You'll see. It's a really easy job. You don't have a lot of duties, and you earn so much money by basically doing nothing. You must understand we value your discretion and lack of curiosity the most.''Yes. Thanks.' I responded quickly.Suddenly, I realized I didn't really want her to leave. That didn't stop her from traversing the warehouse and shutting the door behind her, without any other formalities.I was left alone, with the... art.My job was to sit at the desk and greet visitors, sell them tickets. I noticed that the stack of tickets was relatively small - they didn't really expect visitors. As I imagined - the warehouse was at the edge of town and nothing really promoted this exhibition. No one was going to come.I decided I would put on some music and study the paintings. I got up and moved in front of the first, titledMy mother. It showed a beautiful sea landscape, the crystal waves melting into the bright shore. It was the type of scenery you'd find before a storm, so bright and yet ominous, as if it knew what it awaited. I couldn't find any trace of a woman, though.Right when I was about to move to the next painting, my neck tensed up.It's impossible to describe it. The sudden alarming urge to run. The panic that builds up in your chest. I was afraid to turn around, and yet I hated having my back turned to the room.I took a deep breath.I'll count to three. One, two, three.I didn't turn around. I kept locking eyes withMy mother,afraid to act on the impulse of running back to my desk. After torturous moments where my heart was threatening to jump out of my chest, I did a swift turn and then plunged back to my desk. 'Whew,' I said out loud. 'This place is creepy as fuck.''Why?''Because.I don't know, it's just fucking odd. I wouldn't pay money to come here.'My throat was so dry it was itching. In the cold air, drops of sweat began gathering on my forehead. My eyes darted to various points of the room. To the paintings. To the statues. To its corners. Who had I spoken to? Who even was that? I stared at the closed entrance door. 'Who is that?'I got no answer.'Fuck off. Just answer me. I heard you loud and clear, I know that someone is in here. You have to,' I began hopelessly, 'you have to buy a ticket to get in...'I heard a clatter in the back of the warehouse.The Hunger. The Shoes that Walked Home. The Painter.Did the pedestal refer to the one who had made the paintings?I stood up and made my way slowly to the back. I kept looking at the floor until I saw the edges of The Hunger. In the dim light, I could make out the shadow of the pedestal, and on it, I saw the shadow of a figure. It looked humanoid, like someone crouched over. I couldn't tell which direction it was facing.I was so cold. I stepped back, slowly, the way I came. At last, after what felt like billions of years, I sat down on my chair. I spent the remaining time of my shift there, too disturbed to listen to music.At some point, I heard the faint sound of wet footsteps coming from the back. You know when you're little, and you begin recognizing the walk of your family members as they're coming up the stairs? How you can distinguish between your younger brother's upbeat walk and your fathers slow, heavy steps? These footsteps sounded as if those two patterns were combined. Almost like... limping. They went on for a few seconds, then faded without reaching a certain destination.I swore to myself that I would quit the next day. However, when I saw the bank transfer that night, I thought it wasn't really a bad job. It's not like I was being chased around or hurt in any way. I just had to sit down.I dreamt, however, of those footsteps reaching me at last. It's Tuesday, and as I'm writing this, I can hear them faintly in the back. I just hope that they appreciate my discretion. I wonder if The Hunger and The Shoes that Walked Home are connected in some way, but they don't pay me to be curious.",

      "content_preview": "I need your help. I don’t normally post online about my real life. How much help can the internet be? It’s just people screaming their opinions at each other. But I genuinely have no idea what to do in this situation.I’m a professional housesitter. Never used to know that was a thing, but friends I petsit for recommended me to wealthy acquaintances, and a few testimonials later, I’m housesitting these big McMansions. I usually show up the first day in a beige jacket over a black tee—casual but classy. But once the owners are gone and I’m in charge, I switch into my laziest jeans or PJs, make myself an espresso with their fancy machine (they always have one), and wander barefoot out to the deck overlooking the lake. And I open my arms wide and say something cheesy like, “Jeeves, fetch me the morning paper.” Then I open my phone and play Wordle and fantasize that I actually live there and think about how next summer I’m going to refinish the deck—basically LARPing life as the 1%.But I always leave the place looking better than I found it, usually with a note about how I changed the flickering bulb or the CO2 detector battery or fixed the squeaky door. So I get pretty good reviews.Never any problems.Until now.So, latest gig. Rich old white guy, keeps referring to me as “Gen Z” (Bro, I’m a millennial). Prattles about investments and the market and asks about my golf game (I do not have a golf game. Like all poors, I play whatever is free at the park). Halfway through introductions, he remembers he hasn’t told me his name yet and says, “I’m Gerald. My pronouns are she-her. Hah! Just kidding.” Claps me on the back.Haha. You’re so funny, Gerald.He gives me a tour of the house—huge windows and hardwood floors and sliding doors leading out to the patio overlooking the shimmering lake. He even has an indoor swimming pool, I guess for when the lake freezes over. The guest room where I’ll be staying is the only bedroom on the main floor. I ask him why he needs a sitter since he’s got no pets and is only gone for three days. He tells me it’s for peace of mind. He’s had break-ins recently. Speaking of which—he explains the fob system.“For security, the doors autolock. So if you remove your fob and later go out to the patio, or leave and come back, you’ll be locked out. Always wear your fob. I’m giving you my spare—nifty, huh?” He grins as he pulls on a gold chain around his neck to show me what looks like a turquoise amulet. The amulet is a stunning bit of jewelry that looks like he plucked it straight from King Tutankhamen’s tomb. It’s probably priceless and belongs in a museum. But when I ask if I can see it he draws it back and tucks it under his shirt. “Ope! Sorry Zoomer. This thing is worth more than your life, haha. Yours is the discount version.” He hands me a small silver chain with a fob set in the back of a similar amulet, but mine is just colored glass and cheesy plastic. “Leave it in the crystal bowl near the entrance when you leave the last day. The doors will lock behind you.”Discount version?Specially made for poors! “Sure,” I say.Upstairs are bedrooms themed in different colors, a trophy room, and a library. It’s not exactly off-limits, but he tells me I shouldn’t have much reason to go up there. Then he says hedoeswant to show me one thing. We troop up the ornate staircase with the carved banister and he points to a door at the end of a long hallway. Like everything in the house, it is ornate, but rather than the modern style of the rest of the house, this door has a carved gold handle and plaques with relief sculpture around the frame as if from an ancient tomb. Hell, that’s probably exactly what it is, and it probably opens to his own personal museum of plundered artifacts. Gerald, unsurprisingly, tells me under no circumstances may I enter. I tell him he should just put a velvet rope up in front of it.After laughing way too loud at my joke, he says, “You might hear thumping—we have squirrels. I’ll take care of them once I get back. Just don’t worry about the noises.”“Gotcha.”“Pretty cushy job, right?” He smiles as we return to the main floor. “The hard part, for me, is finding someone trustworthy. Privacy is my main concern.”“Yep, understood. I won’t go upstairs.”“You’re probably tempted now that I’ve told you not to.”“Nope.”“Probably think, ‘Oh, he must have a dead body in there!’ or something, hah!”What I actually think is,Wow, you are really making this weird, my dude. In the same way it might be weird if I ordered a meat pie and was told, “Here you go, delicious pie! 100 percent beef, absolutely no fingers inside.”Perhaps realizing his remarks sound sus (as this “Zoomer” would say), Gerald adds, “Just kidding.”Haha.Anyway—the first day, I arrive wearing my discount jewelry and do my usual checks, but it’s all immaculate, nothing that needs fixing or cleaning, so I head out to the deck with a beer. “Zoomer, open this bottle,” I say, role-playing Gerald. “My pronouns are fuck me,” I add as I crack it open and take a swig. Lol. I down a couple bottles while watching the stars twinkle over the lake. As the sun fades and a chill sets in, I retreat indoors—THUMP THUMP THUMPThe knocking is so loud I drop my beer. Swearing, I clean up the sticky mess, my pulse hammering with eachTHUMP.Those are some big fucking squirrels,I think.I stand underneath the ceiling below what I assume is the locked room and a squirrel hurling bowling balls. With a final, ominousTHUMP, the noises cease. After a few tense minutes, I make a circuit of the house, just re-checking the security of everything for peace of mind. Aside from the occasional thumps upstairs, everything seems normal. I find a plush robe of Gerald’s in the walk-in closet that is bigger than my entire apartment. I prance around in it for awhile, lip-syncing to music booming through the house, eventually luxuriating in a bubble bath with some fancy chocolates he won’t miss. The tub is the ostentatious centerpiece of the master bathroom, set on a raised platform in the middle of the room with gold-gilded mirrors along the walls, which I can only imagine Gerald looks into while airing out his wrinkly junk out and saying things like, “My Gerald, what a snack you are!” I’m still lounging in the tub when noise starts up from that door at the end of the hall. And even though it’s a little ways down, I have pretty sensitive hearing, and I notice…Thud thud thudThe noise this time is less like pounding or thumping and more like…Footsteps?“Fuck, no,” I whisper.Like someone walking around in that room just beyond the door. I lean out and call, “HELLO?”The footsteps cease.Every hair on my neck stands on end. For a few minutes, I stay in the tub. But when the steps start up again—thud thud thud—I haul myself out of the warm water and wrap myself in Gerald’s fleecy robe and pad down the hall with my wet feet. Raise my knuckles to rap on the door when I stop, my eyes fixed just above the ornate gold handle. It takes my buzzed brain a few seconds to parse what I am looking at, to catch up to the chill that’s already freezing the blood in my veins and sending every hair standing on end.I stare. And keep staring. Trying to make sense of it.The locked room. The bolt is on the outside. Onmyside of the door.This room isn’t locked from inside to protect Gerald’s privacy and keep me out. It’s locked to keep something or someonein.Oh fuck me. Is my role actually not housesitter, but jailer?***THUMP THUMP THUMP2am. I haven’t opened the door. I called police, but for some reason I get no reception inside the house, so I had to speak with them while standing out on the deck. They seemed to think I was prank calling after I told them I was housesitting and scared by knocking and when they asked me to go back inside the house and open the door I said, “But there’s no reception so you won’t hear if something happens… What if it’s a monster that eats me before you get here?” I might have been slurring a little, too. Something to do with all those beers I had. Or that fancy liquor in the cabinet that probably cost 2k a swallow. I only had one swallow. Anyway when the dispatcher asked if I’d been drinking I hung up.I decided to leave the mystery for morning. But every time the noise quiets enough that I might sleep, a sudden furious pounding wakes me again. Pretty sure what he’s actually got in there is a velociraptor, with its mouth tied shut so it can’t shriek, only bang its claws and tail against things. And open doors. Of course. Hence the lock.THUD THUD. Christ I’m losing it.THUMP!Fuck it. I make my way upstairs in the dead of night to the door, flicking on my phone’s flashlight and considering the bolt. I rap my knuckles on the wood—knock knock. Is anyone th—KNOCK KNOCKThe resulting knock sends my heart into spasms. For a second I almost pass out standing up. Swallow hard.Ok. I square my shoulders, call out in my most assertive voice: “H-hello?”Silence.“Hey. Is someone in there? Who just knocked?”Silence.“I’m not going to let you out unless you say something.”Silence. Fine. I can play hardball with whoever orwhateveris inside. I’ve taken all of four steps when suddenly, a loud:KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKThen the door begins rattling. Rattling loudly. Like someone’s grabbed the knob and is shaking with all their might. Rattle rattle rattle rattle—I do the only sensible thing, at this point.I leave the house.***I come back in the morning and the room upstairs is quiet. I have a pleasant day scrolling on my phone and swimming laps in the indoor pool. But every so often, there are those footsteps shuffling around above. I put a pizza in the oven for lunch and stand in the main room looking at the ceiling, and that’s when Gerald reaches out. When I answer the phone, he thanks me for taking care of everything and asks if the “squirrels” kept me up. I put on a fake smile and tell him no, and I ask him how his vacation is going. Pretend like all is normal. Like he’s not hiding some crazy secret in there. He has that same shit-eating smile himself, like he’s hiding a crazy secret in there. Things are great, he says, he’s having a wonderful vacation, the ladies there all love him ‘cause he’s got therizz.God I hate this man. Then he sobers up and says, “Just remember, Zoomer, the one rule you have to follow. I’ll be back in two days. Ignore those squirrels. Keep up the good work and you and I will be skibidi, you get me?”“I get you,” I say. As soon as I’m off the phone with him, I’m back upstairs outside the door, contemplating it.OK Zoomer, I think.Let’s do this.And I unlock the door and open it.***The room inside is just a collection of boxes and storage. I don’t see anyone at all. No velociraptors. No squirrels with bowling balls. No prisoner bound and gagged and thumping around. Not even a person who just for some reason can’t talk and walks around with footsteps thudding.The room is empty.I’m about to step inside and search when the oven timer goes off for the pizza, so I shut the door and turn away, heading back down the hall—I’ll go through those boxes right after lunch. I’ve almost reached the staircase when I hear it. The shriek of hinges…CreeeeeaaakThe door behind me is open.Time feels suspended as I stare at that opening door. A door that I definitely closed. And I wonder if the wind did it even as I know there are no windows open and no drafts. And then I hear it, even though I’m not moving. I’m standing still there in that hallway, but I hear it, loud and clear.Thud… thud…The floorboards. Like someone is stepping along them. Heavy steps. Shuffling toward me—And that’s all the warning I need before I’m ducking into the master bedroom, slamming the door shut, and realizingit has no lock.Fuck!I dash into the bathroom—whichdoeshave a lock—slam the door, lock it, and back away, my mouth motoring a series ofshitsandfucksas the door rattles. Something just beyond shakes the knob. Rattle rattle rattle and I fumble for my phone, only to remember belatedly that it has no reception inside these walls. I have to use the wifi. But the wifi isn’t working—why isn’t the wifi fucking working? What happened? I need to get outside!I dash to the bathroom window, and that’s when I realize the windows are sealed closed and made of some kind of reinforced glass. I grab the porcelain lid from the back of the toilet and slam it into the glass, and the lid cracks. The glass isn’t dented. But what kind of psycho has windows in their bathroom that can’t open and—There’s a crackling sound, and then the same speakers that I previously used to blast music throughout the mansion now pipe a voice down at me like the voice of God. But it’s the voice of Gerald:“You can’t escape my pet, Zoomer. Sorry to do this to you. But that curse has to feed on somebody. And better you than me.”“Curse?” I shout. I’m searching the bathroom for a weapon. Something else to use on the glass. I find baby powder under the sink and scatter it all over the floor.“You’ve seen my collection.” Gerald loves to hear himself talk. I imagine him pontificating in front of a whole crowd of old white dudes. Tossing back expensive bourbon. Drinking in their attention. Holding court. I imagine him sweeping his arms out, wherever he is, bragging to me from across the world. “You won’t find anything like it anywhere in the world. But some of these items, they come from tombs. All those old stories about tombs and curses? They’re not all fiction.”“And lemme guess your amulet is part of it?” That shiny fucking thing. And I got the glass version. I should’ve known it meant something. It didn’t look natural.“Amulet of immortality,” he gloats. “Or at least agelessness. A shame I found it when I was already in my sixties. But that was nearly seventy years ago now. I’m well over a century, Zoomer.”“Really? Well how about you let someone else be its meal? I thought you and me were, you know, skibidi?”“You think I haven’t seen you prancing your bare ass around my place?” Oh. I didn’t see any cameras. But I should probably have assumed. He chuckles. “You’re practically in the cradle. Don’t feel bad. Scrabbling for crumbs, housesitting? You wouldn’t have made much difference in the world. Me—every day I’m alive I pour thousands into research, into charity, into making something of my life. More than you’d ever amount to even if you did live to old age.”“But why do you even need me?”“Well, I’m its mark. I opened its tomb. Took the amulet. But like anything, its energy is finite. Especially this far from the tomb. I figured out when it gobbled my buddy first, who broke in and took the amulet with me. It took awhile to come after me again. Next time it did, it got one of the guides who was with us. One touch, drained the life out of him. That time it took even longer for it to come back again. And I realized… draining the life essence out of someone, putting it in this amulet takes a process. It always goes dormant for awhile after. But once it wakes up again, once I start hearing footsteps, well… it needs to be fed. Distracted.”“Or maybe you could give back the fucking amulet!”“Already told you Zoomer, this is my eternal life we’re talking about. And yours isn’t worth shit.”“But I didn’t open the tomb! Why would it come after me??”A long chuckle. And then he says, “No, but youdidopen the door.”The door. The fucking door. With its ornate carvings and all those weird symbols and—shit, it must’ve been taken right off the tomb. He’s made me into a tomb raider and now I’m the nearest one to violate the sanctity of its space, while Gerald is off across the globe. My phone is a brick and I can’t get out through the glass. This thing is going to kill me if I don’t think fast.“Sorry Zoomer. Bye bye now.”And then I hear a click, and realize how fucked I am because even remotely, Gerald has control over the house. The bathroom door unlocks.I am definitely fucking dead.***I have about five seconds to figure out a plan before that thing sucks the life out of me. All I know is that I can’t let it touch me. I back away from the opening door as footprints appear in the baby powder I’ve spilled on the floor.Thud… thud. I snatch towels from around the tub and fling them, and the invisiblesomethingdoes not slow as it shrugs the towels off, but for a few seconds I can clearly see a sort of towel-mummy, and we play ring-around-the-rosie around the bathtub. It slouches after me, footsteps appearing in the baby powder while Gerald’s voice booms:“One touch, Zoomer! Hahahaha! One touch!”Before the bathroom door can swing closed, I dash out, the footstepsthud thuddingafter me, gaining speed. I bolt downstairs but the front door of the house is sealed. The glass doors leading out to the patio are locked and also strongly reinforced. Gerald’s voice taunts me, his eyes following me through the cameras—“keep zooming, Zoomer!” Like this is all just a sick sport, and I’ll be damned if I let him spectate my end. So I scramble to the door to the one part of the house I haven’t really ventured—the basement.“Ohohoho! Now you’re really trapped!”Ignoring him, I scurry past wine racks and shelving and aha, there it is! The panel for the breakers. Shutting the power down won’t unlock the doors, but I’m hoping to at least get this dickweed’s eyes off me as I rapidly flip all the switches—Gerald snarls, “You’ll still be locked in, you little sh—”All the lights go off, and I am trapped in total darkness.***Fumbling for my phone’s flashlight, I tap on the dim luminescence. Listening. Panting in the pitch black. If it’s already down here with me I’m fucked. There’s no place to hide. And only one door, one staircase back out. I stand, panting, terrified…thud… thud…My heart almost gives out in relief. The footsteps are above me. Circling around overhead. The curse hasn’t followed me down… perhaps because it doesn’t realize where the stairs are. It just keeps shuffling around overhead, and sometimes moves a little ways off but always circles back, homing in on me, pounding at the floor. Like an invisible zombie.Of course, as soon as Gerald gets back, I’m fucked. I think about the mansion’s layout. And finally, I formulate a plan.***I’m in Gerald’s fanciest bathrobe when he finally arrives back at the mansion, and I haul myself up from the lounger where I’ve been tanning by a window beside the indoor pool. The atmosphere is silent—no thudding, thumping, or pounding—and I’ve spent most of the past few hours typing up this post while sipping one of his probably-priceless brandys. Which brings me to the point I need some advice on—what to do about the amulet? With the tomb raided and most of the relics in museums and the door here on the mansion’s upper floor, there’s no real way to put the genie back in the bottle, so to speak. I’m open to suggestions about the amulet’s fate.Anyway, I called late last night and lied to Gerald that I found a way to break the curse. This morning I restored power so he could watch me on the camera and see for himself how quiet the whole place is.“Well I’ll be damned.” Gerald looks genuinely impressed when he steps in through the front door, and a little annoyed. He glares at me as I come out to greet him. “How the hell are you still alive?”“It’s a secret. One I’d be happy to let you in on…” I examine my nails. “… for 100k.”His eyes bulge. “You gotta be shitting me, Zoomer. Listen, you drank about ten thousand dollars worth of alcohol and left my bathroom a fuckin’ mess. You’re lucky I don’t sue you for damages!”“’Lucky?’ You tried to kill me! I could report you to the authorities. That money is peanuts to you anyway. Plus, if you don’t pay me, you’ll regret it. I didn’t actually break the curse. It’ll get you if I don’t tell you the secret.”He laughs. “Oh, Zoomer. Never play poker. You wouldn’t be standing here safely if there were any danger! You’re just lying to try to scare me into opening my wallet. You think I don’t recognize a hustle? Listen, you wanna play legal games with me, I’ll crush you like the bug you are—\"But I’m not listening to him anymore. Instead, I’m looking past him, to where the pool room doors are open, and I can see the stretch of blue water and my lounger at the far back, near the deep end. Wet marks have appeared on the wood floor coming out from the pool room doors. The plush oriental rug Gerald and I are standing on gets a few dark marks on it. Gerald is too busy snarling at me to hear the firstthud…. thud, but then his face whitens, and he whirls around and exclaims, “No—NO—NO!!! Stay awa—” He stumbles backwards, but it’s too late. His skin withers, shriveling like a time-elapsed grape drying into a raisin, his hair whitening and his skin shrinking onto bone until he resembles a crusty mummy, like all the years of his immortal life have been sucked away… and then he drops dead to the floor, the amulet glittering on his neck.Was gonna warn him but, you know… I checked my ratings this morning.He gave me a one starreview.",

      "content_preview": "I need to write this down. I need to get it out of my head and into the world, because I feel like I’m going crazy, and because I need to warn people.I’m an experienced hiker. I’m not one of those weekend warriors who sticks to the paved, well-marked trails. I like the deep woods, the places where you can walk for a whole day and not see another soul. I had a long weekend, so I decided to tackle a remote trail in a state forest a few hours from my home. My plan was simple: hike in about five or six miles, find a good spot, camp for the night, and hike out the next day. Standard stuff.The hike in was beautiful. The air was crisp, the sky was a brilliant, cloudless blue, and the late autumn sun cast long, golden shafts of light through the canopy. The only sounds were the crunch of my boots on the fallen leaves, the chatter of a distant sparrows, and the wind whispering through the trees. This is why I do it. This feeling of absolute peace, of being completely disconnected from the noise of the world.After a few hours of steady hiking, I started looking for a place to make camp. I was looking for the usual: a relatively flat spot, not too close to the trail, preferably with access to a water source. And then, I found it.It wasn't just a good spot. It was a perfect spot. Unnaturally perfect.I stepped off the main trail, pushing through a thicket of ferns, and found myself in a clearing I can only describe as idyllic. It was a perfect circle, maybe forty feet in diameter. The ground was covered in a carpet of short, soft, vibrant green grass that looked more like a meticulously manicured lawn than a patch of wild forest floor. And the trees… the trees formed a perfect, unbroken ring around the clearing. Tall, ancient oaks and pines stood shoulder to shoulder, their branches interlocking overhead like some kind of a dome, leaving this single, perfect circle of green open to the sky. It was like something out of a fairy tale.A small, rational part of my brain registered how strange it was. Clearings in dense forests are rarely so symmetrical. The grass shouldn't be so uniform, so soft. But the overwhelming feeling was one of discovery, of incredible luck. It felt… safe. Protected. The circle of trees felt like a natural fence, a private room gifted to me by the forest itself. I dismissed my unease as my city-dweller’s cynicism. I had found the jackpot of campsites.I dropped my pack with a contented sigh and set to work. The tent went up easily, the stakes sinking into the soft earth with a satisfying thump. I gathered some fallen branches from just outside the clearing and built a small, neat fire pit in the center. Soon, a cheerful little fire was crackling away, warding off the evening chill. I cooked a simple meal of dehydrated chili and sat on my log, watching the flames dance as the sun set, painting the sky above the circle of trees in hues of orange and purple.This, I thought to myself, is perfect. This is what it’s all about.As true darkness fell, the forest changed, as it always does. The familiar woods of the day became a strange place of shadows and unseen movements. But I was snug in my little circle of light and warmth. I felt completely secure. After cleaning up my cook set, I doused the fire thoroughly, making sure every last ember was out, and crawled into my tent.I zipped up the flap, settled into my sleeping bag, and tried to sleep. And that’s when the perfection started to unravel.It began with a feeling. A strange sensation from the ground beneath me. It was a faint, almost imperceptible movement, directly under my sleeping bag. It felt like… insects. A whole lot of them, moving around just under the tent floor. A low-grade, creepy-crawly feeling.I tried to ignore it. I’m in the woods, after all. There are bugs. I pulled my sleeping bag tighter around me and closed my eyes, focusing on the gentle sounds of the night. But I couldn’t sleep. The feeling persisted, a constant, subtle, wriggling sensation against my back. It wasn’t painful. It was just… wrong.Then, the noises started.They came from outside the tent, from the ring of trees surrounding the clearing. A soft snap of a twig. The dry rustle of leaves. At first, I assumed it was just an animal. A deer, maybe a raccoon. But the sounds were too regular. Snap… rustle… snap… They seemed to be moving slowly around the perimeter of the clearing, like someone is moving around me in the darkness. My heart started to beat a little faster.I lay there, perfectly still, my ears straining in the darkness. And then I saw the shadows.My tent is made of a thin, light-colored nylon. The moon was bright, and it cast eerie, dancing shadows of the tree branches onto the tent walls. I watched them, trying to calm my racing mind. It’s just the wind, I told myself. The wind is making the branches move.But there was no wind. The air was dead still.Yet the shadows on my tent walls were moving. Not just swaying, but actively, deliberately shifting. They were long, thin, finger-like shadows, and they were stroking the outside of my tent. I could see them sliding up the walls, tracing the seams, like curious, probing fingers.I sat bolt upright, my breath caught in my throat. I grabbed my powerful flashlight from the mesh pocket beside me. My hand was shaking. I flicked it on, pointing the bright, white beam at the tent wall. The shadow vanished in the glare. I swept the beam around the inside of the tent. Nothing. Just me, my gear, and my hammering heart.I turned the light off. The shadow-fingers returned, caressing the thin fabric.I was terrified now. The feeling from the ground had intensified. It wasn't just a vague wriggling anymore. It was faster, more deliberate. It felt like a thousand tiny needles tapping against the floor of the tent from underneath.I fumbled for the flashlight again, my hands slick with sweat, and pointed the beam down at the tent floor beside my sleeping bag.And I saw it.The grass had come through.Dozens of thin, blade-like shoots of the soft green grass had pierced the thick nylon floor of my tent. They were sticking up, maybe half an inch, like a patch of freshly sprouted lawn. But that wasn’t the worst part.They were moving.They were swaying back and forth, in perfect, horrifying unison. Swish-swish-swish. A tiny, hypnotic, rhythmic motion. They weren’t just blades of grass. They were… something else. Cilia. Teeth. Feelers. They were testing the air inside my tent. They were trying to find me.I screamed, then scrambled for the zipper of the tent door, my fingers feeling like useless, clumsy sausages. The sound of the zipper was obscenely loud in the silence. I burst out of the tent and stumbled to my feet in the center of the clearing, whipping the beam of my flashlight around wildly.The clearing was empty. The circle of trees stood silent and still. For a moment, a sliver of hope, of denial, cut through my panic. Maybe I was hallucinating. Maybe I had finally lost it.Then I turned the flashlight back on my tent.And the world fell out from under me.The tree branches weren't coming from the trees.They were coming from the ground.Dozens of thick, dark, root-like tendrils, the color of wet earth, had erupted from the soft green grass of the clearing. They were wrapped around my tent, constricting it, squeezing it like a giant boa constrictor. The sleek dome of my tent was misshapen, buckled inwards under the pressure. The roots were fibrous and sinewy, and I could swear I saw them pulsing with a slow, rhythmic beat, like a network of dark veins. They were pulling the tent downwards, into the soft earth, which seemed to be… yielding. Sinking.It looked like my tent was being eaten. Digested.And in that moment of absolute, soul-shattering horror, I understood.I didn’t think. I didn’t grab my pack. I didn’t try to save my expensive gear. My phone, my wallet. they were all in the tent. A tent that was currently being swallowed by the ground. The only thing I had was the flashlight in my hand and the clothes on my back.I ran.I ran for the gap in the trees that led back to the trail, my feet pounding on the soft, living earth. I felt a strange, sucking sensation with every step, as if the ground itself was trying to hold me back. I crashed through the ferns and onto the hard-packed dirt of the trail, and I didn't stop.The run through the forest was a blur of pure, animal panic. The beam of my flashlight bounced and jittered, illuminating a chaotic, terrifying slide show of dark tree trunks, twisted roots, and gaping black shadows. Every rustle of leaves was the creature, its tendrils slithering after me. Every shadow was its gaping maw. I ran until my lungs felt like they were on fire, until my legs were jelly, until I was sobbing and gasping for air.After what felt like an eternity, I saw it. A glint of reflected light through the trees. My car.The sight of that familiar, man-made object was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I burst out of the woods and into the small, gravel parking area, fumbling in my pocket for the spare key I always keep there. My hands were shaking so violently it took me three tries to get it into the lock.I threw myself into the driver's seat, slammed the door, and locked it. I sat there for a moment, my chest heaving, listening to the sound of my own ragged breathing. I jammed the key in the ignition and the engine roared to life, a beautiful, beautiful sound of civilization and escape.I didn't look back. I drove all night, the adrenaline coursing through my veins, not stopping until the sun was up and I was hundreds of miles away.I’m safe now, I guess. I’m in a cheap motel room. But I’m not okay. I close my eyes and I see it. The wiggling grass. The pulsing, dark roots. The way my tent buckled and sank into the earth.I think the clearing wasn't a clearing. It was a thing. A living thing. The soft grass wasn't grass; it was a lure, the soft lining of a mouth. The perfect circle of trees wasn't a protective fence; it was the rim of the jaw. And I had willingly, happily, set up my camp on its tongue.",

      "content_preview": "People love watching haunted videos at 2 AM with the lights off, like fear is just entertainment. The podcasts. The Reddit threads. All those YouTubers with shaky GoPros chasing shadows in basements and acting surprised when a light flickers.But real horror? Real horror doesn't come with jump cuts and screaming thumbnails.Real horror doesn’t want to be shared.I know because it tried, once, to test me.It started three years ago, back when I ran a YouTube channel with my friends. We were idiots. The whole thing was just dumb pranks and fake haunted explorations. Low-effort content, low-effort brains. Me, Jack, Lee, and Jim. Four guys with no sense of consequence and too much night to waste.We heard about the old Halcyon Hotel from someone Jack knew—names changed, obviously, for reasons you’ll understand soon. It used to be the crown jewel of our town two decades ago. Now it was a withering husk on the edge of relevance, half of it under renovation, the other half dying of mold and neglect.But what really caught our attention was the rumor.No one,no one, was allowed to stay in the B Wing of the seventh floor.Not since 2008. Not since a string of incidents that had the hotel slapping padlocks on that hallway and pretending it didn’t exist.A suicide in Room 715.A woman was found hanging—but not by her neck. By herhair.She’d twisted a thick rope around the base of her bun, looped it over the ceiling fan, and stepped off the bed. When the staff finally broke down the door two days later, the room was humid and reeking, and the floor—sticky, wet, and red—was soaked with blood.Her scalp had torn halfway off. Flesh peeled back from her skull like wet paper, raw and glistening. Both her wrists were slashed wide open—blood dried in branching, arterial patterns across the floor, the walls, even the lampshade.No one else was in the room. The door had been locked from the inside.In the note they found, smeared in spots with blood and God knows what else, she wrote:\"My hair hisses like snakes. It whispers to me when I sleep. Tells me to do things. I think… I think it’s been growing without me. I just wanted silence.\"That was all. Silence.Room 712. A man, burned alive in his bed.No known cause. No faulty wiring. No lit cigarettes. No short-circuited appliances. Just fire—sudden, savage, and contained. The mattress was half-melted, the headboard scorched to charcoal. The room stank of burnt flesh and something unnervingly sweet—like cologne baked into the skin before it liquefied.By some stroke of luck, a night staff member happened to be walking that corridor and spotted smoke curling from beneath the door. He called for backup, and with two others, managed to break in and smother the flames before they could leap to the hallway.But nothing added up. There were no signs of what started the fire. No lighter or fuel. And no remains of theman. Just his shoes, placed neatly by the bed. His watch still ticking on the nightstand. Wallet, phone—untouched. No record of anyone entering that room except him.But there was no body. Only a heap of fine, grey ash where a person should’ve been. As if the fire had come only for him, and spared everything else.Room 707:Two guests disappeared.One was found in the ventilation shaft days later, body twisted like a pretzel. The other? Never recovered.There were reports of rituals, symbols carved into walls beneath wallpaper, and odd sighitngs. A child once said she saw “a man made of glass” waving from the hallway.And the final nail in that coffin happened in late 2007.A woman checked in one rainy December night with her three kids—ages five, seven, and nine. Said she was escaping her abusive husband. Staff felt bad for her. Gave her a discount. Around 2:00 AM, a man came in—skinny, twitchy, eyes like raw nerve endings—claimed he was her cousin. No questions were asked. He just walked straight up to her room.They checked out early the next morning. Just the two of them. One giant suitcase. No kids.Housekeeping entered the room a few hours later, and what they found broke something in that building.Burnt black candles in every corner. Ash across the carpet. Walls smeared with something red and drying. Bedsheets soaked and stiff with blood. In the bathroom—The tub was full.Limp, half-sawed arms. Ripped legs. Small ones. Three different body sizes. Burn marks etched across what was left. No heads. Just open, bleeding necks. And carved into the limbs—actualsymbols. Jagged ones. Like someone used a box cutter. Old-school satanic crap—sigils, spirals, inverted crosses drawn in skin.The blood on the wall, there werewordsscrawled in it. Latin, maybe. Maybe not. One cleaner said she saw the letters rearranging when no one was looking. She was probably hallucinating, but it was still creepy.The police swarmed the place. The investigation stretched on for months. Eventually, it came out—the man wasn’t her cousin like he claimed at check-in. Just her junkie boyfriend. The two of them were wrapped up in some twisted messiah delusion, obsessed with rituals and fire. They had sacrificed all three kids. Said they were “offerings to the fire gods” or some deranged variation of that.They were caught eventually. Faces blurred on the local news. But even after that, there was no real closure. Because what they left behind in that room? Wasn’t just blood. Wasn’t just rot.It was somethingelse. Something that didn’t leave when they did.The owner kept it hush-hush. But after that, they didn’t just lock the B Wing. They sealed it with a steel door. Acted like it never existed. No Entry. No exceptions.Until Jack greased the night crew.We slipped in through the back around 1 AM. One of the bellboys—Collin—let us in through the fire escape. Couldn’t have been older than nineteen, wiry frame, hoodie pulled tight over his head like he was hoping it might shield him from guilt. When he handed Jack the key to the seventh floor’s locked-off corridor, his hand trembled like he was trying not to drop it.We crept past the main reception, stuck to the shadows along the lobby wall, trying not to draw attention as we looped around to the elevator. Collin came with us, walking fast, glancing over his shoulder like the walls were listening.Right as we hit the elevator call button, he leaned in close to Jack and whispered, “Hey man… just—just be careful up there. I’ve heard stuff. From guys who used to work the night shift before me. They said that floor messes with your head. Like… rewires your brain or something. You start seeing things. Things that aren’t there—or maybe are, and shouldn’t be.”Jack smirked. “Like ghosts and demons kinda things?”Collin didn’t smile. “No. More like reflections that move before you do. Hearing your own voice whispering from behind. Hallucinations and stuff. I’m serious, dude. Don’t believe everything you see up there.”Then, quieter, his eyes darting to the far end of the lobby.“I once saw a man standing by the big window near the emergency exit. Long coat. Tall hat. Just staring. The steel door to the seventh was locked, but he wasthere. I swear to God. When I got closer… gone.”We went quiet for a second. Even the elevator seemed to take longer than it should.Then Lee laughed. “C’mon, man. You rehearsing that for TikTok or something?”“Yeah,” Jack chuckled, slapping his back. “Appreciate the warning, bro, but we’ll be out by four.”Collin didn't laugh with us.He just nodded, stepped back as the elevator doors opened. “I’ll swing back at four to sneak you out. Just… don’t let itseeyou.”",

      "content_preview": "Remain on the main road.Occasionally, you will see other highways branching off Route 333. Do not take these. When you pass through towns, you may see side streets. Do not take these either.Any building along the main thoroughfare is permitted: gas stations, truck stops, grocery stores, etc. Wandering through wilderness features is also permitted, though we do not advise this practice as it may distract from work-related activities.Do not, however, wander onto paved side streets. You will likely never wander back.-Employee Handbook: Section 4.B__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|Part 4|Part 5Surprise, surprise. I’m alive.That shouldn’t come as much of a shock. How could I have posted my last entry if I’d died? But I assure you, sitting in the driver’s seat, watching highway patrol screech away and the deadly dark clouds roll in, I was entirely sure Iwasgoing to die. Randall seemed to think so.Brownish-red drops pattered against my windshield. They rolled down the hood and dripped from the side mirrors. The drizzle soon turned into a shower, which soon turned into a downpour.Blood rain―that’s the term I wish I could use. That it had stayed a simple deluge and then passed on overhead. Instead, it got worse. The wind picked up. My rig rocked side to side. A red bolt of lightning struck a far-away mountain top.The weather transformed from a blood rain into the thing it truly was: ameat storm.Chunks ofsomethingsplattered against the windows. They exploded gore in every direction. Whole fingernails spattered the ground with the sound of hail. Loose, human-looking veins rained across the highway.I didn’t bother with wipers. There was no surviving this, though I did try turning off the circulating air.Too late. By the time you smell manure on a road trip, it’salwaystoo late to close the windows.  The stench of rotting flesh already filled my cab.It was the most terrible, gory thing I’d ever seen. I should have asked,Who?What people had this gore been taken from? How could Route 333 possibly have caused so much death? I didn’t ask this though. Instead I passively watched the disaster unfold, oddly at peace.Through the roar of the storm, I could make out something wailing through the back wall. The thing in the freight carrier was sobbing.This was it. I’d taken this job on Route 333 to flee my old life, but you can’t run from one thing without running towards another. This was the thing I’d been hurtling towards. It would be easy too. So easy to just sit there, recline back, and wait.My promise to help Tiff no longer mattered. My passion from the last few days flushed out of me as quickly as it had come, because in the end, this was the thing I truly wanted. An out. The end. A release.I didn’t just accept it.I craved it.Across the empty desert, larger body parts rained down. Legs. Severed ears. Fist-sized, gelatinous globs I assumed were organs, that burst on impact like cans of soup. Something slammed against my windshield. A rotting arm with each finger severed at the knuckle.It tumbled away but too late. Already cracks spiderwebbed out from the point of impact to match my side window.Any second now…And then, another truck appeared through the storm.The tempest bore down. The other vehicle flickered between visible and hidden, through sheets of blood rain. Where had it come from? There hadn't been anybody else. The weather had turned so quickly that I should have seen them beforehand in the distance.I watched as their rig slowed to a stop just a short stretch of road away. The driver’s side door flew open, and a figure threw themselves out into the storm.What happened next occurred in quick succession. There was a pop. The cab and front of their rig crumpled inwards like someone squeezing an empty soda can. Their shriveled hood burst into flames but was put out by the rain. The enormous freight carrier collapsed inwards in much the same way, going from 3D to 2D in a millisecond.The entire vehicle groaned, teetered, then toppled to the side.Holy…A pounding on my window. It took me a beat to register what was happening.The other driver. The person.I unrolled my window. A nightmarish, entrail-laden person looked up at me. I couldn’t even tell the gender.“What are you doing!” they screamed through the wind. “Get out of here!”“What about you?”“What about me?”“You don’t want a ride?” I yelled.“I’d love a ride, but I’m not asking for one, am I?”Was this a vampire and a threshold situation? Why were they acting so odd? Despite the storm, and the crumpled truck, and the intestines raining from the sky, I experienced a jolt of fear. Was this the real way I died from using my phone? Had the road set up this whole elaborate situation to get me tolet inthis stranger?I hovered my hand above the gear shift.This was like Myra all over again. This person looked harmless, but they would kill me, or eat me, or any number of terrible things if I opened the door. Wasn’t that one of the first rules? Never pick up hitchhikers.It clicked.“Get in,” I screamed, and threw open my door.Blood and entrails splattered me. The trucker clambered up the side, scrambled over me, and collapsed in the passenger seat.“Took you long enough,” they spat.She,I now realized.She wasn’t a hitchhiker. She’d waited for me to offer a ride before coming in so I would know I could trust her. Maybe this was still a trick of Route 333, but I got the sense there were some rules even it couldn’t break.She panted and clutched her chest, but when I just sat there, she pounded the dashboard. “Go, you idiot!”I did. We peeled out and careened the way she’d come.“It should be lessening,” she said after a minute. “It already got my rig. It should be appeased.” The girl spotted my phone in the cupholder. “OH MY GOSH, YOU HAVEN’T GOTTEN RID OF THIS YET?”She unrolled the window, and flicked it into the storm.“Hey! That’s my―” But I had good enough sense to shut up.Really, Brendon, I chided myself.Priorities.We drove.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Within minutes the storm had lessened. Hefty livers and lungs lightened to spleens and eyeballs. Eventually, everything solid stopped falling. The rust-colored rain diluted until it was clear, pure water. Maybe by the time we stopped, my truck would be semi-clean.The inside, however, would not be.In the passenger seat, the girl dripped with blood. Sinuous intestinal bits dangled from her chin. A puddle of what looked like stomach bile pooled at her feet from a fleshy pouch that had gotten tangled in her hair, and warm, rotting carcass filled the air. She spat repeatedly. “It’s in my mouth.Ugh!”“Do you want a towel? There should be one―”She tore the top sheet from my sleeper bed.I bit my tongue. She’d just been through something traumatic. She deserved to do whatever she―She ripped off the rest of the blankets.“Okay,” I said. “I seriously just offered you a―”“What kind of idiot uses their phone!”“Uh…”“You owe me a truck by the way. You’re lucky I was there to take the fallout for your stupid decisions.”“Well,you'relucky I was there to pick you up,” I shot back.“I would be fine if you hadn't been there. Again. You were the one on the phone.”“There wasn’t any other option. It was the only way to get rid of the cops.”“You werespeedingtoo?”I forced myself to take three deep breaths.Why were we arguing? Here we were, strangers covered in entrails, almost having died in the worst possible way imaginable, and already arguing about who to blame (for the record, my vote’s on Randall). I wasn’t even totally sure we were out of the danger zone yet.“Pull over,” she said.“What? Why?”“Just pull over.”I did, and she retched out the window. She wiped her mouth and re-composed herself. “K, let’s go.”“One sec.”I leaned out my own window and puked myself. We both took another few turns―it was like we’d been holding out until this moment―then set back out, ignoring the persisting smell of death.She wrung out her hair onto my seat. “There’s showers in the town just past that ridge.”“I’ve driven this way before. I don’t remember any towns nearby.”“Not for you, no. Where do you think I came from? I’m lane-locked.”I stared at her questioningly.“Don’t you know anything about how the road works?” she asked. “We’re going my speed now. Otherwise every lane-locked driver could just get a ride back to civilization with a faster driver. I was just in a town an hour ago.”The explanation made sense. Otherwise rescuing people like Tiff would be easy. It also explained why I hadn't seen her rig before she’d appeared in the storm: she’d been in her own pocket of the road I didn’t have access to yet.The further we drove, the more unfamiliar the landscape appeared. We were only about a day from civilization, but I’d never driven here. In the far off distance were familiar mountains, but they were smaller than I'd ever seen them. Hours away, rather than minutes.And the cars,I realized. We were no longer the only ones on the road. Jeeps and mini-vans rushed occasionally from the opposite direction, filled with families and couples. The other drivers had mentioned this would happen once the road elongated enough. It would start filling with other traffic, but I hadn't spent much brain-power on it. That point was still months away for me. I’d gotten so used to the eeriness of the empty road, this sudden fullness was even eerier.“You’re new, aren't you?” the girl asked. “This is all still fresh to you.”“It is.”“I’m Autumn by the way.”“Brendon.”“Well, Brendon, you’re officially the first real person I’ve talked to this year, and you’ve done a splendid job reaffirming my hopes you’re the last person I talk to this year.”“I really am sorry about your truck. Does Randall know about you?” I paused. “He probably thinks I’m dead by now. Hand me the radio, would you?”“Radio? What rad―” Autumn felt under her leg in the pool of liquid. She pulled out the dripping handheld and attempted switching it on. “Uh. Bad news.”__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________The town was quaint. I wondered if the variety of town was different for lane-locked individuals―a consolation prize of sorts―or if we’d just gotten lucky. There was a main street with hanging flowers from every lightpost, and a farmer’s market at a nearby park full of running children. Best of all, though? The truck-stop showers.After my experience at Tiff’s diner, I’d resolved never to shower on the road again. After a day like today though?Despite what the employee handbook says, some rules are meant to be broken.I spent a whole hour scrubbing effluvia and bits of rotted skin from my nails and hair. Even when I was done, I could smell dying carcass, but I spritzed myself with gas station air conditioner and called it good. Autumn had used the rest of my clothes on our drive to wipe herself down, so I also bought an XXL ‘I HEART BEER’ shirt (I’m a medium for the record. It was the only one left.)A few minutes later Autumn emerged from the shower rooms as well.“You’re staring,” she said.I was. “You look different.”“Than when I was covered in literal human secretions? Um yeah, I do.” She gave me the once over. “You look about the same.” Then she stalked off imperiously before I could retort.What Ihadn'tsaid though, the real reason I was staring, was this: Autumn looked undeniably like Myra.I don’t point that out to say I was attracted to her (I can already imagine the comment section. Please. Just. Don’t.), but it caught me off guard to be reminded of Myra like that. I’d finally stopped thinking about my ex-girlfriend, and here she was, on the road for the second time. Route 333 was mocking me.I spent hours scrubbing out my cab. By evening, it looked mainly clean, but the smell was baked into the seats.Absolutely wonderful.It wasn’t like I had eight more days of my trip ahead of me.Autumn didn't offer to help, which was pretty understandable. I’d gotten her truck destroyed, and now what? I was just going to abandon her in this town without transportation. She did, however, show up once evening was set and lean against the side of the trailer. She couldn’t be much older than me. Maybe even younger.“There’s a motel just down the street,” she said. “Not the coziest place, but you don’t have to go down any side streets, so it’s allowed. I stayed there all this week. It’s cleaner than your sleeper, and not all towns are as docile at night as during the day.”“How long have you been stuck out here?” I asked.Her expression darkened. “Take another shower. You reek worse than before.”She marched away before I could respond. This was the second time she'd done that.I paused at the back of the freight before following after her. “Sorry about today,” I whispered. “I’m sure you didn’t ask to get caught in the meat storm. I suspect you didn’t ask to be stuck in a trailer either.”The thing said nothing.I leaned closer. “Do you want to come out?”It merely sniffled.That night was the best sleep I’d gotten on the road. Under any other circumstance, I would have been stressed beyond belief. Could the Faceless man get into motel rooms? What about highway patrol? There was nothing in the employee handbook against sleeping outside of our vehicles, but I’d escaped most of my experiences here by merely hiding in the cab. Sleeping outside of it felt somehow wrong.I gave myself permission to relax. Autumn didn’t seem concerned, and I’d been entirely ready to die earlier. Why should I freak out now?In the morning, I experienced something I hadn't for months: feeling rested. I grabbed an apple from the open breakfast area, and headed outside for a walk around the parking lot. The morning sun colored the clouds pink and orange―it’s always been fascinating to me. The fact that in photos sunsets and sunrises look nearly identical. The only difference is the direction.“Brendon!”I whirled.Randall waved at me from an alley just beyond the parking lot. His face was a mask of relief and fatigue.I blinked.“You’re okay,” he said. “We weren’t sure after you stopped responding. We thought―but we weren't sure―I came straight here. I haven’t slept all night.”I blinked again.He pulled out a radio. “Gloria, we found him. He’s alright. He ended up in Autumn’s town. Brendon, come here. Say ‘hi’, so she knows you’re okay.”I tilted my head.I walked forward to the lip of the side street.“I’m good,” I said. “We survived.”“She can’t hear you. Here.” He offered the radio in one hand. I didn’t walk forward. “Brendon, take it.”“Lucky you found me,” I said.“Tell me about it. None of the other truckers knew where you’d ended up. They told me not to come, but I had to search, and this seemed like the most likely area. You’re really fine? The cargo’s okay.”“Cargo’s fine. Autumn’s truck got obliterated though.”“You and I can go back in yours. She can take my car. Here, I’ll show you.” Randall gestured for me to follow him down the alley.I stayed put.“What is it?” I asked.“Sorry?”“The thing in my trunk, the living thing…why do you all want it so badly?”“I’m not sure what you’re―”“Oh please. That Myra clone was more convincing than your sorry self. I’ve made mistakes before, but I’m not an absolute idiot.”For a beat, just one, Randall looked offended.Then his expression dropped. He sneered in a cold, loathing fashion I’d never seen with the real Randall. “It doesn’t belong to you, Stone-dweller.”“No. But I don’t think my cargo belongs to you either. At least I can take it where I want. That’s right, isn’t it? You can’t come here onto the main road.”It scowled without answering.“Try better next time.”“We will devour you.”“Maybe,” I said. “But not yet.”I pulled an Autumn and strolled away before it could reply.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________She found me behind my trailer. I don’t know how she knew to look for me there or why she was even looking for me, but when Autumn found me that’s where I was. I contemplated the blood-splattered cargo doors.“Don’t,” she told me.“Don’t what?”“You’re a terrible liar. I know what you’re thinking about doing, but it’s not worth it.”“You know what’s inside?”She shoved her hands in a set of baggy pockets. “Management sucks. I knew this Randall you keep talking about. He’s the worst. He really is, but that doesn’t mean whatever’s in there isn’t dangerous. Terrible people can still be in charge of good causes.”“What if we’re the ones hurting it?” I asked. “What if I’m the only one that can help it.”“Savior complex much?”“That’s not―”“When you let me into your truck, you were just sitting there. It looked like you were just waiting for the end. Just focus on keeping yourself alive for now, alright?”How did I explain that that was the issue? That when there was another person or thing that needed me I could put my foot on the pedal and drive. But when it was just me, alone, with nobody…I was about to voice this, but before I could, Autumn shrugged and you guessed it― strolled away.That would get annoying quick.I didn’t open the trunk. Not that day. But I did stop by it before I headed out to rest my hand on the cool metal. “I’ll protect you,” I whispered. “Wherever we're going, I promise you’ll at least make it.”The next time there was a storm, Iwould drive.",

      "content_preview": "I was at work when I received a call from my son’s school. Worried that the little guy had thrown up again I quickly dismissed myself from a meeting with the other partners and stepped into the hall.“Hello? Is everything alright?” I asked.“Good afternoon Jack, this is Amanda calling. Is now a good time?”I frowned. Why was the principal reaching out? “Um, sure. I’m sorry but is everything okay with Flynn? Is he sick again?”There was a long pause before Amanda spoke. “I have some concerning…material…here that your son was working on during recess. We confiscated it because the other children were getting scared. Flynn was a bit upset about that and he isn’t calming down. I understand you’re at work but is it possible that you could come by?”I was already grabbing my keys and heading towards the elevator. “Of course but have you reached out to Rose? She’s closer by.”“We tried several times but she hasn’t picked up her phone.”I hissed through my teeth. I loved my wife but if there is any one thing that gets on my nerves about her it’s the fact she never picks up the phone. It’s like she has a special knack for never being by it, especially when there is an emergency.While I was speeding down the freeway Rose called. “Jack, please tell me you’re on the way to the school.”“I am. Want to tell me what you were up to in the garden this time?”“Look hun I already feel bad. I called the school as soon as I got back inside. I’m just turning the corner now.”I shook my head and let out a slow exhale. A healthy marriage really did come down to picking your battles wisely. “Sounds good Rosie. I’ll be there in ten.”I pulled into the school’s parking lot and power-walked over to the main entrance where two armed security guards chatted with one another. I ignored my buzzing phone and dabbed my brow with my favorite silk handkerchief.I greeted both men and handed over my ID. While I waited I checked my phone and saw several missed calls from my secretary in addition to one missed call from Bob, the managing partner.Oh well. Fuck Bob. My kid is more important.The security guard took his sweet time checking my ID. Normally I wouldn’t mind that. We paid good money to keep our son in a school that cared about the safety of its children. But I didn’t like the dark look one of the security guards shot me once I got my ID back.I flung open the door to the admin building and locked eyes with the secretary. She looked me up and down while her fingers danced across her keyboard. “Amanda is expecting you, she said go ahead and walk right in. I’ll let her know you’re on the way.”“Thank you,” I said.Unfortunately I knew how to get there by myself because like I alluded to earlier, my son has had a recent slew of health issues. The odd thing though is that these issues didn’t seem to have a physical cause, which led Rosie and I to suspecting some kind of psychological explanation. The school psychologist agreed with us and ever since we have all been trying to get Flynn to understand he can get our attention without forcing himself to vomit.It had been a while since he last threw up, which made me suspect at the moment these ‘drawings’ were his latest way of trying to get attention.Amanda looked up from her stack of papers and smiled when I stepped in. “Jack! Thank you for coming by,” she said. She reached out and took my hand in hers.I nodded and took a seat across from her. “I like the desk. You got an upgrade.” I rapped my knuckles against it. “Solid wood right there.”She chuckled and took off her glasses. Her honey brown eyes were soft, her voice soothing. “How are you?”I laughed and looked away. There was a cute picture of a kitten hanging onto a branch that caught my eye. “How do you think? This is what, the seventh time this month that he’s done this?” I massaged my temples. Reminded myself to breathe. “Then there’s work and…everything else.”Amanda tapped a manicured finger against her lips. “How are things with Rose?”“Good. We are in a very good place now.”“I’m glad to hear that Jack. Really.”“Alright well enough of this,” I said. “Where’s Rose and Flynn?”“They left a few minutes before you arrived. Flynn was getting a bit too…how do I put it…”“Speak plainly please. You know me Amanda, I don’t care for all that fake talk.”Amanda folded her arms and sighed. “He was getting…upset. He hit one of the nurses and nearly jumped across this table to get to his drawing. I’ve seen some pretty possessive children but I have never seen one get that upset over their art. How is he doing at home? Does he get protective over either one of you? Does he play well with any neighborhood kids or…?”I rolled my eyes. The fucking schools these days man, I’ll tell ya. The way the administrators talk reminds me of corporate speak. Just a bunch of phony bullshit masquerading as politeness.“Good Lord. Let me see it already. I want to know what everyone is getting so upset about. It better be the worst damn scene imaginable to justify…”Amanda slid the paper across the desk and looked away, but not before I caught her grimace.I grabbed the paper and flipped it over. I stared at it for some time and tried to make sense of what I was seeing. Then my hands started to shake. I wanted to ask so many different questions after realizing what my boy had drawn. Questions that every father is afraid to ask when something like this happens. But my throat was so dry that any words would have came out as choked grunts.“Take your time,” Amanda whispered.I finally found my voice and said, “I don’t…I don’t understand? Could he have seen something like this in a video game or show?”“Possibly. How well do you monitor his technology usage?”I placed the picture back on the table. Left it face down. I wanted it burned but I needed some questions answered first. “He doesn’t have internet access and the TV is limited to what, the animal channel and the history one? Forget what they are called.”She shrugged. “These days those channels have more than just animals or history. But either way, Cera is on vacation so she won’t be available to see Flynn anytime soon. In the meanwhile I suggest you look very closely at the media you allow him to consume.”“Tell me Amanda. What do you really think about this?”“I really don’t know Jack. The throwing up was bad enough. This makes things worse. I know you so I’m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, but to others it looks bad. You told me to give it to you straight so I will — it’s not normal for a young kid to draw something so…violent. And we can’t control the other kids from going home and telling their parents what they saw.”I didn’t like that. “What are you trying to say?”She got up from her chair and walked around the desk, taking a seat on the edge. The late afternoon sunlight made her hair match the color of her eyes. “I’m saying that if this continues we may have to expel Flynn.”I sprang up and got closer than I should have. But I was so pissed over everything that I lost myself. “Are you serious? After all the fucking money I have sunk into this school? We have donated double, no triple, of what anyone else has!” I grabbed her arm and stared deep into her eyes. “You’re not kicking him out of here even if he draws the damn Devil, got that?”Amanda didn’t move my hand away. I wasn’t grabbing her that hard either. Not any harder than I have before. I let go and sunk back into my chair. “I’m sorry…I shouldn’t have.”She came closer and before I knew it she was running her hands through my hair. The way she used to. “I wish…” she began.I took hold of her wrists and moved them away. “You’re lucky Rose didn’t see that.”Suddenly professional again, Amanda returned to her seat. She placed her glasses back on and shuffled through the documents on her desk before handing me one. “This is for you, it’s a record of today’s incident along with my approval to keep Flynn at home for the remainder of the week. Cera will be back by next Monday. Maybe she will be able to help or at least point us in a better direction.”I thanked her and started to leave. But then I stopped in the doorway. “Amanda I’m sorry.”“I knew what I was getting into, Jack.”No. No she didn’t.I stopped by the local pizzeria on the way back home. Nothing made Flynn happier than a couple slices (don’t forget the extra olives) and an old western flick.When I got home Flynn ran and tried to snatch the pizza box from my hands. He chased me through the house and into the kitchen where Rose was drinking what appeared to be her third glass of wine judging by the blush on her face.I greeted her with a kiss and one of those looks that said ‘we have a lot to talk about.’ Then I started grabbing plates while Flynn got us some sodas from the fridge.Flynn talked to us about some new dinosaur he was obsessed with. He showed us pictures on his iPad and enthusiastically explained how it defended itself with its thumbs. In between bites I marveled at the resilience within the mind of a child. How was it that they could change emotions so quickly? Or forget so soon?Was that a blessing or a curse?Whichever it was, I envied my son for that. These days, I felt a growing weight that seemed to carry me further and further into a dull apathy. I tried to stay in the present. I felt more alive there. But at night when everything got quiet, those inner voices got really fucking loud.I noticed my wife glaring at me over her wineglass. I smiled at her tiredly, ignoring those cries in the back of my mind. The ones that repeated again and again:SHE KNOWSLater that night, after we tucked Flynn into bed with his legion of protective stuffed animals and guardian war-tabby, we started to discuss the day.“I’m scared Jack.”“I know. So am I.”“I don’t want him in therapy,” she said softly. “Did I ever tell you about my grandma? How they put her in that one asylum because she kept having nightmares of a man watching her from the closet?”“They don’t do that anymore.”“But the other kids…if they find out they will rip him to shreds. I can’t take that…”“He’s a strong boy. He can get through anything.” I traced her shoulder in the way I knew she liked. “We’ll look back at all of this and laugh someday. Nothing bad lasts forever. We have both been through worse.”I heard her sob. Tears started to wet my shirt. “I just want him to be okay…”I held her while she cried. Then after she cried herself out and drifted off I laid there and stared up at the ceiling fan as it spun. I couldn’t fall asleep so I checked on Flynn, who was sleeping safe and sound, then went to sit down in the living room.I don’t know when I fell asleep.But I do know it was my son’s screams that caused me to scramble off the sofa and race down the hall.I pushed the door open. Flynn was on the bed, knees drawn up to his chest. He was crying and looking back and forth between me and the window.It was wide open.I leaned outside. We live on the outskirts of town, so there is a fairly wide range of view from the second floor of the house. There was no one on the lawn, nor were there any signs that someone climbed up or down the wall. I couldn’t see anything out by the trees either.“Daddy!” Flynn shouted. “It was in the closet! Not outside.”“What?” I said. That’s when I noticed the closet doors were wide open. Some of Flynn’s toys were scattered around. Plushies, for the most part. They were missing limbs, eyes, and heads.Rose ran into the room. “Jack? What the hell is going on?”“Mommy there was someone in the closet who said they wanted to take me into the woods,”  Flynn sobbed.The woods? The woods? I looked at Rose. “Stay with Flynn and call the police. I’m going to drive around. See if I find anyone.”“Are you stupid?” She shouted. “You’re not going anywhere if some freak is out there trying to snatch our kid! Stay right there. I will call the cops.”Rose left the room. I clung to Flynn until I was finally able to relax by reminding myself that he was here with me. Safe and sound. Not taken. “Flynn? Buddy?  Can you tell me what the person looked like?”Flynn trembled. “I…I couldn’t see them.”“What do you mean? I thought you said they were in your closet?”He hugged the only stuffed animal that hadn’t been ripped apart to his chest. “It was skinny and had long hair…”I paused, wondering if it would be too soon to ask him the question I was terrified to ask. But I knew I had to. “Did it hurt you?”Flynn shook his head. “No. But it told me that it doesn’t like you.” He started to cry and between deep breaths he said, “it said…it said…that it doesn’t like you or Amanda.”An eerie silence settled over the room. I leaned away from my son and took him by the shoulders. “Are you sure it said that name?”Flynn nodded.I felt rather than sensed Rose enter the room. I didn’t look back at her, I don’t think I could have even if I tried. “Are the police on their way?” I finally managed to ask.“No,” Rose said. “But I think I found out who the culprit is. Come see. Flynn, stay.”I hugged my son, and followed my wife out into the backyard. It was cold out. A low wind sent a haunting moan echoing into the night. We came to a stop before the garden shed. It was there that I realized the moans weren’t coming from the wind, but from inside the shed.“Rose, what’s going on?” I asked.She looked to the side. Her cheeks were stained red. “I caught the person who has been destroying our family.”I stayed planted. “Why didn’t you call the police?”Rose, my Rose, laughed into the night. “The police? How would they help with this?” Her voice rose in pitch. “Come see what I planted.”From inside that damn shed I heard another moan. I looked at my wife and then at the shed. In that moment, I made a choice. Not one that I am particularly proud of, and had I not been a father, I may have chosen differently.I shoved Rose with all my strength. She hit the shed with little resistance and collapsed into a sobbing wreck on the ground. I called the police and waited there, watching Rose wilt, until they arrived.She was taken into custody and I was questioned. I received little sympathy from the officers and later the detectives. I told the judge at Rose’s sentencing that I wished for some lenience and that Flynn would still need his mother once she was mentally well again.However, the nature of her crime against Amanda was so severe that she was made an example of.It was a little over a year later, while I was at work, that I received a call from my son’s school.They told me that he had started drawing again, and that I needed to see what he had drawn. I sighed. He had just started doing better.I was listening to the radio on my way to his school, and while I listened, I heard them start talking about an event that occurred last night.Apparently there had been a mass breakout from Levitt Asylum. The asylum where my wife was being treated.",

      "content_preview": "Last year, my friends and I decided to do a three-day hike on the Ouachita Trail. Ben, Sean, and I had done multi-day hikes together on different parts of the roughly 210-mile trail before and were hoping to knock out another section before the summer was over. The section we decided to hike this time had a public camping area at the base of the trailhead that led to the Ouachita Trail proper, which we had decided to take advantage of.We had parked Ben’s car at the ranger station near our endpoint and carpooled in mine to the camp. When we arrived, the sun had started to set but the place was bustling. Kids were riding bikes around the footpath and families were sitting around grills, enjoying the scenery. Places like this weren’t really my cup of tea; I preferred more secluded, quiet areas to set up camp, but something about the communal atmosphere gave rise to a sense of nostalgia for the times my family took me camping at places like this.By the time we set up our tents, night had fallen, and the crackling of dozens of campfires filled the air. We ate a quick supper of roasted hot dogs and a few beers before heading to bed.That next morning, I awoke to distant shouts echoing through the campsite. I sat up onto my elbows and listened, trying to make out what was being said. Before I could determine what was being yelled, I was startled by a quick slapping at the front of my tent. Worming my way out of my sleeping bag, I unzipped my tent flap and poked my head outside. Shivering at the cold morning air, I saw Ben and Sean in front of their tents, pulling on their hiking boots.“Get your clothes on, man.” Ben said as he saw me.“What’s going on?”“A kid’s missing, probably wandered off last night.” answered Sean, cinching his boot laces tight and standing up.I turned back into the tent and started getting dressed. My heart sank as I heard the shouts become more abundant as other campers joined in calling out the child’s name.“Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!”I hoped that she was just in the shower room or had woken up early to go to the playground nearby, but I couldn’t help but think of the countless stories I’d heard of kids being abducted or disappearing into the woods, only for their bodies to be found miles away or not at all.Ben and Sean were already a few campsites down from ours and calling out to the woodline when I came out of my tent. I hurriedly tied my boots and joined them.“Do we know what she looks like?” I asked.“Brown haired, blue-eyed, eight-year-old girl named Sarah.” Came a voice from behind us.I turned to see a college-aged guy walking towards us ahead of another guy and a girl who were around the same age and wearing packs.“Any idea which way she went?” Sean asked.“No, her dad said she was asleep in her tent when he went to bed around eleven last night, and was gone when they woke up about thirty minutes ago. Said her shoes and flashlight were missing.”“I’m guessing they’ve already checked the bathrooms?” I asked, looking towards the brick structure at the center of the campground.“Yeah, we checked...” Said the girl, “...no luck.”“Listen, we’re going to head to the trailhead to look while the rangers get the main search organized. I asked them and they gave us the go-ahead. Do you guys want to help out?” the first guy asked.“For sure…” Ben said, looking to me and Sean as we nodded in agreement, “We’ll grab our packs and meet you there in five.”We made it back to our site and threw some essentials in our packs. I realized that I had left my water bottle in my car, but Sean, being the prepper that he is, gave me a spare. Once packed, we strapped on our packs and headed towards the trailhead, leaving our camp set up since it was clear our trip had been delayed.The shouts had tapered off as people began to gather around a park ranger at the center of the camp area. Walking towards the trailhead, we heard sobs coming from a campsite just off the path – a park ranger was sitting beside a woman, who could only be Sarah’s mother, crying into a pink pillow in the shape of a unicorn, while a deputy stood attempting to speak to the girl’s frantic father.We glanced at each other as we moved past the heartbreaking scene. The expressions on each of our faces were of sorrow-tinted determination.James, Kristen, and Paul were the names of our new companions. They were each outdoorsy types like we were and were just as well-equipped.We met at the trailhead just outside of the camp area and gathered around the large wooden map, and formulated a plan.There were several offshooting trails which snaked through the valley; “Main Street” was the eight-mile circular trail which returned to the trailhead and connected to the Ouachita Trail at the top, “Baker’s Falls” was a cutback trail which led to a waterfall four miles from the trailhead, and “Vista Trail” lead up the mountain five mile to the North.We decided that it would be best to split into groups of two in order to hit each trail while staying as safe as possible. Paul and Kristen volunteered to take the Vista Trail, Sean and James decided to take Baker’s Falls, leaving Ben and I to take Main Street. It was agreed that we would meet at the trailhead in seven hours, giving us time to be thorough with our searches and be back before nightfall. We knew cell service would be spotty if not altogether nonexistent, but we exchanged numbers on the off chance we needed to contact each other and ensured we each had the ranger’s station’s number.When we set off, Paul and Kristen headed North at the split and began their arduous trek up the side of the mountain while the rest of us hiked East towards Baker’s Falls. We didn’t talk much, aside from occasionally calling out for Sarah – we were afraid that by making too much noise, we might miss hearing her and didn’t want to distract each other and miss any sign of her.Just before Noon, we arrived at the split for Baker’s Falls. Sean and James headed down the mountain while Ben and I continued on Main Street. It was a nice day given the circumstances If it were any other time, I would have been greatly enjoying myself, taking in the cool air and absorbing the majestic scenery, but, for obvious reason, I didn’t pay any of that much mind.After a while, James and Sean’s echoing calls faded away as we made our way towards the intersection with the main trail. We took our time, listening intently between each callout. The trail began to turn North up the mountain at a sharper angle, slowing us down quite a bit. It was fairly taxing and I found myself calling out less as I began to run out of breath. It had been a while since I had last hiked with a pack. I noticed Ben starting to struggle as well so, I suggested we take a break, after all, we had been going non-stop for several miles at this point.We found a shaded spot next to an outcropping of rocks next to the trail, took off our packs, and pulled out some snacks. We sat silently eating and listening between deafening bites of granola.At first, it sounded like a bird. In the distance behind us, a ways off of the trail, I heard a shrill cry. I stopped chewing and tapped Ben.“Listen… You hear that?”After a moment, it echoed again. A muffled cry that was almost certainly that of a child.We both jumped to our feet and called out.“Sarah!”The cry responded.“Shit! She’s up there!” Ben cried as we both made our way around the outcropping, leaving our packs where they sat.“Sarah! Keep making noise! We’re coming!” I yelledThe cries became clearer as we trudged our way up the mountain off the trail, slipping on loose rocks and sticks. We were getting close.Ahead of us, we saw what appeared to be an opening on a small plateau through the trees. The vegetation began to thin out, and the ground became saturated with flat, rough, gray stones, which were much different than those that we had seen so far. As we made our way to the opening, it became evident that the crying was that of a little girl.The trees gave way to a large glade of gray stones – no trees or plants in sight.“Sarah! Where are you?” Ben called, straining to catch his breath.“Down here!” a small voice squeaked from somewhere in the glade.In the middle of the opening was a small rise in the stones. Once we were about fifteen feet away, I saw that it was the raised lip of a large hole about seven feet across and blacker than night, a short way down.“Jesus… Sarah! Are you in there?” I called down into the abyss.“Yes!” she replied through her sobs.Her voice echoed up towards us. She was a long way down.“Are you hurt?”“I… I can’t stand up…” she cried.“Dammit… Ben, did you put any rope in your pack before we left?”“No, did you?”“No… Sarah, are you bleeding?”“I don’t think so…” she said weakly.“It’s too dangerous to try and climb down there. These rocks could come loose and cave the whole thing in,” said Ben, testing the edge of the pit.I pulled my phone from my pocket and unlocked the screen, but found there was no service. Ben did the same and shook his head.“Ben, get back to the trail and get help. I’ll stay here with her.”“Alright. I’ll be back.” He said before running back into the trees.“Just hang tight, Sarah, we’re getting you some help.”Silence fell over the glade as Ben’s footfalls faded into the distance.“Sarah?”Her sobbing had stopped and several seconds passed before she made another sound.“Please come and get me…” her voice was weak and pleading, “... It’s really dark in here.”I turned my phone light on and held it into the opening. It illuminated a few feet down but no further. I still couldn’t see her.“I promise we’re going to get you out. It’s not safe to come to you right now, I don’t have the tools and I don’t want you to get hurt any more than you already are.”I knew she must have been scared and I felt horrible that she had to stay in that hole a second longer. I thought about dropping my phone to her for light or to play a game, but it might break and be of no use to either of us. I thought about my pack and hated myself for leaving it at the trail. I had a head lamp in the front pocket and some paracord I could lower it down to her with.“Sarah, I have a flashlight and some snacks in my backpack on the trail. I’m going to go and-”“-Don’t leave me!” she screamed.It was a loud, tormented, almost angry scream.“Okay, okay… I won’t go anywhere.”Silence returned to the glade.Looking at the opening and the rocks surrounding it, I noticed something odd. The rim of the pit was nearly a perfect circle – it definitely wasn’t a natural formation. The rocks appeared almost as though they had been deliberately stacked.“Sarah, how did you get in there?”“ I fell…”“Did you fall from up here or is there another way in somewhere?”There was no response for a moment.“I slipped and fell from up there.”There was no sign of collapse on any side of the pit. I thought that maybe it was a stable structure after all.“I can’t climb out, my leg hurts really bad.” She groaned. “Can you please come down here with me? I’m really scared.”I really considered it. Even if the structure was stable enough to hold my weight without collapsing, the hole was too wide for me to brace against the sides and it would take a skilled rock climber to safely climb down with as small as the cracks and ridges of the walls were.“I really wish I could, but it wouldn’t be safe for either of us.”There was no response.“Are you thirsty?” I asked, remembering the water bottle I had clipped to my belt.“Yes.”I unclipped the bottle and held it at the side of the opening.“Sarah, can you see me?”“Uh huh.”“Good, I need you to move as far as you can against the wall, I’m going to drop this bottle down to you, okay?”“Okay.”I listened for movement but heard nothing.“Sarah, can you move against the wall?”“I did.”I paused for a moment.“Sarah, are you sure? This is kind of heavy and I don’t –”“-- I moved!” she screamed.“Jesus… alright,” I mumbled as I dropped the bottle into the inky blackness.I waited for a thump and a cry or it to clatter against the floor, but no noise came.“Did you get it?”She didn’t respond.“Sarah, did you get the water bottle?”Still no response.“Shit… I knocked her out…” I mumbled. “Sarah!”“I got it.” she said, breaking the silence.I breathed a sigh of relief.“Don’t scare me like that!” I laughed as I pulled out my phone.Still no service. It had been nearly an hour and a half since Ben left. I did a quick calculation and estimated that it would be at least another hour before he returned with help. I sat next to the edge for a while, letting a sense of relief and accomplishment wash over me. We had done a really good thing here, and I was more than happy to sacrifice a hiking trip to help find this girl.I sat for a while longer, waiting for the sound of the cavalry rushing up the hillside, but was met with a bloodcurdling scream from the pit.“Shit! Sarah! What is it?”“Peter, there’s something in here with me!” another scream.“What is it? Sarah? What is it?”“I don’t know! Please come down here! Please! Please!”“Sarah, I’m gonna drop my phone down to you! Use the light and see what it is, okay?”She continued screaming.I pulled my boot off and removed my sock, turned the light on my phone, and slid it inside, layering the sock on it for more cushion.“I’m dropping the phone! Try and grab it!” I yelled over her screams as I let the phone fall.I watched as the dim glow of the light through the sock disappeared into the darkness. A few moments later, the screaming stopped.“Sarah! Did you get the light? What was it?”Again, nothing.“Sarah! Answer me, please!”“I got it.” she said calmly.“Is the light on? I don’t see anything.”There was a long pause.“It broke.”“O… Okay… That’s fine, but you’re alright now?”“Please just come down here, Peter…” she said in a whimper.“I’m really sorry, but I told you its not sa…” I froze.“Sarah, how do you know my name?”There was no answer fo a while.“Answer me, Sarah. How do you know my name?”“It's on your bottle, silly.” she giggled.“That’s not my bottle. Se… a friend let me borrow it.”There was no way she could have known my name, at the very least my full first name. I didn’t think Ben had called me by name in the short time he was there, and, even if he did, he calls me Pete.“Come down here.” she said in a raspy whisper.“No.”“Come down here!”I stood and started to back away from the pit.“Down here! Down here! Help! Help me!” the voice screamed changing pitches.I stumbled back and fell onto the rocks as I heard what sounded like bone scraping against stone from within the pit.“Down here! Help! Here!” the voice no longer resembled that of a child’s, no longer that of a human.I stood and ran. I ran as fast as I could down the side of the mountain as unearthly screams bellowed from behind me. I fell again, this time rolling forwards, striking my hip against a stump sending a wave of dull pain through my body. I stood and ran as best I could back to the way I had came.I wasn’t sure where I came out on the trail but I knew which way the trailhead was. I ran until I couldn’t hear the screams and kept running until I met a ranger coming up the mountain towards me at a jog.“No! Don’t go up there!” I shouted breathlessly.“Calm down, you’re safe. Are you hurt?” he asked.“I’ll be alright, but you can’t go up there. That’s not Sarah… I don’t–”“-- It’s alright, Sarah’s safe. Your partners found her halfway up Vista Trail.”He took me by the shoulders and started guiding me down the mountain.“Where’s Ben? Did he make it down?”“Yeah, Ben and the rest of your crew are down at the campsite waiting for you. Y’all did a good job. Really appreciate your help.”We walked for a while before I was able to calm myself.“What is that glade up there, that pit? What the fuck is in it?”He sighed and gave me a quick glance.“Nothin’ that you gotta worry about.” he said with an uneasy smile.We made it back to the camping area and I met up with Ben and Sean who both understandably, had a few questions, however, I didn’t have time to answer them since the rangers were shutting down the camping area and the trails and we had to leave. We packed up our things and loaded my car just as they were closing the gates.On the way back to Ben’s car, I told them what happened at the glade. Ben said the ranger freaked out when he told him what we had found and told him to stay at the campsite until he came back with me. Apparently, when Kristen and Paul found Sarah, she told them her mom was calling her from the woods when she went to the bathroom that night, so she followed her voice up the trail but got lost.Sean thinks to this day that we’re pulling some wild prank on him, but Ben and I know what we heard, what we saw.I haven’t gone hiking since, and I don’t think I will for a while.",

      "content_preview": "They say if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. I don’t love what I do. Not exactly.But I was born for it. And I’m very, very good at it.It’s not a 9-to-5. There’s no clocking in, no coffee breaks, no PTO. You don’t apply for this kind of job. It finds you.And the first thing they tell you — the very first thing — is: Never tell anyone what you do. Not your spouse. Not your family. Not your priest.Not even yourself, if you can help it.But lately, it’s been getting harder to ignore. The weight of it. The screams of it.So here I am. Telling you.⸻I guess the easiest way to explain it is this:I clean up… after things. Unnatural things.You know when a family just disappears from their home? Car still in the driveway. Dinner half-eaten. No signs of struggle. Just… gone?That’s when I get a call.Or when some hikers go off-trail and are found days later — faces stretched in terror, skin blistered like it aged 100 years overnight?That’s me, too.But I’m not law enforcement. Not military. Not some paranormal investigator with a podcast and a night-vision camera.I don’t ask questions. I don’t take notes. I remove.Blood. Evidence. Sometimes entire houses.And I do it well.⸻My tools are custom. They don’t have names — just serial codes. I’ve got solvents that melt bone, vacuums that erase the residue of fear, gloves that never stain.And then there’s the Black Book. It’s always waiting on my kitchen table in the morning.No knock. No call. Just there. Heavy. Smells like dirt and ozone.Inside is always the same: A name. A location. And a set of rules.Follow the rules. That’s what keeps you alive.⸻Let me give you an example. A few months ago, I was sent to a house in Oregon.A cabin. Deep woods. No roads on Google Maps.The Black Book said:RULE 1: Do not look in the mirrors. RULE 2: Remove the nursery wallpaper before dusk. RULE 3: If you hear crying from under the floorboards, leave. Immediately.I followed them. Mostly.I slipped. Glanced at a mirror by the front door — just for a second.Saw something that wasn’t me. It had my face, but the smile wasn’t mine. The teeth weren’t human.I covered it with a blanket and kept working. Didn’t sleep for three days after that.But I got the job done. Place was gone by morning. Just dirt and fog where the cabin used to be.⸻Sometimes it’s worse. Sometimes they send me to places where the walls breathe.Where clocks run backward. Where the wind whispers in dead languages.Last year, there was a site — I can’t say where — that required me to burn down a hotel that didn’t technically exist.The Black Book said:“Each room you enter will add another memory you never had. Burn it before you forget who you are.”Took me five hours. By the time I lit the final match, I was almost convinced I had a wife named Clara and a baby girl named June. I don’t.I double-checked.I think.⸻The worst job I ever had?A basement in Kansas. Concrete walls. Chains. Blood thick as syrup on the floor.Nothing in the Black Book but one sentence:“It is still hungry. Do not feed it anything you love.”I almost failed that one. Dropped my wallet without noticing. Had a photo of my sister in it.I left the house shaking. When I checked my wallet in the car, the photo was gone. In its place was a scrap of flesh.Still beating.⸻Some days I wonder who they are — the ones who leave the book. The ones who know where the horrors are. The ones who created the rules.Are they protecting us? Or just covering their tracks?Am I the good guy in all this? Or just another cog in a much darker machine?I try not to ask. The Black Book doesn’t like it when you ask. I tried once — left a note inside:“Who are you?”Next morning, I woke up with my own handwriting carved into my arm.“Cleaner, clean thyself.”I bled for hours.⸻So why am I telling you this now?Because this morning, for the first time in over a decade… The Black Book didn’t show up.Instead, there was an envelope.My name written in red. No return address. Inside — a photo.Of me. Sleeping.And on the back, just one rule:“Do not run. We already know where you’ll go.”⸻I have a very special job. But I think I just became the next mess to clean up.And I don’t think anyone’s coming to save me.",

      "content_preview": "Part 1Part 2I didn’t sleep. Not after Shaan. Not after the fan’s thin wheeze kept tracing a boy’s last breath through my ceiling.Morning didn’t arrive. It seeped. Pale light bled through the curtains while I counted fan clicks like rosary beads.At 7:12 a.m. the intercom coughed once, reminding me it knew my name. It didn’t ring. It didn’t need to. The rules stirred in my head: It learns your voice. Do not breathe at the crack. Never go to the terrace.I made tea with bottled water. The towel over the mirror had a wet thumbprint on the inside. Not mine.In the hall, footsteps matched me for five beats then stopped when I stopped. I slid a rolled towel hard against the door’s bottom until the draft stopped touching my ankles like a tongue.I was brave long enough to be stupid. I went looking for the extra landing.Between the seventh and eighth floors, a shadow waited: the outline of a landing that had forgotten to be built. My feet corrected it.A black door stood there, its number carved not painted, wet as if the wound wouldn’t close. In front, an offering plate of tilgul sweets—black, damp. From what? From breath.The door exhaled. The hair on my arms leaned toward it. Rule 7 thudded in my skull. I climbed until the real eighth floor pretended nothing had happened.Back in 13A, the diary had edged closer to the bed like a stray that knows kitchen timings. The pressed marigold bled darker, like a thumbprint.Blank pages weren’t blank anymore.DON’T FOLLOW THE RULES. THEY BELONG TO HIM. HE FEEDS ON HABITS. HE COUNTS IN FIFTY-TWOS. DON’T LET HIM COUNT YOU.The handwriting was adult, gouged deep enough to scar the paper’s back.The next page held a photocopy: Kutumbakam CHS AGM Minutes – 27/10/2017. The stamp was crooked, the paper smelled of kerosene.Agenda Item 3: Weekly Sankalp Pooja to continue for “kutumb cohesion.” Resolved: unanimous. Note: Water tank to be covered after incidents with stray animals. Note: Children’s laughter during power fluctuations to be ignored—“electrical discharge in conduits.”Signed: Secretary – Mrinal.Mrinal. The WhatsApp landlord.On the next page, in jagged ink: MRINAL IS NOT THE LANDLORD. THE LANDLORD IS WHAT LIVES WHERE MRINAL LIVES.Below, 36 names. Each marked JUMPED, BURNT, HUNG. Beneath: BRANCHES carved deep.Banyan roots. Family. Kutumbakam.At 1:53 p.m. my phone died.Rule 11: Do not let your phone die inside the flat. When it is dead, reflections get ideas.The black screen behaved like a second room.A second me blinked back—delayed, like a livestream lagging. I raised my right hand. He raised his left, then corrected himself. He looked past me.The bathroom towel slipped. The reflection of my bed had someone already in it. Breathing in a rhythm almost mine.I spoke. “Who are you?”The intercom rang. One bright beep. Then my own voice echoed back: Who are you? Tilted wrong, like a man practicing a new language.The bed breathed deeper, pleased we’d been introduced.I grabbed my backpack. Rule 9: if someone is already in your bed, leave immediately. Do not pack. Do not turn.I turned.The sheet showed the faint print of a striped tie across a chest. Blue bled through like gasoline sky.“Shaan?” I asked, because my stupidity has always looked like hope.The sheet smiled, crease stretching into a mouth too wide. I ran.The stairwell smelled of incense. Rule 13 belonged to 2:00 a.m., not 2:00 p.m., but time obeys the building.The khaki lift operator stood waiting. Eyes too wide. Counting under his breath: one… two… three…I climbed.Between 7 and 8, the black door whispered my name, sweet as tilgul. Behind it, voices braided—uncles, aunties, children giggling until it became choking. Kutumb, kutumb.Three knocks rattled my window upstairs. Rule 10 allows three. A fourth bent the curtain rod like a hand leaning to peer in.I kept climbing.The terrace door was unlocked.Rule 15: Never go to the terrace. The landlord lives there.The terrace stretched wider than the building. Hooks lined the parapet. From each hung sacks that twitched like they remembered being alive.A chauk was drawn in lampblack and turmeric: a banyan tree whose roots grew downward from branches. Thirty-six names on the roots, and a fresh red dab waiting for a thirty-seventh.Ajmera waited by the tank. Shirt neat, cuffs damp with something not water. Tan briefcase open, rows of black sesame laddoos pulsing faintly.“Welcome, Sameer,” he said with my voice. “Eat, beta. Speak sweetly. Belong.”The diary’s warning burned in me: DON’T FOLLOW THE RULES.I bit my tongue and spat blood into the chauk. The roots darkened like wet stone. The sacks shuddered once, then stilled.Ajmera’s face slid like a mask catching on teeth. Smooth marble eyes behind it looked… relieved.“Ah. A breaker,” he murmured. “We haven’t had one since Shaan tried to count backwards.”He touched the red dab on the tree. “We are thirty-six. We need fifty-two. Fifty-two voices. Fifty-two windows. You’ll help us count.”Below, the intercom rang through concrete. Beep. Beep. Children laughed in my corridor. Light flickered though every clock said 2:17 p.m.“It’s not midnight,” I said.“It is if we say.”Something knocked my window four times. Shaan’s figure stood in 13B, tie in hand, counting on his fingers. He lifted a fifth.“Don’t call him Shaan,” Mrinal’s voice said from the intercom inside my skull. “He’s ours. We don’t use small names. We use roles.”“What’s mine?”He smiled with my mouth. “Landlord.”I don’t remember reaching 13A. The door was open. The towel pushed under it like a tongue retreating. Two shapes breathed under the sheet.My dead phone lit anyway: WhatsApp—Mrinal. 1 new message.There were sixteen rules now.16. When you finally hear me knock, open. We are waiting.The bed smiled. The towel lifted. The kitchen whispered my name.The key I found inside the diary is slick with oil that isn’t oil. Teeth cut in wrong places, like it was made for a throat.Knocks now overlap—from the black door, from the intercom, from the mirror’s mouth.Three. Four. Five.The sixth is for me.I am going to open.Edit: If this posts, it means I got something through the keyhole that is not me. If I don’t reply, do not DM, do not visit. If your phone dies while reading this, put it face down and count backwards from fifty-two without using numbers that curve. Don’t ask why. It’s not a rule. It’s a wound.",

      "content_preview": "Have you ever spent years of your life with someone just to find out none of it was real?I had met Andrew when I was 22, working as a bartender for a shitty hole-in-the-wall bar. He was an incredibly outgoing individual that effortlessly brightened the day of anyone who was within fifteen feet of him. He had made the lonely closing shift of a dead Tuesday enjoyable and after I got off of work we met up for coffee and waffles at a nearby diner.The chemistry we had was unlike anything I had ever experienced before and it wasn't long before we began dating. Andrew became my rock that I could always rely on to keep me grounded when the rest of the world was caught up in a squall of chaos. He embraced my love of b-movie horror and I accepted his enthusiasm for the outdoors after weeks of convincing on his part.Andrew was the life of the party and while there were times that I just wanted to stay in and binge slasher movies, he would tease me for being a homebody and drag me out of the house to meet up with one of his Neverending swaths of social circles for bowling, Lazer Tag, House Parties, or his absolute favorite, The Late Night Hike through the forest that stood behind the shitty bar I had worked at when we met.It had been a major milestone for me when I quit the bar six months after Andrew and I met. With his support and encouragement I started my own business in a niche field that I was actually passionate about. While the money isn't best, I love the work I do and even the worst days are still better than having to mop up bodily waste from someone who had too much to drink.At a 40th Anniversary showing ofThe Rocky Horror Picture Show, Andrew proposed to me during theDammit, Janetscene. His collection of friends, who had grown on me fast and became my friends as well, hooted and cheered for us and took us out for celebratory drinks after the show. Since that chance encounter two years previously, my life had become my own personal heaven. The work I did now was fulfilling, I had an amazing new group of friends, and I was now engaged to the best man I had ever met.“Hey, I found the perfect place we should go for a nice picnic and hike.” Andrew told me as I was grabbing the last load of laundry from the ancient dryer in Andrew’s basement.“I was hoping that we could just stay in for the day, Andy. Since I moved in, it feels like we have been going non-stop.” I replied, tired but not annoyed at the suggestion. After his proposal, I moved into Andrew’s two bedroom house. It was quaint but there always seemed to be another little project that needed to be tackled. With both of our work schedules, there never seemed to be enough time in the day to fix all of the little quirks the house had.“Oh, c’mon Christy,” He said, wrapping his arms around me and giving the side of my neck a kiss. “Wouldn’t it be nice to actually enjoy the three-day weekend we have to actually get out and have some personal time together.”“Mmmm,” I moaned as his soft lips and blonde facial hair brushed against the side of my neck. “Alright, I guess it would be nice to spend time together, just the two of us.”Despite moving in together, we hardly had any time to ourselves. The mass of friends were constantly inviting us over and out to celebrate the engagement and to offer help with planning the wedding. It had left us little time to ourselves and the chance to be alone in nature would be nice.“This place we are going to has a nice little spring with a few nooks and crannies out of sight from the main trails.” Andrew informed me as he hurriedly threw supplies into his hiking bag, the mischievous look on his face made my face redden.“Andy, you naughty boy.” I said before playfully swatting at his butt. He returned the gesture with a pinch of my own butt before tossing the bag over his shoulder and nearly dragging me to my car.During the three hour drive to the national park that we would be hiking through I had dozed off, as we finally arrived Andrew woke me with an excited expression.“Here we are, miles and miles of trails. A chance to really connect with nature.” He beamed with a smile that brought one to my own face.“Where did you even hear about this place?” I asked, shaking the last of sleep from my eyes before sitting forward.“Sam and Frankie were telling us about it the last time we went bowling, don’t you remember?”“Not really, with all of the friends we have and ideas tossed around, it is hard to keep track of everything.”“Lucky for you I have a steel cage for a mind,” He responded, lightly tapping his temple with a finger.“More like a rusty bear trap,” I teased as I mocked a rusty trap closing with my hands.We shared a laugh before he parked and we set out for our hike. Andrew had planned a long trek that would bring us back to the car a little before dark. I was glad I had worn an old outfit so that I wouldn't have to worry about getting covered in mud. When I asked about who would be doing the driving back home after we hiked all day and he eased my worry with the promise of a stay at the motel we had passed twenty minutes before we arrived. A place I would have seen had I not fallen asleep. With satisfaction at his call ahead and carefully laid plans, we set off into the forest for our day of just the two of us.“Isn't that the same outfit you wore when we met?” Andrew asked, his eyes feasting up and down on my body.“Yeah, I thought I'd just throw on some old clothes since you wanted to go on an intense hike,” I replied, snapping my fingers to get his attention.We both laughed as we ventured further down the trails.An odd thing I noticed while we hiked was the strange absence of other people while we hiked.“I thought you wanted time together not with a horde of others?” Andrew said as we stopped at the top of a cliff with an old picnic table for people to rest before beginning their descent towards the spring.“Of course I want time without a ton of other people, I just think it is strange that we haven’t seen anyone else while we have been here. I mean it IS a holiday weekend, you would think we would have passed by some other wilderness enthusiast or gun-ho parents dragging their kids along to get away from technology for once in their life.”“This is a pretty big place, we probably have passed by others but just didn’t notice them,” Andrew said as he sat his bag down on the table and stretched his arms. I smiled as he took off his shirt and stretched his taut form. I took a few steps towards him and gave him a peck before I spoke again.“Take a picture with me.” I said leaning against him and fishing my phone from my pocket.As he wrapped an arm around me, I lifted the phone up and took a picture of us. As I went to take another, a large buck jumped out from behind a nearby tree, startling us both. In slow motion I watched as my phone leapt from my hands and down the cliffside to the unwelcoming arms below. With a faint crack from below, I could feel my heart drop to my stomach.“Fuck, fuck, fuck, I dropped my fucking phone. That stupid fucking deer made me drop my phone. Goddammit I could kill that shitty fucking thing!” I yelled out in frustration.“Woah there, I think you might have broken a commandment there,” Andrew said, placing a hand on my shoulder.“I’m glad you think this is such a joke, Andrew.”“I’m not trying to make a joke out of it. I am sure we will be able to recover any photos that are on your phone, plus it was old anyways. I'm pretty sure you have had the same phone since we met. I know you've been wanting to upgrade for a while but haven't really had a chance.” He said as diplomatically as he could.We made our way down to where we were sure the phone had fallen and luckily we were able to find it. The phone had dived straight into the soft embrace of rocks and branches and the shattered screen was more than enough evidence of how useless it would be. Andrew pulled a plastic bag that had once contained trail mix and placed the destroyed phone inside before stashing it away in his hiking bag.“First thing tomorrow, we will go and get you a brand new phone. The best one they got, even if it means I gotta sell a kidney to get it for you,” Andrew said, trying to cheer me up, obviously aware of my disappointment at losing the collection of memories of our life together that had been gathered on my phone.We continued on towards the springs, crossing over an old wooden bridge that created and groaned with every step as we crossed over it. The entirety of the short time we spent crossing it, my whole body was on edge at the overwhelming sensation of the bridge threatening to collapse at any moment.With the momentary hazard passed we found our way to a pleasant spring resting beside a cliffside. The gurgle of water leaking out and falling down onto the rocks below created a serene background besides the rustling wind and crunching of leaves and twigs as we approached it.Leaning forward, Andrew cupped his hand and brought a handful of spring water towards his mouth before sipping at it.“Are you sure you should be drinking that?” I asked, thinking about what things could be contained in that water.“You drink spring water that's bottled with millions of micro plastics in it, at least this is straight from the source,” Andrew said as he splashed his face with the spring water.“Y'know, there is a little overhang here that we could…” Andrew trailed off as he made a gesture with his hands.“I'm not really feeling up to it. I am still irritated about dropping my phone and don't think I am in the right headspace for that,\" I said, noticing a momentary flash of rage cross Andrew's face before it shifted to an understanding look of disappointment.“Well, you should at least try this water,” He gestured to the water as he spoke before glancing absently in the distance.I tried a small sip of the water and the taste was heavy with a strange metallic taste. Just before I was about to comment, Andrew was already stepping off towards the trail.When we approached another bridge, I insisted that Andrew lead the way as it spanked across a rather steep decline. After he proved the structural integrity of it, I began crossing for myself. Just as I made it halfway through, a horrid crack from the wood echoed through the air.As I fell through the bridge, my hands stretched out to catch myself. The nails of my left hand dug into the wood before being ripped out as my weight jerked my body below. In the briefest of moments I looked out towards Andrew, a malicious smile greeted me as I tumbled towards the earth below and was embraced by darkness.As I regained consciousness, I was greeted with the sight of a stag skull wrapping its long tongue around the bleeding fingers of my left hand. I screamed out in terror only to be greeted with Andrew's worried face gracefully holding my bandaged left hand.“Thank God you're okay,” Andrew said, slowly setting my hand down and helping me sit forward. My clothes caked in dirt and a long tear down the right side of my jeans with scrapes and cuts leading to the missing shoe on my right foot.I tried to reply but he hushed me to conserve my energy. He told me he was going to climb back up and try to call for help as he didn't have any signal where we were.I tried to beg him to help me back up but he was already walking away before I could form the words. I raised my undamaged hand to my head and was greeted with a sharp pain on the side of my head and a small wet patch of blood.Panic racing throughout my body, I forced myself to my feet. It felt like hours since Andrew had gone off for help and it was now well into the night. I stumbled my way through the overgrowth and began my slow ascent up the hillside back towards the trail.Upon finally reaching the trail, surrounded in the darkness of night, I looked around for any trace of Andrew only to be greeted by silence. The sounds of wind or wildlife were missing and the only audible noise was my labored breathing and rapid heartbeat drumming in my ears.Dragging my way back to the spring, I greedily drank from the water, ignoring the odd aftertaste. Glancing at a small pool of water at my feet, the shadowy reflection I saw was a skeletal form of myself. I turned away as tears filled my eyes. Pain rippled through my body as I shambled through the dark, my head swimming as my vision blurred.“Christy! Where are you!” Andrew yelled out in the distance before he rounded a corner, coming into view.Calling out for me in Andrew’s voice was an eight-foot monster. Legs bent backwards connected to a skeletal torso draped in baggy flesh that stretched and shifted to attempt to mimic the human form. The swollen and bulbous head had two antlers poking out as the mouth of broken teeth cluttered together in the attempt to form a smile as the thing hunched over to greet me. I was stunned into silent horror as the beast with Andrew’s voice reached out to me.“You…hhhaaaadddd m-m-me-eee s-s-so-oo-oh wor-or-rree-reed,” The familiar voice struggled to say through gnarled teeth as charred hands wrapped around my wrists.I yanked my hands back as adrenaline scattered my body away from the demented form. I ran away, heart pounding, panic and tears blurring my vision almost as much as the leaves and branches that smacked my face as I escaped in a direction that I hoped would lead to freedom.Atop the cliffside where I had dropped my phone, I paused long enough to catch my breath. Leaning against the picnic table was an old metal trekking pole with electrical tape wrapped around the worn out handle. I grabbed the ancient hiking stick and leaned against it before starting back out of the forest when Andrew pulled himself over the cliffside.Without thinking, I brought the brass mud tip of the pole down onto Andrew's amorphous face, knocking a chunk of fleshy clay off in the process.Andrew dropped to his knees with flakes of ash rising from his body. The blob of his head formed into a grainy recreation of the face I had stared into for countless hours since we met at the bar all those years ago.“I…love…you…” spoken to me in a voice similar to that of an animal mimicking the words of a person. Smoke rose from the missing chunk in his head before his body fell into a confusing blend of shapes that I couldn't decipher.Tears streaming from my eyes, I turned away from my fiancé and fled from the forest around me.As I shuffled past the edge of the forest, I was greeted with the familiar sight of the bar I had met Andrew at so long ago. A small group of people smoking outside noticed me immediately and rushed over to me as I collapsed. The last of the adrenaline spent as safety from my living nightmare finally embraced me.I had been missing for ten years.On the magical night I had met Andrew and thought I had begun an amazing life with my soul mate, I had, in reality, closed the bar after an empty night and walked directly into the forest behind the bar in a trance-like state.When my car was found the following morning by the bar owner, she called my phone to see if I was having car troubles the night before. When I didn't answer, she checked the security footage to find me walking off into the forest. Her concern heightened as the grainy video displayed a strange shadow figure at the edge of the trees seemingly luring me towards it.For six months they searched the forest only to find my damaged phone and my lost shoe. The worst was assumed and my missing persons poster had circulated the state but after all these years I was assumed dead.Miraculously, I had somehow survived, vastly malnourished at 70 pounds, patches of hair missing, several poorly healed scars littered my body. The worst of which were the scars around my wrists and ankles that remind me too much of rope burn scars, the implications as terrifying as the monstrous forms Andrew had taken.There had never been an Andrew.I try to tell myself that everyday.But I still have all of these amazing memories of someone who truly loved me and all of the memories we created together with friends.When I have explained the memories I have of the time since I left the bar all those years ago, I have been told it was my mind trying to protect itself.Creating an imaginary world where everything was perfect to shield me from the hell I was actually living.Even as those memories begin to fade and I accept the reality that there never was an Andrew, I still miss him.I loved Andrew.He was my soul mate.When I wake up drenched in sweat from the night terrors of that final hike, one thought still lingers.What would have happened had I continued the fantasy with Andrew?Would I have ever escaped?Or would I still be……Lost in the Forest",

      "content_preview": "I used to work night shifts cleaning an old hospital. Most of the building was empty — a newer, modern hospital had opened in town. The patients left behind were mostly old, terminal, and waiting for their last days.But there was one wing no one touched. Hall 7.The staff that had been working there longer than I had, told me stories about Hall 7. We rarely had to go there, except when we had to get certain supplies. As I was the cleaner, when my supplies ran out, Hall 7 was the place I had to go to to refill.I usually avoided it as much as I could, but tonight I had no choice. My supplies needed a refill, so I went.The stories the staff had told me screamed loudly in my head every time I went for a supply run, so it did tonight as well. The stories of the old man that was hospitalized for a tumor as big as a basketball. His stomach had ballooned so far it looked ready to split, skin stretched thin and glossy, purple veins crawling across it like worms. Nurses whispered it was like watching a pregnant man, except the child inside was nothing but rot.One night, the man rang the bell but the new nurse working that night was so disgusted and afraid of the look of his stretched tummy, that she ignored him.He rang and rang, the bell echoing down the hall, until the nurse covered her ears. She couldn’t bring herself to look at him. After an hour the bell went silent.The hospital remained quiet until the nurse clocked out and went home, not checking in on the poor patient all night.The morning came, and so did the new staff that clocked in. A new nurse went to check on the man, and to her horror - the man wasn't laying in his bedShe found him on the floor. His abdomen was a ragged pit, flesh peeled back like wet wallpaper, the edges glistening with blood and pus. In his right hand — the scalpel. In the other — the tumor.The tumor was slick, pale, threaded with veins that pulsed weakly as if alive. It was round, obscene, a perfect parody of life. He grinned at the nurse, lifted it high, and slammed it to the floor.Splat. Splat. Splat.Each bounce sprayed red arcs across the walls, a rain of meat and fluid.The man had cut the tumor out himself. But he wasn't dead. The blood was pouring out of the wide open, gaping hole. The patient turned his head and looked the nurse straight in her eyes as he continued to bounce his tumor like a ball on the floor. The sound bouncing up and down was a gut wrenching -Splat. Splat. Splat.The nurse backed out the door screaming in horror as the patient's mouth widened. “I’m free now,” he whispered. “I’m human again.”A few minutes later, the man died.It's a horrifying story, that I always dismissed in hope that humans are way more caring for eachother than this. I just could not believe it. The workers that told me the story, were not employed when they claimed this took place. A urban legend.This story lingered - screamed - in my brain when I headed to the supply closet in Hall 7.The walk to Hall 7 was suffocating. The air reeked of disinfectant, pus, and death. With the vents broken long ago, the stench of wounds and alcohol clung to every breath.The stench so pungent making everyone who came in contact with it lose hope.I reached the end of Hall 6, turning right to the corridor leading to Hall 7. Turning again, now reaching the double doors to my destination.Hall 7 was dark, I ran my hand along the wall until I found the lightswitch. Lights turned on,flickering & unreliable. With the supply closet in sight, straight down the hall I began my walk. The corridor felt so long, but that was also the case. It was quiet, only the sound of the lights buzzing.Trying to keep my mind occupied on anything other than the story, I started to whistle the tune of “Stand by me”, a song me and my mom always whistled when I was worried as a kid, some kind of comfort in the pressing feeling of the hall. The windows into the rooms were dark, not operating in the same light system as the lightswitch.Everything was fine, until a loud bang rattled one of the rooms. My chest tightened. My breathing was loud, heart pounding as loudly in my chest.I tried to control my body as I slowly backed towards the wall.Another noise, now a clunking sound, sharp metal scraping on the floor. I was standing with my back against the wall, almost merging together with the concrete behind me. Facing the opposite wall - a patient room where the repeating sound came from , the large uncurtained window dark as night. I felt like a zoo animal, in the flickering lights above shining down on me with an unnerving sense of being watched.The sound got louder and louder, then it suddenly stopped. As I gained control of my body and started to walk away, just a few steps into my escape - I heard a loud thud on the window coming from the patient room. I turned my head - and that's when my stomach turned. In the window, close as can be stood a man. A man with his eyes wide open, staring at me - with the widest grin I've ever seen. His eyes were locked in on mine. He raised his hands, both holding objects. A sharp, glistering scalpel and a large, round, white gooey ball.My lungs burned, my body screamed to run, but I was nailed to the floor. The man lifted his left hand. Something wet hit the ground — splat, splat, splat. I couldn’t see it in the dark room he stood in, but I knew. He was bouncing it. The tumor.That sound broke me. My legs moved before my brain did. I bolted. The lights flickered once, twice — then died. Swallowing me in black. I ran blind, gagging on the smell that chased me all the way home.I left all my belongings there, certain I would never return to that hospital, or any hospital for that matter.I'm writing this, since I need help. Professionally, maybe?The psychiatrist I spoke with on the phone told me that I needed to come to her office for evaluation. That's out of the question, as I'm unable to leave my room.My bed is rotting with me. The sheets are stiff with sweat and feces. Plates of food fester on the floor, crawling with flies that buzz against the curtains. The air stinks of mildew and waste, but worse than that — I smell him.I can no longer work. I fear living, I'm not able to sleep. I take pills - really strong ones but they don't work. Nothing helps me from the repulsiveness, the barbarity of the scene that's been replaying in front of me every single day on the wooden floor of my bedroom. The eyes staring right into mine, the cutting, the sound of the large round ball hitting the floor when the flesh gives in as it detaches and rolls under my bed. Bleeding & crawling in under my bed -  the dead man shuffles around to find his ball. Rolling it out, grabbing &  holding it in his arms as his face turns with the widest grin -  “I’m free now,” he whispers, blood foaming at his lips. “I’m human again.”  And then it's over, for a couple of minutes until it all repeats again. It's constant.I cannot move. I'm living in my bed. To say I'm “living” is an overstatement. I haven't eaten since this happened. I can't leave my bed. I have my computer, my phone. I know that no one will believe me, but I'm really struggling for help. I sit here, tight in the corner of my bed pressed against the wall. I'm living in my own feces. I'm scared, embarrassed, confused.Please, I'm begging you. How can I make this stop?",

      "content_preview": "Maybe you’re too young or too old to know what I’m talking about. So I’ll explain first. Basically, somebody sends out an email with a subject line like: “KEEP READING. DO NOT IGNORE.” And then the message itself will contain some kind of short horror story.Something about how a schoolgirl was pushed down a well and if you didn’t repost it or forward it to X amount of people, she’d come crawling out of your toilet and drag you down into the pipes. Something like that. They all typically follow a similar formula.The first time I got one of them was back in middle school. Not an email, but a Facebook post that popped up on my feed. I don’t exactly remember what the story was. Just that it terrified me enough at the time that I actually did repost it. Something my friends completely roasted me for after the fact. But hey, no demon girl ever came crawling out of my toilet. So who’s to say I didn’t make the right call?Obviously the entire concept of these chain mails or “scare mails” was pretty dumb and juvenile. And most of the stories were so terribly written that they could only ever work on skittish 13-year-olds. But as dumb as they were, they were still entertaining enough to engage with back in the day. It was fun to just fuck around and pretend they were real. Core childhood memories.So this morning I was sitting at my desk, watching YouTube while sipping coffee. My typical routine before work. Before leaving, I did a quick scan through my emails. Nothing unusual. There was an invite to a wedding, a newsletter from my old university, my boss complaining about some bullshit.But right before I was about to close my laptop, something new landed in my inbox. It was from an address I didn’t recognize. Just one word in the subject line.SorryA bit weird. A bit concerning. Probably malware. I barely respond to the emails that I actually have to, why would I bother with this?I ended up clicking on it anyway. Life had been a bit monotonous recently. Maybe this would prove to be something interesting.The message was only a few sentences long. I’ll paste it below.ONE NIGHT A WOMAN WAS HIT BY A SPEEDING CAR AT NIGHT. THE DRIVER WAS INTOXICATED AND DID NOT CALL THE POLICE. INSTEAD HE DRAGGED HER BLEEDING BODY DOWN INTO THE SEWERS AND LEFT HER THERE TO DIE. THEY FOUND HER BODY TWO DAYS LATER AND BROUGHT IT INTO THE MORGUE, WHERE THEY CLEANED HER UP AND TUCKED HER AWAY.BUT WHEN THEY WENT TO TAKE HER OUT TWO WEEKS LATER, SHE WAS MISSING, HER EMPTY BODY BAG FILLED WITH STINKING SEWAGE.IF YOU DO NOT FORWARD THIS TO FIVE OTHERS BY MIDNIGHT, SHE WILL BE IN YOUR ROOM TONIGHT. SHE WILL SEEK VENGEANCE.THIS IS NOT A JOKE – YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.I think I laughed out loud after reading it. I couldn’t even remember the last time I’d seen one of these. What a blast from the past. Albeit a bit more intense than the ones I remembered seeing as a kid, but I suppose that these things evolve over time.I was still a bit perturbed that it had been sent to my work email. But then again, I work at a pretty big company and it probably wasn’t a terribly hard thing to find.The email contained an attachment as well. A single PNG file named “HER”. I just figured it was going to be some AI-generated image of a demon woman. An attempt at a cheap scare in order to prolong the joke. So I decided to humor the sender by opening it up.But there was nothing there. Just a plain, black image. What a letdown.I didn’t think about it much for the rest of the day. Work was stressful and I had to force myself to endure a boxing class afterwards. By the time I got home I was ready to eat dinner and just pass out.After eating, I was lying on my couch, sipping Sangria while messaging this girl, Elisa, that I’d matched with on hinge. I was having trouble coming up with things to talk about, so I mentioned the email. She was about the same age as me, so I figured she’d get a kick out of it.Which she did. She gave me her own email and asked me to forward it to her. She wanted to see it. Just curious.So I sent it over.Then I put my phone down and went to go take a shower. When I checked my phone again, she’d sent another message.Holy shit, that’s terrifying.I messaged her back something like I know right, I’m shitting bricks just thinking about it.But she told me she wasn’t joking. And that she wasn’t talking about the story.Look at the image again. And turn your brightness all the way up. Look closely.It wasn’t exactly what I wanted to read before going to bed. But I went ahead and did so. I opened up my email and then redownloaded the file. Then I turned the lights off and raised the brightness on my phone as high as it could go.I stared intently at the screen. It took some squinting, but I was able to see it.Elisa was right. It was absolutely fucking terrifying. You still couldn’t see much, but you could see just enough. A set of floating teeth just barely reflecting the minimal light there was. The crescent shape suggested a smile. Two eyes hovered above. Both of them were unnaturally wide, as if they were actively being pried open by unseen hands.Immediately I turned the lights back on. You know that feeling you get when you dig into your pockets, and your wallet or phone isn’t there? I was feeling something similar to that. But with an added layer of dread.The details just didn’t add up. Was the email a joke or a genuine attempt at a scare? It was too terribly written to be serious. But if it was a joke, then why was this image the creepiest shit I’d ever seen?Elisa sent another message, saying that she’d used Lightroom to lift the exposure, make the image as bright as possible.I stared at her second email sitting in my inbox before opening it up. And this is the point where any humor or nostalgia was completely sucked away from the situation.The image was still extremely dark, but enough details had been revealed for it to be somewhat clear that it was a woman’s face. Well kind of. More like something imitating a woman. Something extremely uncanny. It felt like my brain was trying to convince me that it was actually a mannequin, mostly due to the paper white skin. But the longer I stared at it, the less likely that seemed to be. Because I’d never seen a mannequin with an expression like that. Something so hateful. So evil. It didn’t even seem possible for any person or machine to recreate.A smile was there, though the jaw was clenched, the teeth pressed tight together. The nostrils were large, flared wide open, each one like a shotgun barrel. The eyes were owl-like, stretched out in a painful looking way. But the brows were drawn down, the skin furrowed heavily between them as if this person were actually supposed to be squinting. A contradiction of features. I don’t know how else to explain it.I tried doing a reverse image search, but it came back empty. I know that’s not definitive proof of anything, but I’d been hoping that at least an obscure art forum would’ve turned up. The picture was just so odd and frightening that being able to connect it to something would’ve maybe settled my nerves a bit.Whoever had conjured this whole thing up was good. Because it had freaked me out in a way that I really didn’t like.I was standing in the kitchen, just mulling it all over when somebody knocked at my door. I checked the time, seeing ten past midnight. Weird. But alright.I checked the peephole, seeing a cop standing at my door. Even fucking weirder.I opened it and immediately she asked me to step outside. No explanation. Just this dead serious look in her eyes. As if she thought I was hiding a body somewhere.I asked her what this was about.“Come. Out. Now,” she said, her voice now barely above a whisper. “Just do it.”Maybe I’d done something while I was blackout drunk? In any case, I obliged.As soon as we were out in the hall, the cop shut the door behind me. She gestured for me to follow her and I did. The first question she asked me once we’d made it outside to the parking lot was whether I lived by myself or not. I told her by myself. She took a deep breath, introduced herself as officer Viana before explaining that she had been called over here to deal with a noise complaint. I knew who she was talking about. A guy named Sam living three doors down from me. Rich college kid. Kind of annoying as fuck, but I wasn’t the one who called it in.After warning him to shut the music off, she’d walked outside to leave when she looked over at the window leading into my bedroom. I live on the first floor and my unit’s right beside the entrance. If you were about average height, you’d be able to see into it from the lot. She said that I hadn’t closed my blinds and that I’d left my window open and that the streetlights were just bright enough for her to be able to see inside. She said that she saw the outline of a figure standing by the door, completely still, as if they were waiting for somebody to enter. She said it didn’t look like a doll or mannequin. That she got the sense it was something dangerous.The entire time she spoke, she had a hand on her weapon, her eyes continuously darting between me and the window.I did remember leaving the windows and blinds open. It’s a bad habit. But somebody would’ve had to break through the mesh screen in order to get in. I would’ve heard it. Sam’s music bleeding through the walls would not have been loud enough to muffle it. Not a chance.And then I realized that I’d gone into my bedroom to reach the shower about half an hour before she showed up. I hadn’t seen anything then. But what if I just hadn’t looked?Honestly, I didn’t want to believe what she was telling me. Because if it was true, then what in the fuck was I dealing with?We were standing too far away from the building for me to be able to see anything. So I began walking over to get a look at it for myself. But Viana stopped me.“You probably don’t want to see it,” she told me. “For your own sake, I wouldn’t recommend it.”Her tone was earnest enough for me to believe her.I asked her what I was supposed to do then. She told me to just wait. She’d already called for backup and once they arrived, they’d go ahead and enter my apartment and investigate it.It didn’t seem like I had another option, so I told her alright. At this point, I’m still hanging onto skepticism. More as a coping tool than anything else.The backup arrived nearly twenty minutes ago and they’re still in my apartment. It was getting cold outside, so right now I’m waiting in the lobby.If anybody’s wondering, no I still haven’t told them about the email. There was just… no way. No way it could’ve been connected.But now I don’t know. I really don’t know.  And I’m not sure what to expect from here.If anything else happens, I’ll update.UPDATE:Remember those creepy chain emails from the early-mid 2000's?

      "content_preview": "The world is a different place at 3 AM. It’s quiet. The city holds its breath, and the only sounds are the hum of your own engine and the lonely sigh of a distant train. I know this world better than I know the world of the sun. For the last two years, it’s been my office. I’m a rideshare driver, and I work the dead hours, from midnight to 6 AM. The hours when the city sleeps and the weirdness comes out to play.Mostly, it’s a grind. A few airport runs for red-eye flights. A couple of tired nurses or factory workers getting off a late shift. The money is barely enough to cover my rent and the ever-increasing cost of just existing. It's a life of constant financial anxiety, of checking your bank balance and feeling that familiar, cold knot in your stomach. But it’s a job, nA few months ago, the app I drive for offered me an upgrade. An invitation to their “VIP Navigator” program. The email was full of the usual corporate buzzwords: “enhanced earning opportunities,” “exclusive clientele,” “premium service tier.” It promised a way out of the grind. All I had to do was maintain a high rating and opt-in. I clicked the link. It took me to a long, dense page of terms and conditions, a wall of text in a tiny font. I did what everyone does. I scrolled to the bottom, ticked the little box, and clicked “I Agree” without reading a single word. I just wanted more money. I had no idea what I was actually agreeing to.For a couple of weeks, nothing changed. I was starting to think it was just another empty corporate promise. Then, the first VIP request came through.It was 2:15 AM on a Tuesday. The request pinged with a different, softer chime. The pickup was a standard downtown hotel. The destination was an address on the far, far outskirts of town, a street name I’d never even seen before. The fare estimate was… significant. More than I usually make in half a night. I accepted instantly, a jolt of excitement cutting through my usual late-night fatigue.A man in a crisp, dark suit was waiting under the hotel awning. He looked completely normal, if a little tired, like a businessman who’d just gotten off a long flight. He got into the back seat, gave me a polite, curt nod, and said nothing. I confirmed the destination, he grunted in affirmation, and we were off. I followed the app’s GPS, my car a silent little bubble moving through the empty, sleeping city.Halfway there, as we were cruising down the main highway that leads out of the city, the app chimed.New route suggested. 10 minutes faster.This was normal. The app often rerouted for traffic or accidents, though there was zero traffic at this hour. The new route directed me off the highway and onto a series of dark, winding back roads. I glanced in the rearview mirror. The passenger was just sitting there, a silhouette in the back seat, staring out the window. But something felt different about him. The shadows in the back of the car seemed deeper around him, darker, as if he were absorbing the faint light from the dashboard. And for a split second, as we passed under a lone streetlight, I could have sworn his eyes flashed, a brief, faint glint of something that wasn't a reflection. I blinked, and it was gone. Just a tired man in a suit. I told myself I was just tired, too. Trust the tech, I thought.The roads became more and more desolate. The houses gave way to fields, the fields to dense, black woods. The streetlights disappeared completely. My headlights cut a lonely tunnel through an oppressive, absolute darkness. Finally, the pleasant, robotic voice of the GPS announced, “You have arrived.”I stopped the car. We were in the middle of a dark, empty field. There was no house, no driveway, no landmark of any kind. Just tall grass swaying in the night wind and the endless, silent trees.A cold knot of unease tightened in my stomach. “Uh, sir?” I said, turning in my seat. “This is the spot. There’s… nothing here.”He turned his head slowly. He was smiling. It was a calm, placid, empty smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Thank you,” he said, his voice smooth and even. “This is perfect.”He got out of the car, closed the door gently, and without another word, he walked off into the darkness, disappearing into the tall grass as if the field had swallowed him whole. I watched until I couldn't see him anymore. I sat there for a full minute, my heart pounding, before the app pinged again.Ride complete.The payment came through. The fare was exactly what was estimated. And then, another notification.Your passenger has added a tip.A massive one. A tip that was three times the cost of the fare itself.I drove home that night with a sense of profound, chilling strangeness, but also with a wallet that was substantially fatter. I told myself it was just a weirdo. A guy meeting someone for a shady deal, or just a rich eccentric who liked being dropped off in fields. The money made it easy to rationalize. It made the weirdness a feature, not a bug.But then it kept happening. The rides became a strange, terrifying, and incredibly lucrative new routine.A week later, I got a ping from the old wharf district. The pickup was at the end of a long, foggy pier. The air tasted of salt and decay, and the only sound was the black water lapping against the rotting pylons below. A woman was waiting, a lone figure at the end of the pier. She was beautiful, dressed in a long, dark coat, but as she approached the car, she moved with a strange, fluid grace, almost like she didn’t have a skeleton. She flowed into the back seat. The reroute came almost immediately, taking us away from the city and towards an industrial wasteland of abandoned canneries and rusting warehouses. I glanced in the rearview mirror as she shifted in her seat. For a split second, under the dim interior light, her skin seemed to… ripple. It wasn’t a trick of the light. It was like watching a badly rendered special effect, a digital texture struggling to stay mapped onto an object. I snapped my eyes back to the road, my hands gripping the steering wheel. The drop-off was in front of a massive, derelict factory, its windows like a thousand empty, black eyes. She got out with that same watery grace, and vanished into the shadows of the building. The tip was, once again, obscene.A few nights after that, I was sent to a quiet, dead-end street in a wealthy suburb. The houses were all dark. A young man was waiting under a streetlight. He seemed agitated, constantly fidgeting. He got into the car with an awkward haste, and I immediately noticed a long, thick lump under the back of his coat, right at the base of his spine. My first thought was a weapon. But the shape was wrong. It was too long, too flexible. As he settled into the seat, it… moved. A distinct, serpentine twitch. It was a tail. He felt me see it, I think. He froze, then tried to adjust his coat with a pained, embarrassed expression. The entire ride, he sat rigid, his shame and my terror creating a thick, unbearable silence in the car. The app took us to the dead center of a massive, old bridge that spanned a dry, rocky riverbed. He got out, gave me a look that was a strange mix of a warning and a shared, cursed secret, and then walked to the railing and just stood there, looking down. I didn't stay to watch.The weirdest was the young girl. The pickup was a university library, just after midnight. She couldn’t have been more than nineteen. She got into the back and didn’t say a single word. She just sat there, smiling at me in the rearview mirror. It was a wide, constant, unblinking smile. As we passed under a streetlight, the light flashed across her face, and I saw her teeth. They weren’t fangs, not like a vampire in a movie. But every single tooth, from incisor to molar, was honed to a perfect, carnivorous point, like a mouthful of tiny, white daggers. She knew I’d seen them. Her smile widened, a silent, gleeful threat. The app led us to the gates of an old, long-abandoned asylum on a hill overlooking the city. She got out, and just stood by the gate as I drove away, her smile the last thing I saw in my mirror.I was making incredible money. More than I had ever dreamed of. I was paying my bills, saving, finally getting ahead. But the unease was growing into a constant, low-grade terror. I was a ferryman, a chauffeur for… something else. And the car wasn't entirely mine anymore.I found that out the hard way. One night, I had another silent man in the back, the kind whose presence felt like a block of ice. The app tried to reroute me down a dark, unpaved service road into the woods. I’d had enough. My nerves were shot. I ignored it. I stayed on the brightly lit main road.The car’s electronics began to fail.The radio, which had been off, burst to life with a deafening shriek of pure, white static. The headlights flickered, then died completely, plunging us into absolute darkness on the highway. The engine began to sputter, to cough, the car lurching and slowing. I pumped the gas pedal, but it was useless. The car was dying.From the back seat, a low, calm voice spoke for the first time. “I really wouldn’t do that if I were you.”I looked in the rearview mirror. The man was leaning forward, his face obscured by the total darkness. “The chosen road is always the safest path,” he said, his voice a smooth, cold whisper. “Straying from it can lead to… unexpected destinations. Unpleasant ones. For both of us.”A cold sweat broke out on my skin. I wrenched the steering wheel, turning the dying car back towards the turn-off for the service road. The moment my tires hit the dirt, the engine roared back to life. The headlights snapped on at full brightness. The static from the radio cut out. The car was fine. I was no longer in control.I made the turn. I completed the ride. I took the money. But something inside me had broken.I had to know. I couldn’t live with the not-knowing anymore.Last week, I got a request. A young woman, picked up from a downtown bar. The ride was the usual routine. The reroute, the silent journey, the drop-off at an abandoned, graffiti-covered factory. The huge tip. But this time, I had a plan. I had her name from the app.When I got home, my hands shaking, I typed her name into a social media search bar.Her profile popped up immediately. It was her. Same smiling face, same haircut. Her profile was public. I scrolled through her photos. There she was, in a picture posted just an hour before I had picked her up. She was at the bar, laughing with friends, a drink in her hand. The caption read, “Girls’ night! So good to be out!”I felt a moment of relief. She was a normal person. A real person. Maybe this was all just some elaborate, weird, urban exploration game for rich eccentrics.Then I scrolled further down her profile. And my world fell out from under me.The post directly below the picture from the bar was from her sister. It was dated the next day. But the year was five years ago. It was a memorial post. A collage of her smiling pictures, with a long, heartbreaking caption.“Can’t believe it’s been five years since we lost you. I still think about you every day. That night, after you left the bar… I wish you had just taken a cab home. I wish that drunk driver hadn’t run that red light. We miss you so much.”I stared at the screen, at the smiling face of the woman I had just dropped off at an abandoned factory, and at the memorial post mourning her death in a car accident five years ago.My mind shattered. The pieces clicked into a place I had refused to let them go, if she was dead, what about the others? The woman with the rippling skin? The man with the tail? The girl with the sharp teeth? Were they ghosts, too? Or were they something else entirely? Things from a place even darker than the grave, using my car, my app, as their own private taxi service between worlds?The money. It suddenly felt filthy. Tainted. It was the price of my silence, my complicity. I had to get rid of it. I had to sever my connection to this… this whole thing.The next morning, I went to my bank. I walked up to the ATM, my heart pounding. I was going to withdraw every single cent I had earned from these rides and donate it to a charity. Just get it away from me.I put my card in, entered my PIN, and selected “Check Balance.”I stared at the screen. My checking account. My savings account. They were both nearly empty. The same meager balance I’d had three months ago, before the VIP program had started.This was wrong. There should have been tens of thousands of dollars in there. I took my card and went inside, to a human teller. I explained the situation. She typed my details into her computer, a confused frown on her face.“Sir,” she said, turning the monitor towards me. “There are no large deposits on your account. The transaction history is just your regular paycheck and your usual small rideshare payouts. There’s no record of these ‘tips’ you’re talking about.”I rushed home, my mind a screaming wreck. I pulled up the driver app on my phone. I went to my earnings history.It was all gone. Weeks and weeks of VIP rides, of massive fares and obscene tips… they had been wiped clean. The app showed no record of them ever happening. It was as if I had imagined the whole thing.But I knew I hadn't. I knew what I had done. I had broken the rules. I had looked behind the curtain. I had read the terms and conditions the hard way.Don’t ask questions. Don’t get curious. Just drive.My payment wasn't money. My payment was my ignorance. And the moment I gave that up, they took the money back.The VIP rides stopped after that. Completely. The app went back to normal, feeding me the occasional, low-paying airport run. The silence in my car at night was no longer peaceful. It was heavy, expectant. I was back to being broke, but now I was broke and haunted.Yesterday, I came home from a long, unprofitable night of driving, and I found an envelope had been slipped under my apartment door. There was no stamp, no address. Just a single, folded piece of high-quality, cream-colored paper.I opened it. The text was printed in a crisp, clean, corporate font.NOTICE OF SERVICE TIER REASSIGNMENTDear Navigator,It has come to our attention that your activity has been in violation of the terms agreed upon in the VIP Navigator User Agreement, Section 7, Subsection C: “Discretion and Non-Disclosure.” All accrued premium incentives have been forfeited as per the contract.Your account has been returned to Standard Service Tier, effective immediately.We thank you for your service.And that was it. A corporate memo from hell. A pink slip from the underworld.I don’t know what to do. I’m trapped. I’m back in my old, desperate life, but now I know what the silence of the city at night really holds. I know what kind of passengers are waiting on those dark street corners. And I know there’s a secret, hidden transit system moving all around us, operating on rules I can’t begin to comprehend.I broke my contract. They took my money. But I can’t shake the feeling that they didn't take everything they were owed. I feel like I’m still on their books. And I’m terrified that one day, I’m going to get a ride request. Not as a driver. But as a passenger. And the drop-off will be somewhere dark, and desolate, and final.",

      "content_preview": "Don’t be alarmed if the road feels a few minutes longer every time you drive it.That's because it is.As the road lengthens, new side streets may appear. Do not take these, however alluring. Gas stations may pop up to fill in stretches of empty desert. Be wary of purchasing snack brands from them you have never heard of or that do not exist. Cacti will show up every few miles that weren't there on your last drive. These are just cacti.No need to fear the cacti.If your drive on Route 333 takes more than thirty minutes than the last time, report such fluctuations immediately. Multiple former employees, who failed to report such anomalies, are still stuck there.Still driving.-Employee Handbook: Section 7.C_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________It was about the time I graduated from undergrad, and finally braved checking on the empty void that was my bank account, that I realized three things:Hmmm, perhaps an English degree hadn't been the smartest choice for replenishing the aforementioned empty void that was my bank account.I could no longer live in student housing.I had utterly no idea what to do with my life.All of those, along with a healthy mix of typical Gen Z stress/depression/insert-anxiety-disorder-here, were probably the reasons I responded to the advert in my mailbox for trucking positions along the Pacific Coast.I didn’t actually expect anything to come of my application, but the company responded immediately and offered to pay for a trip to go out and talk with them―I’d never been to California, so why not?Besides your typical interview questions, the only other thing they had me do was a skill assessment.“All you have to do is take a freight truck to the turnaround point and come back.” The interviewing manager, Randall, dangled a set of keys in front of me. He seemed like a nice enough guy, if a bit guarded. “Not too difficult. You look like a competent boy.”“Don’t I need a Commercial Driver’s License?” I’d actually driven the campus shuttle for two years during college, but it hadn't been a large enough bus to need a commercial license. I’d made that clear on my application.“Do you think you're able to drive a rig of this size?”“Well, yeah, but―”“Then don’t worry about it,” Randall told me.“How far is the turnaround?”“For most it's four hours, but it could be less. That’s what we’re testing you on. ”“So you want me to speed? In a five ton vehicle? That I don’t have a license for?”“More like fifteen tons, and absolutely not. Don’t speed. That would taint the results. We want to time how long it takes you naturally.”The logic made no sense. Don’t speed, but cross your fingers it goes quick?But it didn’t matter anymore. The whole situation was sketchy. This was multiple levels of illegal, and federal prison wasn’t what I imagined the keynote speaker meant by“seize every opportunity”in her graduation speech. I was steeling myself to tell all this to Randall and walk straight out of the office, when―“I forgot to mention,” he said. “Eight hundred dollars in compensation for your time.”Ten minutes later I was in the cab, turning the key.I noticed another man, similar age to me, sitting in the idling cab of another semi just across the parking lot― “Another applicant,” Randall explained. “It’s easier for us if we time multiple of you at the same time.”The other man gave me a friendly wave, then just as pleasantly flipped me off, which was such a confusing series of events, I decided to log it away for later to process fully. ‘Dead meat’he mouthed, though it could have just as easily been ‘Red beats.’“What’s the address of the turnaround?” I asked, waving my phone to show the open Google Maps app.“No phones,” Randall said. Instead, he explained how I would recognize the turnaround point―a red-roofed, unmanned weighing station some way down Route 333―along with a few other basic guidelines:1: Don’t use your phone for any reason, not even for music. Leave it on airplane mode, or better, just power it off. Even if there’s an emergency, use the handheld radio.2: Do feel free to listen to the stereo though. Station 86.9 FM is country if that’s your thing, but probably steer clear of station 96.5.3: No picking up hitchhikers. Not even if they look like they’re hurt. Not even if they’re begging and crying for a ride,especiallyif they’re begging and crying. Really. Don't.4: Around halfway there, your rig will stall and come to a stop. Don’t panic. Don’t turn it off. Don’t get out. Put it in park, and wait exactly one minute and forty-seven seconds. After that, the engine should start back up. If, for some reason, the rig doesn’t start after that time… well, it should.“But if it doesn’t?” I asked.“Hide,” he said. “Close your eyes until it does― but it should.”Okay then.“These are all spelled out with more details in the employee handbook,” he told me when  I (understandably) tried asking more questions. “You shouldn’t have to worry about most of them unless you get the job. Just don’t use your phone, and most importantly don’t freak out when the rig stalls out.”“But how do you already know it's going―”He raised his hands and shook his head to signal no more questions.Eight hundred dollars,I reminded myself. There’s something slightly soul-sucking in the realization of how low a price you can be bought for. Then again, there’s something soul-sucking in being a broke unemployed college grad, so pick your poison.“One last thing,” Randall tells me from underneath the window. “Whatever you see, whatever happens, don’t ever stop driving.”“Not at all ominous.”He winked.I watched as the other interviewee pulled away first―mycompetitor,I decided now that I really did have a second to process his introduction.Twat. After I’d adjusted my mirrors and seat, I pulled out after him, highly aware of the timer in Randall's hand as he shrunk to a pin prick in my rearview._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________The most nerve-wracking part of the whole experience? No GPS.I wasn't worried about getting lost― the instructions were basically to drive straight on Route 333 until I arrived―but there was something disconcerting about knowing if Ididget lost I wasn't allowed to look up my location. I don’t think I’d ever actually driven anywhere new without my phone.I already know what you boomers out there will say: my generation issoft. Wenever learned to do things the hard way.We’re addicted totechnology.To which I’ll respond:True. Fair really. But also you try giving upyouriPhone.The first minutes of the drive went smooth. The highway was a bit twisty but otherwise calm with a gorgeous view. Gargantuan trees―some variant of Redwood I assumed―towered over me from every side, but pretty as it was, the two lane road was practically deserted. No other cars passed me. None snuck up behind me. I flipped on my headlights to deal with the shade.It was a bit eerie truthfully.After a while, I started catching glimpses of the competitor man’s truck through the trees. I’d pass a bend, and his rig would flash between branches and trunks. He’d disappear around turns, but I was catching up.How to get around him? The road was thin, and if thiswassome sort of a speed race, there was no way he’d pull over to let me get by. Maybe another lane would open up soon. Maybe if I honked, it would spook him enough to let me pass?Turns out, it didn’t matter.Just as I was solidly behind him, my truck went silent. There was no sputter of life eking from a motor nor the dying cough of an engine. The gas pedal simply stopped working. My rig slowed, slowed some more, then stopped.I was prepared for this. I waited. In my head I counted.Randall had known. Somehow he’d known my rig would sputter out at some point, but he hadn't seemed concerned. Was it planned? Some way to see how we reacted in stressful situations? I found myself wildly looking around for a security camera.Don’t be paranoid.Just like he’d told me, somewhere around second number one hundred, the engine roared back to life. My freight truck chugged forward, and when I applied gas, it sped up.Alright then.The rest of the drive was blessedly uneventful. I never caught back up to competitor man, but smooth otherwise. At some point the trees petered out to a short stretch of desert highway, and then―The red-roofed weighing station.I slowed down and looked at the time. This couldn’t be right. I’d only been driving for half an hour or so, and the other truck had never passed me. Randall had said it usually took several hours to get here. This couldn’t be the correct place…It was though. It had to be. I was still on the Route 333―I was sure of it. This was the first weighing station, and the description matched perfectly.I pulled out the digital camera Randall had given me and snapped a picture. If I was wrong at least I could claim stupidity, not that I’d been trying to cheat. Maybe that would be enough. I maneuvered the rig through the unmanned station and headed back the way I’d come.Eventually, I reached the redwoods. The world transformed from sunlight back to shadow and mist. Tendrils of fog wafted above exposed roots. I’d be back in just a few minutes now.Then the truck started to slow.I swore. “Not again.”Sure enough though, the rig came to a stop in a section of the forest so shaded it could have been evening. Bugs sped in and out of the headlight beams.Something was off.Nerves,I told myself.This whole thing is strange, so you’re overthinking.That wasusuallythe problem. Overthinking. Spiralling until I shut down. It was the reason I majored in a subject that let me be quiet and clack away on my laptop. It was the reason I got a job on the campus shuttle where I wouldn’t have to talk to anybody and applied forthisposition in the first place.It had been building for months, years maybe, this feeling that something in my life was wrong.Off.But after I'd gone through and eliminated the only things it could be, all I was left with wasme. The thing that was broken was me, and maybe that wasn't something I could realistically run away from, but I could sure try. For the first time in months, while driving Route 333, I'd felt normal in the thrill of theleaving something behind, but now I was stopped, stagnant, and it was all back again.And then another realization:How long has it been?I hadn't counted this time. There hadn't been a need after last time… but it felt like at least a few minutes had passed? Maybe? I started counting in my head.Twenty―Forty-five―Sixty.I gave up.It had definitely been longer than a minute forty-seven. The truck still wasn’t moving. The first cold edges of true fear crept into me, up my spine and snaking around my heart.I waited some more.I swore some more.When neither of those delightfully brilliant options worked, I put the truck in park, cracked the door, and hopped down.Outside was chillier than I’d imagined. Weird. Sure it was shady, but it was still summer. I considered trying to pop the hood of this thing―for some reason, all men, even those of us with no mechanical knowledge, feel a sense of control by ponderously examining broken engines―but for a massive beast like this, I couldn’t pretend to know where to start.“Hello?” I called.In the mist, off in the distance, there almost looked like a figure. Fog rolled through, and they vanished. Did they live around here? Maybe I could ask them for help. When the mist cleared, there was nobody.Hide. That’s what Randall had told me, albeit offhandedly.Hide and close your eyes.But that just felt silly.  Some way for him to distract me from realizing he’d stuck me with a crappy vehicle―either way, I needed to go back in for my phone. Forget the rules, I was calling for help.The handle was locked.I rounded to the other side, and tried that handle too. Locked.Incessant swearing might not have solved my problems the first two times, but no reason not to try in a third, right?The coldness clutched my heart until I could barely breathe. I watched as more mist rolled into the trees, and the figure―it was back. Closer. For a second time, I almost called out for help.Hide.Before I could overthink my overthinking, before I could question how stupid I’d look, I dropped to my stomach and rolled under the truck. Then I squeezed my eyes shut.A set of footsteps approached the vehicle. I started to look up but stopped myself and pressed my face to the asphalt where I wouldn’t be tempted.Another set joined it.Then another.They started moving faster, in no particular pattern around the rig. A dozen pittering dog’s feet, except heavier, more intentional. Frantic. Something tried at the door handles. I could hear the frustrated yank, over and over. They were searching the area, looking for a way in.Don’t look.Don’t look.Don’t―Above me the engine roared to life. All at once the hundred desperate footsteps stopped completely.I wasted no time. I rolled from my hiding spot, scrambled across the deserted road for the now unlocked door, and threw the rig into drive. Within seconds I was hurtling back down the highway towards safety.That’s it,I thought.I passed my twisted test and now I get to return safely and refuse this sick job once and for all―and that was all true. I was safe. Iwouldget to scream at Randall.…Just not before seeing what was behind the next turn.It came from nowhere. I swerved like crazy to avoid it. By the time I even processed what was obstructing the road, I’d already passed it with no chance of slowing back down.It had been my competitor’s truck. Totally stopped. Diagonal across the whole road. And the man who’d been driving it? He’d been splayed across the hood, skewered through by a tree branch the length of a door.His eyes had been torn out._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________“What was that!”“Now let’s not get too excited.” Randall looked up from his desk, back at the truck yard.“What were those things! Who did that to the other guy?”“Other guy?”“He was stabbed by a tree. His eyes were literally empty sockets!”Randall sighed. Not the sigh ofOh no, there’s a crazy man yelling at me.The sigh ofOh great, more paperwork.“Unit Fifty,” he spoke into his handheld radio. “There’s a cleanup a few miles in. Sounds like a messy one. Maybe give it an hour to let the forest-dwellers settle down before going in for a retrieval ”“Cleanup!? We have to call the police.”“We’re not calling anybody. They prefer not to know about these things.”“We can’t just leave him there!”He held up his hands. “I know you’re in shock, but as I said, let’s try to calm ourselves. Yelling isn’t helping anyone. I get it. We’ll make sure to retrieve him. It’s totally understandable why you’d turn back early.”“Early?” For some reason it was this odd, insignificant fact that finally yanked me from my frenzy. As unjust as murder might be, to a recent graduate nothing will ever top the injustice being failed on a test IknowI passed. “I didn’t come back early.”His eyebrows pinched together. I pulled out the digital camera and shoved the image of the turnaround point in his face. Slowly, his expression opened up to one of shock and awe.“You were gone an hour, maybe an hour thirty at most.”  Randall considered. Then he stood, smiled, and stuck out his hand. “You’ve got a job.”“I’ve got a―what? Have you not been listening? I just saw a dead man. I nearly died myself! There’s absolutely no way I’m accepting whatever joke of a job this is.”“A hundred forty thousand base, plus benefits and overtime.Ten minutes later, I was signing the offer.Go ahead. Hate me if you want. But never underestimate what you yourself wouldn’t do under the weight of a six-figure student debt. If you’re going to be unhappy, no matter where you are, you may as well be unhappy and rich.It was only hours later, after my flight home, after I was safe in my bed on campus, and the whole interview felt like a distant nightmare, that I finally cracked open my new employee handbook. I found the section on the one minute forty-seven second incident. Section 9.A. It explained what Randall had, that I should count in my head, not freak out, and usually nothing would happen. There was some additional explanation too.If your engine does not immediately come to life after the waiting period has concluded, then close your eyes and hide. The things in the forest will eventually lose interest.Above all, remain in your vehicle. If you leave at any point during the hunting ceremony, they will know your scent.You will neverrest again.Read more.",

      "content_preview": "I’m sure at least some people will be able to relate to this. My childhood was odd.At the time, I couldn’t see that there was anything wrong with it. I couldn’t understand it when things happened that weren’t normal.I went to school, had friends, and played games like any other kid. I had loving parents and an annoying sister, just like many other kids my age did. My grandparents, aunts and uncles would often visit.I didn’t like when my grandmother came. She was a strict woman and honestly, she scared me. I can remember vividly one summer she came over. She looked my sister and I up and down. Then turned to my father and asked, “What about the other one? I thought you said get it over with and end this farce.”He pulled her aside and told my sister and I to go play outside. She left that night and never came to visit again.There were so many things that I never learned should be questioned. I never comprehended that they were something I should question.Most of them felt small at the time. We had a picture of our family tree in our hallway - a long line of sibling pairs as far back as anyone remembered. And yet by each of them was space for a third. My mother would bring in extra groceries every trip and sometimes set an extra plate at dinner, then quietly put it away again.But there was one rule that we were never to break.We weren’t allowed to speak at home. Rather, we weren’t allowed to raise our voices above a whisper.Whether in anger, laughter, or even by accident, loudness in general was treated as taboo as soon as we set foot on the driveway.On the few occasions we raised our voices, our father’s anger always fell hardest on me. My sister cried, but she was spared. I didn’t understand why my mother never comforted either of us until much later, and it cost me far more than I would’ve been willing to trade.I really want to emphasize that this was always the norm to me. I didn’t understand what it meant. I didn’t know I should be worried or scared.Despite this, like I mentioned earlier, I did have a good childhood. My parents truly loved us both, and it was rare that we got into trouble. I had a lot of friends at school, and I’d often spend the majority of my day at one of their houses - playing PS2 or taking advantage of their trampoline, which I had always been envious of.My dad didn’t like it. Any time I wanted to get permission for a playdate or a sleepover, I would ask my mom. This would be followed by tense, coarse whispers between the two of them in their room. Sometimes they’d let me, other times not.Hindsight truly is a taunting thing. I can’t tell you how many nights I’ve spent laying awake wishing my dad had won those hushed arguments. I wish to myself as I toss and turn that I hadn’t been born to my parents, that I hadn’t been born at all.But even more vicious than hindsight is the past itself. It stands with absolute resoluteness. It is unchangeable and unforgettable. A wound that never heals until the day the afflicted passes away.Siblings are supposed to be mean to each other when they're young. It’s part of how they grow up - how they learn social skills. So when my friend suggested that we scare my sister during a sleepover, I was immediately on board.I wasn’t allowed to have friends over at our house, but I told them I could record it all and show them the next day. I was beyond excited to have something to rub in my sister’s face. She was the eldest, and I wanted to get the upper hand on her for once.As any little girl would, she screamed when she saw the rubber snake under her pillow. It wasn’t a long scream - she covered her mouth with her hands almost as soon as it left her lips - but it was enough.There was a moment of silence right after she screamed that felt never ending. Then my parents ran into the room. They saw her, mouth still covered and eyes wide with terror, then the toy snake on her bed.My father cursed under his breath before scooping up my sister into his arms.My mother looked like she was going to cry, her eyes darted down even before the noises began.Scratching.Something was scratching the wooden floor underneath our feet.Light at first - soft. Almost as if it was asking to be let in politely. Then louder.Louder and louder until it was violently clawing away the wood like tissue paper.The boards bent first, bowing upward as if the house itself were breathing. Then they split, splinters flying, and something began to crawl through.When my father saw what had emerged from below our feet, he set my sister down and stepped away. All he said was, “I’m sorry.”He didn’t sound angry. He didn’t sound afraid. Just tired. Like he’d been waiting for this. As if he had expected it.It was small. We had raccoons in our backyard that my sister and I would try to catch. At that moment, that’s the only size comparison that I could think of.It crawled on its hands and knees, bloated and red as if its skin was being pulled taut over too much of its own body. A putrid, fleshy cord dangled over its shoulders, coiling around its neck before disappearing into its own swollen belly.How could something so sickly, so small, be so strong?Its eyes locked onto my sister and I jumped between the two. My mother cried out, “No!”Before either of my parents could move, the rotten child seized my ankle and hurled me across the room as if I were a toy soldier. I hit the wall and my mom came to pick me up - both shielding and restraining me.But even if I had broken free, it wouldn’t have mattered. In seconds, it had her. My sister’s nails scraped across the floorboards, her muffled cry cut short as the thing dragged her into the hole below.I heard her scream again - but this time, it wasn’t her hands that silenced it.The sound of flesh being torn from sinew. Ligaments snapping. Bones breaking. Then her voice called again.“Mom….Dad…”It pulled itself back up from the darkness. The sight of it now forced me to vomit on the floor.It was bigger, but wrong. Its arms and legs were uneven, its hands a clutter of mismatched fingers, as though it had been playing with bones the way a child plays with toys - jamming them into place, trying to look like my sister.Patches of her brown hair sprouted from swollen, red skin, clumps of it slick with blood.Her white teeth were crammed into its grey gums, sharp and uneven, like butcher knives buried in raw meat.But worst of all were the eyes. They were her eyes. I could still see the fear they held only moments ago. The betrayal and terror she had experienced.My father scooped my sister up in his arms and carried her out of the room. I could hear her monstrous, joyful cries as she tried to use her new, stolen voice.The rest of my childhood was spent pretending - pretending the monster had always been my sister. Pretending that her laugh was hers, that her smile was hers.I was punished more harshly for mistreating her than I ever was for breaking the rule of silence.I moved out when I turned sixteen, and continued my game of pretend.I pretended my childhood never happened, that I was a normal man with a normal past and a normal family.Only one thing brings me comfort now. No matter how much my parents beg and plead and yell and berate - I will never have children.This ends with me. And it ends with her.",

      "content_preview": "When I was younger, I had this friend named Bats.I met her at a janky little carnival that was only in town for one weekend. At the time, I’d been in the police academy for two weeks, and another cadet had taken me there on a date.There was nothing wrong with the guy, especially compared to my last boyfriend. But it felt wrong. As the date stretched on and night fell, I realized I didn’t want to be there with him. I didn’t want to be there at all. I wasn’t ready. Not for the date, or the way he kept leaning in, and definitely not for the way he kept looking at me.And that’s because of Jason.Jason was my last boyfriend. One night, about two years prior to that evening at the janky carnival, we went to bed. In the morning, I woke up.Jason didn’t.He was a side sleeper. When he died, that side of his face folded into rills, almost like a curtain rolling upward. It froze that way. That was bad. The emptiness of him was worse.Under the best of circumstances, there’s this quality, a hollow, asymmetrical slackness that's unique to death. The morning I woke up and he didn’t, that’s how he looked. Hollow, asymmetrical, and slack.That’s how I remember him, no matter how hard I try to change it.So fast forward a few years to that rundown carnival.As night fell, I started losing it. By the time the stars came out, I couldn’t look at my date without seeing his face as though he were dead: slack and hollow, with cold skin rilled up like a curtain call.He didn’t notice because he was fixated on a game booth. Among the array of prizes was this gigantic stuffed dragon that he was hellbent on winning for me. I should have been flattered. I should have been having fun.But I couldn’t have fun, not with the way his face kept going slack. Not with the way his eyes kept clouding up. Not with the way the side of his face kept rolling up like a flesh curtain.Watching him play this shitty carnival game for that shitty stuffed animal under the blazing lights was too much. Too much light, too much noise, too much greasy funnel cake smell coating my throat every time I breathed in, too much him, and far, far too much me.Just  as he finally won that stuffed dragon, I started crying.It was the worst kind of crying too, the kind where tears come before you even know you’re sad.And even though it makes no sense, I panicked. I didn’t want him to see me cry. Couldn’t stand for him to see. That was the only thought in my head:I can’t let him see.So I spun around as tears fell and the lights broke open and flooded the world the way things do when you cry, and stumbled away.Of course, he came after me. Why wouldn't he?I started running.Three seconds later I collided with someone so hard I actually ricocheted a little, and I burst into tears.The next thing I knew, the lady I’d run into was holding me tight and telling my poor date to fuck off before she called the cops.“I am the cops,” he said.That made me laugh, but I was crying so hard it sounded like a sob. That sent my savior into overdrive. Every cop-related slur on this earth erupted out of her, so loud she drew a crowd. Or maybe the funnel cake stand was drawing the crowd with its sticky sweet grease smell, and she was just the entertainment.She screamed until my date finally left.It was impressive. It was also embarrassing when, about two minutes later, I felt the need to tearfully confess that I was also a cop.She patted my back, bracelets jangling as they caught the lights. “All cops are bastards, including you. But bastards need friends too, especially little ones who still have time to grow and shed their bastard skins.”“What?” I asked nervously.She pinched the sleeve of my jacket and pulled upward. Her face lit up so brightly that I was sure she was mocking me. “Look! Your bastardness isn’t even a skin yet. It’s still a coat, which means there’s plenty of time to fix you. I bet the mirror would prove it.”“What mirror?”“The mirror in my favorite place in the world, which is a shitty little night club. It and the mirror are magic. It shows you who you really are on the inside. Want to come see?”“No.\"“Good, because you’re not ready, and when you’re not ready, the mirror drives you insane. I’ve seen it. We’ve got to fix you first. So let’s get fixing.”And that’s how I met Bats.So as a kid, I always felt like I’d been born with a moat around me.In my mind’s eye, this moat was huge and deep, full of jagged rocks waiting to kill you if you tried to dive, and circling sharks ready to eat you if you tried to swim. It felt like the water was lapping closer every day, threatening to wash the ground out from under my feet and carry me out to the sharks and the rocks. I felt like I either had to wait to drown, or take a running leap and pray I’d jumped high enough to clear the moat and reach the solid ground on the other side.And I did exactly that...but barely.In my imagination, I was pinwheeling for balance on the edge of the moat while soft ground crumbled under my feet, threatening to spill me into the water.I still feel like I’m pinwheeling.Anyway, I think Bats had been born with that same moat, but she didn’t try to jump across. Somehow she just danced on the water, dodging rocks and sharks like it was nothing.I don't even know what I'm trying to express here, except to say that Bats was everything I wanted to be, which is everything I’ll never be.Bats was lanky and somehow withered even though she wasn’t much older than me. She had dark hair and eyes that were almost yellow. In low light, they were bright as molten gold. She wore stacks of antique bracelets and billowing bright scarves that contrasted with her clothes, which were mostly black and generally outrageous. Her voice carried the telltale rasp of someone who’s played a little too often with substances, and her laugh was grating but wonderful. She worked the dish pit at a chain restaurant and lived two blocks from me.Her apartment was a cluttered riot of color and light. She hated lamps, so string lights in every shape and color crisscrossed the ceiling and the walls like giant spiderwebs.Her place wasn’t just cluttered with light and junk. It was cluttered with people, too. Young, old, wealthy, homeless, whole, broken — people of every kind, whose only commonality was that they belonged to Bats somehow.I became one of them.When Bats decided you were hers, she never let you go. Some people love you by putting you at peace. Others love you by breaking you open.Bats broke me open.She was the first person to notice I had an eating disorder. She didn’t shame me for it or romanticize or fetishize it, either. What she did was ask what my favorite cookies were.“Oatmeal,” I said.“Fucking gross,” she answered.Instead of oatmeal cookies, she baked a giant batch ofherfavorite: double chocolate chili cookies, and made me eat.It worked. It shouldn’t have. It wouldn’t have if Bats hadn’t made them. But she did.So it worked.Don’t get me wrong. Bats was far from perfect.People who collect human problems always have problems of their own. Bats was no exception. One of the ways her problems manifested was by treating some of the people she broke open like they were pets.She treated me like a pet she wanted to train. It’s probably not a surprise, but her training methods were weird as hell. Most of them focused on what she called my “bastard coat.”“Bastard coats are the outsides we put on to disguise our insides,” she told me. “But the problem with bastard coats is they eventually replace your insides. We have to teach you how to shed your bastard coat and wear your insides out before you become a bastard forever.”Weirdly, she kept dangling the promise of her favorite club —the one with the supposed magic mirror — over me like a reward.“Once you shed your bastard coat, I’ll take you to the club to see who you really are in the mirror. I promise.”But see, I didn’t care.Only Bats could think standing in front of an antique mirror at a crappy club was a reward. For that matter, only Bats would think of survival — because that’s what the police academy was for me, survival — as a bastard coat.And only Bats would make it her mission to change someone like me into someone like her solely through the power of love.I’ll be honest:I used her.The care that she showed me — the love she gave as freely as breathing — was something I’d literally never experienced. It was like a drug. Itwasa drug.I became a junkie.I had no intention of doing any of the things she wanted me to do. Breaking myself down and putting myself back together. Changing my life path, leaving the academy. Shedding my bastard coat and wearing my insides out. I literally didn’t even know what she meant when she said these things.But pretending was the price of her adoration, so I pretended.I shouldn’t have, and not just for her sake. For mine, too. The way she treated me reminded me of Jason. Like him, she was always pushing me to be something I wasn’t. Pressing me to be what she thought I was, instead of learning who I was.But I didn’t care.Not when she baked entire batches of chocolate chili cookies for me to graze on through the day. Not when she rearranged her shifts to pick me up after work so I wouldn’t have to walk home alone. Not when she told me that underneath my bastard coat, I was the sweetest person alive. Not when she told me there was nothing I could do to make her let go of me. Not even when she exerted every bit of power she had over me to make me to stay in her dark, bright, cluttered apartment with her other problem people.Soon I spent more nights at her apartment than mine, curled up in a blanket nest on her bedroom floor under a web of purple string lights.I wasn’t the only one. At any given time, there were several other people crashing on her couch or her floor. She was closer to all of them than to me.Just as an example, she took these other friends out every night. They always went to the club with the magic mirror that supposedly reflected who you really are inside. The mirror I wasn’t ready for.And I wouldn’t even have been able to go. I had to be up at six every morning for the academy, and six is about the time Bats finally stumbled home after her nights out.But that’s not what mattered. What mattered was she was the person I was closest to, butIwasn’t the personshewas closest to.Bats was the only person I’d ever been able to spill my heart to, but she was the kind of person who spilled her heart to everyone. So she was special to me. I wasn’t as special to her, though.We all eventually learn that we don’t mean everything to someone who means everything to us. I’m pretty sure most people learn that as kids. But this was my first time, so I kind of hated Bats for connecting with everyone the way she connected with me.Still, there wasn’t enough hatred in the world to make me give up the love she gave.So I contented myself with the role of her little pet.Here’s the good thing about that: People don’t want anything from pets except good behavior. Up until that point, everyone I’d ever been close to had wanted something from me, whether I knew it or not. But all Bats wanted was good behavior. At the end of the day, good behavior is a performance. It’s just pretend.I pretended, and got the kind of love no one else ever gave me in return.That didn’t stop the jealousy.And I was so jealous.I was jealous of the other people Bats loved, of course. But mostly I was jealous of Bats because in every way that mattered, she was who I wanted to be.I told her that once.She laughed and threw her arms around me. “Underneath your bastard coat, you’re exactly like me, stupid. Why do you think I put up with your bastardness? It’s because I know who you really are.”“Sure.”“It’s true! You can’t spell ‘bastard’ without ‘bats,’ you know. You just have to pull out the extra letters and rearrange what’s left.” She smiled and drew me in for a hug. “Just like you have to shed your bastard coat and rearrange what’s underneath. Outside you’re definitely a bastard. But inside, you’re definitely a bat. You’ll see once I turn you inside out.”None of that makes sense now, but it made sense to me back then.What also made sense was my fear.Maybe Iwasa bat inside, but I was more than my insides. I was my outsides, too. We all are. And Ineededevery last one of those extra letters that grewbatintobastard. Ineededmy bastard coat. What I knew — and what I could never tell her without risking her love — was that the world is safe for bastards. It isn’t safe for bats.And more than anything, I wanted to be safe. That’s why I loved Bats so much: Because she made me feel safe.Except when she talked about her favorite club and its creepy mirror.I don’t know why it bothered me so much, but it did. It even got to the point where any talk of that club kind of scared the shit out of me.According to Bats, this club was only for people who’d accepted who they really were. The bouncers were good at figuring that out (“Creepy good,” Bats told me, “and trust me, I know because one of them loves me”).But just to make sure, they brought every new patron to the Mirror Room first. The mirror in the Mirror Room was magic, and it reflected who you really were. If your reflection matched your outsides, you were good. But if you didn’t know who you were, the reflection came out wrong.And when that happened, it drove you crazy.It sounds like a particularly stupid urban legend, but Bats swore up and down that it was true. “It’ll drive you crazy. I’ve seen it. That’s why I can’t bring you to the club yet. I can have a bastard in my house, but I can’t have acrazybastard. So you have to wait until you can wear your insides out.”I know this all sounds insane.But it all starts to make more sense when you understand that Bats had a chronic substance abuse problem. She functioned pretty well, but you could always tell when she was high. One of her tells was that she wouldn’t shut up about this mirror.Finally I got sick of it, and one night on her way out to the mirror club with her friends she was actually close to - the friends who were actually her friends, not her pets - asked to come along.She told me no. “It’s a place for people who have accepted who they are. And you, my little bastard, are nowhere close.”Then she kissed the top of my head while her friends who were friends and not pets tittered. Then they all trouped out in a cloud of scarves and body glitter and shimmering eyeshadow.No matter what I said, I wanted to go with them.But I couldn't.The biggest problem I had - the real problem - is that people like Bats ruin the lives of people like me.I grew up as a trailer trash foster kid with no past and no future. Just another dead end kid trapped  in the center of a deadly moat. A kid who had to decide whether to drown, or take a running leap and pray to God I cleared the water.I’d taken the leap.I’d cleared the water, but barely.Just barely.My heels are still stuck in the bank, and it's crumbling beneath my feet while I pinwheel for balance.Bats, meanwhile, was dancing on the water behind me, calling for me because she thought I was like her, that I was born to dance on the water too. But she only thought that because I pretended so well. Because I wore good behavior as surely as I wore my bastard coat.That was the real problem, the true problem:No matter what Bats thought, I was nothing like her.And as I watched her and her friends who weren’t pets vanish into the night, I knew it.They were bats, fragile and unsafe, winging through the night. I was a bastard, safe and warm and armored in my coat.Or at least that’s what I told myself as I microwaved dinner and went to bed.I dreamed of her club that night.In the dream, tall shadows with blue eyes like stars stalked a bottomless pit that echoed with atonal music and the low, awful laughter that has, for my entire life, suffused my nightmares.I woke as Bats stumbled into the apartment, smiling and glittering and smeared with makeup, her outfit pasted to her skin with sweat. A cloud of perfume trailed behind her, settling over me as she stepped over my blanket bed.I watched her, feeling like a particularly stupid, ugly little girl.She saw me watching. Bats always saw me, even when I didn’t want her to.Finally she dropped down beside me, a glittering phantom, and stroked my hair.“It was an amazing night,” she said. “I wish you’d been there. And you will be soon. You’re so close to shedding your bastard coat. Then I can turn you inside out, and you can finally be you.”She was wrong.Weeks bled into each other. I grew more confident. My academy graduation drew closer. I made friends with other people who had taken the running leap to clear their moats. People who encouraged me, people who liked me. The ground beneath my feet stopped crumbling quite so fast.And my bastard coat got heavier by the day.Sometimes in my nightmares, I actually saw that coat. It always melted into my skin and settled over my bones. Instead of me wearing my insides out, my coat was wearing its way inside.One day after work, my sergeant walked me out to my car. She saw Bats waiting for me and said, “Take it from me: People like her will ruin your career.”That made me angry. It was so unfair. So untrue.Except maybe it was true.Maybe I knew it.And maybe that’s why I clung to Bats — because I wanted her to dance up and pull me off the crumbling bank and into the shark-infested moat.Except I didn’t want that. I didn’t.So I began the process of un-clinging.Only Bats didn’t allow it.I’m not saying that’s healthy. I’m just saying that’s how she was.And I lapped it up, like always.I couldn’t help it. I felt at peace when I was with her. I felt loved. I felt like I was home.I wasn’t, and IknewI wasn’t. But I pretended. Sometimes pretending is all we get.So I pretended Bats was my family. Actually, that’s not completely true. Shewasmy family, or at least the closest thing I had. But I pretended I was her family, too. And that really was pretend. Bats loved me, but she didn’t love me like family. She didn't love me best. She just loved me like she loved everyone else.But that was more than I’d ever had, and I took it without giving anything back except fake good behavior.A few weeks later, I graduated my academy. Bats refused to come to the ceremony on principle — “that’s too many bastards in one place for me, the smell alone would kill me —” but she took me to mini golf after.She was high and the sky was a blazing, hazy, smoggy riot of color so beautiful it could’ve come out of a nightmare. Everything was hot as hell and miserable until the sun went down, at which point it turned hot as hell and perfectly pleasant. Like the air was a warm bath.After our game, we bought the biggest drinks we could at the 7-11 and wandered to the park, where we laughed and yelled and danced like we were drunk. We weren’t, not at all. Except we were.Once we slurped the last of our soda and crunched the last pieces of sugar-stained ice, we plopped down on the grass and looked up at the sky. There were no stars because of light pollution, but we pretended.She said, “I’m taking you to the club tonight.”“Why?”“Because right this very minute, your bastard coat is slipping off and your insides are shining through. You have to see for yourself. Then you’ll shed your coat for good.”She pulled me to my feet and led me home, where she issued instructions: “Dress however you want. But leave your bastard coat open so everyone can see who you really are underneath.”I don’t remember what I wore, only that the night was so oppressively hot that I sweated through them immediately. But not in a way that made me feel disgusting.In a way that made me feel like I was sparkling.When we reached the club, there was a line winding down the sidewalk. Music inside echoed. It didn’t sound like club music, which was a relief, somehow.The line inched forward with aching slowness because the bouncer took so much time inspecting everyone. He raised their coats, patted them down, made them turn around and around. Normally this would have gotten my hackles way, way up, but this wasn’t normal. Somehow, there was something completely, primally right about what he was doing. For some reason, that sense of utter rightness unsettled me as much as if he actually had been predatory.“I’m glad it’s him tonight,” Bats said happily. “He’s the one who loves me.”To pass the time, I studied the people in line. With unease, I noticed a few faces I’d seen on my recent rounds in the county jail. My mentor’s words wound through my mind like a poisoned current:People like her will ruin your career.Finally we reached the bouncer.Bats swept forward. The way he looked at her proved her right: He adored her.He checked her over and waved her in with a smile that enchanted even me. Bats crossed the threshold and spun around, smiling at me from her cloud of glitter and shadows.Then the door swung shut, and it was my turn.As the bouncer’s eyes turned to me, I suddenly felt heavy. So weighed down, and terribly, terribly hot. Like I was wearing the biggest, heaviest coat on earth.He swept my hair back, turned my head this way and that, tugged the strap of my dress.He had no smile for me.Finally he said, “You can’t come in. Your bastard coat has become your skin.”The world kind of stopped.I felt so stupid. So embarrassed. So I did what I always did when I was upset, which was laugh.Then I spun around and marched home. To my home, not hers.That night I dreamed of the club again. Of its wide-smiled doorman marching me to the magic mirror. The glass swirled with darkness and blinding light and dozens of eyes, each and every one locking onto me. Terror drowned me, followed by panic. I twisted and flailed against the bouncer, who flung me in front of the mirror.I knew, deep in my heart, that I couldn’t look at my reflection. That I couldn’t inflict whatever waited there on the world or myself.So I closed my eyes.Then I woke up and got ready for work.Bats was waiting for me when my shift ended. I tried to avoid her, but Bats didn’t know how to be avoided.And I didn’t know how to stay away from someone who loved me.So I got in her car and she drove us back to her apartment. Back home.Back when I was in foster care, I always dreamed of coming home. In reality, going home only ever felt sad. But in my dreams, stepping across the threshold into my parents’ home felt like a relief so profound it was heartbreaking.Stepping into Bats’ apartment felt like that. It always felt like that. That’s why I couldn’t ever stay away from it, or her.I know it wasn’t fair. I’d never been fair to Bats. From the very beginning, I always took more than I gave.But something about my experience at the club — about the bouncer’s face when he told me my bastard coat had become my skin — made me take even more from her.And the more I took, the more she seemed to love me.So I kept taking without giving.And I wasn’t the only one. Just look at who stayed in her home, who she spent her time with, who she sought out, who she protected. Bats loved people who needed her, and she gave everything to people who took everything.So that’s what I did. I thought it would be okay. Well, no. That’s not true. I just never thought about it.She did, though.One day while making another batch of those chili cookies, she said, “I think you only love me because I give what no one else ever has. And I’m glad because that means you’ll never let me go.”Then she hugged me, in the process powdering me with flour and cocoa and cayenne pepper.I felt the weight of my bastard coat sinking into my skin. Sinking deep. Turning my insides into itself.“I’d never let you go anyway,” I lied.She didn’t answer. When Bats didn’t answer you, it meant she didn’t believe you.And honestly, that pissed me off.So I decided to do something about it.That night, like most nights, she took off with her friends who weren’t pets to go to their magic mirror club. I stayed behind. As I got ready for bed, I put my pajamas on inside out.When Bats stumbled in at five in the morning, she didn’t notice.When I got up for the day, I put my shirt and my pants on inside out and made breakfast.She staggered into her tiny kitchen a little later, bleary eyed and so smeary with makeup she looked more like an impressionist painting than a person.It took her fifteen minutes to notice my clothes were on inside out, and when she did she laughed until she hiccuped. “You’ll shed that bastard coat soon, don’t worry.”The thing is, I think I could have shed my bastard coat right then and there. I could actually feel it, heavy on my shoulders, off-center and slowly sliding off.Almost without realizing, I shrugged my shoulders up, just like you do to keep an actual, real, oversized coat in place.Nothing important happened for a while after that.More work, a couple of magical outings with Bats sprinkled between dozens of outings with my new work friends, more nightmares about the club with its mirror.And like any junkie presented with an endless fix, I kept taking more from Bats than I gave.This sounds crazy too, but taking from her made me feel stronger. More stable. Moreme.Like the ground was no longer crumbling beneath my feet.Bats, meanwhile, seemed to shrink. She diminished, somehow. And she was always so cold. Even when she came home from the club, she was no longer a furnace giving off sweat-damp heat. She was cool and clammy. Like she was sick. Or like something was eating her.Knowing what I know now, I think something was.And I think that something was me.She came to the same conclusion because she woke me up one night, drunk and staggering.“I’m sorry I’m drunk,” she slurred. “I know you hate it, but I had to get drunk because that’s the only way I can say this to you. I don’t want to say it, but I need to. You know how that feels, don’t you? When you need to do something even though it’s the very last thing you want?”“Yeah,” I said cautiously.She gave me a broken smile as her eyes misted with tears. “Your bastard coat’s trying to shed, but you keep putting it back on. And you keep using me to help. I can’t do that. You need to be who you want to be, whoever that is. But if you want to be that — if you’re fighting to turn into that — you need to do it somewhere else, with someone you’re not using.”The bottom fell out of my world. Anger immediately welled up like blood in a wound, buoying me.“Other than my sister,” Bats said, “there’s no one I’d rather be around than you. You’re my favorite. I’m your favorite too. But you’re my favorite because I love you. I’m your favorite because you use me.”That was the end.Even though she could barely walk in a straight line, she insisted on escorting me back to my apartment. I was selfish, so I let her.On her way back home, she got hit by a drunk driver and died. The guy is still in jail. I know because I check every year.My world shuddered on its axis and collapsed, leaving me to cling to the rim of reality. To the soft wet edge of that moat as the ground crumbled beneath my fingers.The weeks following were half hazy living nightmare, half starkly boring monotony. Everything was far too real even though nothing was real enough.For some reason, I started running.Before work, after work, all day on my days off. Sometimes I’d wake up in the middle of the night and just go out for a run. Flying blindly through the night in darkness thick and warm as syrup.I don’t even remember it. I remember that Ididit, but don’t have any actual memories. Just a dreamy, endless impression of my feet on sunbleached concrete and ribbons of buckled asphalt and tired yellow grass in the park.Hour after hour, night after night, I ran. Almost like I was looking for her. I think I was. I think part of me was trying to catch her, somehow, before she got hit by that car. Hoping I could turn back time or change the future, or maybe just slide into a world where she was still alive. Maybe the very same world where crossing my parents’ threshold was a joyful homecoming instead of the latest step in our dysfunctional dance of separation and reunion.I was running through a living nightmare of my own making to chase down a dream.And one night — just as the weather began to turn, still warm but with the taste of in the air  — I woke up.Reality rushed back in, brightly lit and dark-skied and irretrievably broken, and I found myself in front of Bats’ club.The line wound around the block, full of people coated in multicolored lights.I went to the back of the line and joined them, snaking forward step by maddeningly slow step until I was finally face to face with the bouncer, bathed in every hue of neon.It was the bouncer who’d turned me away before. The one who loved Bats. I expected him to denounce my bastard coat and send me on my way.Instead he waved me in.The inside of the club reminded me of Bats’ apartment: Dark walls draped with color and tangled webs of string lights. The cramped floor was dotted with mismatched tables. There were only two doorways: The one I’d just entered, and a wildly ornate door with a wooden sign that saidMirror Thru Here.At the back was a stage so tiny I couldn’t figure out how the band fit on it.Their music filled the place. It wasn’t club music. I couldn’t tell you what genre it was. It was soothing and unsoothing, happy and heartbreaking, home and somewhere faraway all blended together into invisible smoke.I took a seat at one of the mismatched tables — one that reminded me of the nicked, scratched, paint-splattered folding table my grandma kept in her old house — and watched the band.When the set ended, I stood up just as someone touched my hand.I looked up and saw the bouncer. He looked back with resignation.Then he slid into the seat beside me. “She told me you were just like her,” he said.I didn’t need to ask who he meant.“Can I see if that’s true?”I nodded because I didn’t know what else to do. He gave me a smile — a small, pained one, nothing like the magic one he reserved for Bats — then pulled me to my feet and across the floor.I felt like I was in a dream. Not just any dream, but the dream where Bats was fine, where I’d never hurt her, where going home to my mother felt like joy instead of another disaster. A dream where the ground no longer crumbled beneath my feet.The bouncer led me through the ornate door.Bats was there.Bats, laying on a table, motionless and slack and asymmetrical, bruised and broken, torn into pieces in the special way vehicles break human beings into pieces.Terror drowned me, the strongest, deepest fear I've ever known, flooding the bounds of my moat and threatening to pull me back into the current.But it receded, slowly.And once receded, I approached the table.Bats was dead, but not dull. Her skin shone dimly and unevenly, like a guttering flame. In places where her flesh had been ravaged and road-rashed into nonexistence, her insides glittered through like powdered glass.Around her was a shimmering, multicolored storm of activity.People surrounded the table. A few I recognized from the shining, smiling pack that drifted in and out of her apartment. People who were her friends, not her pets. People who danced on the water with her while I watched bitterly from my crumbling shore. Most I didn’t recognize at all, although a few felt familiar in ways I can’t explain.Two of those were angling a large mirror over her body. They were built strangely — thin, spidery, almost spindly, and terribly graceful. They weren’t frightening or ugly, but looking at them too long made my stomach flip flop and clench the way it does when I see a horrific injury.Their mirror caught and magnified Bats' chest, then turned sideways so that the bouncer and I could see. My breath caught:Where her heart should have been was a ragged, gaping hole.“We’ve been trying to wake her up since she got here,” the bouncer told me. Every word wound through my head, gentle and hypnotic. “But she’s missing something. You can give it back.”I looked at Bats' reflection, at the way different colors rose and fell and danced across her skin, like light on dying embers. At the empty cavern where her heart should be.I understood what the bouncer was asking.And in that moment, I was dying to give it.I grabbed my own chest, expecting my fingers to sink into my skin the way my bastard coat did in nightmares, or maybe for everything to already be cut open. It's insane, but somehow I really thought I’d be able to reach into my own chest cavity to pull out my heart and put it in her chest. I wanted to. I was ready to.The bouncer took my hand again. “It’s not that easy. First, we have to make absolutely sure you’re just like her.”Then he turned me around to face another, much smaller door across the room. It was half open. Darkness bled out. Etched into it were the wordsMirror Room.Bats’ magic mirror.The mirror that shows what you really are. That proves you’re who you really are, or drives you insane.The thing, I realized, that I feared more than anything.The bouncer took me by the arms like an insolently graceful dance partner and led me to the door.Unlike my nightmares, I didn’t fight or flail, and he didn’t fling me down. He only pushed me inside gently, then shut the door.The darkness was absolute and my terror overwhelming for one endless second.Then the lights snapped on, heavy as syrup, hot as the sun, illuminating swirling storms of dust and the massive mirror across from me.I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Just a glimpse. It was enough to make me panic.I covered my eyes and stayed that way for a long time, sweating under the lights with my hands pressed to my face.At some point, I realized I was shaking.That opened the door for other perceptions, each more painful than the last. The heat. The sweat cutting rivulets down my painfully hot skin. My clothes clinging to me like oily film.And over it all, thick and heavy and maddeningly itchy, was a coat.The heaviest, itchiest, most awful coat I could have ever dreamed of.My bastard coat somehow brought into reality.It wasn’t just itchy, it was painful. I felt like it was sinking past my sweat-soaked clothes and straight to my skin where it just kept sinking. I could feel the individual fibers, a thousand white-hot filaments, cooking their way into my body.My outside, eating its way in.I finally parted my fingers to bare one eye. I kept it squinted, ready to snap it shut at the first hint of insanity, and glanced at the mirror.All I saw was me.I covered my face again and took a deep breath. I steeled my spine, squared my shoulders. Then I dropped my hands to my sides, and opened my eyes.My reflection was only me.Only me in a ragged, sweat-drenched coat with a funny motley pattern. It hung wide open, so huge it threw most of my body into shadow. My skin glimmered strangely underneath, not with sweat but something else. Not anything beautiful. Something eerie and upsetting, the visual equivalent of the bone-chilling music I always hear in nightmares. But it wasn’t a nightmare. It was me.Just me in a big ugly coat.Relief crushed upward like a reverse avalanche, and burst out of me in peals of laughter.My knees went so weak that I lowered myself to the floor amid the storm of swirling dust. The coat tented over me as the syrupy hot lights dimmed. The room was still oppressively, terribly hot, but softly so. Like the mini golf course after dark. Suffocating but pleasant, like a hot bath.The door creaked open.Soft footsteps approached. Someone knelt beside me and slid their hands under my coat. I tensed up as a dozen ugly memories of even uglier touches threatened to crash over me, but those hands only went under my arms to raise me gently to my feet.It was the bouncer, apologetic and gentle and so, so sad.“You’re not a match for her,” he said.Another reverse avalanche crushed upward, this time exiting in the form of sobs. I’d failed her. I’d used her until it killed her, then failed her.He put his arms around my shoulders the way Bats used to do. “Don’t be sad. She’d want it this way. You’re not the last person she wants to take from, but you’re close. This is better. I promise.”He led me into the room where Bats lay slack and asymmetrical on her table. As we passed, I took her hand one last time, focusing on the feel of her broad palm and long fingers while people I couldn’t bring myself to look at angled the mirror over her missing heart.But I caught a glimpse of her face in the mirror. Her reflection at least didn’t look slack or asymmetrical. She was horrifyingly beautiful and monstrously lovely, the worst yet most welcome thing I’ve ever seen.The bouncer walked me out, past the mismatched tables and the band and the glittering, shimmering people in the shadows, and all the way back onto the street, where he straightened my coat and smoothed my hair back. I noticed, for the first time, that he was wearing a coat, too. It was a different color and pattern — stripes, not motley — but cut exactly the same. Unlike mine, his fit perfectly. Beyond perfectly.Like a second skin.“It’s okay to wear a bastard coat,” he said. “You don’t have to wear your insides out, just as long as your outsides don’t wear in. She didn’t understand that.” He gave me a sad and enchanting half smile. “I’m glad you’re not a match. It would have hurt me to take you apart.”Then he sent me on my way, with my bastard coat dragging on the ground behind me.I staggered home just like Bats used to, stumbling through my apartment in a haze of shimmering sweat. I collapsed on my bed as the room spun gently.As I fell asleep, I noticed I couldn’t see my coat anymore. I couldfeelit, heavy as ever on my shoulders. But I couldn’t see it.I haven’t seen it since.I know it’s there. I feel it sometimes when I focus, but it’s not heavy or too big. It just feels like a second skin.Anyway, I didn’t learn anything from that.I didn’t become a better person. I didn’t change my ways or have some kind of stoner-ass Ebenezer Scrooge awakening.I just woke up the next morning, standing on the edge of my moat while the ground crumbled under my heels, and missed her.I don't know what else to say, except I'd give a lot to go back and change it.Or at least to give her a fraction of what shegave me.",

      "content_preview": "Of all the nights for the devil to visit, he chose one that was calm. No great storms, no loud bashes of lightning and thunder. It was a quiet evening, cloudless, the stars blotted out by the lights of the city. I was on the late shift at the confessional booth. It was the eleventh hour, and no one had yet come to use my services.I was nodding off in my chair when the door to the other side of the booth was pulled open. Someone stepped in, and sat down.I had heard no one enter the cathedral. The approach of a potential confessor was usually accompanied by great and echoed footsteps as they traversed the stone floor to the wooden cubicle. This one had come in so silently, that until the moment they pulled open the door, I had believed myself to be alone. I was still in a state of half-doze, so I blinked several times to wake myself and turned to view the confessor through the grate.I could not make out their face through the wooden screen, and the shadow which filled their compartment obscured most of their finer features. But I could tell that they were male, and that they were dressed richly. The confessor wore a suit that looked exquisite, and from the clinking sound his hands made, I could tell they were covered with rings. They glinted and cast strange warped light rays on the ceiling that reminded me of ancient worms wriggling in primordial ooze.“Good evening, Father.” That voice. Smooth as oil. Like the glint off of a freshly sharpened knife, with the note of a coin just flipped. Pure, almost celestial in origin. It rolled pleasingly on my ears, and I was brought to ease. “Forgive me, for I have sinned. It has been…eons uncounted since my last confession.”Despite the smoothness of his voice, his words struck an uncertain chord within me. “That is an unusual beginning, my son.”The man chuckled. “Allow me to explain, Father. I am Lucifer.”I have serviced an expansive and varied area when it comes to saints and sinners. This was not the first time I had been in the booth and heard the person on the other side admit to being the devil. Most times, such delusions did not interfere with the process. I treated them as any other, spoke to them of their wrongdoings, and tried to give a modicum of hope that they would be made whole, that one day they would be free of their fevered mind.This man was different.It must have been the growing dread I felt at his arrival, but I looked at him more closely through the divider. His eyes found mine, and I saw them clearly, even though his face was still shrouded in the gloom. Brown irises so dark they were almost black. As I searched, I noted he bore none of the popular hallmarks of the Prince of Darkness. No horns, goats hooves, or the smell of sulfur. This man had the smell of cheap wine, and the vestments of an investment broker.But in my heart, the truth of the matter grew like a weed. I could not deny it. I was convinced by the darkness the man had brought, and the unease I felt in the corners of my mind. It was the same primeval instinct that tells animals they are in the presence of a predator.He was not lying, my confessor. As sure as I would know the Christ if he walked through my door, I knew this being to be the devil himself.My mouth went dry. My mind went silent, and the only words I could utter were those which had been engrained into me by habit. “...Do you…wish to confess?”The devil laughed. It was a soft sound, two parts pain and one part joyless mirth. It filled the whole space, but made everything feel hollow. When he spoke again, I noticed his voice slurred slightly, like one inebriated. “I suppose I have. It sounds odd even to me. I didn’t know that I would come here until my feet took the path.”I waited. My tongue had frozen to the roof of my mouth. I feared my immortal soul if I were to say the wrong thing to Satan.The devil took my silence as an offered compliance. “I hope you will understand if I do not make the sign of the cross, considering…present company.”“...Quite alright, my…son.”“Lucifer is fine, Father.”I swallowed. I reminded myself I was in a place of God, that the devil held no power here. But still, I could not keep my knees from trembling beneath my robe. My heart fluttered within my chest with great entropy. “Very well...Lucifer. What do you wish to confess?”The devil went quiet. His head bowed in thought. I saw him gather his thoughts, and my fear left me enough so that the gesture struck me as odd. I had only seen such movement before in those humbled. I did not know the devil to be contemplative.Satan began to speak. “I confess…hell is no longer mine.”“...Do you mean…in that it has been saved through Christ?” Even as I spoke, I felt foolish.The devil laughed again. “I almost wish that were the case. Does that speak to how dire this situation is? But I suppose you already knew that. I am here after all…”I waited, but the pause continued. “...How then is hell no longer yours?”The devil did not answer for a moment. I heard him sigh, and heard the clink of gold as he wrung his hands together in his lap. “What do you know of my history, Father?”“You fell from heaven. You rebelled against God. You seek to destroy his work.”“You’ve studied your own book. Well done. But it is correct in that regard. Yes, I rebelled against God, and yes, I was cast down because of it.The devil took another moment. The initial fear of him was wearing off. As my mind began to work, I again questioned the strangeness of our meeting. I had expected something more like staring into the jaws of a lion. Instead, it was like seeing an old, ill-met acquaintance.The devil spoke again. “Yes, I confess, I wished to take control of God’s Kingdom. I confess to the sin of…ambitionif such a sin even exists. I believed I could do better, so wasn’t I morally obligated to see it through? Even when I was cast down, I still gathered legions to my side. What was that you people said all those years ago? That God incarnate would come down and allow himself an ignominious death? A fool’s bet, I said. I had met God. He would not do it. He could not do it. He was soft. He could not even bring himself to destroy me, and I had done many things to deserve such a punishment. God had limits.”“But he did do it.” My own boldness surprised me.I saw the devil turn to look at me. The unnerving idea came that not only could he see me in perfect detail behind the screen, but that he could see through my very skin and into the darkest desires of my soul. When he spoke, his voice was soft, and I felt that sense of danger return to me. Cold sweat broke out across my brow. The devils voice barely broke above a whisper. “Yes. He did.”For a moment, I held my breath, praying silently to Christ to preserve me. I felt no calming sense of peace. Only the stillness of a deaf heaven.The devil remained quiet as he continued. “I take no offense, Father. You are not the first to speak those words to me. The minute Christ rose from that tomb, I lost what control I had over my subjects. In their eyes, I was wrong, no longer to be trusted. Odd, considering they were the ones to give me the moniker Lord of Lies. Mammon was the first to rebel. He led the most away. That made everyone bolder, and Lilith left soon after. Then there was Baal with his priests that seemed to serve everyone and anyone just for some small notoriety. He had never gotten over that Elijah debacle. Felt like he needed to prove himself. They all slaughtered each other. Hell was bathed in the blood of demons for almost a century.”“...And is this why you have come to me?” I shivered as I felt the devil’s gaze upon me once more.“Patience, Father. Isn’t that what you preach?”It was silent for a long time. I forced myself to remain quiet. I had begun to sweat, even though my cubicle felt icy cold.“I was left with nothing. None of my subjects remained loyal. I was watching the battle for hell as a spectator. No one rallied to my banner. No one remained loyal to the one they had elected as lord. Somehow…among my own people…I had fallen a second time. It was inexcusable. But I had nowhere left to turn… No manner of recompense…”He stopped speaking again. But this time, I felt something more than just dread. A great turning point, suspended above us. I do not profess the gift of prophecy, the feeling inside of me was not so divine. I felt some insanity compel me. Some unevolved part of myself begging for him to stop, to halt the confession and not to hear any more. I knew that if I continued to listen, I risked stepping over the precipice of insanity and into the roiling waters of psychosis. I held my soul in one hand, haggling with infinity for the price of a devil’s story.In my foolishness, I disregarded it all. I stayed silent, and ushered in my own damnation.“Father,” the devil’s voice was soft again. ““Do you know there are depths deeper than hell? Darknesses where even I have not ventured? The folly of the learned man is he thinks he has gone further than all else. I share his shame. In my search for the power to crush the rebellions of hell, I stumbled on that which I should not have even considered. Things God himself would not challenge. Things that were meant to remain untouched.”Through the screen, I saw the devil look down to his hands, almost as a child confronted with their own misdeeds. “They were rumors at first. Odd mentions, stories forgotten. But I searched them, and as I investigated, those rumors grew into theories, and then into realities. Underneath the bedrock of creation was might untapped. I was certain of it. With that certainty, I went into the dark, and wandered for a century.”The devil turned to look at me again. In the shadow, I saw his eyes clearly, as I had before. In them, I saw the seeds of madness, but something else. Something embedded deep in the loam of his pupils…Fear.“I found…things. Entities that existed before God himself. Creatures whose names I would not utter even in the full light of day. Beings twisted with a greater malice, a primal pain that substituted comprehension for raw power. They understood nothing but the desire to pull every organized molecule and sub-particle into a storm of devastation.”The devil’s voice hitched. He swallowed. “In the early days, I would have never...but I was desperate.”I became aware of an empty feeling around me. A void that grew stronger in the devil’s silence. In the booth, I felt the sight of a thousand eyes upon me, and I wished to hide. But I could not. I knew I could not. I had stepped over the threshold, and in discerning these beings, I had given them the power to see me as well.Lucifer continued. ““I tried to tell them, my old subjects. I warned them of what would happen if they persisted in their petty war. I was the true master of hell. I had built this place up from rubble, in the very defiance of God himself. And still they dismissed me. When I told them of the great evil I had at my fingertips, they did not believe me. They thought my mind broken. Imagine that.”In the devil’s next pause, I hazarded a moment to speak. I could no longer exist in silence without fearing my own annihilation to beings unseen. “What did you do?”The devil looked at his hands again. So childlike. ““I woke them.”Unbidden to my mind leapt images of carnage. I do not know if it was a vision, but I saw hell reduced to rubble. I felt that void again. A twisting and roiling mass that made my mind race. I saw it grow to swallow the devil’s kingdom, and felt its hunger as if it were my own. I felt my soul cry out in anguish as it was torn asunder by the feeling of chaos and nothingness. I knew if I persisted in this state for long, I would lose my mind.Then all in a moment, I was returned to my booth.So swallowed up in what I had seen, I almost missed the devil’s next words. And the slight tremble that they contained.“All I desired was God’s throne. I knew I could… I could be better. I could do better. Those beings which now inhabit hell…those who now rule the destiny of men and gods…they are not like you or I. They desire neither control nor salvation. To them, both heaven and hell are so much detritus on the cosmic ocean.” I heard the clink of gold again, and I assumed the devil was playing with his rings. “I confess, hell is no longer mine.”“And soon the earth will no longer be God’s. Nothing will”I stared at the devil through the screen. He looked at me, and in his veiled countenance, I saw the true misery of damnation. What I had thought was a terrible joke, a trick, was in fact the most sincere form of remorse from the Prince of Darkness. A sin that even he felt the need to confess.The devil looked at me again, and I could tell we both felt empty. “For what it’s worth, I apologize, Father. I had hoped to rule this world. Now, I must watch it crumble. It will end in smoke and rot. The very gates of heaven will rust and disintegrate. The bodies of angels will lie in the streets to fester. The demons already lie in the dust. A day, a week, a millennium, who knows when what I awoke will ascend. But mark my words, it will ascend. And I will be sole witness to the ending of God, a lone Adam in the chaos of uncreation.”“That is my cross. And I will bear it forever.”The devil paused, then continued. “This is all I can remember, Father. I am sorry for this, my greatest sin.”For a moment, I was so swallowed up in hopelessness, that I forgot to offer penance. But what penance could I offer? When I looked through the grate again, the devil had left. I stumbled out and tried to follow him, but found no trace. No evidence he had come and conversed with me. That he had confessed to the imminent end of everything.I do not know if I crossed the threshold of insanity that night, or the night following. After the devil’s confession, I went home and slept through the day and into the next night. In my sleep I had a dream. I wandered in the dark. Great things moved around me. Things with slithering bodies and many limbs. Small perverse things with claws that bit and tore. Creatures with terrible wings, bodies made up of concentric circles upon circles that defied all logical thought. They were separate, but conjoined into one great being that over swept all.Before me appeared a great throne made from dark stone. I set myself thereupon, and was swallowed up in the whirl of things known and unknown. I felt the chair beneath me crumble, and great cracks open up in my own body. My blood spilled and was turned to steam by the heat of the great and terrible ones that then brought the entire scene to an abrupt nothingness.And once there was nothing left to tear, rip or destroy, they left. Only the void remained. In that freezing vacuum, I passed a thousand years.Then I awoke.I am no prophet. I do not pretend to know if such things are portents to come. I know I am insane.But the devil promised that those below would ascend.I wait in dread for that day, the day the Lord of Hell promised would come with fear in hiseyes.",

      "content_preview": "Absolutely, under no circumstances, may you ever pick up a hitchhiker.It’s common for unfamiliar persons to approach truck drivers on Route 333 asking for a lift. It does not matter who the person in question may be. It does not matter if they are a nursing mother with a newborn child or a lost pre-teen in great distress. Never, for any reason, under any conditions, may you provide one of said persons with requested rides.You won’t survive if you do.-Employee Handbook: Section 3.B_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Part 1“Why are you doing this?”That was the thing my girlfriend of three years asked me repeatedly in the days leading up to my departure. The start day for my new trucking gig drew closer. I’d be moving to a totally different state.“I did just graduate. I do need a job.”“Trucking has nothing to do with your major. Stay here.”“To be fair, most jobs have nothing to do with English. That’s sort of the issue.”Day after day, though, Myra continued to ask why I was doing this.I could have gone with the easy answer: the money. Which really had been why I’d signed my contract in the first place, but the closer my start date got, the more I was sure that wasn’t the whole reason I was leaving.How did I put into words this growing feeling inside me? That I couldn’t stay. That I wasn’t happy there, or anywhere really, and how it was slowly suffocating me. And while it wasn’t her fault, she also wasn’t the solution as much as she wished she could be, so I had to go. I had to.But yeah, I’m fairly sure what I actually did say was just, “money.” Sue me.“You can still call me,” she said the night before my flight. “We’ll talk every day while you’re driving, yeah?”“I don’t know,” I said. “I think probably not. There’s a whole section in the employee handbook about how I can only use the radio.”“So? They won’t know. How are we supposed to do long-distance if we can’t talk?”I remembered the bloodied corpse of the other interviewee skewered to his hood. I remembered the scratch of my own face pressed to the pavement asthingsskittered around my rig. How could I explain why I had to follow the phone rule too?I stayed silent.Her voice got soft. “We’re breaking up, aren’t we?”“I think… I think we are.”For a second, I thought Myra might slap me. She’s not mean, but she’s impulsive, the type of girl who has a mid-life crisis every other Tuesday and frequently shows up with a brand new life philosophy tattooed on her thigh―one of the things I loved about her.  But it wasn’t always easy to predict what drastic thing she’d do to cope.Instead, she hugged me, kissed me on the cheek, and left. At the door to my apartment, she paused. “Goodbye, Brendon.”_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________In the job preparation packet, my new trucking company was very clear on one thing: read the employee handbook. So I did what anybody would do in this situation. I skimmed it.I’m sure at this point, those of you who read my last post are clucking your tongues disapprovingly―really Brendon? One dead body wasn’t enough? Didn’t  you already accidentally break a rule last time?But let me ask youthis: what was the last jobyouworked whereyouread the entire employee handbook back to front?That's what I thought.The parts I did read had some weird stuff in them. There was your typical information―what to pack for overnighters, and general rig maintenance guidelines―but also some odder things. Sections on what to do if the moon forgot to show up on a night it was supposed to. Or explanations on which gas stations were normal and which ones had rules to obey likeDon’t stare anybody in the eyes. Not even if they’re speaking directly at you.There was a whole page with a bullet list on which FM radio stations were ‘safe’ and which might put you into a trance for hours/ make you crave non-food substances.Never speed,read a sentence in Section 5.A.If you do, it may draw the attention of the highway patrol. They are not highway patrol. They will not give you a ticket. You do not want to find out what they will give you as punishment instead.Basically, I was around 90-95% sure I would die a morbidly gruesome death my first real time on Route 333―more of a passing interest than an actual fear, which probably just demonstrates how damaged my psyche was.I’m happy to report, however, my first haul went off without a hitch.The first section was redwood groves, followed by hours of desert pockmarked with rundown towns, and finally some twisting mountain canyons. I crashed in the sleeper after delivering my haul at an abandoned building (that’s where they told me to leave it). I woke up early the next morning to finish the route and did so alive and well. My truck stopped for a  minute fourty-seven seconds at the same part as last time, but there was no additional visit from the things in the forest. Randall hadn't actually seemed overly concerned when I explained to him how Ihadin fact gotten out of the truck during the interview, so I chose not to be too worried for now.Back at the truck yard, I dangled my keys in front of Randall. He whistled. “Fourteen hours there and back. That is simply unheard of.”“Can I ask you what I actually delivered?”“No. No you may not.” He smiled cheerily and plucked the keys from me.I was still having a hard time figuring Randall out. Either he was a passive aggressive jerk, or he simply had an odd sense of humor. Either way, he hadn't seemed too concerned when the other man in my interview had gotten savagely murdered, so that probably tipped the scales towards ‘jerk.’My next few weeks went almost equally smooth. Still no incidents in the redwood section. Randall and the other dispatchers started sending me on longer and longer trips down Route 333. They would last three, sometimes four days at a time. I didn’t mind―I was getting massive amounts of overtime―but I did get the odd sense the dispatchers were almostexcitedabout the fact I was going so far.I knew there was a part in the employee handbook about how the road would expand over time. A drive that took me four hours, might take another driver eight or more. Eventually, there would be a breaking point. A rapid expansion, where a section of the road that took you minutes would now take weeks. From tidbits of conversations with other drivers, I got the impression there were truckers who hadn't quit in time. Who’d been stuck on Route 333 for years, trying to get back.Frankly, most days I didn’t care much.For the first time in years, my racing thoughts were finally slowing. My chronic overthinking was fading away to a sense of pleasant numbness. Whatever happened, however this road worked, was the same to me.Before I’d started trucking, I’d been worried that the loneliness would get to me. Now, the only thing I worried about anymore was about how entirely fine I was being this alone._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I’d stopped for fuel at a PetroSpeed, when I heard it. At first, I couldn’t entirely place the voice, and I just continued filling up. Something nagged the recesses of my mind, though, a thin thread yanking and yanking. Finally, I twisted to see who belonged to the voice across the parking lot.I gaped.It was Myra, my ex-girlfriend, talking animatedly with what looked like one of the PetroSpeed workers.As I got closer I could make out their conversation.“What do you mean there’s no mechanics in the area?” Myra jabbed a finger at her car. “How am I supposed to keep driving in that thing?”“I’m sorry, Mam, but the nearest town is hours away. You’ll have to call a towing company.”“I don’t want to call a towing company. I want to find somebody here.”“I understand that Mam, but―”“Myra?” I asked.She whirled, looking as if she was going to snap at me too, then realized who I was. Her hands flew to her mouth, then she sprinted at me and threw herself in my arms.I laughed. “This is insane. What are you doing here?”“Looking for you!”“Looking for―Myra you haven't even called me.”“Yes, I did! I’ve called a dozen times the last few days, and you never picked up. I got worried. I wanted to see you.”I wouldn’t have picked up. I was on the third day of a four day trip. I didn’t even bring my phone anymore to avoid the temptation of using it. Something like this―her somehow tracking me down to the middle of nowhere―felt exactly like the sort of impulsive thing Myra would do. Entirely insane, but the exact reason I fell in love with her.“Amazing luck,” she said. “If my car hadn't died I wouldn’t have stopped here. Can I ride with you?”We talked for hours. It was just like before. We laughed and sang along to the limited country songs we knew at ear-shattering volumes. After a few hours she grabbed my hand, and I didn’t stop her. I’d thought I was fine with the loneliness, but having her here, physically with me, I knew I’d minded more than I let myself believe.“I never thought you’d want to talk with me again,” I told her.“At first I didn’t.” She stroked my knuckle with her thumb. “I don’t think I’ll ever stop loving you.”I felt amazing. No, better than amazing. I felthappy.I glowed the whole evening, all up until we stopped at a rest stop for the night and she slipped into the building for the bathroom.“Everything’s good,” I reported on my handheld radio as part of my nightly check in (Yes, somehow this radio was capable of connecting back with dispatch. I’d given up wondering how).“You sound chipper,” Randall said.“Crazy story actually.” I told him about running into Myra, about how I was giving her a lift back to civilization, and how good it was to see her.He went quiet.“You know you aren’t supposed to pick up hitchhikers,\" he said.“I didn’t. She’s not a hitchhiker. I know her.”“Did she ask you for a ride?”“No. I offered her a ride. I…” But I hadn't, had I? I would have, but she’d gotten to asking first. A slow, deadly chill spread up my back.“Who are you talking to?” Myra climbed into the cab in PJs.“Nobody. Nobody at all.”She fell asleep instantly, cuddled up next to me.This wasMyraof all people*.* Iknewher. She wasn’t a stranger. I hadn't broken any rules. Why wasn’t I allowed to just be happy for once? I forced myself to close my eyes, steady my breaths, and drift off to sleep.I woke up hours later. It was a gradual wake-up. Something wet was on my face. My eyes didn’t snap open, instead for some inexplicable reason I cracked them open just a fraction, thin enough they still appeared closed.She was staring at me. In the early morning light Myra watched me with an enormous grin across her face, fully awake. She leaned in and ran her tongue from my chin up to my forehead.“I love you,” she whispered._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________“Do you need the bathroom,” I asked hours later. We were stopped at a rest stop a mere hour or two from the end of Route 333.  The last few hours, the conversation had been…tense. She hadn't wanted to get out to stretch her legs once. I'd pushed. She'd gotten annoyed.“I’m good.”“You haven't gone all day. You didn’t go yesterday either.”She giggled. Like I’d told some joke. She reached out to my face and ran a single, sharpened nail along my cheek. “It’s almost like you want to get rid of me.”I swallowed and pretended to ignore the drip of blood from my chin. “Of course not.”I took the keys with me when I went to fill up the tank. She pressed her face up against the glass the whole time, smiling down at me, waving incessantly. When I climbed back in, she giggled.“Don’t take so long,” she said. “I missed you.”We drove. She became increasingly cuddly. Her grip when she held my hand―it was tight. Too tight. There would be bruises tomorrow. She started leaning across the center divide to kiss my cheek and rake her teeth against my neck“Stop,” I said.“No.”I stopped three more times to stretch my legs. “You should too,” I said each time, but she refused. She wouldn’t leave.“Stop it!” she growled the fourth time we stopped. Her face distorted into a grotesque mask―then softened back into a smile. “I’ll miss you.”“Myra.” I took a breath. “There’s actually something I need to ask you.”“Yes?”“It’s not something I can ask you in a truck, though.”Her face scrunched in annoyance. Her breath grew harsh and gravelly.“These last two days have been amazing,” I said. “They’ve made me realize how much I missed you and need to be with you. The thing I need to ask you―I have to kneel for it.”A soft smile tugged at her lips.Finally, she relented. She followed me from the truck. As we walked to a clearing in the forest, her steps grew more erratic and random. Moreexcitedperhaps. The skin on her face looked less smooth and more like plastic, like something designed in a factory.“Close your eyes,” I whispered and sunk my hand into my pocket showingly.She did.Then I bolted for the truck.It was seconds before she realized what was happening and even longer before she started after me. By the time the thing, the not-Myra, reached me, the doors were already locked. I was already rolling away.Her face was something entirely inhuman. Her eyes dripped like melted wax from her empty sockets, and her hair peeled off in clumps. “No!” she screeched. “I love you! Don’t leave me!”But I did.For the second time._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________When I returned to the truck yard, I said nothing of what had happened. Randall didn’t either, though he seemed visibly surprised to see me. He simply accepted my keys with a wink.Jerk, I decided.Definitely a jerk.The first thing I did when I got in my car was make a phone call.The person on the other end picked up after the second ring. Neither of us spoke. We breathed into the receiver, waiting for the other to initiate.“Hi,” I said.“Hi.”How could I ever have forgotten what Myra’s true voice sounded like? Nothing in her tone suggested she was anything but safe― something I already knew, but actually confirming it let me relax for the first time in hours.“Brendon,” she said. “Why are you calling?”“I…don’t entirely know.”“Are you alright?” she asked.“I’m not sure.”She was silent. I was too.“You should know―I know it doesn’t matter, but I think you should know―I’m with somebody new,” she said.“Okay.”“That’s it?”“I think so. Yeah.”Myra huffed out a laugh, though I was entirely certain she thought none of this was funny. “Why did you do this to me?” she snapped.I opened my mouth, then closed it.“Nothing?” she asked when I didn't reply. “Really? Brendon, you left after three years, no warning, and you never really even told me why. You haven't called once. You haven’t texted, not even to tell me you're alright. I loved you, and you threw me away. Decent people don’t do that. I get that you have your own stuff going on, but that’s a terrible way to treat somebody.”“It is.” I sighed and leaned my head against the steering wheel. “Myra, I think there’s something broken about me.”“Don’t be dramatic.”“I’m not. Something’s always been broken about me, and I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t even know what it is, but I am sorry. That wasn’t fair of me to leave like that. You deserve to hate me.”A pause.“I could never hate you,” she whispered.We hung up. Before either of us could start crying, I suspected.For a few minutes, sitting there after the call, I considered quitting. I should have been afraid of Route 333. After everything I’d seen on it, after the bodies and the creatures that weren’t quite human, it would make sense for me to leave. Anybody in my situation would be considering the same. Anybody smarter than me probablywouldhave quit.I couldn’t though.I was afraid of the road. Of the things that prowled behind the trees and waited in empty gas station shower stalls. I was afraid of the things that perhaps knew my scent and the thing that had slept next to me in bed. Of course, I was.I was just afraid of the real world more.So I stayed. I kept driving. And one day, when the road expands past days long into weeks long―possibly evenyearslong―I willkeep driving.Keep reading.",

      "content_preview": "I’m still traumatized from 48 years ago, something happened, and it was so horrific… I wrote this document back in 2004, but now I have released it to the public and made it into a book form. Anyways, here it begins.CHAPTER 1. Saunaklonkku incident 1977. Victim: Kari-Pekka.It was the year 1977 in Kajaani, and I was getting ready for a sauna night, I had bought lots of beer. It was still very cold and a little bit foggy outside because it was winter. I was driving back home when I saw bunch of police officers investigating a crime scene in my neighborhood. It was a bit weird because my neighborhood was usually very quiet and peaceful.My friend was also with me coming to the Sauna with me.We drove to the cottage and got out of the car. It was dead silent outside.  After a few hours we were ready to go to the sauna. We went inside the sauna, sat down, and talked about some random things. After some time, my friend left to get some more beer from the car.       At the time he was out, I went to the terrace to drink beer. I had the radio on, and the news radio channel said that there might be a serial killer in the zone of Kajaani, Finland.                                    I was scared to hear it, so I thought that it was safer in the sauna than outside, so I went back in the sauna. After some time, I heard noises under the Sauna benches, and it was weird.                                      I went to look under the benches and then suddenly I was being pulled under them. Then just at that time my friend came back with a loaded shotgun. He said something about , that he was being followed, but then he noticed that I was being pulled under the benches, and he tried to shoot at the thing under them, but he missed and almost hit my knee. Then we heard police sirens outside my house. The thing under the benches managed to escape through a hole in the floor that I forgot to fix. Then probably about five police officers came into my house aiming their guns and said that they detected some weird creature in my yard.They then asked, that did I see where the thing went, but I couldn’t tell where it did go The “thing” probably was the serial killer.Then a few days later everyone started to call the serial killer “Saunaklonkku.”, because he was linked to the sauna “accidents”.I thought that it would be a good idea to move away from my cottage to somewhere else like in a city, so I decided to sell my cottage and surprisingly someone bought it.CHAPTER 2. Saunaklonkku returns 1981. Victim 2: Ukko Jokela.In the year 1981 summer holiday started and my family of two kids, my wife and me bought the cottage. A few days later we decided to test out the sauna. My wife found an old shotgun shell from there and threw it away. After some time, my family and I went fishing at the nearby pond. After an hour or two we went inside because the sun was setting.The kids went to sleep, and I went to drink some beer and watch TV. Then after some time I heard screaming from upstairs.(Ukko Jokela’s wife’s perspective.) I heard one of my kids screaming in the upstairs bedroom, so I went to check on him. He was scared and asked that can I check under his bed if there were any monsters. I checked and sadly was someone, it was the Saunaklonkku. He jumped out from there and stood up holding a pocketknife.(Ukko Jokela’s perspective.)I came in the room and saw that Saunaklonkku stabbed my wife, then one of my kids jumped outside from the nearby window and landed in a spikey bush. Then I quickly ran downstairs with my other child. We escaped outside.I got my child to safety, and then I prepared to strike back at Saunaklonkku. I went outside but then suddenly I was attacked by Saunaklonkku and he punched me, and I fell onto the ground, then Saunaklonkku started punching my face. I felt like I was going to die but then I noticed that Saunaklonkku had a gun with him. I managed to pull the gun out and shoot his kidney which should have been fatal but not for Saunaklonkku.I pushed Saunaklonkku back to the basement and got gasoline i poured it down to the basement and then I shot the gasoline which made it burn, and it made Saunaklonkku burn too. I then ran away from the burning cottage and then in the end it exploded. I got in my car and drove away back towards Tampere.CHAPTER 3. Urban explorers (2002) Victims: Tuure, Juho, Joni and Samuel.In July me and three friends went exploring an abandoned cottage that exploded and went up in flames in the year 1981, and the stories told, that there was some kind of serial killer named “Saunaklonkku”. My friend’s names were Tuure, Juho and Joni. It was late at night, and we all had flashlights, except my flashlight was TERRIBLE, and I mean TERRIBLE. It barely even worked, and it had cracks on it. Everything was going okay, until we came across animal skeletons, and it smelled so bad. Suddenly, we heard footsteps behind us, and we turned but there was no one. We decided to not trust the stories and split up and be in groups of two.(Juho’s perspective.)I teamed up with Joni and went upstairs. There was a broken railing, so it was easy to fall downstairs, there was also a deep hole way deeper than the first floor, it was like 9 meters deep. Suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder and when I turned, there was the Saunaklonkku. I tried to punch toward it, but nothing worked. He pushed me from the broken railing, and it caused me to fall into the darkness.(Joni’s perspective.)I saw Juho get pushed to an old rusty chainsaw that cut him in half and I ran as fast as I could to the kitchen, but it was a dead end and then Saunaklonkku was chasing me. I kept trying to scream for Tuure and Samuel, but they were not answering. I came across a dead end, and Saunaklonkku was right in front of me. I took off my hoodie and got in a fighting position. I swung a punch at it, but it grabbed my arm and started twisting it. I started hearing my bones cracking and dislocating, I started seeing blood splatter from my wrist and elbow. A bone pierced through my arm, and before I even had time to react, my arm got ripped off and blood splattered everywhere. I screamed in pain, and I kicked its stomach. Unfortunately, it grabbed my leg too and threw me on the ground on my neck. I gave up and accepted my end. Saunaklonkku took a rusty pocketknife and stabbed me in both eyes, blood splattering everywhere. I felt my throat getting sliced open, and after that, I only heard footsteps fading away towards the broken basement door.(Samuel’s perspective.)I witnessed both deaths with the binoculars I got for my birthday. I did not have time to look for Tuure, so I ran towards the door to escape. I took my phone out of my pocket, and it had only 1% left on battery, so i quickly dialed the emergency number, and I screamed for help. I didn’t tell them why. I just screamed help. After that, the phone went black. The battery had run out. I ran outside and I realized, that Saunaklonkku was chasing me the whole time. Saunaklonkku almost got me, but the police got there just in time and started to shoot at it and somehow my phone turned off and i quickly got a photo of Saunaklonkku.  Saunaklonkku ran back inside, and I got treated by the police officers.(Tuure’s perspective.)I was in the basement, looking at old stuff with my flashlight. I heard the old basement door creaking open, and I said “Hey, look what I found!” but there was no answer. I pointed my flashlight at the door, and I saw Saunaklonkku. I started to think and chose a peaceful approach saying that i can leave without causing any harm, but he just laughed in a creepy laugh and knew my friends were...dead. The talking could not work so i threw my flashlight at Saunaklonkku’s head, but it did nothing. It ran towards me, grabbed me, and threw me at a brick wall. I heard some of my ribs breaking when I hit the wall, and blood started flowing from my mouth. Saunaklonkku ran towards me and tried to rip my back open, but I got free. I tried to run to the basement door, but I slipped on a mud puddle and something sharp cut my hand open, I also hit my head on an old frying pan. Blood was gushing out of my hand and head, but when I tried to get back up, Saunaklonkku threw a cooking knife at my leg, trapping me to the ground. It ripped off both of my hands off, blood getting everywhere and bones cracking. A bone piece flew straight at my head, ripping a piece off my forehead. Then it ripped off my toenails slowly and painfully. Then Saunaklonkku slammed an axe on my legs, creating a very deep wound all the way from my skin to my bone. Then it got the axe again and slammed in on my chest and pulled in all the way to my waist. It opened my stomach and ripped all my organs out, including my spine. Then Saunaklonkku ripped all my hair out, ripped my eyes out and skinned me alive. After that, it ripped my head off with bare hands. My skin was only muscle and veins.After that, Saunaklonkku was never seen again… for now…Credits: SausageDoge (Reddit) : (Wrote chapter 3). @Privietfruit on reddit. Wrote chapter 1 n 2.

      "content_preview": "My family doesn't age like other people. My grandmother was 98 when she passed, but she looked 65, maybe younger. My great-uncle is 102 and still chops his own firewood. We've always credited it to \"good genes\" and our one sacred tradition: the \"Renewal Stew,\" served at every major family gathering. It was a rich, dark, savory stew that made you feel warm from the inside out, full of life.When Grandma Rose died, I was the one who inherited the old family farmhouse. Tucked away in her study, I finally found it: the original, handwritten recipe book, bound in cracked leather. I felt a thrill, like I was finally being let in on the secret.I opened it to the page for the Renewal Stew. It was mostly blank. There were no ingredients listed for the stew itself, only two cryptic notes in my great-great-grandmother's spidery script:For the Broth, see the cellar instructions.For the Seasoning, see the attic instructions.The cellar was damp and smelled of earth. Behind a stack of old canning jars, I found a loose stone in the wall. Pulling it free revealed a dark, hidden chamber. Inside, arranged in neat rows, were a dozen large, unglazed clay pots filled with a dark, peaty soil. A thick, pale, gnarled root snaked out of the soil in each pot, looking disturbingly like a human hand.A dusty journal sat on a small table. The entries, dating back to the 1800s, described the process. When a member of our family dies, they aren't buried or cremated. They are \"Planted.\" Their bodies are prepared with a special mixture of herbs and laid to rest in these pots. Over the years, the soil and the body produce a \"Life Root.\" This root is harvested, boiled for three days, and becomes the broth for the Renewal Stew.I felt a wave of nausea. We weren't just eating stew. We were consuming the concentrated essence of our dead ancestors.Shaking, I went to the attic. In a locked trunk, I found a collection of small, ornate silver boxes, each engraved with the name of a living family member. I found my own, my name freshly engraved. Inside each box was a small, sharp, obsidian knife. Another journal explained the final step. The \"Seasoning.\" It wasn't a spice. At each gathering, every family member present must make a \"living contribution\" to the stew. A few drops of blood. A sliver of fingernail. A tear, cried directly into the pot. This offering of the living is what \"awakens\" the ancestral broth.I slammed the book shut, my hands trembling. It was a grotesque, cannibalistic ritual. I vowed I would never participate.The next major gathering was for the autumn equinox. I made an excuse not to go, claiming I had the flu. I felt a sense of righteous defiance.A week later, my mother called, her voice thin and weak. \"Your Aunt Carol isn't doing well,\" she said. \"She's had a... a sudden decline.\"I drove to my aunt's house. The woman who opened the door was a stranger. She looked 80 years old, her skin thin and translucent like parchment, her hair patchy and white. But it was Aunt Carol. She was only 58. She looked at me, her eyes wide with a desperate, hungry light.\"You didn't come,\" she rasped, her hand gripping my arm with surprising strength. Her fingernails were cracked and yellow. \"The stew... it wasn't strong enough. It's always weaker when someone is missing.\"I finally understood. We don't have \"good genes.\" We have a curse. A rapid, horrifying decay that is constantly trying to claim us. The stew isn't a fountain of youth; it's the only thing that holds the rot at bay. We aren't living long lives; we are desperately, grotesquely staving off an accelerated death.The winter solstice is next month. My mother called again yesterday. She told me my great-uncle's hands are so stiff he can no longer hold an axe. She told me she found a new gray hair, and when she plucked it, a small patch of skin came with it.Then she asked if I would be coming home for the solstice. Her voice was casual, but the question hung in the air, heavy and raw.They need me. They need my contribution.I'm looking at the small silver box with my name on it. The little black knife sits inside, cold and sharp. I have a choice. I can go, participate in this stomach-churning ritual, and feed the curse to keep my family looking young and vibrant while I know the horrifying truth.Or I can stay here, clean and pure, and watch them all fall apart, knowing that the same rot is flowing through my own veins, waiting for its turn.",

      "content_preview": "After it all happened, I could never explain just what about the little wooden jewelry box had caught my eye. It was simple and unornamented.When questioned about what was inside it, Maggie, the antique shop’s keeper, hesitated before speaking. “That’s a collection of old silver, mostly jewelry and coins.”I nodded. “So a few thousand dollars, I suppose?” I went to put the box back.“Actually, not today. Today it’s on sale. You can get it for about $700. It’s been here for quite a while and I’ve been trying to get rid of it.” That gave me pause.This story isn't easy to tell. My memories have proved to be somewhat fragmented. What follows might not be the most straightforward retelling of events, But it reflects what I lived. Everything started that day in the antique shop. Just bear with me, if you will.Maggie and I go back a little. I started visiting her shop a couple of years ago and over that time had purchased everything from a 1960s toy piano to some original Mackintosh parts from the 1980s. Occasionally, I had gotten discounts on random stuff supposedly for being a loyal customer.“Why so low?” I asked.Maggie smiled. “You’ve been coming here regularly for years. I think I can do this one small thing in return for your business.”Alarm bells are probably ringing for some reading this right now. But in truth, I found it hard to be suspicious of this woman. She was very particular about the things she accepted to sell. I know that because I've sold her stuff before. It never crossed my mind that the jewelry could be fake.I don't know if any of you have guessed yet, but I'm one of those people that buys things and sells them at higher prices. Typically, I like to find things in need of some restoration. If that doesn't cost me too much, I can jack up the price pretty significantly when I'm done with it and still feel like I'm giving enough to the buyer. But there were exceptions to this, like today. Several antiques made from silver priced at a mere 700 bucks felt like the best opportunity I'd had to upsell in a while.I opened the box to give what was inside a look. Several rings, two necklaces, a cup, and some irregularly shaped pieces of metal tumbled onto the checkout counter. It looked like silver. Surely it was real.I picked up one of the larger silver chunks. The thing was trying very hard to be a circle, but failing. On its uneven surface, I could make out a design of sorts depicting a castle and next to it the image of what I now know was a lion. Encircling these was a shield, which separated the symbols into quadrants. To the left of the shield was the letter P, and to the right was the letter D. The lower part of the shield contained a couple of other symbols.Maggie came up beside me. “Those are old Spanish coins. This one you see was their largest denomination, the eight reales. These were struck by hammers, so they're all a little uneven and some are cracked. It's quite rare to see any silver this old that looks like it was minted yesterday.” She laughed and dropped the coin back into the box.Later, I put on both necklaces and two rings. Most of the rings were undecorated. One of them had designs on it reminiscent of the Spanish coins. And another one just had some weird-looking shapes engraved in it. The necklaces were more strange. They were simple, thin silver chains, although the links themselves were hollow pieces of metal strung through with a cord. One of the necklaces was a cross, the other was a tiny pendant representing what on closer inspection appeared to be a man holding some sort of implements in his hands.It occurred to me that it would probably be best to put each piece up individually for sale. I'd recently been in a car accident, and both my car and my body had needed repairs that I was now slowly paying off. But surely I could enjoy wearing 300-year-old jewelry for a couple of days at least.I started to get compliments at work. For once, people wanted to talk to me. One guy, who I knew to be a silver collector mainly because he took any and every opportunity to talk about it, pulled me aside to say that if I were curious about the silver’s origin, I could bring him one of the coins. In the same sentence, he told me about a nice, fancy Italian place nearby that we could grab dinner at if I wanted. I wasn't very interested in that proposition, so I told him that I might take him up on that at some point in my life.A few days after I began wearing the jewelry, the dreams started. All I remember now are brief moments and impressions. Tunnels of some sort underground. Dark spaces illuminated by oil lamps and candles. Hammers, chisels, pickaxes, coughing. The shouting of workers. Distant sounds of earth shifting, maybe even falling. We chipped away at the rock that imprisoned us in hopes of something better. Over and over, these dreams repeated. I began to dread sleep.I found the silver cup on my counter right next to the coffee machine in the early hours of the second morning following the dreams. I must have left it there at some point, though I had no memory of doing this, nor did I have any recollection of it being there before that very moment. But what the hell? A person only lives once. One may as well take the opportunity to drink their morning brew from a silver cup if it is presented to them.The cup was one item that I hadn't paid much attention to. My fingers traced the floral designs on its rounded surface. It was cool to the touch as I lifted it from the counter, but began to warm almost immediately in my hand.The cup's design was like a goblet's, although it was not particularly tall. It was wide at the top, but tapered down to a stem for holding. Below that, the base flared out a bit to offer it more support. I could feel something engraved on the bottom. Upon closer inspection, it was a set of initials. I could see my reflection inside the cup, although the edges of my face were curved somewhat. A minute later, I had a steaming cup of coffee in front of me. A splash of milk went in, then some sweetener.As I brought the cup to my mouth, I had a strange flashback to that one gruesome scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where what's his name? Wallis? Donald? Whoever he is, he drinks from a cup which he presumes to be the Holy Grail only to end up in a pile of bone dust because the cup he had chosen was in fact not the Holy Grail.The warm, sweet liquid passed my lips. There are some psychopaths out there who slurp their coffee. I am not one of them. After a moment, I took another sip. This time, there was a little grit. Usually, this only made an appearance at the very bottom of the cup. Strange. I brought the cup to my lips for more.It was too late by the time I realized that the grit I was tasting couldn't be from coffee. It seemed somehow both earthy and metallic. I spat out what was left of it in my mouth and began to retch over the trash can. But there was nothing to be done. The grit clung to the insides of my throat.I grabbed the cup. The coffee inside was now clouded by flecks of what seemed to be a fine gray dust. As I took deep, heaving breaths, I could feel the smallest of particles from it enter my lungs. It would seem I chose — poorly.That night, I decided that maybe I could use some blackened chicken Alfredo after all. Silver Bro took one look at the coins I had brought and whistled. He called them cobs. “That’s Spanish silver.”“So it’s real?” I asked. I trusted Maggie completely, but it was good to hear this from someone else.“Oh, I’m pretty certain this is real.” The guy launched into an explanation of exactly why that was, but I stopped paying attention after the first five minutes. Usually, I like to learn about the things that I'm reselling. But with this silver, I just couldn't make myself care where it had come from and what its history was.Silver Bro kept making offers to exchange me something for a single piece of jewelry, or even one of the smaller cobs. I said no of course. His offers pissed me off for some reason, a lot. And I didn't know why.Then he showed me some cobs of his own. But where mine were perfectly preserved, his had turned almost black. He noticed this too, and remarked that it was very strange that in all this time there didn't seem to be any sign of corrosion on my silver.\"I must be lucky,\" I replied. But he wasn't. Although the guy certainly knew his way around silver, he didn't seem to know his way around much of anything else, so there was no second date.When I got home, I saw 2 missed calls from Maggie. She had left a voicemail. I'll just paste the transcription here.\"Olivia?\" Let's pretend that's my name. \"It's Maggie. That silver I sold to you. I was wondering if I might have it back? I'll pay you ten times what you gave me for it. I shouldn't have sold it. It's real and all, but it wasn't mine to give. If you could call me back or come in tomorrow, I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement. I’m very sorry about this.\" Just please call me back when you can. It's important. Thanks.\"No. Absolutely not. It was my silver now. I bought it at the price she had asked. It was mine, not hers. Did Maggie only just now see the value of what she had given me? I trusted her. Now here she was trying to take my good fortune away. Such betrayal.Another call came in the next day. Betrayal! And then another. I blocked her number.That night I had a new dream. I was flying far above snow-capped mountains. The air up here was clean. I could breathe. Spreading out below me was everything and everyone I'd ever known and would ever know. This is what the silver could do for me. I could have everything I'd ever wanted. I just had to let go of the tiniest fraction of it.But should I? This treasure was too perfect to let go. Maybe I'd just sell one item and keep the rest for myself. I knew that I would never have such magnificent pieces in my hands ever again if I let them go now.The following day was a Saturday, so I could look forward to doing nothing but snacking and binge-watching another season of Charmed. And that's exactly what I did for about three hours before I was interrupted by a knock on my front door.“I'm not interested!\" I called. The knock came again.\"There is no Jesus Christ in this house! I roll with Satan!\" Surely that would make them go away. But nope. The knock came a third time, and I could hear a familiar voice calling out my name over it. What the fuck? It was Maggie.I jabbed at the pause button on my remote, forced myself out of the recliner, and marched to the front door.\"Do you know what no means?\" I demanded after wrenching it open.\"Olivia,\" Maggie began. \"I'm just here to talk.\" If I hadn't been sleeping well lately, Maggie hadn't been sleeping at all. I could swear that there were more streaks of white through her hair than I'd seen a few days ago.\"I just need to warn you. The silver is dangerous. You should get rid of it as soon as possible.”\"Dangerous?\" I asked incredulously. \"It's a bunch of random silver that's older than you are. It won't bite.\" She was still trying to get it back from me.Maggie frowned. \"You need to understand! The person who sold the silver to me. I looked into his story. Something happened to him. And he wasn't the only one.\"I stifled a laugh. \"Like what? He wanted money? Yeah, that happens sometimes. And then you gave him money. So where's the issue?\" Maggie stiffened.“Can I see it?\" she asked timidly.\"Sure,\" I replied after a moment.I turned around and went back inside. The thought of fetching that box for her didn't even cross my mind. My silver necklaces jingled as I stocked into the kitchen. I searched through the silverware drawer. But it wasn't there. Of course it wasn't. I wheeled around and found the drawer with larger cutting utensils.There it was. A meat cleaver. I grabbed it and walked back. Without hesitating, I pulled open the door and brandished the cleaver at Maggie.\"Go,\" was all I said.\"Olivia.\" Maggie was whispering now. \"The silver is driving you mad!\" A hint of desperation had entered her voice.\"Yeah I'm mad,\" I started. \"Can't a girl watch Charmed in peace?\" Maggie's shoulders slumped.\"Death follows that silver wherever it goes. For your own sake Olivia, destroy it.\" With that, Maggie turned and left me standing alone on my porch, waving a meat cleaver at no one.She could have stayed. Maybe I'd have realized the truth sooner if she had. Then again, maybe not. She had to protect herself too, and looking back, I'm glad that she left.The dreams alternated over the next couple of days. In them, I both saw and felt two different worlds. Two different possibilities. I was destined to fly. And the other people, well, it really wasn't my problem what they were destined for was it?Nights were no longer quite so unpleasant. Yet I still found myself waking early in the morning. The days blurred past. From work to home, from home to work, and from work to home I went. Interspersed through all of that were long stretches of time when I found myself staring into the bed of silver at the bottom of that little box.A hundred little distorted reflections of myself looked back. Then, all at once, they coalesced into one. Those irregularly shaped coins had arranged themselves into a mosaic which reflected a strange and terrible image of myself at me. Although the coins were still uneven and the reflection was distorted in parts, I could see my gaunt face clear as day. There were dark circles beneath my eyes.It was those dreams. All those things I didn't care to think about or understand. They only made me restless. I really needed to see if there was a way to suppress them. No matter. I could surely pay for any help I would need. This realization put my mind at ease.I continued to ponder my newfound wealth as my reflection stared back at me. That is, the reflection of my face along with that of a man standing behind me. My chair fell back as I leaped to my feet and whirled around. There was nothing aside from the wall of my office and the bed where I slept.Then my eyes slid to a clock mounted on the wall. It was well past midnight. But my memories were vague from the time I'd finished dinner and come in here to make a couple of listings on eBay. My computer wasn't even open. Clearly, I needed rest.The man must have realized that time was running short. Because he spoke to me that night. He told me about the mountain that ate men. A place whose original name had long since been forgotten. It had been a place of worship once. Then the hungry ones came, one Diego Huallpa who served them discovered silver, and his masters in their disease and hunger sought to take the mountain's riches instead.Now its only name was Rich Mountain. Over the centuries, men toiled in its belly, and even as they sought to eat the mountain, just to carve a little piece of it out for themselves and their masters, the mountain ate them too. Untold numbers of boys and men were consumed even as the fruits of their labor were carted off on ships to a distant land and the mountain that once stood tall slowly bent under the weight of a thousand hammers and chisels.But the silver was cursed. Everywhere it went, misfortune followed. The hungry ones who condemned their slaves and subjects to death in that mine accumulated so much silver that the metal lost its value, and chaos rained. Like an accident of their own, the hungry ones’ empire crumbled to dust, leaving only remnants in its wake. But the hungry ones had left their former subjects with very little, and so it was that men and boys went back into the mine. By that point, the rich mountain had been so depleted of silver that the people turned to mining tin.Every miner signed a contract with the first strike of his hammer. The earth would allow them all to take some of its bounty, yes, but it would exact a heavy price from any who dared or was forced into such an agreement with it. The little fortune any man gained would be offset by an early end to his life. The only thing to be determined really was if a miner would be killed there and then in the depths of the underworld, or if they would only die later on the surface, when their lungs were so ravaged by those little fine particles that they could no longer breathe.Now the mountain was part of a nation populated by some twelve million people named after a certain celebrated liberator. There was no more corporation, crown  or state to impose on the miners. The mountain was in the hands of the people, on paper. But despite how much the world had progressed, things didn't improve much in the tunnels. Wealth grows with time, but only when one is lucky enough to possess it. Their wealth had been stolen.The mountain was still eating, even in its throes of death. And now foreigners came from far and wide to play pretend at understanding the life of a people born in circumstances alien to them. Through all of this, the silver never disappeared. It was still scattered all over the world, along with all of the greed and loss that had preceded it.Images flashed through my mind. Different people gazed into the box, each with the same gleam in their eye. Then, one by one, they were all killed, and the silver found its way into new hands. The circumstances under which these killings took place were always a little different. But the results were without fail the same. One person would acquire the little box, and another would grow envious. It was only a matter of time before blood was spilled, and the silver changed hands in an endless cycle of violence.The last image to appear to me was a terrified Maggie standing just out of reach of the meat cleaver I'd waved around so carelessly. I had been prepared to kill to protect something that was never mine. And there wasn't much I could say for myself. Really, there wasn't much any of the silver's victims, be they murderers or the murdered, could say for themselves. All the silver had done was awaken something that was already there somewhere deep inside of us.I became aware of myself, of the burning on my neck and fingers. The box was lying still open on my desk. The silver inside it glowed red-hot. I shot to my feet and grabbed the box. I tore out of my office and into the living room. I turned on and opened the fireplace. The box went inside first and began to burn immediately. Then I ripped off my necklaces with such force that the cords cut into the back of my neck as they snapped, and blood flowed down my back. The rings came off more easily. All of it went into the fire.The wooden box was reduced to ashes as I watched. But everything inside remained. Slowly, each piece melted down into globs of molten silver, before those fused together into an amorphous shape. The shape slowly gained more definition until it resolved into a humanoid figure. As I watched, the image of a man holding a hammer and chisel pushed its way out of the figure. It was the man who had spoken to me, and the man whose likeness I'd been wearing in miniature on my neck for days.The metal cooled, and as if knowing its job was done, the fireplace shut off on its own. The miner stepped out. He was covered head to toe in a fine gray dust. The silver no longer glowed; in fact, its entire surface had become tarnished. The miner turned to stare up at me. He didn’t say a word. He didn’t need to. The silver had been kept pristine by the suffering of those who extracted it. But the spirit inside had finally been released, and the silver crumbled to dust before my eyes.For the first time in a long while, I could think with clarity. My curse had been broken. I was no longer enchanted by the blood silver. But the mountain was becoming hollow. The people still worked and died within it for a pittance. Yet all these years later, the hungry ones were still hungry, and all the riches in the world wouldn’t be enough to satiate them.",

      "content_preview": "I know this title seems dumb and weird but I need help because I saw it last night. I was minding my own business cooking when a movie I was watching finished. It auto played to a man standing in a room with a light beaming down with his back facing towards the camera.He was like that for a minute or longer. He then adjusted himself and turned around to face the camera. He was wearing a nice suit and tie with shaggy hair. You just couldn't see his face. No it wasn't like he was missing his face. You could see his lips. It was the lighting of the room. It was like a spotlight for a stage.He then began to speak. I couldn't remember most of it for it just sounded like rambling. He would start on one subject and then immediately jump to the next. It was kinda disorienting.I was gonna shut it off when he started another ramble.“I remember seeing her for the first time. She was so perfect. I thought right then and there she would be my home. Someone I couldn't live without.” A smile of delight grew on his face.“The first few interactions were bumping into each other. We had been working at the same place. She was just starting and I had been there for a while. Her smile was like magic. I would intentionally find ways for me to bump into her. She was my little way into heaven.” He was rubbing his ring finger.“It took awhile to convince her to go on a date with me. She was worried about how it would affect work, how they would look at us, normal little things. When we did go I took her to this lavish place downtown. It was beautiful and perfect. I knew she would love it…. She did, she was absolutely smitten. I could see it on her face and how she did her little excited dance. We ordered some basic fancy food like steak and lobster. The shit that makes a dent in the pocket. I would do it all for her though. When we got done at the restaurant I took her stargazing. I had found this perfect place not too far from the city. It was a place perfect for a first kiss.” He stumbled with his words for a second.“She was so pretty. I was staring at her more than the stars. I think she knew but didn't care. She looked at me at one point and all I could stare at were her lips. They called me. Now maybe I was a little all over and wine drunk but I went for it. Something sober me wouldn't have done. The more I think back on it, I lucked out. She kissed me back and from there it was history.” The excitement growing in his voice was like a little kid getting a toy.“We would go on more dates. Get more daring at the work place. Finally we decided to go home and… and have sex. It felt like heaven. I had never felt anything better.” The euphoria on his face was growing exponential at this point.“It wasn't long though. I had forgotten one thing. One simple thing. That my wife hadn't worked today and was only dropping the kids off for school. You could see the red in her eyes before she swung the axe. It hit me first and went straight through the back of my skull. I didn't feel the pain. I was dead on the spot. The lady on the other hand wasn't so lucky. They say they are still finding pieces of her all over the neighborhood.” He chuckled on that remark.“My wife turned herself in only after drowning our son. Saying that was her only crime…. They found me a couple days afterwards. Head off and penis cut off. I think that being her last fuck you to me.” He paused for a moment before dropping the smile.“September 4 2025 8:00 am” he said before the tv cutting back to some old film. I was confused to say the least. It only got worse when I woke up the next morning to the work group chat saying the boss had been killed. That his wife went crazy or something. Not all the details are known except there are two more victims. One being their child and the other being unknown.I just need to know if I was the only one to see it. Thank you for your time",

      "content_preview": "When I was a kid, from around the ages of 2-10, I always watched the same show after school.“Dandy’s Wondrous Adventures.”It was a show that I had kept tabs on ever since I was a baby. It had been with me since the beginning, and for good reason.Even as an adult, I can point out the many lessons the show taught me as a boy.How to tie my shoes, how to properly eat, how to keep up conversations, etc.It was a much needed show for a kid of my upbringing.My dad had died before I was born in a botched robbery, and my mother worked as a surgeon, meaning she was gone most of the day, coming back home around 9-10 at night.So, most of my youthful lessons were taught by the show.Every episode entered the same: Dandy, an anthropomorphic dandelion, and his sisters Rosie, Daisy, and Blue Bonnie, would run up a hill, click their heels (which were leaves,) face the viewer, and ask how their day had gone.They’d wait for about 5 seconds, and would respond.If the episode was oriented around something happy, they’d all smile and say “That’s terrific!”If it was oriented around something not happy, they’d all share a small look of unanimous dissatisfaction and say “Well ain’t that a shame?”Every time I came home from school, I’d divulge into the characters on how my day went.I always would be disappointed when my response didn’t match theirs, and it never did. I tallied the times I matched their response with mine, and I was down by 47 marks to my 0.Regardless, it was nice to see whatever my favorite cast of characters had in store for me that day.However, this static stream of constant enjoyment changed one afternoon.It was a rainy April day, and I had just gotten home after the torrent of watery sheets had ended its assault on me.I had no homework for the day, and after finishing all of my chores, I galloped upstairs to turn on my TV and pay a visit to my friends. Once again, the episode entered the same way, with Dandy and his sisters dancing up the hill, stopping, and asking me how my day had gone.My day had gone pretty poorly. At school, I had a teacher named Ms. Carol. I was the quiet, nerdy type in elementary school, so Ms. Carol saw me as easy pickings.She’d berate me day in and day out about how weird I was, how I had no friends, and how I was a loser. Any time I tried to report her, no one believed me. Usually I didn’t respond, but today hurt a lot worse.One of my classmates told her about my dad, and used the newfound information as ammunition against me.She’d never hit me, but it felt like she did.It hurt.I confided with Dandy on the issue.How much I hated her, how rude she was, and my anger towards her for being such a jerk.In my endless tirade about how much I deplored her, it had slipped my mind that Dandy hadn’t said anything. It had gone well over 5 seconds, but they didn’t speak.No interruptions.No exclamations.Nothing.Silence.Even the music had ceased.Once my rant had subsided, I turned to look at the TV.Their expressions were not the usual ones they wore.They didn’t look happy or mildly sad.No.They looked mad.All of them wore this expression of intense grimace, like someone had just told them off, or stole something and gotten caught doing it.Dandy looked the angriest.“How rude.” He said, his speech sounding as if his teeth were clenched.Blue Bonnie stepped up to the screen, her arms crossed, staring dead at me like a hawk.“People like that are just so bad, right?” She proclaimed.“You said it!” They all announced. Slowly, their expressions of disdain faded.Dandy spoke up again “Well, it's a good thing we’re talking about bullies today, huh?”They all shook their heads in approval.The episode transitioned to a school area, where they all gathered in what I would guess was the cafeteria. It was rosily colored, with hints of bright pink, yellow, green, and red across all the furniture in the room, ranging from tables to art. Common colors for a kids show.Rosie pointed at another flower. He wasn’t a part of the usual cast, but they all regarded him with some level of knowledge.“That’s Ms. Wiltkens. She’s the worst!” Rosie exclaimed.“She’s the school bully here. And worst of all, she’s a teacher! Everyone is scared of her.” Daisy said.Dandy took his place in the center of the screen.“To get a bully off of you, sometimes you have to teach them a good lesson. Give them a reason to think twice before messing with you. Right guys?”They all unanimously uttered and “mhm” before turning all at once to the screen.Blue Bonnie looked at everyone else.“But won’t you get in trouble for something like that?” She said.They all looked at her before turning back to face me.“To get a bully off of you? It’s worth it.”Their expressions then changed to one of a kinder look, smiling warmly at me before returning to the hill.They all joined in unison to wish me good luck for tomorrow, as they always did, before the credits rolled.I was stunned. It was like the universe had aligned at that exact moment to help me with my problem.But it was the wrong solution.As much as I despised her, it wasn’t worth it to get in a whole load of trouble for fighting a teacher.What good would it do to help my problem anyway.I’d have to do some serious damage to her for the bullying to cease. A simple hit to the nose would just make my problems worse.It honestly felt like the advice they had given me was, for the first time……bad.By that moment, the constant pitter patter of rain had lulled me into a drowsy mess, so I decided to take a quick nap and recuperate.My head touched the soft, comforting surface of my pillow, and I slipped away into my dreams.Around 7:30, I awoke to one hell of a wakeup call.“WAKE UP.”It was violent. Aggressive. Booming. As though a prison warden was waking up an inmate.There was no friendliness in the command. No leeway.Just rage.I popped out of my bed like a meerkat that had sensed an impending threat, but when I did, I saw that the TV had been turned on.And there he was.Dandy.However, strangely enough, his sisters weren’t there.The background was dark, nearly pitch black, with only the moon present in the frame. The grass that was usually bright had turned sickly, adorning a new, yellowish color.“So you won’t listen?” Dandy said, his eyes furrowed into a deep, burning glare.“We are trying to help you with a problem, like we have for years.”I didn’t know what to say. It felt as if my body was stuck. Was this sleep paralysis? Was it a dream?“Do you not like us anymore?”Before I could find the courage to stammer anything out, his sisters came into the shot.“Because we don’t like you. We never liked you.”Their words burned, while my throat felt like it was held in place with barbed wire.Dandy moved forward.“Maybe she’s right. Maybe you are a loser.”They all began to snicker, until it eventually devolved into laughter.They shot out snide remarks, comments about my hair, face, and anything they could latch on to.They even bit into my dad’s death.“He probably did it on purpose. Who would want to have a son like you?” Rosie said.“I bet he faked his death to get away from you!” Blue Bonnie said.“Or maybe he did it himself out of disappoin-” before Dandy could finish what he was going to say, I shut the TV off.I was a hot mess of tears, snot, and fear. Balled up on my bed, I couldn’t bring myself to move until morning came.It was a Saturday, and mom was at work still. She was the hospital’s best surgeon, meaning there were quite a few weekends where she’d be gone for half the day.I wanted to get up out of bed to get breakfast, but I was still in shock after the incident the night prior.Was it a dream? Was it just my imagination?No. It couldn’t have been.I felt everything.All those words, insults, and crude remarks.I felt them all.After much thought, I finally crawled out of bed, and went downstairs.The sky had cleared since yesterday, with a bright, beautiful hue of blue and yellow beaming down for all to enjoy.After eating a healthy bowl of cereal, I returned to my room, and decided to see if I could get some gaming in. I usually gamed during the weekends anyway, as my mom didn’t let me play during school days.After a couple hours on the console, a familiar, yet mellow voice snapped my attention back to the TV.“Hey, friend.”It was Dandy again.In the past, that voice would be a source of comfort.Now, it frightened me.I stood still, my head not daring to look back at the character who had become just as oppressive as my teacher.“Look at me. Please.”Dandy’s voice wasn’t violent this time. It had the same warm aura it had had before the previous night.He sounded apologetic.I slowly looked over my shoulder.They were all there this time. Dandy, Bonnie Blue, Daisy, and Rosie.But they weren’t standing. They were sitting on the hill.The background had returned to its entrancing bright blue color, and the grass looked healthy again.Everything had returned to normal, apart from the characters.Their faces now expressed a look of regret.A deep regret.“We’re sorry, friend. We didn’t mean to lash out like that.” Bonnie Blue said, her eyes sporting a much brighter, kinder look.“It isn’t you. It’s us.” Daisy said, her leafy hands clasped together in her lap.“We know you still like us. Really, we do!” Rosie exclaimed.Dandy then took his turn to look at me, his character near the leftmost part of the frame.“We had an issue like you once. Ms. Wiltkens would treat us badly. She hated every kid she saw in that school, but for us? She hated us the most.”I moved from my chair to stand right in front of the TV, my ears, eyes, and mind completely intertwined with the screen in front of me.It was unbelievable.“She said that we were troubled children who deserved to be alone.” Daisy said.“We had no parents of our own, so we relied on her.” Dandy said.“One day, Ms. Wiltkins said that she had enough with our behavior. She dragged us into the drawing room, locked us in, and left us there.” Bonnie Blue proclaimed.Dandy looked up from his lap, his eyes a constant of sadness and misery.“We never left.” He said.“We don’t want the same for you.” Rosie announced.“You made us happy. So we want you to be happy. We just got scared that you might move on the same path.” Dandy said.I smiled at the TV, beaming happiness through their kind words.It was still a show at the end of the day, so I thought that this was their way of teaching courtesy and openness.“But we think it's time for us to say goodbye.”My smile quickly dissipated into a slightly open mouth, my eyes wide with surprise.“You’re getting old now. Big and strong, just like your dad!” Daisy exclaimed, her smile replacing mine.“We’ve taught you all we can, friend.” Rosie said.I grasped the TV, words slowly bubbling into my throat of pleas for them to stay.“We always cared about you. Even when you were with us back there.” Bonnie Blue said.They all stood up, and took each other's hands, and smiled the widest smiles I’d ever seen them showcase.My head was pressed up against the glass panel separating me from them, my eyes a waterfall of emotion and distress. I begged for them not to leave.“Thank you for tuning in with us, friend!” They all said.Slowly but surely, the screen faded to black, and in big white letters, the words “The End” covered the TV.Then, it cut to static.All that remained was me.Weeping, and shattered.Years later, on my sixteenth birthday, after a big party with my closest friends, of whom I had many of at that point, my mom called me into the living room.I thought that maybe there was another present waiting for me, so I eagerly waltzed into the room, with an immense pep in my step.But my mom did not share my enthusiasm. She looked sullen, and tense.“Sit down, please.” she said, her voice controlled and centered, yet anxious.I complied, my own appearance visibly moving downwards into a look of paralleled seriousness.“I know that it’s your big day, but we need to talk about something. Something I’ve been meaning to tell you for a while.”What proceeded to be said to me shook the core of my world forever.My mom told me that, while it was true that my dad had died in a botched robbery, he wasn’t truly my real dad, and that she wasn’t my real mom.I had lost my original family a year after I was born in a car accident on the freeway after a truck had lost control, and slammed into the side of their car.They died on impact.I was lucky, as I had been at daycare, which they were coming to pick me up from.I had no extended family, so I was put in the foster care program, and adopted by a woman named Ms. Wilkins, who was a boarding school teacher in her past.According to mom, she was an extremely cruel woman, who would regularly beat her adopted children for the littlest of reasons, ranging from breathing too loud to having a cough.One day, however, she went too far, when 4 of her children, after supposedly protecting me from a vicious beating, were locked in a room for a week.They didn't come back out.The other kids, including myself, were not let out of the house after that to avoid any of us telling another person what she had done to them.Eventually, the neighbors noticed how we weren’t ever leaving, and called the police.Ms. Wilkens was sentenced to life in prison.I was stunned, unable to move, as though I was locked in place by my feet.“Take as much time as you need to process this. I'm right here.” My mother said.As my mind began to make sense of it all, I started having sparks fire off in my brain.Ms. Wilkens…I could’ve swore I knew that name from somewhere.Wilkens.Wilkens.Wilkens…And then, it hit me like a boulder rolling down a hill.Ms. Wiltkins, the teacher from the show.I rushed out of the living room, up to my bedroom, and threw my computer open with almost lightning fast speed.I looked up the case, typing everything I could in, praying I could find something.4 of the 5 searches propped up generic results of other heinous foster parents, but then, on my fifth search, I found it.“Boarding school teacher charged with 4 counts of first-degree murder after locking children in room.”I scrolled through the article, and everything aligned with what my mom had said. There was no mention of my name anywhere, but the presence of them defending another kid was in the article. Along with it, photos of the drawings they made while locked inside were posted onto the article itself.All pictures of them as flowers.At the bottom, it listed the names of the deceased children.My heart sank, and my jaw followed its motion.Rosalina MatthewsBonnabel LeeDaisy McMullenDaniel MorelloI had no words. I had no movement.It felt as though the world itself had spun upside down, and I was bearing the brunt of it.Snapping out of my haze, I looked up the cartoon.I searched for what felt like hours.Nothing.Not a single mention of any show titled “Dandy’s Wondrous Adventures.”It made no sense.What the hell was I watching then?Did I imagine it?Was I going through some sort of trauma induced hallucination?It shattered what little grip on reality I had left at that moment.Their names, the show, the antagonist of that one rainy day.It all neatly funneled into this one case that I had apparently been involved with when I was just a toddler.And yet, it only added more complexities.And more emotions.Fear.Confusion.Sadness.Empathy.And finally, courage.I’m 28 now, and I have been an animator for over 8 years. Recently, I pitched the idea for Dandy’s Wondrous Adventures to the board, and just yesterday, it was approved.I did it for them.Whether or not the show I watched was real, this one will be, and I want it to help people just like me.Just like them.I’ve never told anyone this story, and I never planned to.Until today.As of writing this, I received an envelope at my door from an anonymous writer.All it says on the front of the envelope is “From: Your Friends.”Inside the envelope was a crumpled, old, worn piece of paper. It looked as though it had been set out in the sun for years.On one side of the paper was a drawing, as though it was made by a kid.Or rather, a group of kids, as the styles are all different.It looked fresh, completely out of place with the worn down canvas that had been used.On the drawing is them.The characters.They all adorn beautiful white wings, and halos above their heads, while a small, pretty purple butterfly guides them towards the sun.All of them are hand in hand, just like the last time I saw them.On the back, in four corners of the paper, in yellow, indigo, red, and white, was the same phrase, again and again, yet the meaning and significance of the phrase remained constant.“Thank you.”In the middle, a heart presented itself, with it colored in quadrants, the same colors used for the messages.…Thank you too, friends.",

      "content_preview": "I took the night security job at Mount Green University's Spring Hill Campus because I needed the money. Simple as that. The pay was decent, the hours worked with my class schedule, and how hard could it be watching over a few farm animals and a weather station?I should have known something was off when they spent more time on the \"rules\" than actual job training.Spring Hill Campus isn't like the main university. It's about twenty miles outside town, just the veterinary program's practical facilities - a few buildings, some pastures, stables, and that weather station sitting alone in the middle of a field. Across the street sits Mount Green Corrections, a medium-security prison that's been there since the 70s. The whole area feels isolated, especially at night.My supervisor, Jane, was a no-nonsense woman in her mid-forties who'd worked campus security for six years. On my first day, she handed me a laminated card and told me to memorize it.\"These aren't suggestions,\" she said, watching me read. \"Follow every single one, every single night. No exceptions.\"The rules were:NIGHT SECURITY PROTOCOLS - SPRING HILL CAMPUSAlways keep your radio on channel 2. If you come across a life or death situation, switch to channel 4.The campus currently has six pigs, three horses, and three cows. Always do a head count during evening rounds.Always lock the gate to the weather station.There is no scarecrow in the weather station field. Go inside immediately if you see one.All animals are to be inside by 9pm. If you hear any animals outside after this time, ignore them.Do not take the dirt road from the weather station to the stables anytime after 11pm. Stick to the path with the lamps.If you hear a window break near the stables, immediately recount the animals.DO NOT use the bathroom next to the stables. You are not safe there.If you think that one of the animals escaped somehow, leave it. It's probably not one of ours. Rule 6 applies here as well.Our horses love alfalfa treats. Feel free to give them one per night! If they don't eat them, immediately lock yourself in the security office.\"What's with rule 4?\" I asked. \"Why would there be a scarecrow?\"Jane's expression didn't change. \"There wouldn't be. That's the point.\"\"And rule 8? What's wrong with the bathroom?\"\"Just follow the rules, Marcus. They exist for good reasons.\"I wanted to ask more questions, but something in her tone told me the conversation was over.My first night started quietly enough. I arrived at 10pm, did the evening walkthrough Jane had shown me, and settled into the small security office in the main building. The horses - Titus, Belle, and Daisy - were happy to see me and eagerly accepted their alfalfa treats. Good sign, according to rule 10.At 11:30pm, I started my rounds. First stop: livestock count. Six pigs snoring in their pen, three horses drowsing in their stalls, three cows chewing cud. All accounted for.Next was the weather station. It sat about 200 meters from the main buildings, surrounded by a chain-link fence in the middle of an open field. As I approached, my flashlight beam caught something that made my stomach drop.The gate was standing wide open.I stopped walking, suddenly very aware of how dark it was outside the small pool of light from my flashlight. Rule 3 was clear: always lock the gate. But it was already open, which meant either someone else had been here, or...I swept my flashlight across the field beyond the weather station, and that's when I saw it.A dark shape stood motionless about fifty yards into the field. Tall, thin, arms outstretched. Even from a distance, I could tell it wasn't quite right - too tall, too still, positioned at an odd angle.Rule 4 flashed through my mind:There is no scarecrow in the weather station field. Go inside immediately if you see one.My hands started shaking. I fumbled for my radio, but what would I say? \"Hey, there's a fake scarecrow in the field like you said there might be?\" That sounded insane even to me.The shape hadn't moved, but I wasn't taking any chances. I backed away from the weather station, keeping my flashlight trained on the figure. It looked almost human from this angle, like someone standing with their arms spread wide. But the proportions were wrong somehow.As I retreated, I realized I was heading toward the stables. The main building felt too far away, and I was starting to panic. Rule 8 said not to use the bathroom next to the stables, but surely hiding there for a few minutes was better than standing exposed in the open?I made it to the stable building and found the small bathroom attached to the outside wall. The door was tucked into a shadowy alcove, partially hidden from view. I slipped inside and locked the door behind me.Inside, I tried to steady my breathing. The room was cramped, with a small window that looked out toward the pasture. I pulled out my phone to call Jane, but there was no signal. Of course.That's when I heard the footsteps outside.Slow, deliberate, circling the building. Too heavy to be human, but with a strange, uneven gait. I crouched low beside the window and carefully peered out from the corner, staying in the shadows.What I saw made my blood freeze.A creature moved across the open ground near the stables, and it wasn't human. It stood upright like a person, but too tall - maybe seven feet - with a lean, muscular frame covered in dark fur. Its head was elongated, wolf-like but eerily uncanny, with ears that were too large and positioned far too low on its head. In the moonlight, I could see its eyes reflecting light as it turned its head, scanning the area.The thing moved with a strange, loping gait, sometimes dropping to all fours before rising again to its full height. It was clearly searching for something - for me, I realized with growing horror.It approached the window, and I pressed myself against the wall, heart hammering. From my position in the corner, I could see it but remain hidden in the shadows. The creature's snout had pressed against the glass, threatening to shatter it. I could see sickly, large red and yellow eyes darting around, but finding nothing. Its mouth hung open, revealing rows of sharp teeth that caught the light.The thing tilted its head, studying the window with an intelligence that terrified me. It raised one clawed hand and tapped gently on the glass.Tap. Tap. Tap.I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. The creature's mouth moved, and I heard muffled sounds through the glass - it was trying to mimic human speech, though the words were distorted and wrong.Then sirens started wailing from across the street.The thing's head snapped toward the sound, and in an instant, it was gone. I heard rapid footsteps - multiple sets - moving away from the building toward the road. Through the window, I could see searchlights sweeping the area around Mount Green Corrections.I didn't waste time wondering what was happening at the prison. I burst out of the bathroom and ran for the main building, not stopping until I was inside the security office with every door locked.I spent the rest of my shift in that office, jumping at every sound. When Jane arrived at 6am to relieve me, I was still clutching my flashlight.\"Everything okay?\" she asked, though her tone suggested she already knew the answer.\"The weather station gate was open,\" I managed to spit out. \"And there was... something in the field.\"She went to the window and lit a cigarette. \"Did you follow the rules?\"\"Mostly. I used the bathroom by the stables.\"Her face darkened. \"Max, that rule exists for a reason. That bathroom has a window. Windows aren't safe after dark here.\"\"What the hell is going on? Whatarethose things?\"She was quiet for a long moment. Finally, she said, \"Get some rest. You'll be back tonight?\"\"I... I don't know.\"\"The job pays well for a reason. Think about it.\"As I drove home, I kept checking my mirrors. I needed the money - student loans weren't going to pay themselves. But did I need it badly enough to go back?By 9pm, I was putting on my uniform again.I told myself it was just the money. But deep down, I knew I had to understand what I'd seen. What were those things? How long had they been there? And why did Jane seem unfazed by everything I'd told her?Tonight, I'd be more careful. I'd follow every rule exactly.What could go wrong?",

      "content_preview": "Okay, I don’t really post much but I need to get this off my chest because I can’t sleep.We moved into a house on Redthorn Close earlier this year. It seemed like the perfect little cul-de-sac. Quiet, safe, family-friendly. We were excited for our daughter Sophie to grow up here.The neighbours at number 16 (the Hargreaves) introduced themselves on the second day. Older couple, probably late 50s. The husband barely blinks when he talks, and the wife smiles too much, like she’s rehearsed it in a mirror. They gave us a pie as a “welcome gift,” but it smelled off, almost chemical. We threw it away.That was the first red flag.After that, weird stuff started happening:At night we’d hear scratching inside the walls, like something was trying to get through.Our locks kept jamming, like someone had been messing with them.Sophie’s toys would disappear from our garden, then show up a few days later neatly arranged on the Hargreaves’ porch.I asked Mrs. Hargreaves if she’d seen Sophie’s missing doll once, and she just leaned in and whispered: “Children wander. Sometimes they don’t come back.”I laughed nervously but I haven’t forgotten it.At night we’d hear noises from their house thuds, dragging sounds, sometimes what honestly sounded like a muffled scream. My husband tried to call the police once when it got really bad, but weirdly the line was dead every time he picked up the phone. And their curtains always glowed red at night, like they had some kind of furnace burning.Then one evening, Sophie disappeared.The garden gate was wide open, and there was a trail of chalk drawings leading from our driveway straight to their house. I ran over in a panic and banged on their door. Mr. Hargreaves answered. His hands were raw and wet, like he’d been digging. He just said, “We haven’t seen her.” But I swear on my life I heard Sophie giggling inside.My husband lost it. That night he broke into their basement.What we found… I still shake thinking about it. The walls were lined with children’s shoes. Dozens of them. Some so old they looked like they’d been there for decades. Others looked almost new. There were shelves filled with dolls with missing eyes. And in the corner was a pit in the floor, covered with lime. Sophie was sitting at the edge of it, holding one of the dolls, absolutely terrified.When we grabbed her, we turned around and the Hargreaves were standing there. Just standing. Smiling like they’d been expecting us.“You wanted peace,” the wife said. “But Redthorn Close keeps its children.”We got Sophie out. We drove all night and we’ve never gone back to that house.Here’s the thing: I’ve Googled them. There’s nothing. No record. No photos. Like they don’t exist. And if you go to Redthorn Close today, their house looks perfectly normal. Curtains drawn. Garden neat. Like nothing ever happened.But sometimes… people still move into that cul-de-sac. Families with kids. And I don’t see them around for long.",

      "content_preview": "My name is Sameer. I was an engineering student until I wasn’t. I dropped out to chase acting, and I moved into this place because I needed my own hours. The rent is fifteen thousand a month, too cheap for Santacruz, and it came with fifteen rules from a landlord who never shows his face. I posted thosealready.I opened the diaryInside the front page a name was scrawled in block lettersShaanThe next page had something glued to it. A cut-out from a school ID card.A boy’s photograph. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Light blue uniform shirt, striped tie, the emblem of some school pressed into plastic. His hair was combed neatly, his eyes wide like he didn’t want to blink.17 October 2017Today is Diwali. The Festival of Lights. First time we lit rockets on the roof. Everyone counted down and the sky opened like a flower.I ate six kaju barfis. Dinner was puri with potato sabzi and kheer. I ate ten puris. Mom laughed and said run it off.My favorite firework is anar. The fountain that burns upward from the ground. I like it because it pushes light into the dark from below. It shows everyone’s faces.When it hissed and climbed I could see Dad and the uncles playing cards, Mom and the aunties laughing with bangles on their wrists, the watchman clapping once before pretending he didn’t.The air smelled of ghee and sugar smoke and the building itself seemed to smile.I went to bed smiling. Tomorrow is Sunday.18 October 2017A new man moved into 13B today. Dad said hmm, new guy, and Mom told me to carry flowers and a bowl of sweets.We went to greet him. He said his name is Ajmera. His hair was neat. He carried a tan briefcase.I thought he said he worked in fin… ninedance. Dad corrected me. Finance.He smiled at me. Mom told him if you ever need help, don’t hesitate. He said thank you and took a sweet. He chewed slowly, like he had to remember what to do with it.When he shook my hand it was cold. His palm was smooth and tight, like skin that healed wrong.19 October 2017Ajmera uncle called everyone to the community hall. He said he was holding a small prayer, a pooja, once a week. He told us prayers bring peace of mind, focus, and strength. He said prayer makes us powerful.We all sat cross-legged on the floor. He told us to close our eyes. His voice was low and steady and the words sounded like they were coming through water.I almost fell asleep.When it ended he gave us sweets. Black sesame and jaggery. They tasted strange, bitter and sweet at once, like medicine.He stood in front of each of us until we finished eating. I chewed and swallowed. Later I wished I hadn’t.20 October 2017This morning the water ran red.I woke to brush before school and the tap coughed brown, then red, and it stayed red. The smell was metallic. Like a coin in my mouth.Mom shouted not to touch it. Dad banged on doors and found out it was the same everywhere. The uncles and the watchman went to the terrace to check the tank.They found five stray dogs floating in the water. Throats cut. Eyes glassy. Their bodies swollen.I didn’t see them, but my friend’s father did. He came back without any words.They drained and scrubbed the tank, but all day the halls smelled of iron. At night the pipes made a wet sound like swallowing.In the evening I saw Ajmera in the stairwell. He stood very still, both hands wrapped around his briefcase as if he was holding a tray.He told me, “Bottled water only, beta.” He smiled as if he already knew.21 October 2017Ajmera came to our house today.Mom said he was doing a ritual for our health and well-being. She told me to be grateful, because such rituals are difficult and he was doing it free of charge.What job, I wondered. I never saw him leave the building.He lit too many incense sticks. He pulled a black jagged stone from his bag and placed it on a plate. We closed our eyes and prayed. My head felt heavy, drowsy.Before leaving he offered us prasad. The same black sesame and jaggery sweet.I put it in my mouth but spat it into the sink when no one was looking. The taste stayed. Like tar on my tongue.When he bowed goodbye, the cuffs of his shirt were damp.22 October 2017Sunita didi on the 14th was studying for her 10th exams again. She was kind. She always carried bags for the aunties and told me to study even when I hated it.Last week I gave her a chocolate for luck.Today Mom said I couldn’t visit. She has gone to God, she said. Later my friend whispered she had jumped.The aunties cried into their sarees. Their voices sounded like rain falling indoors.I looked up at the roof and saw a figure on the parapet. For one long second. A man. A briefcase in his hand.I blinked. Nothing there.The corridor smelled faintly of incense that didn’t belong to our house.23 October 2017School was closed. Everyone stayed in. Dad didn’t go to work.Police in brown uniforms stood at the gate and pulled tape across the entrance. I’ve only seen those uniforms in textbooks. Their shoes were too clean for our dust.They said someone died in 5A. My best friend Shiva lived there with his grandparents.I waited by the door.When Dad came back his face looked wrong. He whispered to Mom that all three had hung themselves. Mom broke in the kitchen. She tried to cry quietly, but I heard her.Ajmera was outside, speaking softly to the policemen. He poured them tea and stood too close to the tape.He said we are family. He said it twice, as if practicing.When he walked past me the smell of jaggery clung to him, heavy and old, with something like oil beneath it.His smile was too polite. Too long.I don’t want Mom to cry.______________________________________________________________The diary ended there. Blank pages followed. A pressed marigold hid between two sheets, its petals leaking a brown-orange stain into the paper like a wound that refused to dry.I shut the book and sat very still. The air in the flat felt thicker. The walls seemed to know I was awake.The building has a way of noticing you if you stare at it too long.Ajmera.I knew the name from when I was twelve, when the news shouted it over every channel. Dharavi ka Darinda.The Beast of Dharavi. Back then I didn’t understand.Now I was holding the words of a boy who had.The room was too dark. I walked into the hall for light.I pressed the switch. The bulb flickered once, then steadied. I tugged the fan cord without thinking, desperate for movement in the heavy air.The blades creaked into life, slow and uneven, and something swung with them.At first I thought the shadows were playing tricks.But then the shape turned, and my stomach turned with it.A boy was hanging from the fan. His body dangled by strips of cloth knotted around his arms and chest, dragging him upward into the blades as they spun.His uniform shirt was the same pale blue as the photo in the diary. His striped tie whipped against his swollen cheek with every rotation.The sound was worse than the sight. The fan groaned under his weight, each blade clipping the air with a labored wheeze. His shoes scraped the ceiling once, then swung back down.The smell hit a second later—incense gone sour, mixed with something metallic and rotten.His head lolled, eyes bulging, tongue black and heavy. And yet, as he turned with the blades, I swore his gaze locked on mine, just for a heartbeat each time he swung around.My knees gave out. I crashed to the floor, gasping like I was the one choking. I pressed my palms into my eyes, hard enough to see sparks.When I opened them again the fan spun empty. No rope. No boy. Just the creak of old blades and the echo of a smell that clung to the back of my throat.My heart was a drum in my chest. My vision blurred. I didn’t see the face properly, I told myself. I didn’t.But I knew. The jaw. The eyes.It looked like the boy in the photograph at the front of the diary.It looked like Shaan.My hands fumbled for my phone. I pulled up the landlord’s WhatsApp thread. The rules glowed back at me. I scrolled, desperate.Was there one about lights? About the fan? Who can remember fifteen rules when a boy is spinning above your head?As I was scrolling, my attention went to his profile picture And in my landlord's WhatsApp profile picture, the blurry one of the building at night… if I zoomed enough, I could swear the faintest light was shining from one flat.13B.It all endshere",

      "content_preview": "I’m a wildlife photographer. It’s a career built on patience, stillness and the ability to become just another silent, uninteresting part of the landscape. I’ve spent weeks at a time utterly alone in the vast, remote corners of national forests, my only companions were the whispers of the wind and the patient clicking of my camera’s shutter. I’ve waited fourteen hours in a cramped blind, motionless, just for a three second glimpse of a reclusive pine marten. Thats how I thrive on that solitude and how I love the deep, profound quiet of the wild. I always thought It’s where I feel most myself.At least, it used to be. Now, the silence is the most terrifying thing I know, because it’s never truly silent. And the solitude is a lie, because I am never, ever, truly alone.This all started three months ago. I was on a long-term project in a massive, sparsely populated national forest. It’s a primeval sort of place, full of ancient Douglas firs that tower like cathedral spires, their tops lost in a perpetual mist. My goal was to capture a portfolio of the elusive Cascade red fox, a beautiful but notoriously shy creature.For the first few weeks, it was business as usual. I’d rise before dawn, hike miles into the backcountry, and set up, waiting for the forest to offer up its secrets. One evening, I got the shot I’d been dreaming of. A magnificent male fox, the color of its coat was of a dying fire, paused in a sun-dappled clearing, its head cocked, listening. The light was perfect, the composition was something else. I rattled off a dozen frames, my heart soaring with that pure, electric thrill that only photographers know.Back at my base camp that night, I eagerly loaded the photos onto my laptop. I scrolled through, and there it was. The money shot. The fox was perfectly in focus, its eyes were sharp and intelligent. The background was a beautiful, soft bokeh of green and gold. It was perfect.Except for the smudge.In the upper right-hand corner of the frame, there was a strange, vertical blur of white light. It was out of focus, just an artifact, but it was annoying. It looked like a lens flare, but the sun was behind me; it made no sense. I checked the other frames. It was there, in the exact same spot, in every single one. A persistent, ghostly slash against the otherwise perfect image. I sighed, chalking it up to some weird internal reflection in my lens, and made a mental note to clean all my gear thoroughly.A week later, I was photographing a herd of elk by a river at dawn. Again, a perfect morning. The mist was rising off the water, the great animals were silhouetted against the nascent light. It was a primordial, beautiful scene. I took hundreds of photos.And when I reviewed them later, the smudge was there. Different location, different time of day, different lens. But the same vertical, out-of-focus slash of white light, always in the upper periphery of the frame.Now, I was more than annoyed. I was obsessed. I thought to myself that it was a consistent technical problem. A somthing I needed to solve. Was it a scratch on my camera’s sensor? A flaw in the shutter mechanism? I spent two full days troubleshooting, running diagnostics, taking test shots of blank surfaces. I found nothing. My gear was, by all accounts, in perfect working order.The only way to solve it was to recreate the conditions. I went back to the clearing where I’d photographed the fox. I set up my camera on a tripod in the exact same spot, at the exact same time of day. I framed the shot identically. And then, I waited. My goal was to see the flare appear through the viewfinder before I took the picture.I sat there for hours, still as a stone, my eye pressed to the camera. The sun dappled the clearing. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves. The forest was quiet. But as the afternoon wore on, a new feeling began to creep in. A low-grade, primal hum of anxiety.It was the feeling of being watched.It’s a sensation every creature in the wild knows. A prickling at the back of your neck, a sudden, cold awareness that you are no longer just an observer, but are also the observed. I slowly, carefully, scanned the tree line, my eyes searching for the glint of an eye, the twitch of an ear. I saw nothing.But the feeling grew stronger. It was coming from my side. From the very edge of my vision. I kept my head perfectly still, my breathing slow and even, but my eyes darted to the right.And I saw it. For just a fraction of a second.It was a tall, wavering shape, like a column of heat haze. It was the shape of a man, long and thin, and it was hanging upside down from a thick, high branch of a fir tree, its form indistinct and shimmering.The moment my brain registered the impossible image, I snapped my head to look directly at it.And there was nothing there.Just the tree branch, empty against the sky. The forest was still. The feeling of being watched was gone. I sat there, my heart hammering against my ribs, my mouth dry. I told myself I was overtired, that the solitude was getting to me. I was seeing things. It was a trick of the light, a figment of a sleep-deprived imagination.I packed up my gear, unnerved, and hiked back to my truck. I needed a break. I needed to see other people. I drove to the nearest ranger station, a rustic little cabin that served as the park's administrative hub.There were two rangers on duty, an older, grizzled man with a kind, weary face, and a younger woman. I made some small talk, bought a new map I didn’t need, and then, trying to sound casual, I asked my question.“Hey, this is going to sound weird\"I started,“but have you guys ever seen… strange things out in the deep woods? Like, tricks of the light?”The older ranger, looked up from his paperwork. He and the younger ranger exchanged a look. It was a brief, knowing glance, but it was enough.“What kind of ‘tricks of the light’ are we talking about?”He asked, his voice a low, calm rumble.I felt like an idiot, but I pressed on.“Like… a shape. A tall, shimmering shape. Of a man. Hanging upside down from a tree. You only see it out of the corner of your eye.”The younger ranger’s friendly expression tightened. The older just sighed, a long, tired sound, and leaned back in his chair.“The Upside Down Man,”he said. And It wasn’t a question.“Yeah, we’ve seen him. Most of the folks who spend enough time out here have.”A wave of cold relief, immediately followed by a wave of colder dread, washed over me. I wasn’t crazy. But that meant the thing was real.“What is it?”I asked, my voice barely a whisper.“Don’t know,”He said, shaking his head.“Don’t want to know. It’s just… a feature of the landscape, I guess. A weird, local phenomenon. Like a magnetic anomaly or a patch of strange fog.”“But what does it do?”“Nothing,”he said, leaning forward and fixing me with a serious, paternal gaze.“It does absolutely nothing. As long as you do nothing, too. That’s the one and only rule, son. You see him in the corner of your eye? You keep looking straight ahead. You feel him watching you? You pretend you don’t. You do not acknowledge him. You do not engage with him. And you sure as hell don’t go looking for him. He’s a thing you’re only supposed to see by accident. You start making it on purpose, and that’s when you get into trouble.”“Trouble?”I asked.“What kind of trouble?”“We don’t know,”the younger ranger chimed in, her voice tense.“No one’s ever been stupid enough to find out. It’s just… common knowledge. A professional courtesy among those of us who work out here. You leave him alone, and he leaves you alone.”I left the ranger station with my mind reeling. Their warning was stark and absolute. But they had also given me something else: a validation. And a name. The Upside Down Man. And the smudge in my photos… it was a vertical shape of light. A shape like a man, hanging. It was him. My camera could see him, even when I couldn’t.And that’s where I made my mistake. My fatal, arrogant mistake. I’m a photographer. My entire life, my entire purpose, is to see things and to capture them. To be told that there was something out there, a real, observable phenomenon, that I was supposed to ignore… it was anathema to me. It was an irresistible challenge. And the rangers warning was just a dare.I went back into the woods. But this time, I was hunting for him.My entire methodology changed. I’d find a spot and wait, not for an animal to appear, but for that familiar, prickling sensation on my skin. The moment I felt it, I wouldn’t move my head. I’d keep my eyes locked forward, but I’d raise my camera, aiming the lens not at what I was looking at, but at the periphery. At the space where I felt he was. And I’d shoot.The first photos were chilling. The vertical smudge just grew. It was a brilliant, searing slash of overexposed white light, sharp and defined. It looked like a wound in the fabric of the photograph, a tear through which a sterile, featureless light was pouring. And with every photo I took, the slash grew wider, brighter, more aggressive. It was like I was annoying it, and it was screaming back at me through my own camera.I became possessed by it. I stopped eating properly. I barely slept. I was fueled by a manic, obsessive energy. I filled memory card after memory card with these impossible images. The creature was always there, just at the edge of my sight, a shimmering, wavering promise. And I kept shooting, trying to get a clearer image, trying to resolve that blinding white light into a discernible form.Then, my camera died.I was in a deep, mossy canyon, the feeling of being watched was a palpable, heavy pressure on my right side. I raised my camera, aimed it into the periphery, and pressed the shutter. The resulting image on the small LCD screen was pure, blinding white. A completely blank frame. I tried again. White. I aimed it at my own feet. White.He had broken it. Or, more accurately, he had filled it. My camera, could now only see the blinding, featureless light of his presence. It was useless.Any sane person would have stopped then. They would have taken the rangers’ warning to heart and gotten the hell out of there. But I wasn’t sane anymore. My obsession had burned through my reason. The loss of my camera just felt like a challenge,and now, I would have to use my own eyes.I continued the hunt. I would walk through the woods until I felt the familiar presence. Then I would stop, and I would try to see him. I’d keep my head pointed forward, but I’d strain my eyes to the side, trying to resolve the shimmering, wavering shape in my peripheral vision. I’d try to hold it, to focus on it, to force it into clarity.And that’s when the smudge moved from my photos to my own vision.It started as a small, barely noticeable floater in the corner of my right eye. A tiny, translucent blur. I assumed it was an eye strain. But it didn't go away. And every time I went on one of my “hunts,” every time I tried to force my eyes to see the creature directly, the smudge would get a little bigger, a little more opaque. It was turning from a translucent blur into a patch of milky, white fog.I was in the woods, trying to focus on the shimmering shape hanging from a distant branch, and as I strained, I saw the white fog in my own eye physically expand, spreading like a drop of milk in water.And I finally understood. With a clarity so profound and so terrifying it felt like a physical blow, I understood what was happening.It was that he couldn't be seen directly. His very nature was to exist at the edge of perception. And by trying to force him into the center, by trying to capture him, first with my camera and then with my own eyes, I was violating the fundamental rule of his existence. And he was fighting back. He was erasing the part of my vision that I was using to see him. He was a blind spot. A living, predatory blind spot. And he was growing, feeding on my sight.The panic that hit me was unlike anything I have ever known. It was the terror of a man realizing the weapon he has been firing is powered by his own blood. I was deep in a remote wilderness, and I was going blind.I ran. It was a clumsy, stumbling, panicked flight. I tripped over roots I couldn't see properly, crashed through branches that seemed to come out of nowhere. The white fog in the corner of my eye seemed to pulse and swirl with every frantic beat of my heart. I finally made it back to my truck, my body bruised and scratched, my mind a screaming wreck. I drove out of that forest and I have not been back.That was a month ago. The white patch in my vision hasn't gone away. I’ve seen three different ophthalmologists and a neurologist. They’ve run every test imaginable. My eyes, they tell me, are perfectly healthy. There is absolutely nothing physically wrong with them. They think I’m having a complex psychological episode brought on by stress and solitude.I knew it wouldn't be that easy. I thought the connection was through the photos. I thought they were the anchor. So, last week, I built a bonfire in my backyard. I took every memory card, every hard drive, every single print I had made of the white slashes, and I burned them. I watched until they were nothing but a pile of melted plastic and grey ash. I felt a sense of relief, exorcism if i may say.It didn't work.He's not just in the forest anymore. He followed me home. He's here with me now, as I type this. Not in the room, not in the house. He’s in the corner of my eye.I’ll be sitting here, on my couch, and I’ll get that old, familiar, prickling sensation. And I’ll know. If I let my focus soften, I can see him. A tall, wavering, upside-down shape, shimmering at the very edge of my vision. Sometimes he’s in the corner of the room. Sometimes, when I'm outside, he’s hanging from a telephone pole. He’s always there. A silent, constant companion.The rangers were right. The only rule is to ignore him. And now, that is my life. I live in a state of constant, vigilant denial. I can never turn my head too quickly. I can never let my eyes wander. I have to consciously, actively not see the thing that is always there. Because I know that if I try to look at him, if I give in to that primal urge to face the thing that is watching me, the white fog in my eye will grow. And there's not much of my vision left to lose.So this is my warning. If you ever find yourself in the deep, quiet places of the world, and you feel a prickling at the back of your neck, and you see something impossible just at the edge of your sight… for the love of God, pretend you didn't. Look away. Keep looking straight ahead. Some things aren't meant to be seen. And they will take everything from you to make sure you can't.",

      "content_preview": "His body lay there, on the metal table.  I looked at the hole on his back near the right kidney with my fingers interlaced, thinking.  A lot of people might rub their chin or lean on a counter, but I’d learned not to do that in med school.  Just lace your fingers together, nitrile glove on nitrile glove.  It avoids a lot of contamination issues.All of us at the coroner’s office had been putting in some serious overtime, since the hurricane had hit the coast.  The news said it was the worst ever recorded.  Rain still poured down, and the streets were half flooded even if you weren’t in the storm surge.  Our facility was close to capacity, and we needed to get those bodies properly ID’d before sending them to a morgue.What I was dealing with here was something different.  A day after the storm hit, this particular body was recovered from a street flooded with the surge.  When we ran prints, he had an exceptional criminal record, and the finger-width hole was assumed to be from a bullet.  A plausible conclusion would be that he was looting.Things weren’t adding up, though.  What had been labelled an entry wound looked a lot more like an exit wound to me.  It was larger, rougher, and didn’t have any abrasion from the bullet entry.  Details like that were unreliable on bodies that had been in the water for a while, but I saw no evidence of bacterial decomposition.  It was also a bit strange that the man had clawed at the entry, but I supposed it was a reaction to the pain.There was a simple solution to this puzzle: if it was a gunshot wound with no exit, there would be a bullet.I turned him onto his back.  Normally, someone would have helped me, but we were totally swamped.  Rolling over a dead body weighing more than you do is hard work, but this wasn’t my first rodeo.  I started the Y-incision to open up the chest and abdominal cavities.“Really?  You’re doing thatnow?”Flynn was about 14 hours into his shift.  I couldn’t blame him for wanting to get the easier bodies out of there and keeping the rest on ice so he could go home.“I’m the doc, I call the shots.  I’m working on this one, but I can do it alone.  You just keep processing those others.”“Yeah, yeah.”His voice was resigned, not resentful.  Shoulders shrugged in his scrubs, I didn’t need to see behind the surgical mask to know he was frowning.  This was a tough week for all of us.Once I’d gotten the abdomen open, I started checking his left side.  The first thing I noticed was that the kidney was missing.A lot of people only have one kidney.  That wasn’t what I was looking at.  Both arteries and the ureter had been severed.  Perhaps the bullet had passed through those, since there was notable tissue damage and internal bleeding.  However, the condition of the connective tissues meant that he still had the kidney until very recently, and bullets don’t make organs disappear.So whatdoesmake organs disappear?Perhaps it had moved around, once it wasn’t attached to anything.  Stranger things had happened.  The whole abdomen had to be examined anyway, so I just carried  on, figuring I would find it at some point.I discovered a large hole in the liver.  Removing the deep red organ carefully, I turned it over in my hands.  There was only one hole.  If a bullet was in him, it would be there.It felt heavy, the cold wet mass wanting to slip from my gloves.  Normally, I would expect a liver this large to be fatty, but didn’t look like it.  Curious, I put it on the scale.  2.4 Kg.  That was big.I went to write the weight down, and to take a break.  Normally, an assistant would do it.  I took off my gloves to write notes on everything so far, massaging my stiff neck for a moment.  When I checked the clock, it was 10:45 PM.“I’m grabbing a coffee, you want one?”“Yes please.  Actually, if it’s not too much trouble can you grab me a water, too?”“Good idea.”Flynn was right.  I’d forgotten to drink any water, or eat, or do anything but work the last five hours or so.  I poured a couple of coffees and tucked two water bottles into my pockets.  Making my way back down the fluorescent white hallway, I shouldered through heavy doors that pushed open from either side.  They were convenient for moving bodies, or when you were carrying multiple beverages.“You doing alright?”  I asked.“Doing just fine.  Appreciate the drinks, Doc.”  He gave a nod.I downed the entire water bottle in one go, then drank about half of my coffee.  I checked my phone for anything from my husband.Text me when you’re heading home.  Love u!!He was probably asleep already.  Sleep sounded pretty good, but I had a kidney to find.  I put on my labcoat, gloves, mask, and glasses.Seeing the liver, I froze in confusion.  In the sterile white light, it looked deflated.  This had been a long shift, but I wasn’t imagining things.  My notes said 2.4 Kg, but the scale now read 1.1 Kg.  Hurrying over, I stared at the green LED numbers, as if they might change again.I was about to pick the liver back up when I noticed a wet, dark trail streaking from the metal plate of the scale, onto the counter, then down to the tile floor.“Flynn, can you come look at this?”I’d tried to sound calm, but the rapidity with which Flynn came over suggested that I had not succeeded.“What am I looking at?”  He asked.“I weighed that liver at 2.4, wrote it down, got us coffees, and when I came back it weighed 1.1 and there’s this trail going across the floor.”“So… part of it fell?”His conclusion was rational, but not correct.“If it fell, why did it leave a trail that goes half way across the room before fading out?  Also, I feel compelled to mention that the body was in the water.”“Oh.”  His voice was low, and concerned.  “This is bullet hole guy?”“Yep.”We stood there looking at the gruesome trail, a smear which started dark and clear at the scale, but was untraceable about halfway across the room.“We’ve got to find it, don’t we?”  His eyes were visibly concerned, even behind the goggles.Of course he was right.  But the question was not whether we had to find it, rather what ‘it’ was.  There was a growing certainty in my mind that ‘it’ was not an inanimate object, but rather a living organism.I’m not a squeamish person.  There’s no need to go into details here, but I’ve seen a lot of things working as a coroner.  There are a lot of insects associated with decomposing bodies, sure.  None of those insects are 1.3 kilograms.“My best guess is that it’s an eel.  Check the floor, get everything it could crawl under away from the walls.  Slither under.  Whatever eels do on land.  It can’t have gone far.”We checked the small space under the cabinets, all around the room.  I checked under the instrument table, everywhere I could think of.I jumped when I heard metal clatter to the floor.  Flynn cursed.  My first instinct was that the creature had knocked something down, but Flynn had just bumped a tray accidentally.  I could tell his nerves were thin, as were mine.“It’s not here.”  He said.  “Do you want me to check the next room?”I glanced at the doorway.  The rubber sweeps on the base of the door looked secure, I doubted anything could have gotten through.“Let’s just slow down and think for a second.”The whole search had been a panicked reaction.  When we had started, my intuition had been that whatever had come out of the man’s liver would be laying on the floor somewhere.  Since it wasn’t, we would need a new strategy.“Blacklight.”  I said.Behind his mask, Flynn nodded in agreement, quickly going to a drawer and pulling out a blacklight shaped like a baton, with two long bulbs encased in a plastic frame.  He flipped it on, carefully walking toward the scale.The trail glowed a sinister yellow green.  Initially, the dark smears were obvious even to the naked eye, but where they had first seemed to disappear now lay a faint, glowing trail.“What are those little marks along both sides? Do eels have like… flippers?”“I think some of them do.”Perhaps my voice indicated it, but looking at this strange track, I was becoming less confident we were searching for an eel.  When the trail meandered across the floor toward a gurney, a nauseous feeling started in my stomach.  As it went up the wheel, then coiled around the stainless steel leg, acid began to enter my throat.A closed body bag lay at the end of the blacklight’s trail.“We’re turning the body over.”Flynn didn’t want to, but he nodded.  We turned the black bag over on the stainless steel gurney, and I found what I was looking for.A finger-sized hole through the plastic.“Oh God.”  Flynn’s hand went to cover his mouth in horror, but his reflexes stopped the rubber glove a few inches short.“Alright.  Take it to the freezer.  Fast, let’s go.”With no hesitation we pushed the gurney, the body bag, the body, and whatever was inside it through the swinging doors, then turned down the hall.  With one hand on the gurney, I reached out for the long, horizontal handle on the stainless steel doors of the insulated freezer room.I was in denial when I felt something sharp on my glove.  It had to be the zipper on the bag, I told myself.  As my head whipped around, Flynn screamed.  A breathy ‘hah’ noise escaped my lips.The front of it had some kind of teeth or mandibles, evenly spaced and radiating from what must have been its mouth.  Behind that small sharp legs, perhaps an inch long, were going across the back of my glove.  They must have been sharp, because they had easily cut through the nitrile and left small pinpricks of blood.  The whole thing was jointed, armored, looked like bone.All of this I tell you from memory.  Part of me wants to think that I misremembered the thing on the back of my hand, but I know what I saw.  It burned into my retinas like a photograph, even though I violently flung my hand the moment I saw it.Pointed legs dug into my skin, and the length of the monstrosity was pulled out from the body bag and flung across the hall, as I shook my arm as hard as I could in panic.  It left a wet mark where it hit the wall, then flopped to the ground.  Before I knew it, the thing had scurried toward the exit doors, legs scratching at the base of them, then found a tiny gap right in the middle.  As it forced its way under, I noticed with horror it must have been about three feet long.I ran back the way we had come, grabbing a fire extinguisher from the wall.  I couldn’t tell you whether I would have sprayed it or bludgeoned it, but I needed to stop it.  If nothing else, I needed to know what it was.  I needed it desperately.Flynn stood frozen in the hall as I kicked the exit doors open, stepping out into the parking lot in the downpour, searching puddles and currents of water under dim yellow street lights.  A deep puddle had formed around an overflowed storm drain a little ways out, and I saw the water rippling back and forth as if a fish were swimming in it.That was the last I ever saw of it.  That storm drain led right back to the ocean; from whence it came.After perhaps thirty seconds in the rain, I came back in, completely soaked and trailing water on the tile.  Flynn just stared at me.“Sorry.”  He said.For some reason, I laughed.“Nothing to apologize for, you did everything right.”“Whatwasthat?”“I have no idea.”“So it’s just something that came up out of the ocean and eats dead bodies?”Taking the glove off to look at the wounds on my hand, I shook my head.“‘Gunshot wound’ was supposed to be cause of death, remember?”His eyes went wide behind the goggles, and I couldn’t help but remember the marks on the body where the man had clawed at his back.  I wondered what would have happened to me if that thing had gotten to a softer part of me, rather than reaching my hand first.It took me a long time to accept that I would never know what it was.  I talked to a couple of very good marine biologists over the next few weeks, who had never heard of anything like it.  One of them took a bunch of samples from the first body, and found some DNA.  The best she could tell me was that it was from some organism distantly related to a polychaete worm, although no similar DNA had been documented.One of her only insights was that the creature most likely washed up because of the storm, which was the worst we’ve ever had.  That was little comfort to me, because these ‘once in a lifetime’ storms are only getting more common.I asked her how I could find out what it was, what the next steps were.  Her answer stuck with me.“We don’t know half of what lives in the ocean, not even close.  If it’s something we’ve never seen before, I can’t tell you how to find it.  We’ll probably never know what it was.I’m sorry.”",

      "content_preview": "My name doesn’t matter. My town’s name doesn’t matter either. It’s one of those dusty, forgotten places at the edge of the desert that you only end up in if you were born here or your car broke down on the way to somewhere better. I was born here. I’m a mechanic. I like the predictable logic of it. A car comes in broken, I diagnose the problem, I apply the solution, and it leaves fixed. Cause and effect. Clean, simple, and honest. My life is built on that same principle. I have a routine. I like it. It keeps the chaos of the world at bay.At least, it used to.The chaos started about three months ago. It began quietly, without any fanfare. One night, they just… appeared. Six perfect, silent spheres of soft, white light, hovering high in the night sky above the desert flats. They didn’t move. They didn’t blink. They didn’t make a sound. They just hung there, a perfect, geometric arrangement against the brilliant, star-dusted canvas of the desert sky.The first night, everyone in town was out on their porches, just staring up, a collective, silent awe settling over us. It was beautiful, in a strange, unnerving way. The second night, they were back. Same place, same formation. And the third. And every single night since, without fail.After the first week, the novelty wore off for us locals. They became just another part of the landscape, like the mesas or the coyotes. But the outside world took notice. The internet started buzzing. First came the UFOlogists, with their fancy cameras and their intense, wild-eyed theories. Then came the tourists, the new-age crystal crowd, the Instagram influencers looking for a weird backdrop.Our quiet, forgotten little town was suddenly a destination. And it was a nightmare.These people were a plague. They’d block the roads with their RVs to get a better view. They’d wander onto private property. They’d come into my shop, not for repairs, but to ask me a million stupid questions. “Have you been abducted?” “Do you feel any strange energies?” “Can you point me to the best place to make contact?” It was a constant, infuriating disruption to my routine, to the clean, simple logic of my life.Then, about two weeks ago, one of them disappeared.He was a typical “seeker.” A guy in his thirties, drove a beat-up van covered in esoteric bumper stickers. He’d been in town for a month, spending every night out in the desert, trying to “communicate” with the lights. One morning, his van was found abandoned at the edge of the flats, his equipment still set up, but he was gone. No note, no sign of a struggle. He had just vanished.That’s when all hell broke loose. The county sheriff, the state police, news vans from the city—they all descended on us. The town was crawling with them. The search parties were a joke. Dozens of people who didn’t know the first thing about the desert, trampling over everything, yelling, shining their lights. The chaos was a constant, grinding noise that was shredding my last nerve. My business was suffering. I couldn’t work with the constant interruptions, the blocked roads, the general atmosphere of a three-ring circus.I decided I’d had enough. The police weren’t finding anything. The volunteers were useless. I’m a mechanic. I solve problems. And this circus was a problem. I figured, if I wanted it to end, I had to find a solution myself. I know this desert. I know its rhythms, its silences. I thought, maybe if I go out there alone, away from all the noise, I’ll see something they missed. A simple, rational explanation. Maybe the guy just got lost, fell into a ravine. Find the body, the circus leaves, and my life goes back to normal.So, last night, I closed up shop, filled a cooler with water, grabbed the most powerful flashlight I own, and headed out in my truck. The official search was focused on a ten-mile radius around the guy’s abandoned van. I went in the opposite direction, deeper into the flats, directly towards the lights.The desert at night is a different world. The silence is so absolute it feels like a pressure on your eardrums. I drove for an hour, the six lights my only guide, a silent, celestial chandelier hanging in the infinite darkness. They seemed to hum with a quiet energy, a feeling that vibrated right in my teeth.I was on an old, forgotten service road when I saw it. One of the six lights, the one on the far right of the formation, seemed to… detach. It didn’t fall like a meteor, burning a bright, fast streak across the sky. It descended. A slow, controlled, silent glide downwards, as if it were being gently lowered on an invisible string. It dropped below the horizon, disappearing behind a low, flat-topped mesa about a mile ahead.My heart started pounding. This was it. This was something. A deviation from the routine. I stomped on the gas, my truck kicking up a cloud of dust as I sped towards the mesa. This was the answer. A downed weather balloon, some experimental drone… a logical, physical object I could find and present to the world. A solution.I parked my truck at the base of the mesa and got out, the powerful beam of my flashlight cutting a sharp, white tunnel through the darkness. The air was cold, and the silence was deeper here, more expectant. I scrambled up the loose rock of the mesa. On the other side was a small, shallow basin. And in the center of it, shimmering in the moonlight, was a pond.That was weird. There are no natural ponds out here. I walked closer. The air grew thick with a foul, chemical stench. I realized what it was. An old, abandoned mine had used this basin as a drainage pond decades ago. It was a pit of stagnant, polluted water.I swept my flashlight beam across the area. There was no orb. No wreckage. No strange lights. Nothing. Just the filthy, still water and the smell of industrial waste. A bitter wave of disappointment washed over me. Had I imagined it? Was I so desperate for this to be over that my mind was playing tricks on me?I walked to the edge of the pond, my boots sinking slightly in the damp, contaminated soil. I shone my light onto the surface of the water, hoping to see something submerged. The water was a thick, black, oily soup. It was so murky, so polluted, that the surface was barely reflective. But I could just make out my own silhouette, a dark shape cast by the powerful flashlight in my hand.I stood there for a long moment, ready to give up, to go home. And then I noticed it.In the faint, distorted reflection on the water’s surface, my silhouette wasn't alone.There was another one, right next to mine. It was the shape of a man, and it was under the surface. And it was moving. It was thrashing, frantically, its limbs flailing in a silent, desperate panic. I watched, frozen in a state of pure, uncomprehending horror, as the silhouette beat its fists against the underside of the water’s surface. It was like watching a man trapped behind a one-way mirror, a pane of glass separating his world from mine. He was pounding on the wall between us, screaming for help that I couldn’t hear.My first thought was the missing man. Was it him? Trapped somehow? Was this some kind of bizarre projection? My mind, the mechanic’s mind, was scrambling for a logical explanation and coming up with nothing but static. The sheer, naked terror of the thrashing silhouette was paralyzing.I felt a morbid, terrible urge to get closer, to understand what I was seeing. I knelt down at the water’s edge, my flashlight beam still fixed on the two silhouettes. I leaned forward, my face just a few feet from the foul-smelling water. And as I did, my view of the reflection widened. I could now see the reflection of the night sky in the dark, oily water.I saw the stars. And I saw the lights.I counted them. One. Two. Three. Four. Five… Six.A jolt of pure, electric ice shot through my veins. I ripped my gaze from the reflection and looked up at the real sky. I counted again, my heart hammering against my ribs. One. Two. Three. Four. Five.There were only five lights in the sky.But there were six in the reflection.I don’t know what came over me. It wasn’t courage. It was a kind of horrified, fatalistic curiosity. I had to know if it was real. I had to know if the surface was solid. I reached out a trembling hand, my fingers extended, and I touched the water.The second my fingertips broke the surface, the world ended.A force. An immense, impossibly strong, impossibly cold something wrapped around my wrist from inside the reflection. It was a vise grip of pure, malevolent energy, and it pulled.I screamed, a raw, terrified sound that was swallowed by the vast desert silence. The pull was incredible. I was being dragged forward, off my knees, my face towards the filthy water. My mind flashed with an image of the thrashing silhouette, of being pulled through that dark, oily surface into whatever hellish, watery prison lay on the other side.Panic gave me a strength I didn’t know I had. I dug my heels into the dirt, threw my entire body weight backward, and roared with effort and terror. For a horrifying second, there was a terrible, stretching, tearing sensation in my arm, as if I was being pulled apart. And then, I was free. I flew backward, landing hard on the rocky ground, scrambling away from the water’s edge like a terrified crab.I lay there, gasping, clutching my wrist, which was numb and aching with a profound, bone-deep cold. And then the pond began to glow.A soft, white light emanated from beneath the surface, growing brighter and brighter, until the entire, filthy pond was a blazing, incandescent orb. The light was silent, but it felt loud, pressing in on me, scouring the landscape clean of all shadows. The surface of the water began to boil, but with a cold, silent energy.And then, a perfect, massive sphere of pure, white light erupted from the water. It rose into the air, as silent and graceful as it had descended. It climbed higher and higher, a new star in the night sky, until it took its place in the formation, back in the empty spot on the far right.They were six again.I didn’t wait. I scrambled back to my truck, my mind a blank slate of pure, animal fear. I drove, and I didn’t look back.I’m home now. I’m safe. But I’m not. The horror isn’t out there in the desert anymore. It’s here. It’s in my house. Because I understand now.They hide in reflections. Any reflection.I haven’t been able to look in a mirror. I spent all of yesterday with a towel covering my bathroom mirror. I can’t look at my own TV when it’s turned off. The dark, reflective screen feels like a deep, black pond, and I’m terrified of what I might see looking back at me from just beneath the surface. A puddle on the street, a shop window, the reflection in a pair of sunglasses… they’re all doorways. They’re all potential prisons.The man who disappeared… he’s not dead. He’s not lost. He’s taken. He’s in there, in that watery reflection, thrashing against the other side, and maybe one day, the thing that took him will get bored and let another one out.I live in a world without mirrors now. A world where I have to be careful of every shiny surface. I almost got pulled in. I almost became another silent, screaming silhouette trapped behind the glass. And I can still feel the cold in my wrist where it touched me, a constant, chilling reminder that the world I thought was so logical, so full of cause and effect, has a dark, predatory reflection, and it is always, always waiting for you to get too close.",

      "content_preview": "For the past week, something’s been… off with my mom.She’s still doing all the usual things. Making her black coffee first thing in the morning. Tending the roses in the backyard that she refuses to let die, even though it’s August and the heat’s brutal. She still calls me “sweetheart,” still leaves Post-its with gentle reminders to eat, hydrate, sleep.But she won’t look me in the eyes anymore.Not for more than a second or two.I caught her watching me last night from the hallway mirror. I was sitting on the couch, scrolling on my phone, and I just *felt* it. That kind of prickling heat behind your neck like someone’s watching. I looked up, and there she was standing stiffly behind the corner, peering in like she was studying something… or someone.When our eyes met, she froze.Then she forced a smile. “You okay, honey?”I nodded. She disappeared down the hallway like nothing happened.But I *know* she was watching.This morning, she left a slice of toast on the kitchen table for me, same as always. But there was no butter. No jelly. Not even a napkin. It was just… dry.I asked her if everything was alright.She hesitated. “Of course. Why wouldn’t it be?I shrugged. “You just seem distant lately.”She looked at me for a long time. Her fingers were tight around the coffee mug. Then she said, slowly: “Sometimes people change. And sometimes… they think no one will notice.”I tried to laugh it off, but my chest felt *hollow*. I didn’t eat the toast.It’s not just the weird glances or the strange things she says. She’s started locking her bedroom door at night. She *never* used to do that. And I swear, one night I heard her whispering behind it. Like prayers… or warnings.This morning, I woke up and found her in the living room, going through old photo albums. She didn’t even flinch when I walked in.“Looking for something?” I asked.She stared down at a photo of us from years ago. Me at least, I think it’s me smiling in front of a birthday cake, frosting on my chin. Her eyes flicked up to my face, then back to the photo. Her hands were trembling.“You used to have a mole,” she whispered.I blinked. “What?”“On your left cheek,” she said, tapping the photo. “Where is it?”I touched my cheek. “I… guess it faded.”Her lips pressed into a tight line. “Moles don’t fade.”I couldn’t think of anything to say. Just stood there like an idiot.Tonight, she left a knife under her pillow.I saw it when I walked past her room. The door was cracked open, and she was pretending to sleep. But I saw her fingers curled tight around the blanket, like she was bracing for something.I think she’s afraid of me.And the thing is… I been having dreams.Dreams of things that don’t make sense. I hear echoes I see a forest. Wet leaves. I even smell smoke. And the face *My* face staring at me with wide, terrified eyes as I reached out for *him*. As I *stepped into my skin*.I start to question myself.\"What am I?\"\"Am I really who I am?\"Then one night I go to the bathroom and look in the mirror and see all the imperfections all the mistakes... then I see it I see what my mom sees...I’m *not* her son and mom knows it.",

      "content_preview": "I am dictating this from the bathroom floor. The tile is cold under my palms. The house is quiet except for the hum of the air conditioner and my son’s sleep-muffled cough down the hall.They say a father is the shepherd of his home. I believed that, even after I drifted from the Church. I told myself ritual wasn’t necessary to stay close to truth. My wife trusted me, my kids trusted me… and I thought that was enough.It began with the mirror.At first, my reflection lagged a fraction of a second. Then one night, I watched it blink when my eyes were open. A deliberate, slow blink. Later, it smiled when I wasn’t smiling.I kept it secret. If it was madness, speaking it would make it real. If it was spiritual, acknowledging it would invite it deeper. So I watched in silence.Then the whispering began. At first, static. Then words. Then my own voice calling my name in the same firm tone I use when my kids are about to step into danger.Soon the shadows moved outside the mirror. Black shapes slithered along the walls. My wife saw nothing. My kids laughed. But I was terrified.One night, the whisper grew clear: “You walked away. You left the shield down. Now I am in your house.”Later, my son stood by my bed, pale and trembling. “Daddy, the man in the dark says you can’t protect us anymore.”“What man?” I whispered.“The one who stands behind you in the mirror. He says you let him in.”“He’s wrong,” I told him in an attempt to convince us both.The next day I went to a priest. He gave me holy water, a St. Benedict medal, and told me to bless the mirrors, claim my home, pray aloud. To not trust the thing on the other side.That night I pressed wet fingers to the bathroom mirror. Frost raced across the glass. My reflection’s mouth opened wider than a mouth should, releasing a guttural growl. A freezing wind poured from the glass, carrying the stench of decay.“You think water can save you?” it rumbled. “You abandoned the light. The shadows claim you now.”The mirror rippled like water. Behind me, I saw my children’s reflections in the doorway. Blank faces. Moving lips.“Daddy. Let him in. He’ll protect us now.”I pushed harder with the sign of the cross. The image cracked. Not the glass, but the reflection itself. Silence fell.But when I looked again, my reflection smiled. Small. Private. It lifted its hand. I didn’t.That night I woke to the mattress dipping, as if someone had sat at the foot of the bed. The smell of sulfur thickened the air. A voice in my head, calm and cold:“You set down the staff. I picked it up. The flock is safer with me.”The next morning, letters rose across my chest in mirror-writing welts: MINE.Now, every mirror is covered, but towels never stay in place.At 3:12 the glass breathes. My reflection crouches like an animal, blinking three times. It’s our family’s private sign for I love you.I hear my daughter’s door hinge creak though I’m still on the floor. I smell hot pennies.My reflection is standing. I am not.If you pray, pray now. If you don’t, do whatever you do when someone is about to fall from a cliff.Because I’m about to stand. And I don’t know if it’ll be me who rises.",

      "content_preview": "You ever wonder what kind of job makes a man come apart at the seams—fracture not over weeks or years, but in one single, black-lunged night?Not from stress. Not from boredom. But from something else. Something dry and crawling that licks at the edge of your sanity like windblown sand against old bone.Yeah, I used to wonder that too.Now I don't wonder much of anything. My thoughts come slow, like they’ve got to drag themselves up through molasses. I don’t sleep—not really. When I do, I hear the whispering. I see flickers in corners that should be empty. I don’t trust my reflection anymore. I don’t trust my own voice. Something came back with me from that place. Something I never invited.The job was simple—or so I thought. One night shift in the middle of nowhere. And a list of rules. Just twelve of them. Keep your head down. Stay awake. Follow the rules. But rules mean nothing when the air itself wants to gut you. When silence starts to hum. When shadows breathe.Let me take you back to the beginning.My name’s Eric. I’m 28 years old, though now I feel older—worn down like desert stone under centuries of wind. I’ve never been the stay-in-one-place kind of guy. I’ve chased hurricanes on oil rigs, run toward wildfires when everyone else ran away, and even launched myself off rooftops for a few thousand YouTube subscribers back in the day. I guess you could say danger was my drug. I didn’t just flirt with risk—I waltzed with it, arms wide, laughing in its face.So when I saw the job post—a night watch gig at an isolated weather station in the far reaches of West Texas—it felt like a gift. The pay was suspiciously good. The location? Dead center of the xyz Desert, fifty miles off any real road. No towns. No neighbors. No signal. Just a pin on a map and a time to show up.I packed light: books I wouldn’t read, a journal I wouldn’t write in, and that stupid optimism only people who haven’t been broken yet still carry.The outpost—Station 119B—was a concrete box. One room. No markings, no signs of life. Just a dented steel door and a big black window staring out at an endless stretch of sand. Inside, there was a desk cluttered with equipment I couldn’t name, a fridge, a cot, and a generator that sounded like it was one bad night away from dying. But what caught my attention wasn’t any of that.It was the manual.A thin, grease-stained pamphlet on the desk, labeled in crooked red ink:RULES FOR NIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR – STATION 119BNot instructions. Not training. Rules.There were twelve.And they weren’t the kind of rules you find in HR handbooks. They read like folklore passed down from some ancient desert cult.Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.If you hear tapping on the window, turn off all lights and lie face down until it stops.Log wind speed every 30 minutes. If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.If the desert goes silent (no wind, no bugs), recite the phrase taped to the fridge.Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base Code: Yellow Echo.If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.Don’t fall asleep.Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.If Rule 1 is broken, burn the manual immediately and pray.I read them again. And again. Each pass made my skin prickle. It was like reading a curse disguised as policy. But instead of walking away, I laughed. Really laughed—sharp, barked out loud like a man who thinks he’s above fear—because I was still the guy who thought ghosts were fun stories and rules were made to be tested.It sounded strange in that room—too loud, too human. It bounced off the concrete walls like it didn’t belong there. Maybe it didn’t.In my head, this was all just some elaborate hazing ritual. A creepy prank left behind by some disgruntled ex-employee with a flair for drama. I imagined a guy like me—bored, probably high—scribbling down those rules just to mess with the next poor sucker assigned to Station 119B. The candle, the weird times, the chanting. Classic psychological tripwire stuff. Probably some government joke I wasn’t in on.Still… the place didn’t sit right with me.The air was too dry. Not just desert-dry, but hollow, like the atmosphere had been scooped out. The silence felt rehearsed. Choreographed. And the stars above the station—they didn’t twinkle. They just watched. Cold, close, too sharp. Like pinholes poked through a thin sheet of sky. If you stared too long, you got the feeling something might stare back.But I told myself, I’ve jumped out of planes. I’ve stood on collapsing fire lines. I’ve put my own damn hand in a box full of scorpions on a dare for likes. What’s a little ghost story in the desert?The first couple hours passed like I expected: dull, dry, and quiet. I logged the wind speed like Rule #3 said, every thirty minutes. I even timed it with my watch to be precise—treating it more like a chore than a warning. I made some instant coffee that tasted like regret. I watched a tarantula the size of my palm crawl across the outside of the window—slow, aimless, like it knew it was being watched.Then, around midnight, things started to… bend. Not snap. Not break. Just bend, subtly, like the world had gone a few degrees off center.It was 12:11 AM when I heard the knock.A sound so ordinary it felt impossible for it to feel so wrong.Not banging. Not frantic. Just three knocks—spaced out. Intentional. Like whoever was outside wasn’t asking to be let in. They were stating they were already here.Every hair on my neck stood at attention. My hands clenched around the mug before I realized they were shaking.My mind stumbled back to Rule #1: Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.I froze. My thoughts tried to be logical, tried to be brave. Probably just the wind, I whispered to myself, though the words felt hollow even as I said them.But the wind doesn’t knock. It howls. It hisses. It dances through cracks and moans through empty places. It doesn’t walk up to a reinforced steel door and knock three times, exactly, then stop.I checked the wall clock.12:13 AM.My throat tightened like I’d swallowed dry sand. My legs screamed to move—toward the door, away from it, I didn’t even know. But I stayed still. Not because I believed the rule. No, not yet. But because something in my gut, something primal and old, told me that opening that door would be a very final kind of mistake.The knocks came again. Same rhythm. Three. Then silence.12:20. More knocks.12:29. Again.12:41. They kept coming—every few minutes. Always three. Always the same weight behind them. As if the thing on the other side had all the time in the world.I didn’t respond. I didn’t speak. I just sat there, heart hammering, watching the second hand crawl across the clock face like it was moving through tar.Then came the tapping.Not on the door.On the window.A soft, delicate tap-tap-tap, like fingernails on glass.I turned slowly—deliberately—expecting to see something. Anything. A face. A shape. But the window showed only the dark, stretching desert. Pale sand under a black sky. Empty. Still.Then: tap-tap-tap.Right against the glass. Closer this time. More urgent. Like whatever was outside had grown impatient.Something deep in me—some instinct older than thought—screamed to obey the manual.I threw the lights off and dropped flat to the floor, face down, just like Rule #2 demanded.And let me tell you—I felt ridiculous. Lying on cold concrete like a scolded child playing hide and seek. My breath echoed in my ears, too loud, too fast. The tapping continued—soft, steady, like it was trying to coax me up.I didn’t move.The darkness stretched forever.Finally—mercifully—the tapping stopped.I waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Then, slowly, I pushed myself up, muscles aching from the tension. I flicked the lights back on and blinked into the sterile brightness.Then, like a complete jackass, I laughed at myself.Real mature, I thought. Terrified by shadows and knocks like I’m in a Halloween special.But the laughter didn’t stick this time. It crumbled in my throat like dry paper.Because as I stood there, letting my pulse settle, my eyes drifted toward the wind monitor on the desk.And it was flatlining.Zero.No wind. Not even a whisper.My stomach dropped.Rule #3 roared back into my mind like a siren:If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.And suddenly, I wasn’t laughing anymore.I checked the wind monitor again, hoping—praying—I’d read it wrong.Wind Speed: 0 mph.Nothing. Not a breeze. Not a whisper. The line on the graph was dead flat, like a heartbeat that had given up.My chest tightened—squeezed from the inside like my lungs were folding in. That couldn’t be right. Out here, the wind never stopped completely. Even the still nights carried a faint, restless stir through the sand. But now? The world outside was holding its breath.I should’ve stayed inside.But something pulled me toward the door. Not curiosity—denial. That desperate human instinct to confirm the lie, to tell yourself everything’s fine if you can just see it for yourself.I stepped outside.And immediately felt the weight of a mistake settle on me like lead.The air was… wrong. Not just calm—dead. Still in a way that felt manufactured, unnatural. Even my own breathing sounded too loud. There was no wind. No rustle of dry shrubs. No skittering bugs. Nothing but the crunch of my boots on sand.The desert had gone mute.And then I saw them.Footprints.In the sand, just a few feet from the threshold.Coming in.But none going out.I stood there for a full, frozen second, my body refusing to catch up to what my brain was screaming. Then instinct kicked in—I spun, bolted for the door, slammed it shut behind me like it might keep something out that had already gotten in.Lock. Chain. Bolt. I checked everything. Hands trembling. Breath sharp and uneven.And then my stomach twisted as another rule clawed its way up from memory:Rule #7: Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base. Code: Yellow Echo.The satellite phone was right where it had been—on the desk, a grey relic from another era. I grabbed it like a lifeline, dialed the code with fingers that barely obeyed me.It rang.Once.Twice.Then it connected.And what I heard next nearly stopped my heart.It was my voice. But not like a recording. It was live. It was me. Except it wasn’t. The cadence was slightly wrong. The tone a hair off. Too calm. Too final.\"You shouldn’t have opened the door,\" it said.Click.Silence.I stood there, staring at the receiver like it might explain itself. Then I yanked the cord from the back. The phone went dead.That’s when the lights cut out.All at once.Like someone had flipped a master switch on reality.Total blackness swallowed the room. The kind of black that has depth. Like it could reach out and touch you back.I didn’t breathe. Didn’t move.Then my memory jolted into motion—Rule #4: If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.I scrambled to the shelf, nearly knocking over the chair in the dark. My fingers found the candle—a thick, stubby thing already set in a glass holder. I fumbled for the lighter, struck it, and lit the wick with a hand that couldn’t stop shaking.A small, flickering flame sprang to life.And the room changed.The dim red light didn’t just reveal the space—it warped it. Shadows twisted too far into the corners, stretching longer than they should. The air shimmered, barely perceptible, like heat off asphalt—but colder. The walls felt too close now, as if the room had been inching inward, shrinking around me when I wasn’t looking.I turned slowly, and for just a breath, I thought I saw movement in the reflection of the window. Not a shape. Not a face. Just shifting. The kind of thing your brain registers an instant too late.That’s when I heard it.A whisper.Soft. Barely audible. But unmistakable.\"Eric.\"My name.It wasn’t shouted. It wasn’t angry. It was… gentle. Almost caring. Like the voice of someone who knew me. Loved me. Wanted me to trust it.But it didn’t come from the door.And it didn’t come from outside.It came from somewhere. From everywhere. Inside the room. Behind the walls. In the space under the cot. In the reflection in the window I wasn’t supposed to look at. My skin crawled. My mouth went dry. My heart slammed against my ribs like it was trying to run for the door by itself.Rule #5: Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.But was it outside?I didn’t know.And that’s what terrified me most.I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself not to move. Not to speak.The voice came again.\"Eric,\" it whispered. Closer this time. Like it had crossed a threshold.Like it was already inside.I clutched the manual like a child clings to a teddy bear in the dark, desperate for comfort that paper couldn’t possibly give. My arms wrapped around it as if the ink inside could somehow shield me from whatever else was breathing in that room with me.Then I heard it.The fridge.Buzzing.Low, mechanical. A sound so ordinary it shouldn't have chilled my blood. But in that moment, it was like hearing a coffin creak open by itself. My eyes snapped open. The red candle flickered wildly, the flame stuttering as if suffocating in air that was too still, too heavy.Then came the silence.Not quiet—silence. The kind that doesn’t just fill the room but consumes it.No wind. No bugs. No low hum from the machines that had kept me grounded in reality for the past few hours. Even the candle’s flicker made no sound.Just an aching, crushing stillness.Rule #6. My breath hitched.I bolted toward the fridge, legs trembling like they didn’t belong to me. My fingers scrambled along the metal door until they found it: a small, weathered strip of paper taped just above the handle.The writing was faint, as though the ink had tried to escape the words it formed.“O watcher of dusk, I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”My lips moved before I could think.“O watcher of dusk…” I began, my voice cracking like an old record. “I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”It felt like trying to speak underwater. My tongue stumbled over the rhythm the first few times, the words sticking to my throat like glue.I repeated the phrase. Again. And again. Louder.And then—I heard it.The silence shattered.A sudden gust slammed against the walls of the outpost, making the concrete groan in protest. Wind howled through unseen cracks. Insects returned in a chorus of buzzing, scratching life. The room breathed again.And I—God help me—I nearly cried.But the relief lasted all of three seconds.Then the phone rang.That shouldn’t have been possible.I had unplugged it. Pulled the cord straight out of the back. I stared at the empty socket, then at the receiver.It rang again.And again.Three times total.Rule #8 screamed through my skull: If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.I already had.I backed away, the manual still clutched in one hand, candle in the other. My eyes flicked to the wall clock.2:51 AM.And just like that, another rule surfaced.Rule #9: Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.I hadn’t meant to. I swear I hadn’t.But the moment I thought it, I looked.And that’s when I saw it.Not in the window itself, but in the reflection. In the far corner of the room, behind me—a tall, human-shaped figure. Perfectly still. Head cocked slightly to one side like it was trying to understand me.My breath caught in my throat like a wire pulled tight.I turned.Nothing there.I whipped back to the window—and it was still there. Same spot. Same tilt of the head.Watching.Unmoving.I lit another red candle. Then another. My hands moved on instinct now—desperation drowning thought. The room bathed in flickering crimson light. Shadows danced madly along the walls.The figure remained. Still. Patient.Then—I blinked.And it was gone.Just gone.No sound. No movement. Like it had never been there.But I knew it had.My instincts screamed: Get out. Get in the truck. Drive until the sky changes.But the manual… it said nothing about leaving. Not once.And suddenly that absence felt deliberate.Like the rules had never been written for leaving.Only for surviving until morning.And morning felt very, very far away.Then it hit me—Rule #11.Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.Simple. Strange. I'd read it like a joke the first time. But now, it loomed in my mind like a warning carved into the walls of a tomb. Something churned in my gut—hunger, maybe. Or dread wearing hunger’s mask.I moved toward the fridge.Every part of me screamed don’t, but my hand gripped the handle anyway. It was cold. Damp with condensation.I opened it.And found… nothing.Not empty shelves. Not expired leftovers.Nothing.Every item that had been there earlier—gone. Erased. As if they'd never existed.Except for one thing.A single, folded note resting where the milk used to be.I unfolded it slowly, heart pounding like a drumbeat in a funeral march.“Don’t look at the window again.”That was it. No explanation. No name. Just that one line, like the fridge itself was whispering.My hand trembled as I slammed the door shut.Then—knock knock knock.Again.Same rhythm. Same weight.The sound drilled into me, stripped away whatever calm I had left. My whole body tensed, but this time, instinct didn’t scream. This time, I didn’t freeze.I glanced at the clock.1:35 AM.I blinked.Wait.That was past the time window. Rule #1 ended at 1:34 AM.Technically… I could open the door.And I did.Cautiously. Slowly. Holding my breath like it might make a difference.I opened the door.And saw nothing.Just the empty desert, black sky overhead, wind rustling sand like whispers too quiet to understand.But then—I looked down.And that’s when my stomach dropped.A second manual lay on the ground.Different cover. Thicker.Stamped in large, blood-red lettering:“Rules for Eric – Night Two.”Night two.There wasn’t supposed to be a night two.I wasn’t coming back. No one was.That’s when I realized the truth.This place—Station 119B—wasn’t a weather station. It never had been. It was a test. A ritual. A trap.And I wasn’t an employee.I was a subject. A sacrifice. A participant in something I didn’t understand and could never escape.Maybe I hadn’t broken Rule #1. Not technically.But I didn’t care about technicalities anymore.I was done playing by their rules.I walked back inside, teeth clenched, and dropped the new manual into the candle flame.Just like Rule #12 said: If Rule #1 is broken, burn the manual immediately… and pray.The paper caught instantly. The flame devoured it. Pages curled and blackened, the fire dancing like it had a mind of its own.Like it was laughing.I backed away.That’s when the room changed.Instantly.No warning. No flicker. Just gone.The cot—gone. The fridge—gone. The desk, the equipment, the satellite phone—all erased.The room had reset.Same size. Same shape. Same walls.But stripped bare.Just me.The window.And the candle.My breath came in shallow gulps.Then came the tapping.But this time—it wasn’t on the glass.It was inside the walls.Light, skittering taps at first. Then heavier. Then moving.Circling me.Like something was crawling through the concrete. Tracing a spiral I couldn’t see. Trapping me in the center.My mouth opened, but no sound came out.And then—I remember screaming.I don’t remember why, exactly.Only that my voice tore from my throat like it was trying to escape without me. I remember scratching at the door. Fingernails splitting against steel. I remember the candle going out.And I remember the shadows.They crawled under my skin.Not metaphorically. I could feel them. Like black centipedes burrowing through my veins. Eating their way into my thoughts.Then—Nothing.I woke up at dawn.Face down in the dirt, fifty yards from the station. My clothes damp with dew. My hands shaking.My car keys clenched tight in one fist.The manual—gone.I stumbled back to the building.The door hung open. No lock. No chain.Inside?Empty.No furniture. No gear. No candles.Only one thing remained.A mirror.Taped to the center of the window.I walked up to it.I should’ve turned away.I should’ve remembered Rule #9.But I looked.And what looked back wasn’t me.It wore my face—but not my eyes.The eyes were wide. Too wide. Stretched like the skin around them had been peeled back.They were black, bottomless. Not hollow, but full—of things I couldn’t describe. Things that watched from the other side of glass. Things that waited.Things that remembered.Now?I don’t take jobs anymore. I don’t go outside after dark. I stay indoors. I keep the lights on. I pretend the rules still protect me.But nights are hard.Sometimes I hear knocking.Always three times.And if the wind ever dies completely…I stop breathing.Just in case it's still out there.Waiting for me to forget the rules.Even just once.",

      "content_preview": "I don’t know what to do. I’m writing this from a plastic chair in a hospital waiting room. It smells like bleach and quiet despair. My parents are in a room down the hall, in a coma, and the doctors keep using words like “unprecedented” and “unexplained.” But I know what happened. I was there. I watched it happen. And the worst part, the part that is hollowing me out from the inside, is that I think I could have stopped it sooner.My life, up until a week ago, was normal. Boring, even. I’m 18, just finished the soul-crushing marathon of high school final exams. My parents are good people. Quiet, loving, a little old-fashioned. My dad is an immigrant, came here with nothing, and has no family in this country. My mom was an orphan, raised in the system. So, it’s always just been the three of us. A small, tight-knit, unremarkable little unit.After my last exam, I came home and crashed. I was so mentally and physically drained that I slept for nearly 24 hours straight. It was a deep, dreamless, black-hole kind of sleep. When I finally woke up, it was the next morning. The sun was streaming through my window, and for the first time in months, I felt… light. The weight of school was gone. I felt free.I went downstairs to the kitchen, expecting to find my mom making coffee, the house smelling of toast and the comfortable quiet of a Saturday morning. My parents were there. But they weren't alone.Sitting at our small kitchen table, in my chair, was a man I had never seen before.He was maybe in his mid-thirties. He had long, straight black hair that fell past his shoulders, a stark contrast to his pale skin. But his eyes… his eyes were the first thing you noticed. They were a shocking, brilliant, jaundiced yellow. The color of a canary, or a fresh bruise. And they were fixed on the bowl of cereal in front of him with an unnerving intensity.My parents looked up as I entered, and they smiled. Not their normal, warm smiles. These were bright, brittle, and a little too wide.“Good morning, sleepyhead!” my mom chirped, her voice a full octave higher than usual. “Come, come, join us. There’s someone we want you to meet.”I just stood there, dumbfounded. A million questions were swirling in my head, but none of them could find their way to my mouth.“This is… a relative of ours,” my dad said, gesturing towards the man with a strange, almost reverent sweep of his hand. “He’s been out of the country for a very long time. He’s going to be staying with us for a while.”I finally found my voice. “A relative? What relative? You don’t have any relatives here. And Mom, you don’t have any at all.”The bright smiles on my parents’ faces faltered for a fraction of a second. A flicker of something—panic? annoyance?—passed through their eyes before the manic cheerfulness snapped back into place.“Oh, you know, a distant cousin,” my mom said, waving a dismissive hand. “From your father’s side. It’s a long story. We’ll tell you all about it later. Now, sit. Have some breakfast.”I sat. The meal was the most uncomfortable, unnerving twenty minutes of my life. The man never spoke. He never looked up from his bowl. He ate with a slow, deliberate precision, lifting the spoon to his mouth and back down without a single wasted movement. My parents, however, never stopped talking. They kept up a frantic, one-sided stream of chatter directed at him, answering questions he never asked, laughing at jokes he never told.“The weather is lovely today, isn’t it?” my mom said to him. “You always did love the sun.”“We’ll have to take you to the park later,” my dad added. “Just like old times.”It was like they were reading from a script, or like they were hearing a conversation that I couldn't. It was insane.Later that day, when I got my dad alone, I pressed him. “Dad, seriously. Who is that guy? Where did he come from?”My father’s face went cold. The forced cheerfulness vanished, replaced by a stern, hard mask I hadn’t seen since I was a little kid who had broken a rule. “His name is not your concern,” he said, his voice low and flat. “He is our guest. You will treat him with respect. You will not ask any more questions. This is not up for discussion.”And that was it. The conversation was over.The first few days were a masterclass in quiet, creeping dread. The man remained a silent, unnerving presence in our home. He never spoke a word. Not one. I tried, once. I found him alone in the living room, just standing in the center of the room, staring at a blank wall.“Look,” I said, my voice shaking slightly. “I don’t know who you are, or what you’re doing here, but this is my home, and…”I never got to finish. My parents appeared in the doorway as if summoned from thin air.“Don’t be rude to our guest,” my mother snapped, her voice sharp with a panic I didn’t understand. “He is family. Apologize.”I just stared at them, then at the silent man with the yellow eyes, and I retreated to my room.The house started to feel less like my home and more like a temple dedicated to this silent, creepy stranger. The power dynamic shifted in ways that were both subtle and terrifying. At dinner, my mother would serve his plate first. And then we would all have to wait. We weren’t allowed to take a single bite until he had finished his entire meal, which he always ate with the same slow, methodical pace. Only when his plate was clean were we permitted to eat our own, now-cold, food.Then, we were forbidden from speaking to him directly. “If you have something to say, you say it to us,” my dad instructed, his face grim. “We will relay the message.” It was absurd. He was sitting right there. But I saw the look in my father’s eyes. It was not a suggestion. It was a commandment.The worst part was the locked room. It was the spare bedroom upstairs, the one we used for storage. They cleared it out for him. And they started spending hours in there with him, the door locked from the inside. My mom would take him a tray of food, and then she and my dad would go in with him, and they wouldn’t come out until long after dark.I couldn’t stand it. The mystery was eating me alive. I had to know what was happening in there.Last night, I did something I probably shouldn’t have. I waited until they were all in the room. I crept up the stairs, my heart a frantic drum against my ribs. The old house has old doors, with old-fashioned keyholes. I knelt down, my hands trembling, and put my eye to the cold brass.The room was dark, lit only by a few dozen candles they had arranged on the floor. The air inside seemed to shimmer. And in the center of the room, he was standing. His posture was ramrod straight, like a statue, his head tilted back and his long, thin arms raised towards the ceiling, his fingers splayed. He was utterly, unnaturally still.And my parents… my parents were on the floor in front of him. On their knees. They were prostrated before him, their bodies shaking, their heads bowed to the ground. And they were whispering. A low, rhythmic, frantic stream of gibberish, a language that wasn’t a language, a sound of pure, terrified devotion. They weren’t hosting a relative. They were worshipping a god.I scrambled back from the door, a wave of nausea and terror washing over me. This was wrong. This was a sickness. My parents were in some kind of cult, and this man was their leader. They were in danger. I was in danger.I ran to my room, locked the door, and I called the police. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely dial the number. I whispered into the phone, telling the operator that there was a strange man in my house, that my parents were acting erratically, that I was scared for our safety. They said they would send a car over immediately.I hung up, a small sliver of relief cutting through my panic. Help was coming.Knock. Knock.The soft, polite knock on my bedroom door made my blood turn to ice.I didn’t move. I barely breathed.Knock. Knock.I knew who it was. I had never heard him move through the house before. He was always just… there. But I knew.I slowly, shakily, stood up and opened the door.He was standing there. The man with the long black hair and the terrible yellow eyes. And for the very first time since he had arrived in my home, he was looking directly at me.And he was smiling.It was a wide, thin-lipped, maniacal grin, a grotesque slash of white in his pale face. It was a smile of pure, triumphant malice.All the fear, all the confusion of the past week erupted out of me in a single, raw scream. “Who are you?! What have you done to them?! Get out of my house! The police are coming for you! You hear me?! They’re coming!”He didn’t say a word. The horrible smile never wavered. He just held my gaze for a long, silent moment, and then he turned, as calmly as if he were going for a stroll, and walked down the stairs.I followed him, stumbling, my mind a blank roar of terror and rage. He walked to the front door, opened it, and stepped outside. He didn’t run. He just walked down the quiet, suburban street, his tall, thin figure silhouetted against the streetlights, until he turned a corner and was gone.I ran back upstairs, screaming for my parents. I found them on the floor of the spare bedroom, amidst the extinguished candles. They were lying on their sides, unconscious, their faces pale and slack. They were breathing, but it was shallow, faint. They wouldn't wake up.The police arrived a few minutes later. It was a blur of flashing lights, professional voices, and questions I couldn’t properly answer. I told them everything. The man, his yellow eyes, the way my parents were acting, the room upstairs, him leaving just moments before they arrived. I gave them his description, every single detail burned into my memory. An ambulance came and took my parents away.I stayed with two of the officers. They were… sympathetic, I guess. But I could see the skepticism in their eyes. They told me they were going to check the home security footage. We had a small, simple system, just a few cameras covering the front and back doors.I sat at my kitchen table, my head in my hands, as one of the officers reviewed the footage on his laptop. After a few minutes of silence, he called his partner over.“Hey, check this out.”I looked up. The officer turned the laptop towards me. The screen showed the footage from the front door camera from just a few minutes ago. I saw myself, a frantic, terrified figure, following something. I saw myself screaming at the empty doorway. I saw the front door open, as if by a gust of wind, and then close again.But the man… the strange man with the yellow eyes… he wasn't there. He wasn’t in the footage at all. It just looked like I was having a complete psychotic breakdown, screaming at nothing.“There’s no one there, son,” the officer said gently. “The cameras didn’t pick up anyone entering or leaving the house all night, except for you.”I was still staring at the screen, my mind refusing to accept it, when I heard the other officer’s voice from the other room. He was on his phone, his voice low and urgent.“…yeah, another one. Same as the others. The parents are catatonic. The kid is talking about a tall guy with yellow eyes… No, nothing on the cameras, same as always. It’s the fifth one this year.”He trailed off as he saw me looking at him. The officers wouldn't tell me anything else. Just that they would be investigating.So now I’m here. At the hospital. My parents are in a deep coma. The doctors have run every test they can think of. They have no answers. Their brains just seem to have… shut down.I know what happened. He was real. He was a predator. And my parents were his nest, or his food, or something I can’t begin to comprehend. He drained them dry, and then he moved on. And the officer’s words… the fifth one this year. He’s still out there. He’s doing this to other families.And I could have stopped it. I should have called the police the first day. The first hour. The moment I saw him sitting in my chair. But I waited. I was scared. I was confused. And now, my parents are gone, maybe forever, and it’s my fault. I failed them. I was the only one who could see the monster, and I did nothing until it was too late.",

      "content_preview": "I live in a fairly safe neighborhood in a not so safe country if you know what I mean. I reside in a street that’s lined with houses that are blocked around/ private and everyone more or less knows everyone in there but of course we’re always vigilant because you can never tell when you might be unlucky .I live about a quarter mile in , my house right after a bridge next to a deep river (that you can’t really cross) and on the other side miles of tall grass. I live with 7 other people in the household. Every night we ensure we lock the main front gate & activate the security cameras. We also have staircases leading to the front and back entrances of the second floor that’s burglar proofed & secured by even more gates . The remaining perimeter of the property  is blocked off with high concrete walls adjoining the roof leaving no space for any sizable creature to crawl through.This particular night the entire family was out. They had gone to a wake of a close family friend. I was home alone because I’m 26 and needed an early night’s rest for work the following day. It was just after 8pm I locked up & went to shower. I usually play music while doing so but a few minutes into my routine I could’ve sworn I heard a faint knock coming from my front door. At this I quickly jumped out , turned off the music & stood in silence. Feelings of confusion and panic were creeping in because I was 100% sure everything was locked , the gates the doors plus I had the keys inside the house. A few drawn out moments passed when I heard it again but this time it came from my bedroom window that’s on the second floor with no ledge to stand on , on the opposite side of the house . I  checked the cameras and saw that there was no one at any of the windows or entrances and it showed no one entered any time into the property.My logical mind brushed it off as maybe a huge bug or something but I wasn’t convinced. I got dressed and as soon as I walked back into the living room, I heard the padlock on the main front gate being tampered with. This padlock is inside and you basically have to shove your hand in an awkward position through narrow metal bars to even reach it. I hurriedly checked through a window that gave direct sight to the main gate & what I saw made my knees buckle.Standing outside my gate, in the darkness of the night faintly aglow by the dimming street light was my grandmother. She was in one of her homemade dresses she had sewn and her head was covered with a white translucent shawl that obscured part of her face.Now you’re probably thinking - dude go open the gate for your grandma. Well only one problem with that - she’s been dead for 14 years AND was CREMATED.I blinked a million times trying to blame exhaustion from work for what I was seeing but somehow whatever that stood there taking the form of my poor grandmother had caught sight of me looking through the window . It slowly raised its hand and waved awkwardly and beckoned me to come open the gate without saying a word.Immediately I called my mom and explained what was going on. Thankfully she didn’t doubt me because she had also experienced strange things along with my other relatives in this street. I looked out after making the call and saw that the figure was gone. Within 20 minutes my mom and other relatives arrived home.They did a thorough search and found no one on the property. What’s even weirder was that the security camera footage showed no one was standing at the gate during the time I was experiencing this. My older cousin decided to do one last check around the house outside this time and in some tall overgrown bushes a few feet from the property he found a white shawl - except this one had many holes and was tinged with dirt as if it had been buried under the earth for years.This happened a month ago & since then I’ve never stayed home at night alone.",

      "content_preview": "When guests visited our apartment, they always commented on the smell—something old, almost medicinal. We blamed the building’s age, and after removing their shoes to come in, they’d eventually stop noticing it. Three years later and I still smell it. Reminds me of hospitals from my childhood.My roommate Paul had the bigger room because he was here first, and I had responded to an ad online to rent the other. Kitchen, common area where we had the TV and our gaming consoles, dining nook, and a covered patio. Paul and I got along even though we came from different worlds. His was one that required a lot of posturing with friends and being perpetually online. Mine was maybe lonelier.Somehow, we clicked, and after our respective workdays we often found ourselves collaborating on meals and playing games late. I liked RPGs; he preferred co-op shooters which I joined reluctantly because he got frustrated, yelled, and gave me side-eye whenever I suggested staying calm. He blamed his thick fingers.From our apartment you could look down at a parking lot where every Tuesday garbage trucks made their rounds at 7 a.m. to the chagrin of tenants whose bedrooms faced that way, like mine.I feel like these are important details. I’m describing my life as it has been for a while. It’s where I live, and it’s where I am now. It’s the mundane little facts that I need to tell you, so that they serve as counterweights to the hefty truth I’m about to unload, in search of sober advice. I just need to tell it so that you can understand. You won’t understand, but I’ve got to at least try.“Olly, check it out!” I remember Paul said. I slurped some cheerios messily and looked up from my phone.“What up?” I said.“Those look new.”I lazily pulled myself up and looked out the window.“Huh? What, where?”“Those shoes. I’m gonna go get them.”Paul rushed out and soon emerged in the parking lot. I watched him step gingerly in his moccasins to the dumpster, and scoop up the pair of bright white sneakers, grinning up at me as he scurried back.The door slammed. I pressed into my lower back to stretch as Paul came in. He proudly displayed the pair of shoes in one hand and snapped with the other.“Tight!”“They don’t stink,” I said.The shoes were completely white, and despite sitting by a dumpster were impeccably clean.“Smell like roses, these,” he said.“Well, will they fit?”“Size 11 baby!” he confirmed.“Nice coincidence.”Now we’ve come to the part of the story I can’t really expect you to believe. I wouldn’t. In my family we’ve seen tragedy. My younger brother was born with a disease that meant lots of operations before he could even walk. Hospitals became second homes; iodine soap a familiar salve; plastic-wrapped food and peel-back tin capped juice in those milky plastic containers a family meal. I accompanied my parents every time they went, and each time was like sucking the color out of dreams, the whimsy out of imagination. I didn’t grow up all at once, but my childhood was not child friendly. I learned that life was limited, solutions pragmatic and usually muted and smelly.“Lemme try ‘em on,” said Paul.He sat on the couch, pulled off his moccasins, put on the right shoe, then the left. And disappeared.As soon as he put those shoes on, he was gone. Gone not in any sense that is common. I mean gone without any real-world indication that he was there before. Gone without any vision, nor any sound that would signal his disappearing. He was there, then he wasn’t, as if his existence simply ceased.I watched the couch cushion slowly reform itself where Paul had been sitting. I was still standing, but I had moved back up against the wall and my palms were pressed against it as if expecting the room to suddenly fall away or for gravity’s pull to shift 90 degrees.What felt like eternity was only a minute, and then Paul was back, sitting on the couch, panting, one of the new shoes in his hand. He looked around like a stranger before finding my eyes and locking on, making me feel like prey.“Fuck!” I yelled.“Fuck,” he whispered. He slowly regained control of his breathing and then yelled, wide-eyed at me. “Fuck! Olly!”“What!” I screamed back, shaking. “What!”Blood rushed back into his face as his complexion softened, and his eyes narrowed.“Bro,” he said. “You won’t believe it.”I didn’t believe it. He told me that he was in a forest. He said it was hot and humid, and the noises of insects, birds and dripping rain were as vivid as anything here. He struggled to recall things at first because of the shock, but as we calmed down, he told me he had truly been there, in the rainforest, standing on moist black dirt and looking up at sunlight piercing canopy. He said it smelled ‘exquisite’, a word that was out of character for him.“You’re saying you were in the Amazon?” I said finally.“No idea bro,” he said. “Amazon maybe. I don’t know.”“Maybe Borneo?”“I don’t know. The rainforest man. The deadass rainforest.”“Alright,” I said.By now he had taken off the other shoe and the pair was just sitting there in front of us on the rug.Paul eyed me. Looked at the shoes.“Yup,” he said. “You gotta.”“The hell I do,” I countered.“You gotta.”He grimaced, reading my face, I guess.“You wanna, Olly. You wanna, trust me.”I did. I felt calm enough to know that I did. I had to try this. They’d fit my size 10 feet.I bent down and grabbed one, slipped it on my socked foot. Grabbed the other, and held there, staring at Paul.“What should I—you know,” I prompted.“Fuck, right, dude. Listen. Just take the shoe off, it’s what I did, and pow, I’m back. Just take off the shoes.”This was our exchange before I put the other shoe on, and the apartment was immediately gone. No cues, no noise or visual of transition. Just there, and now here. Where was I? It wasn’t a forest like Paul; it was a field. I felt the sun on my skin. Hills in the distance, and a highway? A semi-truck rumbling past. Buildings in the distance.I bent down and tore off a shoe, and was suddenly back in the apartment facing a roommate whose body language bounced with intrigue.“Dude!” he yelled. “You just vanished!”“My God,” I said. “Jesus Christ.”He was nodding with his whole head and neck, as if vibing. Wide-eyed, unblinking.“Sick, right? The rainforest—”“—not a forest,” I said. “More like a prairie, I guess? But there was a road, a big truck. Buildings too.”“No shit. I’d’ve checked out those buildings,” he said a bit curtly.“Yeah but I came back before I could really get my bearings. It was crazy.”“Crazy,” he repeated. “Crazy.”We both looked at the shoe I held.So, this is the secret. Magical shoes that transported us. Not unheard of in fiction but I am telling you that this happened to us. Paul went to a forest. I went to a prairie. We found a pair of shoes in the trash and put them on and were teleported to these destinations instantaneously.It didn’t stop there. It couldn’t. Would you have stopped? Paul went again. When he came back, he told me he was on a hill overlooking a valley and could see a whole city that he didn’t recognize. I went again and found myself on a grey sand beach with a cold wind. We went a few more times like this. Once, I found myself on a snowy mountain, and when I reappeared in our apartment Paul said I was cold to the touch. There was even snow in my hair. Then Paul went again, and the asshole was gone for five whole minutes. When he returned, I was surprised to see him cradling about 10 mangos.“What the hell?” I said.“A mango orchard man, a bleeping orchard fer real!”“Are they ripe?”We took a break from teleportation over slices of fresh mango. We discussed our experience and decided that the destinations were random. We knew it didn’t matter if we walked around, that we always returned to the apartment. We knew there were cities, so we knew there were people. It was clearly Earth so whatever magic this was, it was here. But when was it? Had either of us seen anything out of whack for 2025? No, we hadn’t. Still no people.“Maybe we should stop,” I remember saying. “Give it a rest maybe.”Neither of us wanted to do that. We had the whole day still.We took turns teleporting, and we learned more. We started to figure that eventually we should land in cities. A few times we each landed within sight of populations, but since we had agreed to a one-minute limit after Paul’s five-minute disappearance, we couldn’t yet reach those places. Paul begrudged the rule. We also figured that if we hadn’t landed in towns or cities yet, it was only because most of the globe is still just wild land, farms, or water.Bad timing, to jinx ourselves like that.I pulled on the second shoe and at once lost my senses. Not that I couldn’t feel, because the shock of cold was devastating and I gasped. Not that I couldn’t taste because when I gasped, I lost my breath as my mouth filled with icy salt water. Not that I couldn’t see but it was black night and then plunging darkness. Not that I couldn’t hear but it was shrieking wind and then warbled frigid water in ghostly depths that seemed to tear me in different directions.I struggled, panic filled. Reach. But swim, swim! I thought. Must breathe, I knew, but I could escape this. I reached, and just as my lungs began to inhale, my frozen knuckles locked their fingers around a shoe and tugged it off.Suddenly I was in the apartment on all fours heaving and vomiting saltwater over our rug. Shivering miserably, drenched completely. I felt Paul hitting my back. My ears were ringing, adjusting to the sudden warmth.Paul brought water. Patted my back.“I was,” I said. My voice sounded like gravel. “I was in the ocean, I think.”Paul just stared, nodded. He was amazed and still I sensed, jealous?Later I sat in my robe wrapped in towels before a humming space heater. I told him about the storm, the night. We had already experienced nighttime in the couple hours we had been at this adventure. I told him about the crashing waves that I couldn’t escape.“We have to be more careful,” I said.That had been enough for one day.We agreed the shoes would stay in the living room, that we would only use them together. We spent the rest of the evening talking about it. Unbelieving, but convinced. We planned. From now on we had an entry position. We’d sit in cannonball position, but one leg crossing the other. Both hands would grasp the second shoe as we put it on, so that we’d already be prepared to yank it off in case of trouble. We considered other things like wearing a wetsuit and flippers, goggles, even an oxygen tank, given how likely it should be that we’d land in an ocean somewhere. But ultimately, we decided to buy a large plastic sheet from Home Depot and lay it out on the living room floor to catch water, and to purchase a simple lifejacket that wouldn’t hinder movement when teleporting plopped us on dry land.I barely slept that night. As frightening as they were, these shoes changed my life. I was jittery with excitement, suppressing fear.We both called in sick next morning. Of course we did.Then we got into Paul’s car and went on our errands. Only took an hour.Back at the apartment, we laid our new plastic sheet where the rug had been. Rug was hung to dry out on the patio. The life jacket was a small sea kayaker’s jacket. Stylish and minimal. We had also bought a small knife, some beef jerky, a headlamp, a length of high-strength static line, and bug spray. The jacket had pockets for these things.We also decided to pack my phone in the jacket. It had a better waterproof rating than Paul’s, and my international roaming plan was less ghastly expensive than his, if we ever landed somewhere with signal. We wanted to take photos and videos. But mostly it was to set the timer, as we’d agreed to increase the time to five minutes. Later we’d increase it to ten minutes.We shared a large breakfast of hashbrowns, egg sausage sandwiches and dark coffee. Then the adventure began.As the morning progressed, an area of our living room began to look like a naturopath’s collection. On each trip, we’d bring something back. A rock. A branch. A flower or bundle of grass. Dirt, or sometimes trash. It was shocking how rarely we landed close to people yet how often we found trash. It became clear that we were hitting places all over the world. Wrappers with Chinese lettering, a grocery bag with Tamil (the phone translation app said), French, other languages we’d yet to identify.On one trip Paul was gone over five minutes. I began to worry. His phone rang and I picked it up. ‘Olly’, it read. I accepted.“Paul?” I said, haltingly.“Brooooo!” I heard him yell. It was a perfectly clear call.“Paul!” I exclaimed. I stood and paced. “Paul where are you?”“I’m not sure but I got bars bro! So, I’m callin’.”“Any landmark? What’s the climate?”“Pretty dry. I think I’m in a desert, but there are power lines I see. I guess a cell tower’s close so.”My hand was in my hair, as if calming my mind.“Clear skies,” he said.“Maybe you’re stateside somewhere? Southwest? Take a photo, we can reverse image search back here again. Or wait just open the map app, I downloaded a ton of regions last night.”“Hold on.”I waited a few seconds.“No dice, no internet just calling. GPS shows I’m nowhere,” he said.“Damn.”“Yeah. Hey, Olly?”“What’s up?”Just then he appeared almost exactly where I was pacing and I bumped into him, knocking us both to the plastic-covered ground. We laughed maniacally.When we calmed, he showed me some photos he’d taken.“GeoGuessr eat your heart out,” I said.“Huh?”“You know, that Google Maps street view game? It shows you a street view somewhere on the planet and you guess where it is by dropping a pin on a map. Whoever’s closest wins. I played with colleagues a few times.”“That’s an idea,” said Paul.We created a map, named it ‘Jumping Jimmies.’ Then we did a reverse image search on one of the pictures that Paul had taken with my phone. While it wasn’t conclusive it gave us some lookalikes.“Could be that one. ‘Red Sand’, in Saudi.”“Mmm,” I said. “But look at that rock, a bit too unique. You woulda seen that. This one? Devil’s Desert?”“Not sandy enough.”“Namibia? No.”“Wait, that one!” Paul exclaimed. “What’s that?”“Oh yeah that looks good. Says ‘Atacama, Chile’.”“Yes! That’s it I’m sure of it! Mark it.”We chose a series of icons that we labeled by the percentage of how sure we were of each location. ~90% on the Atacama Desert, green circle.Elation welled up in my heart. I had always loved to travel and now I was traveling the world incognito. Paul and I were prepared, ready, and eager. We thought we anticipated everything. If only we’d kept our guard up…By evening many colorful icons dotted our map. We had taken dozens of photos, one of Paul’s toothy smile beside a grinning shepherd on a mountain road somewhere in Kyrgyzstan, another of a group of people at a bus stop in a Colombian town (Paul envied how often I landed with people).“Yeah, you always get the good places,” Paul said. “I just get trees and hills. Every single time.”Puddles pooled on the plastic tarp in our living room from a handful of times we found ourselves swimming. Paul wanted to visit a city, but I wasn’t ready to increase our time limit enough to walk to one or to board a bus like in Colombia. We had to take it slowly, and I knew that if Paul would be patient we’d land in one.But then it finally happened.Tokyo is the largest city on Earth, with a population over 30 million. Fitting then that it was the first big city we happened upon, or that I happened upon. I had learned to reign in my expectations when slipping on the second shoe. In less than an instant I was teleported onto a narrow road, remarkably carless and calm, staring up at skyscrapers glinting in sunlight. I recognized Japanese on the shopfront, and English accompanying all the street signs. In fact, I’d been to Tokyo before, and so the sight was familiar. The sight of me, however, less so. At least to a curious couple ogling me. I realized a foreigner in the middle of a Tokyo street wearing a lifejacket packed with survival items and awkwardly sat hugging his knees and grabbing a shoe would look bizarre.I scampered to my feet and out of the way of a stout little delivery van driving past. I smiled at the couple who continued walking. I retrieved my cell phone; 09 minutes 04 seconds left before I should remove a shoe.Something immediately caught my attention—the sweet scent of tempura frying. I located its source: a small restaurant with ubiquitous noren fabric hanging to mark its entryway. I was in Tokyo. I loved Japanese food, loved it absolutely. Here I was! I had to, right? We couldn’t control where we landed, so who knows when I’d happen upon Japan, and Tokyo itself, again? I found my hands searching my chest as I realized I had no money. We should’ve been traveling with credit cards at least. But they pay with cash here mostly. Impractical to travel with every currency, though, and impractical to expect a currency exchange.Then it dawned on me, to my shame and to my joy, that I could dine and dash without so much as a step to flee.Parted the noren to enter. Konnichiwa, hello. I sat at the bar in the narrow locale, removing my lifejacket ashamedly and hanging it on a hook underneath. I ordered the tendon by pointing. The aroma, the delectable crispy vegetables and shrimp, beautifully crisp, and umami flavors.As if waking from a dream I remembered Paul and quickly checked the time. I was already ten minutes overdue! With averted eyes and utter embarrassment and shame for what they’d think, I snatched my lifejacket and ducked under the bar. Removed a shoe.“Son of a bitch!” yelled Paul. “Where the fuck were you? I was freaking out man. We said ten minutes!” He sniffed. “What’s that smell?”I begged his forgiveness and placed my hands on his shoulders, urging him onto the couch. Calm, calm.“It’s toasted sesame,” I said. “I was in Tokyo. I ate tempura.”“Tempura? That fried stuff they serve with sushi?”“Sure, yeah.”“Did you say... Tokyo? A city? You ate in a city!?” he yelled, smiling.“Damn right,” I said.“Jumpin’ jimmies!” he yelled, and I repeated that refrain reflexively. “Mark it down! A city, you lucky bastard. Lowkey smells insane. You lucky, lucky asshole. And you didn’t bring any back.”“Damn it!” I said. “I’m sorry Paul, I didn’t think about it. When I saw the time—”“—Yeah. All good. Man, I want to land in a city.”Paul’s eyes were on the lifejacket, but not really. They were distant, imaginative. I couldn’t tell if he was more happy or more envious -- long stares are tough to decipher.“You’ll get there man, I promise. We’ll get you there.”For a moment annoyance crossed his expression, but it didn’t linger long enough for comment.“Yeah,” he said plainly.We jumped a few more times and then Paul said he wanted to take a break. Envious, it turned out. He was sulking. Disappeared into his room without too many words between us. I figured he’d just have to let it settle, and we’d be back at it in the evening.I fixed myself a sandwich and ate it while observing our disorderly living room. Souvenirs, laptops, wet plastic. Then I retired to my own room, surprised to feel tired. I think the jumps take it out of you.I sank into willful sleep.When next I woke it was dark outside. I’d slept the whole afternoon. Clock read 9 p.m.Out in the living room everything looked the same. Paul’s door was shut. My mouth felt dry and so I poured a glass of water and leaned on the counter, marveling at our mess again.Then I saw.The shoes were gone.I set the glass down, and skipped to Paul’s door, knocked.“Paul? You awake?” I opened it. “Paul?” Not there.As I rushed back into the living room and started upending cushions in search of the shoes, it was like watching an actor in a movie you’ve already seen. I knew he’d taken them. I knew he jumped.The lifejacket was on the floor. I retrieved my phone from a pouch. “Idiot,” I thought. “You left it.”No missed calls, no texts. I called Paul’s phone and heard it ringing in his room. “Idiot,” I said to myself more sharply.How long had he been gone? I looked for any new artifacts, any notes or new pins on our Google map. Nothing. I checked the tarp, which was mostly dry now. His car was still parked outside. I opened our front door and stuck my head out. Hallway was clear.“This sonofabitch straight up donned the shoes and peaced,” I said aloud.In anger I sounded more like Paul than myself. Oppressive silence seemed to coalesce. It was a bit more humid than normal—all the extra salt water. Suddenly our pile of artifacts and souvenirs seemed nasty, so I grabbed a garbage bag and shoved everything in, tied it off. I was helpless.Hours went by. It was 3 a.m. by the time I felt tired again. My eyes stung. I drank some water and retreated to my bed where I finally let myself pass out.Beep-beep-beep.Groggy and petrified I calmed myself when I realized I was just waking up. The garbage truck upturned the dumpster, its metal arms clanging as it guzzled trash and then replaced the container, drove off. I fell out of bed. 7 a.m.Out in the living room the scene was unchanged. No Paul. He had been gone for so many hours.I cooked runny oatmeal, added raisins and slurped it. Could he have drowned? Didn’t take the lifejacket, the buffoon. Real possibility. Maybe he landed in Vegas and would pop back home to regale me with some story worthy of The Hangover. Wild animal could’ve attacked him, but I struggled to imagine he wouldn’t have the time to remove a shoe. Maybe he’s just on a hike. I knew I shouldn’t have eaten that tempura. I like Paul but I knew he was quick to jealousy. Why didn’t I smooth things over? It would’ve taken five minutes max. Paul’s ego wanted, needed to be coaxed. Two days and already we’re at each other’s throats? No that can’t be it. A misunderstanding maybe. He’s just off to prove a point. Don’t fuck with the rules, Olly, he’ll tell me. Tell yourself, man. Leaving precautions behind, no phone even. God damn it.I was chewing on a raisin, the wet oatmeal juice resting in my mouth awaiting to be swallowed. I was staring at the plastic sheet on our living room floor. One moment that’s all I was doing; the next I was staring at a body.Face-down. Shirtless. Holes in his back, blood pooling, some dripping down the torso. White shorts, pockets outturned, stained. One white shoe, stained. The other foot bare and dirty. Thick fingers, bent and broken on one hand. The way jumping works, it makes it seem that this body had been there for as long as I had been looking at that spot, that I’d been staring at it while I slurped cooling oatmeal. That I should feel guilty for only plunging into nightmare after the body appeared and not before.Paul. Paul’s body. His hair, his broken hands. The smell. My mind recalled images of hospitals and gowns with geometric prints, hands scrubbing harsh brown bars of soap with foam that smelled medicinal and metallic and burnt. The smell of memory competed with the smell of death, one trying to sanitize the other because it cannot be. It can’t. He can’t be dead.Oatmeal dribbled down my chin before I could close my mouth. It suddenly tasted like raw meat, and I spat into the sink. I became aware of my pounding heart playing catch-up. All my senses were delayed, as if reality could not so abruptly be changed, so noiselessly debased to this horror.Each sniff triggered a gag. Each blink felt eternal. Give it enough time to just erase this. Blink it out of existence, I know it can be done. Please, please, please.I write this anonymously. My name’s not Olly and his is not Paul. But I need help. There is a body, shot to death, laying on a plastic tarp in my living room. There’s only one shoe the other is gone. No one will believe me. What do I do?",

      "content_preview": "I have been lucky enough to have lived a relatively full life. I have travelled far and wide - from the rainy cobbled streets of London to the jagged peaks of northern Thailand. Along the way, I made many friends and enjoyed careless flings with temporary lovers before they all slipped back into the black pool of memory. So many cherishable moments in time trapped back in faraway lands. I settled back in the states, doing everything by the book. I found a loving girl who stuck around and we’ve built a life together that’s beautiful. It’s a life sacred enough to chisel into a rockwall so it may be immortalized.All of these positive events which I have painstakingly orchestrated through a lifetime of intentional adventure still cannot bury the catalyst which began this chain reaction. I have been running from this my entire life. In a way, the most definable moment of my existence took place over a brief time in a lonely valley in rural West Virginia.This happened back in the early 90s. I lived in one of the most unique places the world had to offer - the National Radio Quiet Zone. It’s a thirteen thousand square mile boundary where all radio activity is heavily limited and any usage is strictly monitored and reported. Why? It’s because in the center of the zone lies a massive observatory with these gigantic radio telescopes taller than the Statue of Liberty. Those towering satellite dishes are listening for any and all radio frequencies coming from deep space and they need total quiet - an open frequency range. If one little radio or microwave or cell phone occupied any one of those frequencies and that just so happens to be the one an extraterrestrial race was using to shoot signals out into the universe - we might never hear their calls. So the colossal dishes point to the skies, listening to eternity, listening for anything that was up there.That’s the hokey speech observatory officials and local politicians would give to the press, though. I know now from family still in the region that the restrictions are much more relaxed these days and most of the people in the quiet zone secretly have internet and all the other modern luxuries anyone else has now. But, back when I was living there in the 90s, I can attest to the restrictions being strictly enforced by some bootlicker who worked for the observatory. We were faithfully living an off the grid lifestyle then.It was a simple life. Of course there was no internet and no television. All we had at home was a single landline which even for the time was considered prehistoric. My parents were always dirt poor, as is the trend in West Virginia. My father pretty much lived in a coal mine which was a few hours deep into the mountains so I rarely saw him. My mom died when I was 17 and that drove my father even deeper into those mines. The house was left all to me most of the year.The catalyst of my great escape happened when I was 19 and dumb as a box of rocks, shallow as a puddle. I worked for my neighbor, who was separated by five miles of tangled forest. He had a small farm that took a ton of work to keep afloat. He was also a neo-nazi. A lot of people in that area sympathized with those views or just looked the other way. I looked the other way.I had one and only friend, Jerry. He worked at the mart. There was no name to the place, it was just a general store that essentially sold bare necessities for life with no bells and whistles.Jerry and I had been friends our whole lives. We went to school together and our friendship grew even stronger when we both played on the football team in high school. Everyone’s pretty close through school when the graduating class is 44, but Jerry and I just got along with no trouble. We had other friends but, after we all graduated, most got the hell out of town and into a college or they stuck around and buried their heads into the next chapter, be it a job or a drug.Me and Jerry would go hunting or go fishing or we’d just sit and do nothing. We’d just sit there and talk all day. It was never anything too deep or cerebral, but looking back, the act of just talking with no greater objective might’ve been one of my finest experiences. It rivals and maybe even trumps all those glamorous adventures later on in my life. We just sat and listened to each other ramble. To us, we were the funniest guys who ever existed, the most skilled hunters and fishers, and the best at living. It was simple and innocent, and I didn’t know how good I had it.When those chilly fall evenings came around, I’d usually finish up at the farm right as the sun fell below the mountains which then turned a cold and hazy blue. Night would soon follow. Night time in the quiet zone, which was already deeply embedded in rural Appalachia, was an abyssal sort of dark. The stars were brilliant and you could even see those intergalactic clouds of the milky way. The sound of night would either be a deafening roar of insects or the purest most crystalline silence you could imagine. Silence so perfect you’d think you could hear the hum of space - your ears listening like those giant satellite dishes not far off.It was one of those chilly fall evenings when my life changed forever. I had just finished up another tiresome day at my neighbor’s farm. I drove a clunky old 1972 Chevy Silverado that was allegedly once a deep forest green, although it had rusted into an ugly gradient of poverty. Itching at the dozens of mosquito bites I had earned, I sputtered out of my neighbor’s farmland which involved taking a bumpy twisting gravel track a quarter mile down to a road that was somewhat paved. This farm road, which was simply just called 132, took me down to our driveway.I was driving down that pitch black road and I was probably going too fast, being a 19 year old that just got off work and all. I passed by the thick old trees on that snaking switchback, racing for my turnoff to home. My faded headlights only offered me a small oval of light directly in front of my truck, everything else was lost. In between those twisted old trees, at some point, was a figure that I screeched right by. I didn’t know what I had seen until minutes later and even then it was paranoid guesswork. A man? I thought it had been a man. A naked man. The way my weak headlights had illuminated the figure so entirely led me to believe he had nothing on. Maybe that was just a trick of my eye, though. I thought little of it once I was home, quickly relinquishing control over a crazed naked man on the side of the road. I just hoped he wouldn’t find his way to the house where I’d have to shoot him.The next day, I was off from work. I remember heading down to the mart for a stale candy bar and to see Jerry. We had talked about hanging out a few days prior. When I went into the mart, Jerry wasn’t there. That wasn’t right. Jerry always showed up to work, he was annoying in that way. Instead, the till was manned by Pete - the dirtiest man in town.“Where’s Jerry gone?” I asked Pete.“Dunno - didn’t show today,” Pete muttered through labored chewing.“Did he call in?” I asked.“I dunno,” he sucked in a violent breath. “Why don’t you go try his folks?”This was hopeless. I already knew Jerry’s parents had gone out of town for a sick relative in Tennessee. I quit the mart and moved onto his house regardless.Jerry’s family lived in an old shadow of a house up the main street a few miles. I knocked on their door multiple times and looked through the windows and found no one inside.Defeated, I went back home. At some point, I tried to call his house on our landline to see if maybe he had gone out for a little while. The damn phone wasn’t even working.For the first time in a while, I had felt truly alone. It was high noon and there were so many more hours until night time and then a whole eternity of night until the next lonely day. I think waves of grief began to finally break through the levees I had put up for two years. I missed my mom and, hell, even missed my dad. I wanted to cry but I wouldn’t give myself the pleasure of a release. Instead, I bottled it up.Where the hell is Jerry?That thought would keep running through my mind. In a town as small and remote as this one was, it was rare to not know the whereabouts of your inner circle. It was driving me stir crazy by the time night rolled around.That was a defining night as well. I had trouble sleeping from the upsetting nature of the day. I was tossing and turning while flashes of silent distant lightning filled my room. Eventually, I got up to go be miserable in another room. I opened my bedroom door which was at the end of a hallway and then that hallway led into our living room which had a big bay window revealing the dark forest beyond. Somebody was pressed up against the window and peering in.I froze in place while my skin ignited. Whoever it was out there was just standing, hands placed on the window with their forehead stuck to the glass. I couldn’t tell if they could see me submerged in the dark of the hall.How long had he been standing there? Who the hell was he? What’s he doing?I thought he had to have been a burglar.“I’ll fucking kill you!” I shouted out from the dark, expecting him to dart into the forest.He or whoever just kept looking in. I felt he was looking right at me. His head never scanned around and not even a flinch could be perceived from my outburst. He was definitely looking right at something.“I said get the fuck outta here, now!” I tried again. Nothing.Can he not hear me?I thought.I knew he could hear me. I can remember being a kid and hearing my parents fighting or calling my name for dinner through those pitiful walls while I was out in the yard.I was shaking and I couldn’t feel my body from fright. Without warning, a flash of distant lightning filled the skies and exposed the person who I now saw was a man dressed in an all black sort of military outfit. He was wearing some kind of night vision on his head. The few milliseconds of light showed me those two things and I wish I hadn’t even been offered such information.I could’ve vomited right then and there. He was looking directly at me the whole time with that night vision and he definitely wasn’t some strung out burglar. This man looked like a soldier.As soon as I put all the pieces together, I ran to get a gun. Within seconds, I crashed into my room, grabbed my revolver, and pointed it to the bay window. He was gone.I spent the rest of that night clearing the house one hour at a time - always unsure if the man was still watching from outside or had silently slipped in. It was absolutely terrifying but nothing more ever came of it. On my weaker nights, I still see him out of the corner of my eye, just peering in through the windows.The next day I went down to the police station before work and tried to tell them of my encounter with the night vision man. I don’t think they took me all that seriously.“So… this man was just gazing into your window? Just sorta lookin’ in and then he ran off when you threatened him?” asked Lou with a puzzled grin. Me and Jerry had often referred to Lou as deputy dumbass since he was incapable of complex thought. His father was the only reason he became an officer.“No, not exactly. I just said he didn’t move when I yelled at him. He only ran when I went to go grab a gun,” I spit back at Lou who likely didn’t hear my reply.“Well, okay then. Sounds peculiar, a man with night vision and military garb and all,” he twiddled his thumbs and sniffed his nose, “you sure this wasn’t just some illusion of some sort?”“No Lou!”“That’s officer to you, son.”“I know damn well what I saw out there. My mind isn’t lookin’ for illusions.”“How could you know?”“How about you help me for once and just put some damn feelers out, could you do that?”“I’ll get with sheriff.”“Today? Tomorrow? Next week? I don’t wanna end up dead on account of your leisurely pace.”“We’ll get on it. Pronto. Bye now,” Lou shuffled away in his oversized pants.He couldn’t solve a murder if the culprit turned himself in. Infuriated, I itched my mosquito bites until they bled and set off.I stopped by the mart again to check and see if Jerry was around. I rushed in and saw stinky Pete folding a newspaper into something juvenile.“Jerry?” I asked.“Do I look like him?” Pete snapped back.I looked him up and down, the sound of buzzing flies filling the silence.“You know where I could get some of those night vision goggles ‘round here?” I asked just to see what would happen.“What the hell do you need that for?” Pete responded in a flat way, not even looking up from his arts and crafts project.One suspicion down.I went to work and it was a blur of automatic motion and hazy awful daydreams.The night came again, and this time I felt anxious by the all encompassing purple and black shift of the sky. I got in my truck for the quick drive home and suddenly remembered the naked man.What was that guy about,I thought.Was he the same guy as the night vision man?I didn’t want to think about any of it for too long, it was all so unordinary. I didn’t feel safe going home but there was actually nowhere else for me to go unless I just slept in the truck.Maybe I should sleep in the truck,I pondered.I should get on a payphone and call dad,dread filled me thinking about that.Where the hell is Jerry?I started down the chaotic mud track, unsure if I was going home or finding a deserted parking lot for the night. I made it to 132 and paused. Through a small gap in the canopy was the familiar shine of the observatory’s red flashing lights on some low clouds. Many miles away, but still a comfort nevertheless. Something manmade and technologically advanced unlike anything else in the greater area. So advanced and important, it required the rest of us to live in the past just to operate. Maybe I could go there if I needed help, maybe they’d be nice to me and give me somewhere to stay.They’d probably just look at me sideways. I turned left onto 132 and headed home.My truck's headlights shone a pathetic beacon forward as I drove like every other night. The corridor of black trees on either side closing in, trying to reclaim 132. No matter how many times I drove that road, I could never pinpoint exactly where I was. The trees always seemed to change. Who would ever know if they did and what would it mean? I passed two particularly twisted trees and there it was again. The naked man. I slammed on the brakes this time.The truck shook violently to a stop and I looked in my rear view, trying to make the man out. He wasn’t far behind, but I couldn’t see him. It was so dark. I craned my neck to look behind me and beyond the faint glow of my brake lights was a formless void of black. I put the truck in reverse, making sure I saw no headlights approaching from behind as I rolled back up the road.It felt like hours or like I was trapped in a loop of reversing and scanning the treeline. Then I saw a pale body amid the grainy dark standing perfectly still. I kept creeping the truck nearer and nearer until I passed the pale form. The person was standing a few yards off the left shoulder and was seemingly unaware of my presence. Still shrouded in the blackness of night, I tried to get their attention. I couldn’t make out any details despite being so close, so I kept backing up and angled my truck so that my headlights exposed the person. The dim lights finally showed me something awful.“Jerry!” I screamed. “Jerry, oh my god!”I got out of the truck and ran up to him. That was not Jerry.Standing before me with perfect posture was my best friend. He was fully naked and totally catatonic. His mouth was agape and his eyes were shut. I could tell he’d been standing there for a very long time because insects had begun to use him to their advantage. A black widow spun its web in between his legs, ants crawled all across his body, and mosquitoes drank from him freely. I kept calling his name directly to his face and he didn’t do anything. He looked like a statue of himself or one of those wax sculptures. I was so petrified that I myself entered a sort of stupor of my own, just looking at him with terror. I finally let myself cry. I tried shaking him awake and I’d never felt a body so utterly stiff and unmoving. Then, one of those giant spiny house centipedes crawled out of his hair and all around his face until it sought refuge in his open mouth.Irreparable damage. Seeing your friend in that state. He was the closest thing I ever had to a brother. If he had just died instead - a car wreck, hunting accident, or some genetic tragedy - I could eventually overcome the crashing waves of grief. But this was something else entirely. He wasn’t even dead, at least I didn’t think so. I tried to calm myself enough to detect any sign of life. I mean, he was standing up perfectly straight, he couldn’t have been dead. At one point, I could’ve sworn I heard the quietest, saddest wheezing whistling through his open mouth like it was his last breath. That centipede was still in there, who knows how deep it ventured.I don’t know how long I sat there just panicking. I can’t faithfully convey the utter alien nature of it all. Was he alive or dead or something new? I tried to move him, I tried so hard. He wasn’t going anywhere. I was waiting for another car to pass us by so I could wave them down but no one ever came.Whatever was going on with Jerry, I swore to him I’d stay by his side. I told him I wasn’t going to leave him and I had hoped there was a piece of him still floating around in his caged body that could hear me. I brushed all the bugs off of him, I grabbed a stick and persuaded the black widow to abandon its home, I even searched around in Jerry’s mouth for the centipede but it had fallen further into him. I tried to keep him clean and I tried to keep myself calm.It could’ve been hours in that vacuum of agony, I’ll never know. All I know is that somewhere within that space I left my friend out there in that abyss. Cold and alone.I shot awake in my bed, covered in even more mosquito bites and even a few ticks. Judging by the colonies of insects which occupied Jerry, I wasn’t curious where I had gotten them. I was, however, greatly concerned at what had just happened.I had blacked out or repressed something awful - I don’t know. The sun shone through my blinds in brilliant gold. My truck was parked outside.I raced down my driveway, my truck buckling and screeching for mercy. It was only a few minutes until I found the twisted trees where Jerry had stood. Those two trees always looked the same. I got out and examined the ground beneath me. I saw two footprints sunken deep into the ground and then in front of them must’ve been the result of my frenzy last night.I shouted his name through the dense and uncaring forest. I cried again at the absurdity of it all - of the last few days. Where had he gone this time? Had someone taken him? Did he snap out of that trance? The only thing that motivated me was knowing he must be alive and somewhere else now.I sped my truck into town, prepared to make a scene that would be talked about for generations. I whipped into the police station’s parking lot and stormed my way to the door. I could already see the looks from everyone in my peripheral.I swung the door open, ready to burst out into hysterics about what I had seen. Instead, I saw Sheriff Morgan staring at me. He was a large and dominating presence. He got the first word in.“Jerry’s been lookin’ for you everywhere!” he exclaimed.“W-what,” I stammered. “What are you talking about? Jer-Jerry was ju-.”“You just missed him. He seemed real upset and said he needed to get a hold of you,” Sheriff Morgan interrupted and placed a lot of emphasis on the word “needed”.“Well, I was just at home. I just woke up,” I said, so confused.“Maybe he’s there now. It seemed pretty urgent to me.”“Oh-okay. I guess I’ll,” I trailed off into a trance. “I guess I’ll try and catch him.”“Everything alright between you two? What’s goin’ on? He refused to elaborate,” Sheriff Morgan said while closing in on me.“It’s nothin’. We’re just, well, we’re unordinary I suppose,” I was just letting my mouth decide what to say - my brain was overheating.I stumbled back out of the police station and, after the door shut behind me, proceeded to sprint to my truck.I made it home in record time and searched all around for Jerry. I couldn’t find him anywhere. I was about to get back in the truck to maybe try and catch him back at his house but then I saw a small piece of paper under a rock by the backdoor. I went to pick it up and it read:Meet me at the black rock as soon as you see this. Make sure you’re alone. -JMy hands shook with adrenaline, fear, and also excitement at the sight of seeing my best friend’s handwriting. Proof he was still himself enough to know me and know something was wrong. Maybe he could explain what was happening to him. I got in the truck.The black rock was our secret fishing spot that was likely no more a secret than anywhere else, but we always had the best luck there. It was near rapids in the river that roared day and night. We’d always cast our lines and sit on this big smooth black rock. It was about a half hour out of town and a pain to get to, so I knew going in that whatever Jerry had to say was something he wanted to make sure stayed between us.I saw the old crooked sign that advertised gas at 22 cents per gallon and pulled in behind the abandoned service station. Behind the building was a dense treeline with a tiny opening to an old trail people used to use often.I walked down the trail as if I was hunting game. I could see through tiny holes in the dense brush the strong current of the river ahead. I recounted all the times I had drunkenly stumbled up and down this beaten path. All the good times. Now it felt final, like a funeral.I came out the other end and followed the river’s run until I saw Jerry. He was indeed sitting on the black rock, and from behind and a distance away he looked totally normal. This could’ve been any other day where we’d be fishing and I just ran back to the car to grab something unimportant. I couldn’t contain myself as much as I wanted to - had planned to.“Jerry!” I yelled with a childish crack in my voice.He turned and looked at me, waving me over slowly.“Jerry! What the hell man, I mean we’ve got some serious catching up to do,” I said as I fast approached him.I wanted to tackle him and call him a dumbass and ask him days worth of questions but I knew I had to unravel what I had seen gently and methodically.I walked right up to him and part of me had to make sure it was really him. He had barely addressed me beyond the slow wave.“Hey dude, I got your note. I’ve got a lot, I mean a lot of shit to-,” I was interrupted by him.“Sit down, man,” he said with an awfully subdued tone. He sounded ten years older.“Sure,” I sat next to him, staring at him like he was the answer to an ancient mystery.He itched his arm and let out a horrible sigh. The kind of sigh released before words come out that will ruin your life.“I don’t know how to tell you this,” he said. “I really don’t.”“Just lay it on me, man. I got plenty to tell you too.”“I… oh man,” he sighed again, putting his head in his hands and sniffling.I placed a hand on his shoulder and my vision became watery. He bucked it off.“Okay, here it goes. I… I saw - I’ve been seeing some weird shit lately, and I don’t know how to explain it. Maybe you can help me,” Jerry said.“Of course. What have you seen?”“A few nights ago, I shot awake.. It was late like… almost crack of dawn type late.”Would I even need to tell him what I had seen? Or was he already aware of what was happening to him?“I get this strange feeling,” Jerry continued. “I feel eyes on me from somewhere. So I grab the Beretta and I take a walk around the house. Now it’s real quiet out which was odd because this time of year it’s usually, you know… in your face kinda loud with all the bugs. So I’m walkin’ around and then I see something. Up on a mound with no trees or nothin’. I see a silhouette of somebody.”I immediately wanted to interrupt Jerry and tell him I had seen the same man. The night vision man - but he was clearly upset in a way I’d never seen. I let him continue.“He’s just standing there, looking my way. And he just kept standing there. It took a minute but I eventually started yellin’, y’know, threatening him. I told him I had a gun and all that. He didn’t seem to care. Didn’t move a muscle. I was about to fire a round off into the air to try and scare him for real but as soon as I pointed the gun to the sky he took off.”I felt every molecule in me vibrating. It was so hard to wait to tell him my side of things. It was so hard to look him in the face now, knowing there was a centipede digesting in him. I felt like I had watched him die but somehow worse and now he was back here talking to me like normal.“I took off work the next day, which I know isn’t like me,” Jerry admitted. “The whole situation rubbed me the wrong way and I was so damn tired. So I came here to try and take my mind off things.” Jerry wiped his eyes but more tears rushed out as soon as he took his hands away. “Then, the next night came. I was having a rough sleep and woke up around a similar time. I feel strange again. I get out of bed and I try to avoid looking out at that mound, but you know I eventually do. And when I do, I see that man again. Same place, exact same position. I watched him this time, watched for any movement or odd behavior. Nothin’. I felt like he could see me even though I was far off and hidden in the shadows, but I just kept lookin’ at him for a while.”It was the night vision man. Everything Jerry was saying to describe this man was lining up to my experience with him. But why? Why both of us? And who the hell was he?“Right as I was building up the courage to go try and scare him or shoot him or whatever, he took off again. And I’m still curious if it was the exact same time as the night before.”Jerry stared out and took a break between recounting his last few nights and those pauses were agonizing. I wanted to use those perfect gaps to tell my side already, but I could tell if I interrupted he might erupt on me. Besides, I didn’t want him to lose his train of thought.“I just came back here again and tried to amp myself up. I told myself to be a fucking man and to shoot that bastard if he came back on my property again. Just shoot him down and worry about the rest later. He was a threat,” Jerry said, nodding. “He was a threat.”Jerry itched his arms aggressively and I could see the scabs coming off as he did.“Last night, I decided to stay up and wait. I was gonna just camp out and watch that mound. I had my Beretta in hand and, yeah, I felt like a god damn lunatic,” Jerry said before a long pause. “Alright. Here we go. I’m sorry, man.”“What do you have to be sorry for?” I asked.Jerry just sighed and continued, “I nod off at some point, okay? I was sitting there since dusk so boredom must’ve gotten the best of me. I wake up and I see the guy on the mound again. I’m scared at first, but then I’m honestly just angry. Like, who the fuck gave him the right to come on our land and be a damn creep? So I storm out there and I walk up to him. He doesn’t move, he doesn’t do anything. I keep warning him ‘last chance, asshole’ and whatnot. He’s not budging. I get pretty close to him before I realize something fucked up,” Jerry sighed. “He’s naked. Dick’s out and in the wind. I point my gun at him and I nearly pull the trigger right then and there. I don’t, though. Instead I keep my gun fixed on him and walk a few more steps forward.”Naked? The night vision man wasn’t naked for me. Suddenly, Jerry removed something from his waistband.“Tell me why the fuck it was you, man,” Jerry growled, his Beretta now laying in his lap.That hit me like a gunshot from his pistol. My vision warped and my body felt like it had fallen a thousand feet. I couldn’t believe this. He was mistaken. He must’ve been.Iwas the one who sawhim, not the other way around. I watched his stiff body stand in the mud for hours the night before. I peeled the beetles from his skin and waited for help that never came. I did everything I could for him and now he’s got a gun on me. I couldn’t understand. This was all so far beyond me. We were just kids. I swear I did everything I could’ve done for him in that horrifying moment. Then I remembered my unexplained blackout. My ambiguous return home. All of these complex thoughts and emotions turned into one single tear that rolled down my cheek as I stared directly into my best friend’s eyes, who now looked at me with fury and rage.“You,” Jerry muttered as he tightened his grip around his gun. “You fucking freak. You act all innocent now, but I saw you. I walked right up to you and you couldn’t even open your eyes to look at me. You had your mouth open and you wouldn’t move. What the hell is going on with you, man. Drugs? It better be drugs or you’re seriously fucked up in the head. Showing up to my house, stalking me… naked?”“No,” I blurted out. “No, no, no.”“Don’t lie to me. I’m not here to listen to bullshit,” Jerry barked back.“This is… I… Jerry. I saw you. I’ve seen you too.”“What do you mean you’ve seen me too? What the fuck does that even mean, man?”“You were standing on the side of 132 last night, and I saw you the other night too, but I didn’t know it was you yet. On my way home from the farm. You were standing in the dark. Naked.”“Get the fuck outta here. What are you even talkin’ about?”“Y-you were standing there in the exact same way as you described me. Naked, eyes shut, mouth wide open. There were bugs all over you. You looked dead. I tried to move you, but you wouldn’t budge. You wouldn’t move. I tried so hard to get you to fucking move.”“That’s impossible. I would remember something like that.”“I would remember standing outside your house fucking naked too! I’d remember you threatening to shoot me - but I don’t!”Jerry stood up, his gun still drawn. He paced back and forth.“What the fuck,” he said to himself. He pounded his head with frustration.“I know. Listen man, I know. I know it sounds absolutely insane. I know.”“There’s no way that I was naked on the side of the road multiple nights. There’s just simply no fucking way that happened. I-I-I would have died, right? Like, something would’ve gotten me. A bear or something. I would’ve been arrested at some point,” Jerry tried to reason with the unreasonable.I began to piece things together in my mind. A distorted puzzle that didn’t fit together in our way of thinking but maybe to something else. I looked out at the river rushing us by.“At some point when I was out there with you, I blacked out completely. I thought I had just blocked it out or something because you were so messed up and it was just… it was just awful to see you like that. But now I think I blacked out and then became like you,” I said in a defeated way.“I don’t get it. I just don’t see it, man,” Jerry refused.“You said you nodded off at one point when you were staking out the mound. Maybe that was you entering that… state,” I suggested. “You said you sat down around dusk. Well I get off about an hour after and I’m driving home in the dark. That could be just enough time for you to arrive in your uh - your place.”“This is so fucking stupid. You sound like a space cadet,” Jerry said, growing equally defeated. The fight in him was leaving slowly, too.I stayed the course with my crackpot theory. It was confusing enough to slowly calm Jerry down, but I had felt so betrayed by something out there. What was happening to us? I couldn’t believe I was also being assumed every night and terrorizing people I cared about. And just thewhyof it all was so frustrating. A mystery I knew I’d never get to the bottom of. A mystery as enduring as the meaning of life or what came before the universe.“There’s no understanding this, Jerry. I think we just accept it. Tonight, we’ll be out there again. Maybe we can watch over each other until it stops,” I said.“I still don’t see how I wouldn’t remember standing out there naked.”“Look at your arms and your legs. Shit, look everywhere. You’re covered in bites. You don’t get those at the mart. You don’t even get those out here.”Jerry looked at his arms and poked his head under his shirt, flicking it back into place and huffing with frustration.“I just don’t-”“Jerry, just… let it lie. Let it sink in, man.”We both sat there for a while, listening to the wise river crash. I heard the crunch of gravel beneath a boot and looked up to see Jerry flinging his gun into the river. It cracked the water’s surface and that was it.“I had some nasty thoughts just now, figured I outta get rid of that,” Jerry mumbled.I had thought some nasty thoughts too in that period of horrible reflection. I had thought maybe we could end the confusion real quick and easy at the black rock with that pistol. I had thought maybe I could take out Jerry in his next trance with that pistol and then I’d do myself. I didn’t want to know his nasty thoughts.We continued to sit in silence. Something was forever disconnected between us. Something was forever keeping us bonded together.Within four days, I had become a different person forever. Something in me shifted. I don’t think it was a normal shift of a young adult, like becoming jaded or losing innocence. I think it was something absolutely transformative, something that changed my DNA. I felt biologically altered from that time on. Somebody or something out there had played God, or maybe God played with us.We entered our respective trances for three more nights before they stopped entirely, at least for us. We watched over each other in the dark, making sure no wildlife took us, and we even followed each other back home. We were hard to keep up with. We’d both take the same route to our locations each night, but it was as the crow flew.I don’t know what would happen within us or why it happened. I don’t know why we went to where we did and why we were both relatively close to one another’s home when we entered that state.We just did our best to support one another in this inexplicable spell. We were cautiously thrilled when everything stopped after just a week. One awful week that controls my life to this day.The invisible hand had left its mark, though. And with that mark began a life of running. Jerry did the same. We got out of that town as quickly as two broke 19 year olds could. We went our separate ways and have never spoken since.I’ll never forget all the fun we had before that week. Life was just easy. Jerry, I’ll always cherish our friendship, even if we were forced apart by the unknowable. Wherever you are, I hope you’re happy and far away from that place that took so much from us.",

      "content_preview": "At this point I'm not sure where else to turn. If anyone has any ideas on how to help me, please reply.It's been two weeks since my last good nights sleep. I don't know why, but every night I have horrible nightmares of watching my mother die. My mother is not sick; nor is she in some kind of danger, (as far as I know) and I do not carry any resentment towards my mother. She is one of my best friends, and I would do anything for her, but these dreams persist. Every time it's something different: a car crash, heart attack, falling from a 10 story building, and the worst ones, some crazed psychopath killing or violating her in various ways that I'd prefer not to think about.Tracing back my steps, it seems that this all started when I moved into a new apartment. I actually moved back home to Kansas City to be closer to my mother and father, but with how the past two weeks have been, I'm starting to regret it. The place I moved into is a small, old building that looks like it was built around the turn of the century. That old red brick that I loved so much as a child now incases me. The electricity is also pretty shoddy. Lights flicker often and when they do work properly there is a constant buzzing that sounds just too loud for comfort. The building has horrible reception and the internet is practically non existent, but this is what I could afford right now.One night I woke up from a rather disgusting scene of my mother being strung up on a light pole and what sounded like whistling, but it didn't sound like a well formed whistle. It has a very shrill, distorted tone as if someone was trying to whistle while inhaling. If you try to speak while inhaling you get that very distorted sound that doesn't sound quite human. Imagine that, but for a whistle. It sounded like it was coming from the bathroom. Considering how old the building was I assumed it was just some weird noise from the plumbing and tried to go back to bed. When I woke up the following morning, I walked into the bathroom to relieve myself and found an odd sight. The mirror was completely fogged over. It appears that the shower had been running for a while, but no one else lived in my apartment, and there was no other evidence that the water had been running. I wondered if the noise I'd heard last night was water running, but that didn't explain why the mirror was still fogged up. I quickly grabbed my Glock G19, checked the magazine, and ensured a round was in the chamber before clearing the apartment. Once I was satisficed there was no one in the apartment I continued on with my day, trying to forget the strange events of the night before and that morning.Last night I had the worst nightmare yet. I won't go into too many of the gory details, but in sort, I dreamt that a man dressed in some BDSM style leathers was mutilating my mother and cutting her open while she was still alive. I woke up from this in the middle of the night, half way through the dream. I'm not sure what time it was, but the only night in the room came from the digital clock on the beside table and the moon shining through the curtains. I wake up silently screaming for it to stop. The only sound coming from me a choked gasp for air as I realized I was in the realm of the living again. It may have just been a trick from the light and me being on edge from the nightmares, but at the edge of my bed I swear I some a short, pale, humanoid creature. It appeared to have frail, thin limbs that were too long for it's small body. It's head was misshapen, too long, too thin, and the eyes were just dark pin pricks. It was making the same inhaled whistle sound I heard from the previous night. I blinked and it vanished.Since that night I haven't slept. I'm going on 54 hours without sleep now. I can't keep having these dreams, and I'm convinced that that thing is what's causing them. That insidious whistle, I can't unhear it. I haven't seen it, or heard the whistle since that night, but I know if I stay awake long enough, it will come back.",

      "content_preview": "You may be tempted to ask what you’re hauling in your trailer.Don’t.This information is confidential. Management is aware of the details, so that you don’t have to be. Any attempts to open cargo doors for a peek will result in immediate termination, potential legal action, as well as likely an untimely, gruesome demise.You were warned.-Employee Handbook: Section 7.E______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Part 1Part 2Part 3As you might remember, I ended my last post with a delightfully heroic announcement. I was going to save Tiff, defy the road, and risk my very life to do so. As befits the commencement of any noble quest, I started my journey in the same way as any fearless hero.I tried to get somebody else to do the work for me.“Randall―” I began.“I get the impression you're about to say something I won't like.”“―we need to rescue the stranded truckers.”“Thought so.”“There has to be something we can do to get them out. Tiff doesn’t even have a vehicle anymore. She says her old one broke down, but maybe we can haul her a car.”“We’re not in the business of handing free cars to non-employees.”“I’ll buy it,” I said.“Maybe she can share with Al.” Theotherdriver stuck on Route 333. The one still driving.“This isn't funny.”“Of course, it isn't funny!” Randall slammed his hands on the desk and shot to his feet. “I find nothing humorous in you messing with things you have no idea about.”“Maybe if you answered more of my questions, Iwouldhave more of an idea! You don’t get to hand us an obscure employee handbook then expect us to be good little soldier boys who follow your every order without ever giving us any explanations at all.\"“Yes, actually. I do get to expect that. That’s what the extremely generous salary is for.”“Oh shove off. Money doesn’t let you treat us like crap.”“Oh?”I think it was his smirk that did it. Randall was fuming as much as me, but he still managed a satisfied smile as if to say,You’re stuck. You know it. You won’t leave.And he was right. Nowhere else paid this well, not for a college grad. I’d moved my whole life to California. I absolutely couldn’t go back now…But that smirk.“Find a new driver.” I stormed out of the office.For any of you who’ve fantasized about doing the exact same thing at your current job, I can assure you it feels every bit as good as you imagined and more. I kept expecting the horror of what I’d done to hit, but it didn’t. Instead, I seethed on my drive home. I seethed as I heated up dinner in the microwave, and I seethed as I went to bed.It had been so long since I’d cared about anything, that I forgot how strong it could feel.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I woke up at one AM to a screaming cell phone.Those of you who’ve read this far have probably noticed my attempts at sleep often get interrupted―faceless men watching me, exes licking my face, the likes. If you’re bored of this repeated occurrence, I’d just like to add my signature to that ballot. At what age did eight hours of healthy sleep become such a wildly unrealistic request?I was so groggy I didn’t even bother to check the caller ID before picking up. Big mistake.“We need you to come in,” Randall said. “Now.”“It’s the middle of the night.”“This is an emergency.”I cussed him out. “If you’ll remember, I quit less than ten hours ago.”“You're not still going on about that are you? You didn't quit. You just stormed out. Look, I apologize for whatever it is that made you so ticked earlier, alright? We good? Now, stop throwing a fit and get yourself to the terminal.”“I'm not coming in.”I hung up on him mid-sentence.If I weren’t so tired that probably would have felt almost as phenomenal as walking out. At least until the point that Randall called again.I declined. He called again. I declined. He called―I kid you not―twelve more times.Twelve.Probably, I should have blocked him at that point, but I still wasn’t thinking straight. The thirteenth time, I finally picked back up.“Stop!”“Please.” Randall’s tone was different now. He’d lost his usual superior edge. There was only desperation. “Brendon, this isn’t a game. Come in tonight, right now, and I'll include a ten thousand dollar bonus on your next paycheck.”My finger hovered above the hang-up button. “Not a bonus,” I said. “A yearly raise.”“That's not how promotions work here.”“It wouldn't be a promotion. You would be rehiring me. I already quit remember?”Randall cussed me out. It felt good to hear him so undeniably lose his cool. “Fine! You win. You’ll get your rehiring bonus. Just come in.” His tone lowered. “Okay, but we're not really redoing the paperwork for you to be fired and rehired. That's just excessive.\"“It is.”Did I feel like a sell-out? A little. But at least Randall was pissed. My grand defiance for authority had lasted barely eight hours, and I now knew my ego was worth a scant ten grand―more than I’d thought actually.Student loans really are no joke.As soon as I reached the truck yard, Randall handed me a cup of coffee and a set of keys.“The trailer’s already hooked up. You don’t even need to take it far tonight, just get it onto Route 333, and then you can sleep for a few hours if you want.”“Where am I going?”Randall exhaled. He handed me a map, something he’d never done before (I hadn't even known maps of Route 333 existed), and showed me where I was headed.“But that’s at least five days from here. That’s a ten day haul. I only brought one set of clothes.”“I threw some of mine in the cab.” When I tried to interrupt, he held up his hand. “Andyes,it’s one with AC.”There was that at least.“What’s in the trailer?” I asked.He didn’t even respond, just raised an eyebrow, back to his usual condescending self. That was fair I supposed. Ihadagreed to take the job again, and I knew the rules. No peeking.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Obviously, I’d asked the other drivers about what we were hauling. They were more than happy to offer up knowledge like best pullouts for a quick nap, what diners fried the best bacon, and how to avoid running into the things with zippers on their stomachs. Any time I tried asking about our cargo though?The mood changed. Their faces darkened. They sobered.“Sometimes not knowing a secret can drive you mad,” Deidree confided in me once, “but sometimes it's knowing the secret that does it. In this job, you have to figure out which it is.”I didn’t trust that management always had our best interests in mind, but I did trust the other drivers. I gave up asking what we were hauling. I let myself stop wondering. If I could live with not knowing that probably meant it was the latter of Deidree’s options: finding out would be the worse alternative.That night though, driving through massive redwoods beneath a starry sky, I wasn’t sure. The not knowing. Thewondering. It was going to kill me.I was so distracted, it took me almost by surprise when my rig sputtered, slowed then stopped. By now, I knew to expect this interruption. It happened every trip down Route 333. The exact location would vary, but it always happened in the redwood section.Per usual, I clicked start on the stopwatch I’d begun carrying. Somewhere around a minute fifty-five, I stopped it. There was no point in keeping track of the time anymore.I already knew I’d been stalled for too long.Control your breath. Don’t panic. Close your eyes. Hide.This hadn't happened since my interview, but I’d always known this was a possibility. The other drivers talked about multiple minute time outs happening to them, and none of them had ever gotten hurt. All I had to do was crouch in between my seat and the sleeper bed, shut my eyes, and ignore the very real fact that these things had my scent.The footsteps began. They scurried around my rig. Occasionally, things would tap or knock on the metal. Something yanked at the door handles. They stayed shut. At one point the entire truck shuddered as if a dozen bodies were slamming themselves against one side in an attempt to tip it. The truck stayed put.It would get worse I knew. That’s what had happened the first time. The footsteps had increased steadily, until I could hear nothing else, and then the engine had started― except the footsteps didn’t get worse. Instead, the scurrying calmed down.The forest dwellers were still out there. I could hear the pitter of feet, but it was calmer, less frantic. Was this some sort of a trick? Did they think I couldn’t hear them and would open my eyes?A moment later I knew that theory was wrong. They weren’t trying to hide. They were trying to quiet down enough to speak with me.“Give it to us.”The voice wasn’t a voice exactly. It was the rustle of leaves, the snap of branches underfoot, and the tinkle of windchimes, all somehow combined in a way that formed words.I held my breath.“We smell you, He Who Dwells on Stone. Your odor has presented itself here once before, in our domain. We demand an audience.”I kept still. Was there anything in the employee handbook about actually speaking with them? I didn’t think so, but maybe I’d missed it.Maybe you should really read the whole thing, Brendon.The strange not-voice seemed to sigh. “Speak with us, or we slash your tires.”A pretty convincing argument in my opinion. “What do you want?” I asked.“The thing you carry in your moving device. Relinquish possession of it to us.”“Interesting proposition. Unfortunately, the cargo isn’t really mine to begin with, so I’m not really in a position to hand anything over. I’m sure you understand.”“Relinquish it, and we will allow you open passage through our lands for the rest of your travels. Do not, and we will tear apart your machine.”Alsoa pretty convincing argument.“What is it?” I asked.“That is not an answer one life force may give another.”“K, so like you don’t know.”“Of course we know,” the thing said defensively.“Really? Because it sounds like you’re bluffing right now.”“We know!”The thing calmed itself down. “Relinquish your load and we will allow passage to all of your kind for the next generation.”I remembered the man skewered on the hood of his truck. These things weren’t bluffing. They could kill us andeasilytoo. How many people would I save over a generation if I agreed?And yet…I didn’t know what was in my cargo, but I did know these things killed humans for merely looking at them. If they wanted my haul, it couldn’t be for anything good.So I did the only thing I could think to do. I stalled.“How about a clue?” I asked. “Surely, you can give me a clue of what I’m hauling.”It couldn’t, it informed me. So I pushed. The thing got more and more frustrated. I got more and more anxious. The footsteps grew restless again. They began circling my truck, looking for a way in. One of them―I got the impression it was the one speaking to me― scratched at the door. It slammed against the window. The sound of cracking glass.“You are merely attempting to waste our time,” the forest thing accused.“That is the plan. Yes.”It slammed the glass again. More cracking.Bad. Real bad.I could practically sense the creature drawing back, preparing for a third and final strike, about to break in―The engine roared to life. I whooped and scrambled for the front. Just before I uncovered my eyes though, I realized the footsteps were still there, circling my truck.They hadn't left.I didn’t consider. I didn’t allow myself time to think up a secondary plan. I just leapt into my seat, threw the car in drive, and slammed my foot on the gas―all without looking.The truck lurched forward. I forced my eyes to stay closed fortwo, four, sixseconds, before letting them spring open. A turn was coming up. I jerked the wheel to the left but not in time to avoid the low hanging branches that battered against my front windshield. I retook control, never slowing once, and never glancing in the rearview.I'd escaped.It was only a couple hours later, when I was well into the desert and far enough to feel comfortable, that I finally pulled to the side of the road to survey the damage. The driver window had splinters running through it. There were dents along the skirt of the freight carrier, but it was otherwise intact.I circled to the back to make sure everything was still locked and secure. It was.Everything’s fine. Get some sleep. You’re fine.And then, as often happens just after the movie protagonist says, “It’s all good, guys,” I was immediately disabused of my delusions of safety.Something was crying.I pressed my ear to the metal of the freight. Sure enough, inside the container, faint but audible, was a little girl’s sobs.“Hello?” I asked. “Do you need help?”The crying cut off. I waited another ten minutes with my ears pressed to the container, but the crying never started again. The thing stayed silent.It would have been easy. For the sake of my sanity, I could have chalked it up to imagination. I was sleep deprived and in shock, and of course I’d heard crying. It was my own inner child acting out from revulsion at this entire stressful situation. That’s what it was.But it wasn’t.I’d learned something, thoughwhatI now knew, I wasn’t totally sure. Was the thing in the cargo bay a person? A creature? A child?Sometimes not knowing a secret can drive you mad. Sometimes knowing the secretis worse.Keep reading.",

      "content_preview": "I used to think I was just in a bad relationship. Toxic, controlling, the kind people warn you about. But now… I’m not even sure I was in a relationship at all. I don’t know what to call it anymore.She was my girlfriend for almost two years. At first she was everything I wasn’t. Loud, funny, fearless. I’m quiet. Careful. The kind of guy who double checks the door lock twice before bed. She pulled me out of my shell. Made me feel seen. I fell hard.The control started small. “Text me when you get there.” “Don’t keep your phone on at night, it’s bad for you.” “Don’t say that word, just trust me.”I laughed it off at first. I thought she was just quirky. Protective. Maybe a little paranoid. Nothing serious.But then things changed.She showed me pictures from a friend’s birthday. I know I was there. I stood by the fridge half the night because it was too crowded in the living room. I remember holding my beer while people laughed around me.But when she scrolled through her phone, picture after picture, I wasn’t in any of them. Not even blurred in the background.I laughed nervously. “Weird. I was right there.”She tilted her head, smiled faintly. “Maybe you just think you were.”I said, “No. I was literally standing next to you.”Her smile didn’t change. “If you say so.”My stomach dropped.A week later I texted her that I’d be home late from work. When I got back she was cold, distant.“You didn’t tell me you’d be late,” she said.“Yes I did,” I pulled out my phone, showed her the message. Sent at 5:12 pm. Two check marks. Read.She opened her phone, pulled up our chat, and held it out. No message. My text wasn’t there.She stared at me. Calm, almost amused. “See? You didn’t send anything. You only think you did.”I wanted to scream, but instead I just stood there, heart racing.She began asking me questions I couldn’t answer.“Are you sure you’re real?” “Why do you always feel like a placeholder?” “Do you remember things that didn’t happen?”Sometimes she whispered it like she was testing me. Sometimes she said it casually, like asking about the weather.At first I thought she was joking. Then I realized she wasn’t.One night I woke up and saw her phone glowing on the table. She was asleep. I shouldn’t have looked. But I did.There were folders. Labeled things like “Tests.” “Shadows.” “Phases.”Inside: photos of me. Sleeping. Cooking. Sitting on the balcony. But the angles were strange. Always just enough to make me look… not solid. Off. Like a background element, not a person.One video had me talking, but there was no sound. Just my mouth moving while faint music played over it.I felt sick. I put her phone back and lay there wide awake until morning.When I asked her about it, she didn’t deny anything. She just said: “You weren’t supposed to see that. You’re disrupting the process.”That word stuck with me. Process.She started talking more about “tests” and “phases.” She told me her job was classified. “They’re watching how I react,” she said once. “Who?” I asked. She just smiled. “If I tell you, you’ll disappear.”She said it so casually, like she was reminding me to take out the trash.I tried leaving once. I packed my bag, shoes half on, socks mismatched. I was halfway out the door when she said softly:“If you walk away, they’ll know you broke character. Is that what you want?”I froze.She looked so calm, sitting there with a blanket around her shoulders, watching me. “You can play along, or you can ruin the experiment. Either way, I’ll be fine. You won’t.”I don’t know why, but I put the bag down.We had dinner with my mom. Afterwards, driving home, she said, “You know you weren’t actually there, right?”I laughed bitterly. “What the hell are you talking about? I ate the damn pasta.”She shook her head, almost sad. “I ate alone with your mother. You weren’t there. You imagine these things.”I pulled the car over, hands gripping the wheel so tight my knuckles turned white. “Stop. Just stop.”She leaned over, whispered in my ear: “If I react wrong, they’ll delete you.”I started writing everything down. Keeping receipts. Taking photos of meals before eating. Counting tiles in the bathroom to see if they stayed the same every day.It sounds insane, I know. But when someone is erasing you piece by piece, you’ll cling to anything solid.I finally snapped. I yelled at her. Told her she was lying, gaslighting me, breaking me down.She just stood there, expressionless, while I screamed. Then she whispered: “You’re not supposed to know.”I grabbed her phone. Code 2222. Easy. I opened the folders again. More photos of me. More videos. More evidence of… nothing.She didn’t fight me for the phone. She just watched. When I finally looked up, she said: “You’ve ruined it now. You’re contaminating the study.”I left that night. Stayed on a friend’s couch. Thought maybe it was over.Two weeks later, I saw her.In the store. Middle of the day. She was standing by the exit, holding a bag. Neutral expression. Not angry, not happy. Just watching.I walked up to her before I could think. “Hey.”“Hi.”“How are you?”“Fine.”It was small talk, but the air around us felt heavy, like my chest was filling with sand.Finally I blurted out, “I’m real. I don’t care what you think. I’m real.”She tilted her head. Eyes steady. Voice quiet. “You’re still here? They haven’t deleted you yet?”My blood went cold.That’s the last time we spoke.Since then I’ve noticed small things. Lights flickering. Messages appearing on my phone, then vanishing before I can read them. Screenshots that come out blank.The other night, I found an envelope slipped under my door. No return address. Inside was a single photo. My kitchen. My phone on the table. The same angle I always sit at.Only… I wasn’t in the picture.On the back, in messy handwriting, it said: “Do not feed.”I don’t know if she planted it. Or if someone else did. I don’t know if this is still about her, or if it ever was.But I can’t stop thinking about what she said that day. “You’re part of a test. You were never real.”",

      "content_preview": "The use of phones or digital communication devices is prohibited.Do not use your phone for calling, texting, navigation, music, or any purpose. In cases of emergency, contact dispatch via your handheld radio.We recommend leaving your phone at home. If you choose to bring your device, power it off before entry onto Route 333. If you forget to power off your device, do NOT do so once en route; this would still qualify as phone-utilization. The offender would still be subject to punishment as the road deems fit.Digital non-communication devices are permitted.-Employee Handbook: Section 2.E________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Part 1Part 2Part 3Part 4“What’s in the trailer?”Through the radio, Randall sighed. In case anybody is unfamiliar with the mechanics of the handheld radio, you have to actually be pushing the transmit button for your voice to go through. Which meant Randall was being a passive aggressive cry-baby who intentionallydecidedfor me to hear his sigh of annoyance.Sometimes, managers are just the worst.I stood just outside my truck where I'd pulled over on the side of the highway to check my vehicle for damage. For those who don't remember from my last post, the things in the forest attacked me to try and get whatever was in the trailer. It was still dark outside.“We literallyjusthad this conversation,” he said. “Like three hours ago.”“That was before I heard something inside the cargo. You tell me what’s in there right now, or I turn around and come back.”“That eager to visit the forest again, huh?”“Hang on,” I said. “How do you know about my encounter?”The other end of the radio fell silent.“You set me up!” I said. “Youknewthey were going to go after me with this thing in the trunk. You were trying to kill me off!”“Don’t be irrational. That’s not what happened. You―”“Don’t lie to me!” I screamed―then immediately realized he couldn’t hear me, because,oh right, these are still radios.One at a time. Pushing my transmit button while he was pushing his was just preventing me from hearing him. Which made me even more angry andhow dare the radio betray me too!Which only proved thatyes.I indeedwasbeing irrational, even if it was justified.I calmed and lifted my finger.“―safe as long as you followed the rules,” he continued, oblivious to my outburst. “You did follow the rules, right? What am I saying, you’re alive, so of course you did. Look, road dwellers just get more excited when there’s live cargo. That’s all. As long as you’re cautious the rest of the trip, you’ll be fine.”“But you knew I could die.”“We would never put you in real danger. I’m not worried for your safety, Brendon. You shouldn’t be either.”I wasn’t,I realized. Sure, in the moment I felt fear just like anybody else, but afterwards, in the calm, I was never worried for my safety. It didn’t matter what happened to me. My fury was less about the prospect of dying and more about the injustice of being set up.“Something’s crying in it,” I said. “It sounds like a little girl.”“Well, it isn’t.”“Then tell me what it is.”“Stop asking. You know that isn’t something I'll do. You haven't slept yet Brendon. I haven’t either. Go put your head on a pillow, and let’s talk when we’re both more calm, yeah?”I told him exactly where he could stick his head.“You aren’t as valuable as you think,” he growled at me. “If you continue in such an unprofessional manner, we really will find a replacement.”I suspected I was exactly as valuable as I thought I was. Who else would take this job? Who else could drive the highway as fast as me?Andunprofessional?That was rich coming from the guy who’d demanded I come in at one in the morning and shrugged off the suggestion that we help save the lives of his former employees. I was gearing up to explain all of this (you can bet in less-than-professional words) when a wave of fatigue hit me.I really hadn't gotten any sleep. The sun would be up in a few hours, and my body was experiencing the adrenaline-exhausted version of a hangover.“Fine,” I told Randall. “We argue when I wake.”“You’ll feel better.”________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________He was right. After sleeping, I did feel better. And while that should have only annoyed me further, it was difficult to feel so since I now felt infuriatingly great.So great, in fact, I didn’t radio Randall back. As much as I loathed him that morning, neither he nor anyone else at dispatch was ever going to answer my questions. That much was obvious even before he’d straight up admitted it. It was also obvious I wasn’t really going to go back until I’d unloaded my current haul, so what was the point?Instead, I headed inside the truck stop to grab a cup of the only decent coffee on Route 333.“You’re alright then,” Tiff told me in the mini-diner.“Why wouldn’t I be?”“The Faceless Man was prodding your rig for hours last night. I had a broom ready in case he tried to break anything. I’ve never seen him stay in one place like that.”A chill crept through me. “I never saw him.”“He wasn’t at the windows. He was at the back of the freight. Looked like he was trying to get inside.”They get more excited when there’s live cargo.That’s what Randall had said.I sipped at my coffee.“Hey Tiff…” I started. How could I phrase this? “Have you ever figured out―have you ever wondered, um, what’s up with the other people on the road? The non-truckers, like the ones who work here? Like if they’re real or not?”“Um. Like.I forget your generation uses so many filler words.” She considered my question. “There’s different types of real, I suppose. We’re one type. They’re another.”A statement which, while sounding wise and sage, didn’t actually help me understand anything. Ah well.Tiff packed me food for a few days, and I headed outside. Back at my rig, I slipped a pancake under the slit in the trailer door. Something snatched it from the inside.“Can you hear me?” I whispered.No response.“Do you need help?”Nothing except the near-imperceptible shudder of the back door. Almost as if something on the other side was pressing a hand to it. Waiting to see what I’d decide.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________It was after about six hours of driving that I realized with dawning, crippling horror of my irreversible mistake.I’d forgotten a battery pack.Let me explain. As you all probably remember, it’s prohibited to use phones on Route 333, even if you’re not calling with them. Why exactly? Dunno. But it is, and I wasn’t about to break any rules unnecessarily. Instead, I’d gotten in the habit of downloading content onto my old iPod Nano, which apparently qualified as a different category (I checked with management. It’s fine as long as I leave it in airplane mode). I also brought a battery pack to recharge the iPod with, since the outlets in the trucks didn’t always work.Such as my current truck.Which meant―you guessed it―I was now stuck on a ten day drive without any podcasts, books, or self-chosen music. And while I did understand on a deeply personal level that there were indeed worse tragedies than ‘lack of entertainment,’ this did still qualify as a tragedy.I’d stayed away from the radio before that point. A few of the stations were in fact dangerous―they’d put you in a trance or whisper secrets you wished you could unhear―but overall they were safe. The other truckers didn’t seem to fear them too much. Logically, I knew the radio was overall safe, but I’d still never been desperate enough to take the risk.Until my iPod died, that is.I flipped past a few country stations. Not my thing. Soon, though, I discovered something odd: a K-pop channel.It had probably been a few years since I’d actually listened to a car radio, but I couldn’t ever remember Korean music playing on it. Especially not out in the middle of nowhere like this. And the song that was playing―I didn’t recognize it.I know K-pop. Stereotype me however you wish, but yes, I’m one of those white guys that watches anime, and watches K-dramas, and listens to Korean boy bands. K-pop Demon Hunter? Pretty good. This song though? Not a clue.I listened for a while more. The channel was 96.2. That wasn’t one of the stations I’d been warned against, was it? None of the music that came on was stuff I’d heard. They sounded like the groups I listened to but songs I was positive didn’t exist. Eventually, some of them started repeating, not in a loop like a playlist, just in the way popular songs replay every hour on the radio.And you know what? I started getting into it.Besides the pay, the perks of Route 333 had been few and far between, but this was one I could get used to. An entire playlist of music I loved that didn’t exist in the real world? Sign me up. Maybe next time I’d bring a tape recorder and post this stuff online. I even started singing along. Time flew by.I didn’t notice the flashing blue and white lights until the sirens came on.“Um Randall...”Nobody responded.The police car pulled in behind me. The lights flicked off.“Randall,” I tried again.“Sorry!” came a voice from the handheld radio. A woman.Gloria, I believed? I didn’t interact with her as much. “I was out of the room. Randall’s not actually―oh, he left a note. It says ‘Tell Brendon I’m off shift. If he wants to continue arguing, tell him one of the following responses’.” She pauses. “The rest is quite rude to be honest.”“I’m not trying to argue,” I said. “I just got pulled over.”“Do you have a flat?”“No. As in a cop pulled me over.”There was silence. The silence of a doctor deciding how to word that ‘it’s terminal. There’s nothing I can do.’ “How bad were you speeding?” Gloria asked. “That can make a big difference.”“Not at all. I was on cruise. I’ve read that section in the employee handbook.”“Wait, you haven’t read all the employee handbook yet?”Um.“Look, the important thing is he pulled me over. What do I do?”A car door slammed. The highway patrol officer approached.“The reason makes a difference,” Gloria pushed.“Yeah, I get that, but I don’t know.” I paused. “My cargo. That’s got to be why. I’m the one on the long haul trip with the special cargo.”A longer silence. “Let me call Randall.”The radio went dead. A knock sounded on my door. My heartbeat pittered in my chest. The employee handbook was pretty clear about this particular subject: don’t get pulled over. Don’t speed or do anything that might draw the highway patrol, because there wasn’t much you could do once you had.I didn’t do anything,I assured myself.This isn’t my fault. Not really.Then again, it wasn’t really Tiff’s fault she’d gotten lane-locked.“Sir,” a husky voice said from outside.I held my breath, and popped the door.He had a tag and a uniform. He rested a hand on his hip. The mustached man was just like every other officer that had ever pulled me over, save one singular difference: his head was bent entirely back.It was as if somebody with impossible strength had grabbed his hair and yanked backwards and down. The neck was snapped and contorted. An empty tube jutted up from a break in the twisted skin, his throat. His entire face was upside down and he stood backwards to face me.“Um, hi,” I said.“Do you mind telling me what’s in your trailer?”“Funny story. Not actually sure.”“Please remove yourself from the vehicle and open the back of the truck.”“Sorry, why did you pull me over?”The officer sighed as if to saykids these days.A puff of red mist spurted from his severed throat blowhole. “Sir, you are speaking to an officer of the law. Iwillbe investigating your vehicle. You will extricate yourself this instant or face the full wrath of the law.” It was like a child pretending at the lines a real police might say.That thought calmed me. Play-acting.Fine. Two could dance to this tune.“Your warrant?” I asked. “As an officer of the law, you’re clearly well aware you need one to search private property.”“Yes. That… that’s correct. I do know that. I’ll retrieve mine now.”He walked backwards towards his stalling car― by which I mean he walked forwards, with his upside down eyes blinking at me.“Hello!” I called into my handheld. “Could really use some advice right now?”Nothing.“If not, I’m planning to try and outrun him.”“Brendon, do not try to out-drive highway patrol. I repeat, do NOT attempt a chase. You will lose.” Gloria’s voice came through strong and clear.Finally.Before I could respond, she continued. “I spoke to Randall. He said―none of us love the idea―but he said if you really weren’t speeding, there is one thing you could try?”“Yeah?” I said.She sounded almost embarrassed as she explained. Randall had suggested a last ditch attempt at escape, something that had only worked a few times before: annoying the officer until he left. If I really had done nothing to get pulled over, the officer might give up if he got frustrated enough. As long as he had no legal grounds to detain me or worse―ticketme.I didn’t bother asking what ticketing actually meant.“Okay, and how am I supposed toannoythe officer?” In my side window, I could see the cop ruffling around in the passenger of his cruiser.“Randall says―again we don’t like this, but it’s worked once before―you can try videotaping him with your phone. Cops hate that.”The fear pulsing through me abated. The pounding distress settled. A cold understanding took over. “Hey Gloria,” I said. “Put Randall through to me.”I imagined a disagreement. A small debate. Eventually, though, his voice came through muffled and tinny. She must be holding her phone to the handheld. “Brendon?” he said.“Answer honestly this time. Did you know this haul might kill me?”“I did.”“Is there a chance I survive if I use my phone?”“As soon as the cop is gone, drive like there’s no tomorrow.”“That wasn’t my question,” I said. “I asked if there’s a chance I survive.”“There is.”“And if I refuse this plan?” I asked.“Don’t.” His voice was barely audible. “I’m sorry. I really am sorry we put you in this position, but you cannot let highway patrol get ahold of your cargo. None of the sentient road-dwellers can. That isn’t an option. Too much is at stake. This is bigger than you.”I nodded. “If I risk breaking this rule, I have one condition. It isn't negotiable. It’s a yes or no. I will only do this if you agree, got that? It's that when I get back, you will explain to me what Route 333 is. You will tell me what I’m hauling and why it’s so important.” I took a breath without letting go of the transmit button. “No arguing. Yes or no?”A pause.“Yes.”There was a knock on the door. The officer was back. I set the radio down, then carefully, resigned, pulled my phone from the passenger cubby and powered it on.I could explain in detail what happened next. It would be the natural thing to do, to describe how I recorded our conversation like a pestilential YouTuber until the bent-necked officer exploded and stormed away―I won’t do that.To me the whole thing was a dream. It worked. Of course it did. Randallknewit would more than he could let on, but none of that mattered. I may have survived highway patrol....But I wouldn’t survive this next part.I watched as the black and white cruiser pulled in front of me and screamed down the highway. Smaller, smaller,gone.How does the officer see out his windshield?,I wondered distantly. I set my phone in the drink holder without bothering to power it off. What I did no longer mattered.I waited.Waited.WaitedA line of clouds appeared over the horizon line, dark and hostile. They rolled in at an unnatural speed. Outside my windows, the wind picked up. Dust devils rose up across the desert.My end was here.Randall never would have agreed to my one condition if he thought I’d survive.  I knew almost nothing about him, but I knew that much. That was the only reason I’d made our deal: to see his response. Never, for any reason, would he or the rest of management tell me the truth about the road.He needed me to avoid highway patrol. He couldn’t allow any of the living things on Route 333 to get to my cargo, but whatever was coming for me now was in some sort of a different category. It wasn’t alive. Itwasdeadly though. Enough he knew he wouldn't have to uphold his end of our bargain.I inhaled.I exhaled.Clouds rushed in above me, and thick drops of rust-colored liquid slid down my windshield. Blood. The end.Even now, Iwasn’t nervous.Keep reading",

      "content_preview": "I’ve always believed certain places absorb energy. Not just haunted castles or graveyards, but places where a lot of people pass through—airports, train stations… hotels. Especially hotel rooms.See, I used to work night security at one of the poshest hotels in Dublin City. Five stars, marble floors, high-end clientele. That kind of place. You’d think nothing dark could touch it. But let me tell you, money doesn't stop the weird shit from creeping in.It started around 2:17 AM. I remember because I was mid-yawn, flipping through the camera feeds, when the front desk patched a call through to security.A man’s voice. Panicked. Breathless.“My wife’s in the bath. I think she’s not breathing.”I snapped upright. Me and this other guard, Mark, rushed to Room 237 on the 8th floor. The hallway was dead quiet. The kind of quiet that feels wrong, like the building itself is holding its breath.We pushed in. The guy was pacing around, soaked from the waist down. The bathroom door was wide open. I’ll never unsee that moment.She was in the tub, completely still. Water up to her shoulders. Eyes open, but not seeing.We dragged her out. Tried CPR. I was counting compressions under my breath while Mark gave breaths. Her skin was cold. Like—not just chilly—cold, like touching stone. I knew it was too late, but we had to try.Police arrived within minutes. The moment they stepped in, they told us to stop. One of the officers pulled me aside and said quietly, “She’s been gone a while. A couple hours, at least.”The husband told them they’d argued earlier. He stormed out, came back, saw her in the bath, assumed she was just soaking, and went to bed. Said he only got suspicious when she didn’t join him.No obvious signs of violence. No water overflow. No witnesses. They couldn’t charge him. But between us—staff, cops, even the paramedics—we all felt it. That gut pull. Thatsomething’s offfeeling.He checked out the next morning. Quiet. Calm. Not a single tear.Room 237 was locked off for three weeks.Housekeeping deep-cleaned every inch. Management said, “Accidents happen. Life moves on.” They reopened the room like nothing happened. No priest. No sage. Nothing. Just fresh linens and a new bar of soap.The first person to stay in that room after the death was this woman named Liz. She was a regular—corporate client, stayed at least once a month. She always asked for a high-floor room. She got 237 without knowing a damn thing.Next morning, 6:50 AM, she’s at the front desk with her suitcase and this look like she’d seen hell.I was walking past when she said, loud enough for guests to hear, “That room is haunted. I didn’t sleep a second. Something’swrongwith it.”She said she kept hearing dripping water all night. Not just from the bathroom—like it was coming from thewalls. At 3 AM, the taps in the bathtub turned on by themselves. Full blast. She walked in and turned them off, soaked her slippers. Then, five minutes later, the shower started. She swore she hadn’t touched anything.She said she kept smelling something… floral. Like old roses, but rotten. Like death wearing perfume.We offered her another room. She refused. Said she was checking out for good. Never came back.After that, Room 237 got a reputation—internally.Guests kept requesting room changes after one night. Some didn’t even last that long.There was this German businessman who called at 1:03 AM, whispering like he didn’t want someone to hear: “I think someone is in my bathroom.”I asked if he saw anything.“No,” he said, “but someone is coughing. A wet cough.”I went up. Bathroom was empty. But the floor was damp. Towels crumpled in the corner. The toilet had been used—seat up, water moving like it had just flushed. The guy hadn’t gone in all night. He checked out the next morning without breakfast.A honeymoon couple stayed there once. The woman came down at 4:12 AM in her pajamas, crying. She said she saw a pale woman standing at the foot of the bed. Dripping wet. Not moving. Just… staring.Her husband didn’t see anything, but he confirmed the room temperature droppedten degreesin minutes.I checked the thermostat. It was set to 23°C. The room was at 14.No windows were open.I started dreading that room.Even walking past it gave me this tightness in my chest. Like I was being watched. I’d make rounds and literally speed-walk past it.Once, I was reviewing CCTV around 2:20 AM—same time the original call had come in—and I saw something weird. The hallway camera outside 237 glitched. Just for a second.But when I paused the footage and zoomed in… there was a shadow. Not a person. A shape. Just outside the door. Like someone was standing there, pressed against it.I replayed it a hundred times. Mark saw it too. “It’s probably compression error,” he said.But his voice shook when he said it.Management refused to shut the room.They said we’d get sued if we told guests. “Unless you see something tangible, it's superstition.” So we kept assigning the room. But we started calling itThe Bathtub Roombehind closed doors.The cleaners hated it. They’d go in pairs. Even when nothing moved, the mirror always fogged up on its own. Once, one of the maids, Rosa, swore she saw the words“Don’t leave me”written in the steam. But when she called her coworker over, it vanished.Guests who stayed more than one night? Always complained of water sounds. Dripping. Running. Gurgling. Sometimes crying. One guy swore his sheets were damp every morning. Like someone had gotten in the bed wet.Then came the worst night. 3:08 AM. We get a call from Room 237. The guest was an old man, solo traveler. Very logical, very composed. He said, “Someone knocked on my bathroom door from the inside. Not once.Three times.”I sprinted up. When I opened the door, the room was empty.But the lights in the bathroom were flickering. Not just flickering—buzzing. And the bathtub faucet was trickling. Just enough to hear.That’s when I noticed it.There was water. Not just in the tub. It was on the floor. In a straight line. Like footprints. Leading from the bath… to the bed.But no one had walked. No one had opened the door.I put in my resignation a week later.Mark lasted a month more. He said he heard a woman humming in the elevator when he was alone. Hummed the same tune for three floors. When the doors opened, no one was there.Room 237 is still open, as far as I know.They just keep painting over the mold and turning the mattress.But something lives there now. Or maybe something never left.Not every hotel room starts off haunted.Some of thembecomehaunted.And I was there when it happened.",

      "content_preview": "That night provided no distinction between itself and a hundred others, and yet, to this very hour, it is the one that bewilders me the most. My earliest recollection of this night, already stained by the visions we call nightmares, and it had since occurred to me that these very visions were the root of what others, with a kind of pity, call my fascination of horror. They insist, of course, that the indulgence in the dreadful, had given rise to the dreams, but the truth, I think, is quite the reverse; as long before I had encountered a tale of horror, my nights were filled with them, vivid and entire, such that I touched, felt and suffered through them, as though they were the very texture of reality. What later passed for horror in plays and books was, to me, the language to articulate which I had already known.The dreams, in their ceaseless recurrence, held less the quality of terror, but more so of desolation, for although fear was its shadow, it seemed loneliness - untamed, oppressing, intense - was its true substance. That particular vision, as I recall, arrived with the same melancholy in which the night itself had shrouded me in, and it was under that veil that I first became aware, of a voice. It was a man’s voice, deliberate, articulate, he seemed to say less than he knew, and as he threaded through my mind, my vision fractured into two planes of perspective, the dim, humid air of the dream, and flickering against it, a vision, like from a scene from an uncanny chronicle. There was a mother - a solitary mother - and a child, a little girl radiant with all the charm of innocence. The voice endowed their figures with a tenderness so complete that I might have mistaken it for love itself: the child, obedient, mirthful, inquisitive, and the mother, exalted in that devotion that which the little one had become, beyond dispute, the absolute center of her world.The dream drew on, the voice continued, with brevity, calculation and a darkness such that I dared not name; and with it, my unease grew - cold, precise, insistent. I recall the little girl, her cheer, her inquisitions, the charm that drew me in despite myself. Her mother, all pride and delight in the radiant company of her child, their tender exchanges unfolding as though staged for me alone.Yet beneath it all, a tension grew - thick, dreadful, unspoken. I remember the moment the child’s light faltered, her sweetness slipping away as suddenly as a candle snuffed. That charm that had secured my affection was gone, and with it, a silence fell. The mother, steadfast, and loving, showed no notice to the change. The voice observed this, too, with cold insistence.And then, most dreadfully, I saw her - the mother herself. What had once been beauty, poise, the unmistakable grace of a woman well-kept, collapsed before me into something hollow, unwell. She had become, in an instant, the shell of her former self. Something was wrong - terribly wrong - and my disquiet thickened into a terror I could neither name nor escape.The mother’s mind was, by then, most certainly gone. I saw it in the restless way she moved about her child, in her speech and gestures that carried no sense, only fragments. Yet what I beheld was never wholly clear to me - never certain. It was like watching a puzzle with pieces missing, though the pieces lay scattered before my very eyes, hidden only by some refusal of sight.“She believed her daughter looked like this.” The little girl appeared again - familiar, radiant, almost celestial, like one of Raphael’s own angels. “But she really looked like this.” And with those words, the glow collapsed into shadow, into a depth without end - darkness, abyssal, and all-consuming.I awoke in a dark room. The love of my life lay peacefully beside me, her breathing steady, untroubled. Yet the air around me was not my own. I felt a presence in that darkness, as though I had risen into company I had never invited.My eyes fought their way back to focus, dragging open at a snail’s pace. The blackness thickened into a fog, swallowing the corners, softening the shapes, leaving me helpless to search it fully. My body, too, betrayed me. Still as stone, it would not obey the simplest command. I lay there, bound to the bed, listening to her quiet sleep while something else - unseen, unspoken - lingered close in the dark.I recall at the border of my vision, the black veil of darkness slowly was undone, and hidden beneath laid a small figure, stiff like a mannequin. The black fog dissipated more and more, and revealed more of my unwelcomed guest - even as I recount the events, I can’t help but feel unsteady, for what she really looked like was truly horrid. I remember her skin which rippled and moved, as tho alive, her eyes vacant, but even so, felt horribly watchful and perceptive.The events of that night had gone on for longer than one night, and my interaction with this unwelcome guest, stirred something truly more haunting than any of the so-called ‘horrors’, it had stirred an unhealthy connection to a girl that had known nothing but love and devotion in life, and now sought it in even after. I was staring out my window, beyond the trees and the night’s darkness that shrouded them, I saw her once more, and with vacant eyes she had seen me as well.",

      "content_preview": "There’s a reason we’re scared of the dark.That familiar discomfort when you’re driving alone at night—even if you don’t see anyone on the road around you. It’s instinct. A warning built into your bones. Because there are things out there. Beings we can’t explain. They don’t show up on camera. They don’t care about your pepper spray. But they follow rules. Ancient ones. Rituals, maybe. I don’t know where they come from or who made them, but I’ve learned this much: if you follow the rules, they’ll leave you alone.I just never thought I’d experience something like that behind the wheel of a damn cab.People think being an rideshare driver is simple. And they’re right...for the most part. You drive. You talk if they want to talk. You drop them off. You get paid. No real boss breathing down your neck, no office politics, no deadlines. Just the road, your car, and a playlist long enough to keep you entertained between rides.That’s why I started doing it in the first place. After I left my old job, I didn’t want to deal with people anymore. Not really. I’d been a mechanic for twenty years, ran my own shop until my knees gave out and my business went to shit. The rideshare apps came at the right time. I didn’t have to smile if I didn’t want to. I didn’t have to fix anybody’s problems. Just get them where they were going.During the day, it’s easy. College kids heading to class, nurses pulling doubles, grocery store runs for people without cars. Honest, quiet work. Sometimes I’d even enjoy the small talk. I liked hearing about their lives. Felt like I was doing something good, even if it was just five stars and a quiet \"thanks.\"But at night... things change.The air gets heavy. The people get strange.I remember when I first heard about the rules of the road after sundown.Not guidelines. Not suggestions.Rules.They show up on the app the second the sun begins to set.And if you break one—well. Let’s just say you don’t want to find out what happens.I’m sure this is very confusing to hear for the first time. So let me explain.Every night shift starts the same.Right after sunset, the app buzzes and emits a strange sound. Not a standard chirp a notification makes. Something dull and stringy, like a warning siren before a storm—on a much smaller scale of course. The screen goes black just before a message appears in blocky text:NIGHT SHIFT PROTOCOL – ACTIVE BETWEEN SUNSET AND SUNRISE.1. Do not look at passengers directly. Use the rearview mirror if you must.2. Do not accept payment greater than the cab fare. Never take gifts.3. Only process one ride at a time. Never allow multiple passengers in your car.4. Make sure your final passenger is dropped off before sunrise.I review them every time, even though I’ve got them memorized. I don’t know if the app updates them or if something darker is watching to make sure I read them. Either way, I never skip that screen. At least, I don’t anymore. I made the mistake of ignoring the rules once—and that was one time too many.I never really was a superstitious man. Back when I started doing nights, I laughed. Rules like these felt like a joke—some edgy tech campaign or something. The kind of stuff that gets passed around on Halloween to show they’re being hip and festive.But the thing is… these rules. They're the real deal. The consequences are even more real.I learned that the hard way.It started with something small—just a guy who insisted on paying double. He said he appreciated my service. Said I looked tired and he wanted to “bless” me. He pulled out a crisp hundred and set it gently on the center console.I told him no.He insisted.I told him again.He smiled and slipped it into the cupholder. \"It's yours either way, man.\"I didn’t touch it. Just left it there until he was gone. I mean, what’s the harm? The guy looked unremarkable after all. A middle aged gentleman with slicked back salt-and-pepper hair. Reading glasses. T-shirt and a vest. Gave me easy-going surfer vibes.Then I looked up in the mirror.He was still there.I heard him leave—heard the door shut behind him and saw him disappear into the dark.But he was there.Grinning.His eyes were all black.He mouthed something, but the words didn’t match the movement. Like a broken puppet trying to whisper a prayer.I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I reached back, heart pounding. The seat was empty. He was nowhere to be found.Except for the mirror. He stayed there for the rest of the drive.Just smiling. Chatting away.I parked my cab in the farthest corner of my apartment’s lot, locked the doors, and went inside. That hundred-dollar bill stayed exactly where it was—untouched, humming with some quiet, invisible pressure. I could feel its presence everywhere I went. Something was trying to make me go back for it. Spend it maybe? I wasn’t sure, but I needed help to make it go away.I contacted support through the app. There’s no help line, no human name. Just a form with one question:Describe your incident.I typed everything. The passenger, the tip, the mirror. I waited. I felt so silly.Twenty-four hours later, I got a reply.Protocol breach acknowledged.Remedial steps required before shift may resume:– Burn the foreign currency.– Avoid seafood for two full days.Thanks for contacting Technical Support!That was it.No apology. No explanation. Just instructions.I picked up the hundred dollar bill like it was a loaded firearm and was surprised by the weight of it. I went out to the alley behind my complex and set it on fire in a soup can. The flames hissed green for a moment, then evaporated. It didn’t smell like money burning—it smelled like salt and old fish.I skipped sushi that week. Thankfully I am not much of a fish guy. By the third night, the app let me log in again. And like nothing ever happened, the rides returned.It has been pretty smooth sailing ever since. Not every shift is terrifying. Some are just... weird.Like the woman in the bright yellow dress who got in without saying a word and only whispered her destination.“The Bog.”Or the man who didn’t blink, stared straight ahead, and screamed every time we passed a fire hydrant.The weirdest ride I ever gave was from last November.It was around 3:12 a.m., that dead stretch of time where the world feels empty. I was parked near the outskirts of town, engine idling, watching a moth dive repeatedly into the windshield. A ping came through. There was no address, just coordinates. I almost declined—nobody lives way out there. It’s all farmland and old sheds. But I was behind on rent. And I was pretty good at following the rules at this point.The profile picture was blank. Name just said “M.”Fine. I accepted.As I approached the pickup spot, my headlights hit something standing in the middle of the road.A man.No. Afigure. Very still. Dressed in old-fashioned clothes. Black hat, long coat, hands folded in front of him like he was at a funeral. I stopped.He didn’t move.I glanced at the app. The pin was directly on him.Against my better judgment, I rolled down the window a few inches.“Hey uh…you M?”The figure nodded once.I unlocked the doors and pulled up the rules panel on the app in my phone.Same rules as always. No change.I read over the first one for good measure:Do not look at passengers directly. Use the rearview mirror if you must.Right.He opened the back door and slid in. Didn’t speak. Just sat there, the seat creaking under his weight.I pulled away from the shoulder and merged back onto the main road. The silence was suffocating.I snuck a glance into the rearview mirror.At first, I saw nothing.Then the mirror fogged up. As if someone had breathed on it from the inside.I wiped away the condensation with my thumb and nearly jumped in my seat at what was revealed beneath.The figure in the backseat wasn’t looking at me.It was holding something.A large postcard, pressed flat against its face like a mask. Long fingers curled around the edges—fingers with nails so long and yellow they looked rotted. Just the sight of them sent a cold wave down my spine.I leaned forward just slightly, enough to make out the writing.Two words, scrawled across the card in what looked like red ink.Or blood.I couldn’t tell.“Just drive,”it said.I didn’t ask questions.I drove.For forty minutes, we cruised past silent fields, dead gas stations, and stretches of road I swear I’d never seen on any map. I didn’t get a destination update. No timer. Just me, the road, and whatever was sitting behind me.The silence felt thicker than usual. The only sound was the low hum of the engine and the occasional creak of the frame, like the car itself felt uneasy.I kept checking the rearview, but the mirror kept fogging up. Over and over, I wiped it clean with the side of my hand—each time revealing the same thing:He was closer.At first, he was sitting upright, stiff, almost mannequin-like.Next time, he was leaning slightly forward.Then his knees were nearly touching the back of my seat.His hat was old and stained, the brim tipped just low enough to hide most of his face. Torn in one corner, frayed like it had been dragged through gravel. I couldn’t see his eyes, but I could feel them. Like heat on the back of my neck.A cold sweat was forming along my forehead. I didn’t know what to do. No name. No timer. No destination.That had never happened before.I gripped the wheel tighter and kept driving, heart pounding louder than the tires on the asphalt.What do I do if he doesn’t leave?What if he just sits there until the sun comes up?Something bad would happen. I didn’t know what, exactly—but I knew the rules. This wasn’t just another creepy fare.At exactly 4:00 a.m., he tapped the window twice.I pulled over.Before I could say a word, the door creaked open and slammed shut. I checked the mirror.Fog gone.Seat empty.Except for something left behind.There was a small envelope with one of those fancy wax seals. Inside was a bundle of tattered cash wrapped in a classy red bow.Not a cent over the fare. Thank God.I set it aside and sat there for a while, just breathing. The car was finally quiet. Still.That night feels like it happened ages ago. I’m more seasoned now.Passengers without destinations? Common occurrence these days. Took me a while to realize—they’re not chasing a place. They’re chasing a feeling. A reaction. They're insatiable like that.But I’ve learned a lot since then. I know better than to feed their desires. You give them the cold shoulder long enough, and eventually, they leave.These days, I’m more composed. Like a prison warden ferrying rowdy inmates. I even bought a pistol. It sits in the glove compartment, mostly idle. But if someone in the back gets bold—starts creeping too close—a little flash of the barrel is usually enough.They growl. They curse. Slam the door behind them.Cab fare left on the seat. Not a cent overpaid.I don’t bother being gentle. It’s not like they can tip me.But tonight I am feeling a bit more anxious than usual. It isn’t because of the job. Nope, supernatural cab passengers are a walk in the park compared to what I have in store tomorrow.My son’s getting married.I haven’t been part of his life— not really. That was my fault. I kept my distance after the divorce, told myself he’d be better off without me hovering around. No awkward visits. No clumsy father-son talks. Just space.But when the invitation came, I cried.I just sat on the couch, clutching that envelope, and cried like I hadn’t in years.There was no way I was missing it. I’ve missed too much already.I should be resting right now. Getting ready for the big day. But I needed to calm my nerves. For some odd reason this job does it for me.Midnight hits. The app dings—first ride of the night. I take a deep breath and swipe to accept. Gotta focus. Just get through the shift, then it’s straight to the hotel, change into the suit, and head to the ceremony.The guy who gets in looks normal. Collared shirt, dark jeans, clean-cut. He slides into the backseat without a word at first. I start driving.A few blocks in, he speaks up. “Big night?”I nod. “Yeah. My son’s getting married tomorrow.”“Oh, that’s great. What’s his name?”I hesitate. “James.”He repeats it, real slow. “James. Strong name. What time’s the wedding?”“Two,” I say, eyes fixed on the road.He grins. “That’s wonderful. You must be proud.”I give a tight smile but don’t answer. Something about the way he’s asking all this makes me uneasy. It’s not the questions—people make small talk all the time. It’s the way he leans in when he speaks, like he already knows the answers. Like he’s confirming something.We pull up to his drop-off. He thanks me, steps out, and just… stands there on the curb, staring through the rear window. I look straight ahead and pretend not to notice.After a few seconds, he disappears into the dark.I sit there in silence, hands still on the wheel. That was strange. Even stranger than usual.Then it hits me.The rules. I forgot to check the rules tonight.I pulled up the app and swiped to the “Rules” section.Crap.There’s a new rule.“Don’t talk to the passengers about your personal life.”I stare at the screen like maybe I’m reading it wrong. Like maybe it’s always been there and I just never noticed. But I know better. That rule wasn’t there yesterday.My heart starts pounding.I pull over, open the app, and send a message to support. Something simple:“There’s a new rule. I broke it. How bad is this? What should I do?”No reply.Silence ensued. Last time I broke the rules, it took 24 hours to respond. And I don't have 24 hours.Eventually, I pull back onto the road. I figure I’ll do a couple more drop-offs, keep things simple. Maybe if I don’t mess up again, everything will smooth over.The next few passengers seem normal enough. Quiet. But there’s this weird vibe. A kind of smugness. A few of them chuckle under their breath. One guy keeps stealing glances at me in the rearview like I’m the punchline to some inside joke. Another girl won’t stop smiling—just this too-wide grin like she knows some deep dark secret about me.It starts to wear on me. By the third ride like that, my stomach’s turning.And then it gets worse.My next pickup is a woman standing alone on the corner in full wedding attire. A long white dress, veil, bouquet. It looks new. Clean. Not like a Halloween thing—this looks real. Expensive.She doesn’t speak when she gets in, just hums softly.Then she starts singing.“Here comes the bride…”Over and over. Whispered. Off-key. Like she’s only half-remembering the melody.The hair on my arms stands up.I drive in silence. Try not to react. She keeps singing all the way to her destination. And just before she opens the door, she leans forward and whispers:“So… when’s the wedding?”I say nothing.She tilts her head, like a confused bird. Then she gets out and drifts off into the dark, dragging the bottom of the dress behind her.I’m breathing hard now. Knuckles white on the wheel.Next ride. A guy in a wrinkled button-up shirt, tie hanging loose. He climbs in already shouting.“—He was a goddamn mechanic! And you know what? He was useless! Sat on his ass for twenty years and expects me to be grateful!”I keep driving. He doesn’t stop.“My fiancée wants me to invite him. Can you believe that? To my own wedding? She doesn’t know the guy. Hell, I don’t even know the guy.”He starts banging his fist on the seat in rhythm. Like he’s working himself up to something.I glance in the rearview. Big mistake.His eyes are wide. Wild. Red around the edges. There’s something shiny in his lap. For a second I think it’s a phone.It’s not.Without warning, he raises a pistol, sticks it under his chin, and pulls the trigger.A deafening pop.The windshield doesn’t shatter, but I hear the spray hit the back window.He slumps sideways. The door opens on its own, like someone was helping him out. I hear his body land on the sidewalk with a thump and the door slam shut behind him.I don’t stop.I don’t check.I just keep driving.Like I said, I'm a seasoned driver now. Sad to say this isn't the first time one of these loons popped themselves in the backseat to try and get me to turn around. I have bigger issues to worry about. The rule break hung heavy in my head.And I still haven’t heard back from support.The next passenger looked… relatively normal.Clean-cut. Mid-twenties. Button-down shirt tucked into dark jeans. He smiled as he climbed into the backseat. Polite nod. No words.The last few rides had been unsettling to say the least. But this guy felt different. Not better. Just different. He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to. Something in his silence felt smug. Like he already knew me. Like we’d done this before.We drove for fifteen minutes without a word. Then I pulled up to the hotel.He didn’t move.I shifted into park and turned slightly. Still not looking directly at him. Just using the mirror. “This is the address. You’re good to go.”He stared at me. No change in expression. No acknowledgment.And then I heard it. A knock on the driver-side window.“Dad?”I nearly jumped out of my skin.I turned, and there he was—James, my son. In his dress shirt and slacks, standing outside the hotel, looking confused and a little nervous. The same hotel he and the groomsmen were staying at tonight. How could I forget?I forced a smile. “Oh—hey, son. Just dropping someone off. You nervous for tomorrow?”He squinted at me like something was off. “Yeah… can we talk?”My stomach tightened. I had to get this guy out of the car.“Sure, just let me finish this ride. I’ll come inside after, okay?”His eyes drifted past me to the back seat.“…Troy?” he said.I froze.The figure in the back seat leaned forward, resting his elbows casually on the front headrest. His smile widened.“Hey man, can you believe this? I ran into your pops and figured we’d do a quick beer run before the big day. Hop in!”My blood went cold.No no, no, that isn’t Troy, I thought to myself.But I couldn’t tell James that. I don’t know what would happen if I did. This was bad. Really bad.“No,” James said shaking his head in disbelief. “Troy, you were just inside. You were with the guys. How—how did you get out here so fast?”The figure didn’t break character. He laughed like it was a shared joke between friends.James looked between us, clearly unnerved. “Dad… whoisthat?”I didn’t wait for the thing in the back to answer. This couldn’t go on any longer. I slammed the car into drive and tore out of the parking lot, tires screeching, engine roaring.In the mirror, James was yelling something. Running after us. I couldn’t hear him.“You’re gonna miss the wedding,” the thing said, voice perfectly calm. “That’s not very fatherly of you.”“Shut up,” I snapped. “You’re not getting in my head.”“Oh, come on,” it cooed. “Don’t be like that. Your son talks about you all the time. To me. To everyone.”I kept my eyes on the road, jaw clenched so tight I could feel it in my temples.“Although, he doesn’t say good things. You’re not a good father, Ben.”“Shut up,” I hissed. Tears bubbling in the corner of my eyes.“You missed birthdays. Missed milestones. What are you even doing now? Trying to show up at the last second and pretend it means something?”I gripped the wheel harder. I wanted to slam the brakes, throw open the door, and drag this thing out by whatever skin it had stolen.“Oh, don’t be like that Ben. I have something that’ll cheer you up,” it whispered. “Just keep driving. All the way until the sun comes up. I have something to show you.”I didn’t respond.I didn’t need to.My phone buzzed on the seat beside me—James. Again.I didn’t answer.The only sound in the car was the hum of the tires and that thing breathing behind me. Waiting.I wasn’t sure what to do now. The passenger gave me a drop-off and refused to get out. That hasn’t really happened before. There’s no way for me to force it out either. Not without looking directly at it. If I couldn’t get this guy to leave before the sun came up, I was screwed.It was useless.I pull over hard, tires kicking up dust on the shoulder of the road. The thing in the back doesn’t flinch. Just smiles like it’s been waiting for this moment all night.I open the glove box and take out my Glock 45.“Oh,” it says. “That didn't take long. You already getting tired of me, Ben?”I don’t answer. I close my eyes and take a few deep breaths.“Oh, Ben. You don’t have to do this. You’re going to miss out on all the fun I have in store—“I don’t even turn around. I raise the gun behind me, steady my breathing, and pull the trigger.The shot is deafening in the confined space. I don’t look. I just sit there, ears ringing, heart thudding. I wait for movement. For another voice. But there’s nothing.I finally peek into the rearview mirror once again.It’s slumped over in the seat. Still smiling, but quiet now. Unmoving.I knew that wasn’t going to kill this thing. But it still felt good. I just needed to shut it up for a minute. If it wasn’t going to leave, so be it. I had to come to terms with that fact.I wasn’t going to make it to the wedding.I was going to abandon my son again.This time for good. The least I could do was say sorry. Tell him I loved him. I just wish I could have done it sooner. Dammit, I wish I had more time.I pull out my phone. Hands shaking.I try to call James back but it goes to straight to voicemail.I speak through the lump in my throat.“Hey. It’s Dad. I just… I wanted to say I’m sorry. For everything. I should’ve been there for you. I should’ve…I should’ve been better.”The thing in the back seat was sitting upright now. Dusting off its blood-soaked shirt and slicking back the loose hair where the bullet exited.I started to sob into the phone.“But I’m proud of you James…I really am. Despite all my mistakes, you’ve done everything right. And I’m really, really happy I get to be at your wedding.”The mimic was coughing now. Pounding its chest with a closed fist. I heard a loud metallic clang as the bullet bounced off one of its teeth on the way out of it’s throat.I stifle a sob and take a deep breath before continuing.“I love you so much James. I’ll see you soon, buddy.”I hang up, tears running down my face, fogging up the screen.I sat there in silence for a few minutes. I watched as an orange glow began to rise from the horizon.It was almost sunrise.I closed my eyes and gripped the steering wheel in grim anticipation. This was it. I wasn’t sure what happened if I broke this rule. But I knew there was no coming back from it. Tech support wouldn’t be able to help me out of this one.Then I hear clapping.Soft. Slow.I look up.In the rearview, I see the thing clapping and wearing a wide smile. Only this time it doesn’t look as smug. It appears sincere. Genuine.“Nice job Ben,” it says. “Really touching.”It drops a handful of bills into the seat beside it and steps out of the vehicle.It ducks its head inside to give one final farewell.“Congrats on your son’s wedding.”Then it was gone. Just before the sunrise.I’m not sure why it decided to leave. All the night passengers want something. A reaction. A release. Most of the time it is something mean spirited. They crave anger, heartbreak, desperation. Maybe this one was benevolent. Maybe it needed to experience something heartfelt. Something real. God knows I needed it too. I’m just glad it’s all over.I didn’t take any more rides for the rest of the night.I went home. Scrubbed the blood off the backseat even though there wasn’t any. Changed the air freshener even though it still smelled new. Took a long, hot shower. Put on the suit I hadn’t worn in years.When I looked in the mirror, I almost didn’t recognize myself. I didn’t look any different. But I felt different. I wasn’t ashamed of the man that looked back at me. I was going to be a new person. I knew it was too late to be a good dad. I've been away too long to fix that. But he would always be my son. And he needed to know that I was never going to abandon him again.I got in the car. Not for work. Just to drive.To the wedding.And for the first time in a long time, I felt something that almost scared me more than a lifetime of ferrying supernatural passengers.Hope.",

      "content_preview": "I first noticed it when I moved into the apartment. Nothing unusual at first—just the usual creaks of a building that had stood since the ’70s. But then I started to see them.Not exactly people. Shadows.At first, I thought I was imagining things. I’d walk into the living room after a long day and, out of the corner of my eye, I’d catch something flickering on the wall. A shape that shouldn’t be there. But whenever I turned my head to look directly, it vanished.It started subtly. The shadows in my apartment—my own, the furniture, the coat rack—began to move slightly on their own. A twitch here, a shiver there, as if they were breathing. Then, they started to change.It was the night I was looking at old family photos that I really noticed. The shadows on the walls behind me twisted and warped, forming figures I recognized. My sister, whom I hadn’t seen in years. My father, who died when I was sixteen. They weren’t quite right, their limbs too long, their heads tilted at impossible angles but there was no mistaking their faces.And then I heard it. A whisper.“Let me in,” it hissed, low and dry, like leaves scraping concrete.I spun around, my heart pounding. My apartment was empty. Just me, the low hum of the fridge, the muffled traffic outside. My rational brain screamed that it was just my imagination. But the shadows didn’t stop.In the following days, the whispers grew louder. Not always words, sometimes just soft murmurs but always persistent. The shadows no longer just imitated people; they began to imitate me. The way I walked. The way I gestured when talking to myself. Sometimes, they moved before me, as if learning me, practicing me.I stopped inviting people over. I stopped using my living room. I started sleeping on the sofa, in the dark, watching the shadows stretch and twist across the walls like liquid. The apartment had changed somehow. It wasn’t just a place I lived; it was alive, and it was watching me.Then I noticed the cracks. Small at first, along the floorboards and baseboards. But they weren’t cracks in the wood…they were cracks in me.I looked at myself in the mirror, and sometimes my reflection lagged a second behind my movements, as if it was trying to catch up. I’d reach for the faucet, and it would hang there in the mirror for a moment longer. My reflection began to tremble, almost imperceptibly, as if the mirror itself was a thin screen holding it back.And the whispers… they were patient. Always patient.“Join us,” they murmured. “It’s warmer in the shadows. We can show you.”I told myself I was going crazy. I started keeping a diary, writing everything down, hoping that if I documented it, I could prove to myself it wasn’t real. But even as I wrote, I felt my words being pulled away, drained from my fingers. It was subtle at first, small omissions in sentences, missing letters, but I knew it wasn’t my brain making mistakes.One night, it got worse.I woke with a weight on my chest. Shadows spread across the room, spilling from the corners like ink from a bottle. They pressed against me, whispering my name over and over, their voices merging into a cold, endless chant. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. My body felt heavy, unreal, as if I were sinking into the mattress, the floor, into the shadows themselves.Then I saw her.My sister. But not my sister. Her shadowy form had wrong proportions, eyes too large, limbs too thin, and she smiled in a way I knew she never could. She leaned closer, and I felt her hand—cold, heavy, and empty—pressing mine.“You are ours now,” she said.I woke the next morning on the floor, drenched in sweat, my body aching as if I had been dragged across concrete. But the shadows persisted. Every corner of the apartment held a new figure, waiting, watching. I tried to leave. I really did.But when I reached the door, I froze. My shadow on the floor didn’t follow me. It stayed behind, stretching unnaturally, merging with the others. And when I looked at my hand, I noticed the faint outline of my fingers disappearing, the edges blending into the darkness.That’s when I understood what they wanted.I wasn’t just being haunted. I was being consumed. Slowly. Every day, every whispered word, every night of suffocating darkness, they tore me apart, enveloped me in themselves.I tried to fight back. I turned on all the lights, burned sage, played loud music, threw water into the corners where the shadows gathered. It didn’t matter. At night, they crept back, relentless. And with every encounter, I felt more of me disappearing.The first thing to vanish was my reflection. One morning, I looked in the mirror and saw nothing but empty space behind my eyes. Then came my words. Speaking became harder. I would open my mouth, but sometimes no sound came out.By the time I realized the truth, it was almost too late.The shadows weren’t just imitating me anymore. They had started to replace me. I would see a figure in the corner—my figure—but wrong, distorted, smiling with my face. It moved when I wasn’t looking, practicing my life, preparing to step fully into my skin. And the more I resisted, the harder it pushed, faster, stronger, smarter.Last night, I made my final mistake. I spoke to it.“Why are you doing this?” I whispered, my voice trembling.The shadows gathered, forming my sister again. Her distorted face gave me a malicious look. “Because it’s afraid of the dark. Because everyone fears what they cannot control. But we… are patient.”Then she smiled. Not with lips, but with the stretching of the shadows themselves. And I felt the last pieces of me give way. My arms, my legs, my face, all of me melting, folding into the darkness.Now, I am almost among them, almost part of them, whispering to anyone who dares stay too long in the corners. Waiting. Learning. Practicing.I’m writing this as fast as I can… before I become one of them. I need to warn you. If you see your shadow moving differently than you remember… do not speak to it. Do not fight it. Do not look away.Because those who live in the shadow are patient. And if you hesitate… they will take you, piece by piece.I can feel you now. Watching. Waiting. The corners are hungry. The shadows are hungry.And soon… they will haveyou.",

      "content_preview": "I don’t know exactly where to start. I was in my dorm room and the sun was setting. My roommate, Alex, had gone cave exploring with his friends - he’d asked if I wanted to join, but I wasn’t a big fan of humidity and darkness.I was just messing around on my laptop and convincing myself I’d start working on my translation homework soon. I’d run out of things to do when my phone rang - I thanked Alex for giving me another reason to procrastinate.I answered a little too quickly. His voice exploded on the other side, interrupted by shaky breaths and the cracking of footsteps.Hey, dude.Hi,I replied.You ok? You having fun?Yeah. It’s cool. Hey, listen - can you come pick me up? In like an hour?I thought you guys said you took the bus and then hiked to the entrance.I’m really exhausted and I got lost and honestly I just want to get out. I want to get in your car and I don’t feel like hiking 3 miles back to the bus station.Well, you should’ve thought about that before.Dude, please.I thought about it for a minute. He’d sent me some location earlier - it was a 2-hour drive.Look, I’m kinda low on gas. You’ll have to wait for me to fill up.I responded, hoping he’d get the hint about gas money.Yeah, whatever. Just come. I’m cold and tired. I’ve been wandering around aimlessly for a while.What do you mean? Are you alone? Where are the others?He took a deep breath before responding.According to my map, I’m close to the other exit. The others - I don’t know. Dana said she was turning around a while ago and I haven’t heard from her since, and Luis and Astrid were right behind me for some time, but then I turned around and realized that, that Luis was gone, and we called for him, but, but he didn’t answer… and Astrid started acting strange, like she knew something I didn’t. She became hysterical and refused to go with me this way, and now I don’t know where the fuck she is. I’m honestly mad at them and I think they’re just pranking me. Please just pick me up.Something in his tone made me feel sorry for him. Maybe theywerepranking him. His friend group had a weird habit of messing with each other.Ok, I’ll come get you.Thanks.So, how is it?I figured I could stay on the phone with him for a while, so he wouldn’t feel scared.Hey… hey Eli. You there?Yeah.Yeah, yeah… just… wow. This cave. You wouldn’t believe it. The entrance itself is huge. Yeah, it’s something else. The first passage is a little downward slope. Walls are wet, like glistening stone, and smooth, but kind of… weirdly soft in patches. I brushed my hand over one spot just to see… and it gave a tiny bit. Not mud or anything, just… elastic. Kinda warm.Warm?Yeah, I dunno. Probably just the humidity or something. Makes me wonder what kind of mineral deposits are in here.The floor is soft too, in some places. Totally normal in a cave with this much moisture, right? You step and it depresses slightly, like packed dirt. Weirdly satisfying. I kept joking that it feels like a mattress.… A mattress?Don’t laugh, okay? It’s just… squishy in spots. You step, it sinks, then pops back. Very odd. But hey, makes walking fun. Keeps you on your toes.Alright… just… be careful.I know, I know. So we hit the first chamber. Huge. Ceiling vanishes into darkness. The walls glint, minerals catching the flashlight, shiny patches, streaks of red and brown. Looks like wet clay, but… not exactly. Almost organic-looking. But probably just light trickery. I mean… caves do weird stuff with reflection, right?Yeah… sure.There are these shadows, too. Weird angles, long thin things dangling from the ceiling. I keep telling myself they’re just roots or stalactites. But sometimes, they seem… to stretch a little when I blink. Like they’re following me. Totally my imagination, I’m sure.Sounds… unsettling.Nah, not really. More curious than anything. I even stepped on a soft patch that squelched a little… mud, I think. Or maybe water seeping under the rocks. Weird noises echoing, probably just the cave acoustics.The air is thick, humid. Metallic smell in spots, probably just minerals. Either way, it’s intense. Makes you really feel the cave.Anyway, the deeper I go, the passages twist and bend. I thought I’d be out by now. I turn thinking I’m going back to the first chamber, and… nope. Different place entirely. Angles change. Walls shift a little when I’m not looking. Totally normal for caves, right? I mean, natural erosion and all that.Uh… yeah, sure.There’s more. Shadows, veins in the floor, weird reflective puddles. Air pockets of warmth and cold in patches. Makes it exciting. Really makes you focus on every step. I’m loving it. Eli, you would love this.Alex… you’re sounding… more nervous than you admit.Nervous? Nah. Curious. Always curious. That’s all. I mean, it’s a cave. Of course it’s creepy in spots. But… really, I feel fine. I’m fine.The line crackled. I could hear faint gurgles echoing through the passages behind him, though he didn’t comment.I hung up and I started my car. I’d been driving to the location of the cave for about one hour, when he called me again.Dude, this thing is fucking changing around me. I think there’s a stream of water below somewhere. I keep hearing this splashing below.I’m almost there. Don’t worry. I’m almost there.Okay.Another shaky breath.Okay.I parked my car and sighed at the sight of the hill I needed to climb to get to the location pin. He couldn’t have picked a more accessible entrance. It had to be somewhere you couldn’t reach by car.After around 20 minutes of fighting with bushes and rocks, I finally got to the top. I stood on this clearing, puffing from the hike. The fog hung low, curling around the tree trunks. The hill stretched gently before me, dotted with dips and rises, shadows and light patches.I called Alex.Hey, I’m… uh, here.Don’t panic. Just, I can’t find the entrance.I can’t stay still! I keep moving, and everywhere I step, it reacts. The walls curve toward me. The floor lifts slightly. The air pulses… wet.Alex… step back, just slowly.I can’t step back… it’s… I think it’s following me. Or maybe… it’s holding me. The walls… the ceiling… the floor… all moving in time with each other, almost breathing together. I touched another wall… veins, ridges, folds. Warm, slick, alive. I think… I’m inside it.Inside… what?I was beginning to lose my cool. The air around me was warm against my cold sweat. The sun was now fully down, and my eyes kept darting to the tree line, dark crowns of branches all around the clearing. The sky was enormous and hostile. I couldn’t find the entrance in the dark. I only had the moonlight and some faint stars guiding me. If I wasn’t going to find Alex…It’s not a cave, Eli. It’s… a body.Stop saying that. Just fucking calm down and go back the way you came…… a huge, grotesque organism…… you’ll be fine, just stay fucking calm……everything I thought was rock is flesh. Veins, ridges, folds. Wet surfaces that pulse and breathe. I… I can feel it sensing me. Reacting to me. Every movement I make, it flexes beneath my hands and feet.Alex…Oh God, I can hear it. A heartbeat. Slow, wet, immense. It reverberates through the floor, through the walls, through the air.I’m inside something alive.A living, breathing… monster.Alex… you need to move back toward the entrance.I think I’m inside its chest or head. Its… body. I can feel… it’s aware. And the sound… the sound of it breathing around me… wet, deep, alive… oh God…Alex…The line fizzed with wet static. A low, gurgling pulse echoed faintly.I started panicking. Alex was almost hysterical, yet his words were stressed, almost spit out. He kept rambling about guts and his friends.Oh my God, I think I found it. Holy shit.The exit?I heard a bunch of obscenities, then a pause. When Alex finally spoke, I had stopped paying attention to him.I think I found its heart.I didn’t answer. In my continuous studying of my surroundings, I’d realized the tree line was now lower than when I’d gotten up there. I looked down, then back to the tree line, which was moving up and down almost imperceptibly. Then, it lowered.And lowered.And lowered.",

      "content_preview": "I can’t tell this story to anyone, but I need to get it off my chest. So I will write it here.Names have been changed.*******************It all started in 1996. My parents had just bought our first home computer - one of those bulky machines that sat in the living room for the whole family to use. On the rare occasions when my parents weren’t around, I would turn it on and scour the Internet for things little children aren’t supposed to mess with. One afternoon, my dad was at work and my mom ran to the shop, leaving me home alone for just a few minutes.I typed www . death . com into the search bar.I often made up creepy website names. I was a curious child and I wanted to educate myself on the things adults were afraid to talk about. The website that popped up was a gloomy page featuring the drawing of a skeleton in a black cape. It read:Do you want to know when you will die?It prompted me to enter my name and date of birth. I did - then clicked onSubmit. As soon as a new window opened, I instinctively closed my eyes. Did I really want to know when I would die? No, I didn’t. Did I believe that a scary website could actually know the date of my death? No, I didn’t. But… you never know.I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard Mom’s keys turning in the lock. Mom would be furious if she knew what I was up to - she thought I only dealt in stuffed animals and Disney princesses. I grabbed the mouse and darted toward the little X in the top right corner of the window. In the process, I stole a quick, furtive glance. A tiny glance.But I saw it alright:August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM.In the years that followed, I lived my life without ever thinking about that stupid website again.Did I, though?… August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM … August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM … August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM…That date was burned into the back of my mind. It sat there like a relentless ticking clock I never dared to speak of. It only left me with 26 years - which doesn’t sound too bad, but it really isn’t that much when you think about it. Although I would never allow myself to acknowledge it, I rushed to achieve my goals because I secretly feared time was running out. I wrote like crazy throughout my twenties until I managed to publish a novel. It sold decently well. Seeing my creation on library shelves helped some of the anxiety subside. At least I had made my mark in the world. A small mark. I needed to keep going to make it bigger.I wrote another novel that I was convinced would become my masterpiece. It was rejected by every single editor.I had never felt so hopelessly crushed. One night, in the midst of a panic attack, I opened my laptop and went back to that website.I landed on a grey, empty page. All it said was:This Domain Name is for Sale!Relief rushed through me. This whole death prediction thing was a hoax from the early days of the Internet - meant to attract traffic from credulous children like me. Obviously. Afterwards, I developed a more relaxed disposition. But only to an extent. I still had a lot of work to do on my way to greatness and I’d better not procrastinate.I married Tim on a bright summer day. From the moment I met him, I knew he was the one. Sweet, dependable, down-to-earth. As a tax accountant, he had a comfortable paycheck, great benefits and a solid life insurance policy. Sure, he wasn’t the most adventurous man in the world, but who cared? He believed in me and was happy to support me while I poured my time into my literary endeavours.August 20, 2022 came around. You may ignore the passing of time all you want, tell yourself that a certain day is still far off - but that day will come.Oh yes, it will.I pretended that there was nothing special about August 20, 2022. Still, I took some precautions. In the weeks prior, I’d put myself through a battery of medical checkups. Not that I had any symptoms - indeed, the doctors confirmed that I was healthy as a horse.Even though August 20 was a Saturday night, I made no plans. I sat in front of the television and did not budge. Tim went upstairs at 10 PM. He always went to bed early. I wished I could join him, but for some reason I absolutely had to finish binge-watching some meaningless Netflix show.August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM. What if I die in my sleep?At 11:31 PM, I started feeling a tingling in my nails. I wiggled my fingers - it went away.A few minutes later, it came back. As any sane person would do, I pulled out my iPhone and Googled it. None of the medical conditions associated with nail tingling could possibly apply to me. As I had already established beyond a reasonable doubt, there was nothing wrong with my body. The only condition that did match, was anxiety disorder. It was 11:40 PM on August 20, 2022 and I had to face it: I was really, really anxious to go on that website again.My fingers flew across the touch keyboard. Hoping to land onThis Domain Name is for Sale!, I crashed back into that old webpage from 1996. But this time, the caped skeleton was pointing at a real-time clock:11 : 44 : 01 PM11 : 44 : 02 PM11: 44 : 03 PMThe room started spinning… the ground gave way beneath my feet. What kind of sick joke was this? That website was supposed to be down. How did it recognize me from 26 years ago? I didn’t use the same Google account! Google accounts didn’t even exist in 1996!!Wait… I wasn’t being rational. What the screen was showing me was just a real-time clock. There was no actual piece of information tied to me. Most likely, the original creators of the website had bought back the domain name and decided to play a prank on anyone who had been on it back in the day. Sooner or later, someone would go on the website at an unfortunate time - and get scared out of their mind.Why won’t this tingling stop?I tossed my phone on the couch and went back to watching TV. I refused to be intimidated by such nonsense. But I could not understand anything the characters on the screen were saying.I glanced at my nails. They looked a bit dark. Had they always looked this way?Almost without thinking, my hand grabbed the phone again. I checked the timer:11 : 48 : 05 PM“So what?” I told myself. “This is a night like any other night. It will pass and the sun will rise and the darkness will be forgotten.”DRIIIIIIIIINI shot up from the couch. WHAT WAS THAT?!The doorbell. Just the doorbell.Our house was pretty isolated but every now and then, bored teenagers would bike out to the edge of town and ring random doorbelles for kicks. I looked through the peephole: just the dark, empty street. I unlocked the door. Maybe I could catch them - give them a good scolding. As I pushed the door open, a gust of icy wind slithered inside, engulfing me in cold, lonely despair. I slammed the door shut and backed away into the warmth of my home.DRIIIIIIINAgain?!“Go away!!”, I shouted. I strained to hear anything outside. Nothing. No giggling. No footsteps. No bike wheels turning. Just dead silence.August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AMI looked through the peephole.I SCREAMED.But the scream didn’t come out. It turned inward - digging into my lungs - as I stood there breathless, my mouth agape like the corpse of a hanging man.Outside my door was the skeleton in a black cape, its unnatural grin and hollow eyes boring into me through the peephole.I scrambled back to the couch, snatched up my phone, dialed 911 and started jabbering: “Help! Someone at my door - trying to get in -  help - they want to hurt me!” … Then I realized that the call hadn’t gone through. I had no reception. Zero bars. In fact, the reception symbol was gone altogether.Suddenly, the phone fell from my hands. I had finally noticed it.My nails. Black. Broken.Rotten.August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AMIt was real. It had always been real.I lunged at my phone. Thankfully, it was still intact. I opened the browser and went back to the website.11 : 54 : 58 PMDRIIIINMy heart jumped into my throat. It tasted like blood.11 minutes to go.I took a deep, trembling breath. I was a smart woman. There had to be something I could do to save myself. Every problem has a solution, doesn’t it?I brought my phone closer to my face, scanning every inch of the webpage, looking for a clue. A loophole. Some guidance from the devil himself.There it was! At the very bottom of the page, almost invisible:ContactI slammed my thumb down. A chat window popped up.Sleepy Friend: Hi Suzanne!It knew my name.

He had lived a GOOD life. Would growing old and sick make him any happier? Probably not. Sure, he was a competent tax accountant. There were thousands others like him. Did the world need more tax filings from him specifically? Not really.12 : 04 : 23 AMI, on the other hand, had important work to do. I was creative, I was unique. My new novel was coming along nicely. It just needed time to mature. TIME.12 : 04 : 51 AMI brutally silenced my thoughts.

Waiting for the Horror to come through.DINGI jumped.It wasn’t the doorbell - just a notification. Sleepy Friend had responded.Sleepy Friend: Thank you, Suzanne.

To my immense relief, they looked perfectly normal. The thought occurred to me that perhaps they had always looked normal. Maybe the fear, bottled up for 26 years, had made me hallucinate.With newly-found courage, I walked to the front door and peered through the peephole: only the empty street.For the first time that night, I suddenly felt clear-minded. It was like I had just woken from a bad dream into an ordinary, reassuring reality.It had all been an elaborate prank. And a very tasteless one at that. I didn’t know how they pulled it off, but after a good night’s sleep, I would figure it out.SWOOSHAs I turned around, the hairs at the back of my neck stood up.The caped figure was gliding down the stairs behind me. Its bony grin flashed in the dim light.My legs were two pillars of stone. I stood still as the figure breezed right past me. The front door swung open in its wake. The figure blended into the night. In the blink of an eye, the door was closed again.I picked up the phone and dialed 911. I did not bother checking the bedroom. I knew what I would find.*************************I buried my husband Tim three years ago. He died of a heart attack -  surprising for a man in his thirties, but not so surprising considering both his father and uncle suffered from heart problems.He is sorely missed. As the wonderful provider that he was, he left me with enough money to support myself while I write full-time.I still haven’t finished my masterpiece. I am so damn close, but something always holds me back. Some days, I can’t focus on my manuscript for more than a few seconds at a time - I keep thinking that I might be about to die and the panic makes my brain go haywire. Other days, I simply stare at the wall, drenched in the weight of this never-ending existence.I think the uncertainty is killing me. Maybe if I knew what to expect… Maybe then I would feel motivated again.I did check the website. It looks exactly as it did in 1996.Do you want to know when you will die?First Name:Last Name:Date of Birth:EnterShould I do it?",

If no AC unit is available, cracked windows are permitted. Openings must not be wide enough to allow through a hand.The Faceless Man has learned how to unlock doors from the inside.-Employee Handbook: Section 8.C_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Part 1Part 2Okay guys.I really should clarify a few things at this point. The first of which being that while it is true―I may not have immediately read theentireemployee handbook before the incidents of my last post―I had readmostof it. Chapter headings, section descriptions, general overview, etc. Even if I’d read the entire part about hitchhikers, it wouldn’t have prevented the whole incident with Not-Myra. And plus, I'll remind you thatI’m not actually dead yet,so I’m not entirely helpless.The main issue with the employee handbook is that it’s vague. Sure, there are rules and guidelines, but I get the impression Randall and the rest of the dispatchers don’t entirely know what’s going on either. This road, Route 333, makes its own rules. It doesn’t always care to inform us about them.Ok, and second thing.I have actually gone to therapy before. I’d prefer not to get into it much with a bunch of anonymous online Redditors (no offense), but it wasn’t especially helpful. For some people I know therapy makes things harder first before it makes them better, but for me, it sort of just made things harder. And harder. And harder. Something about the vulnerability of it.I’ve tried a few medications too, but I’ve heard some people are pretty resistant to them. I suspect that’s me. Even so, thank you for all your concerns. For real.Now.Onto something more related to Route 333 and the many ways I repeatedly almost get myself killed―because let’s be real, that’s why you’re here, not to hear about my ever-degrading mental state. Mainly, I realize I haven't said much about the other truckers.I’m sure to nobody’s surprise, I mainly avoided the other drivers the first few weeks at my job. Every few hours I’d pass one of them on Route 333 and give a small wave, but apart from that, I was in no rush to make new friends. Especially not ones in their forties and fifties. If it weren’t for the Faceless Man, I might have never gotten to know them at all.There’s not much of a section in the employee handbook on the Faceless Man. The only mention is when it says,The Faceless Man has learned how to unlock doors from the inside.Like I said. Vague*.*Ominous too though, so I made sure to close my windows and lock the doors every night before laying down on the cab sleeper. Generally, I’d leave the windows shut even if it was sweltering, but one night it got especially sweltering.There weren’t many clouds in the sky. I’d already tossed and turned in my sweaty sheets for an hour before I decided to let in some air.Just a crack.I even wiggled my fingers in the open space to make sure that’s all that could get through. When I tried to sleep this time, there was enough of a breeze to let me.The next time I woke, it was still night. The moon was covered by clouds, but enough light made it through to illuminate the interior of the cab.Clouds.I sat up.There was no reason to be afraid. I knew this. I hadn't broken any rules. The doors were locked and secured. Even so, I glanced first at the driver’s side window and then the passenger.My entire existence jerked to a stop.It stared at me through the glass―at least that’s what I assumed it was doing. The thing had no eyes, no ears, no hair, and no mouth. The only feature reminiscent of a living creature's were two snake-like slits in the middle of the face. A nose of some sort.It faced me. It smelled. I could audiblyhearthe inhale even through the door, and the slits widened to holes the size of chestnuts. Light from the truck stop caught on each individual hair, almost like teeth.Hello?I tried, but no sound came out. I forced my throat to clear, and tried again. “Do you need something? Are you―are you the Faceless Man?”Right. Because of course the thing with no ears or mouth is going to hear you and respond.And then I thought,maybe the name Faceless Man is somehow offensive, so I immediately asked, “unless you prefer to be called something different?” Because apparently I’d literally already forgotten this thing COULD NOT hear me.If you can’t tell, I tend to overthink whilst in uncomfortable situations.By this point I’d already experienced enough oddities of the road that I was content to just curl there in the corner and wait until the thing left. That’s exactly what I would have done―if the Faceless Man hadn't reached a hand with seven fingers up and tapped the glass.Quick clarification. When I say fingers, that’s probably precisely what you envision: fingers. What Ireallymean is seven bleach white protrusions, each a meter long, with dozens of joints and gnarled nails curling from their tips.I watched in horror as each of the fingers felt along the glass, found the lip, then snaked inwards.“Nope!” I told it. “That’s not happening. You’re not doing that.”I scrambled for my pants, then decided it really wasn’t worth it, and clambered for the driver seat in my boxers. The Faceless Man inhaled again and swiveled to follow my movement.“Out!” I commanded and twisted the key. The truck roared to life.The ivory fingers felt around, sliding past the unlock button and heading directly for the inner handle.“One last chance,” I warned―even though it was entirely clear by now the thing wasn’t able to hear me. When it predictably continued to not be able to hear me, I did what anybody would do in this situation: I rolled up the window.They flattened. Each cylindrical finger compressed where the glass closed into them, and the thing outside shuddered in pain. It yanked at them, trying to escape but unable. I gave it two more seconds, then cracked the window again.The Faceless Man yanked its fingers from my car, exhaled greenish globs of what I suspect was snot on my window, then skittered away.Needless to say, I got an early start that morning.While that whole incident did shake me up(and made me demand a rig with internal AC, non-negotiable), it reminded me of something. The Faceless Man had tracked my movements by smelling me. Maybe that was just a coincidence. Probably, smells were how it was drawn to any human…But there was already another subset of road-dwellers who apparently knew my scent. Could the Faceless Man somehow be connected?The employee handbook said very little about the topic, and Randall hadn't seemed overly talkative when I’d asked him about the things in the forest. I approached a few co-workers instead.They explained thatno,the Faceless Man probably wasn’t connected to the things in the forest. They were confined to the forest. He was confined to cloudy nights. He was just a harmless pest, basically like a raccoon, looking for somewhere to warm up (though, he would occasionally suffocate people by shoving his fingers down their throat, so maybe not entirely harmless). They also told me not to trust any energy drink brands I didn’t recognize at gas stations and to avoid coffee at late night diners.The coffee wasn’t dangerous. It just was nasty.I started talking with the other drivers at the truck yard before and after hauls. We’d chat when we stopped for showers at the same time and radio greetings when we passed each other on the road. Slowly, I got to know some of them.Deidree was a divorced mom of three. She hated she had to be away from her kids for such long stretches, but this job’s pay was the only way she’d be able to send her oldest to college.Then there was Vikram. He immigrated with his family from India about ten years ago. He tried taxi-ing in Chicago, but the pay was crap and the people were rude. He liked long-hauling much better.Chris was more of a short-hauler. He’d been on Route 333 for almost fifteen years, longer than anybody else. He’d started like me with an extremely short drive time, and the road had taken its sweet time expanding for him. He mainly did short trips now to be safe, one or two day hauls. That’s how long it took him to get out of the redwood section to the first turnaround point (from my interview). About 10X slower than me still. Even so, he could still cover ground quicker than some of the others.“I’ll be done in a year or two,” he confided in me once over breakfast at a diner. “They pay me more than anybody, but takes me longer t’get anything done. Besides, don’t wanna risk getting lane-locked.”That's what we call it. Lane-locked*.* Usually, Route 333 expands at an even pace, but eventually, without warning, it will one day explode in length. What took hours to drive the previous day might take weeks or even years now.There’s signs to watch out for―less stars in the sky than usual, rest stop attendants getting colder to you, expansion at an increasing pace―but it’s impossible to predict the exact moment lane-locking happens. There’s always a risk of getting taken unawares.“It’s like a fever breaking,” Deidree explained to me. “We’re the virus. It takes a minute for the highway to get immune to us, but once it does, it happens all at once.”There’s a small stretch far out into the desert where it’s common to see a neon orange flatbed heading the direction of the real world. Sometimes it’s missing. It slips into pockets of the road the rest of us luckily haven’t accessed yet, but always, eventually, you see the flatbed again. Same area. Still driving.“How long has he been going now,” I asked Chris one morning.“Six, maybe seven years? Al’s a good guy. We’ll pull over and talk ‘casionally. His time came quicker than most.”“How much ground has Al covered?”Chris exhaled through his mouth and shook his head. “To you? A few miles maybe. He’ll never make it back, not’n a hundred years. He has a family though. He refuses to quit.”Some do though. Some accept they’re stuck, that it’s not worth years of their life trying to get out, and find a new sort of life on Route 333.People like Tiff._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________The first time I met Tiff, I was getting coffee at three in the morning at the Wayside Diner.It’s true. The coffee at late night diners on Route 333 is truly, utterly disgusting, but I was desperate for any sort of caffeine, however crappy. I was only a few hours from the truck yard terminal, and if possible, I try not to sleep on the highway more than absolutely necessary.Call me high maintenance, but I’m still not a fan of waking up to see Mr. Nose sniffing longingly at me.A middle-aged waitress delivered my coffee and waited there as I sipped it.“What the…” I looked up at her. “This is actually palatable.”“Not exactly a compliment, but I’ll take it.” The woman slid in the booth across from me. “You must be the new one. Brendon, right?”“Uh, yeah?” I wasn’t used to people on Route 333 knowing who I was, or really even acknowledging me. It was still unclear from the handbook and my interactions with them if they were actual people or just sort ofthere.This woman seemed different though.“I’m Tiff. Former employee turned waitress.”“I’ve heard of you. The others, they mention you.”“Still remember me do they? Glad to hear I’m not entirely forgotten. Almost never visit me anymore.”“You work here?”She shrugged. “When I want. Staffing lets me fill in―not so sure if they’relettingme, as much as I tell them I work here and they believe me. Doesn’t pay anything, but it’s not like I need money anymore, just like chatting. Imuchprefer real people though.”She clasped her hands, and muscles flexed along her fully tattooed arms. Tiff was exactly the type of tough woman you’d imagine would become a trucker―well, that mixed with the sort of desperate, lonely friendliness only found at an old folks home.“Tell me,” she said. “What was your first reaction when you realized Route 333 wasn’t a normal road? I always ask that.”“I don’t think I’ve ever screamed at an interviewer before.”She laughed. “And after you started working?”“It was… a bit weird. I guess? I don’t know. I just sort of accepted it.”“Abitweird?” She eyed me, then reached for my cup and took a swig. “You seem like somebody going through something.”True enough.We talked for hours that night. She grabbed us some pie from the counter, and she asked about my life and talked about hers.She’d been offered a position on Route 333 for years before she actually accepted. She’d heard the rumors. She knew the sort of dangers it offered. When she finally took a position it was only because her daughter got a brain tumor. Treatment was expensive. Her daughter didn’t survive, but after that, Tiff kept hauling to stave off the loneliness.I told her I understood.She told me thatno, I didn’tactually, seeing how I was atwenty-odd-something puppy boybut that I probably had my own similar thing I did understand that was close enough, so she wasn't offended.By the time we called it quits, the sun was already rising. I don’t remember everything we talked about, but I do remember myself standing up, patting her shoulder and saying, “I’ll talk to Randall. We’ll find some way for you to get out of here.”Her face went dark. “You shouldn’t have said that. Not where the road can hear you.”I slept a few hours, then got up around noon. Before I left, I decided to take a shower.The water in the personal shower room was cold. I waited a few minutes for it to heat up, but when it didn’t, I decided that realistically there were people dying from parasites in other countries, and a cold shower likely wouldn’t result in a grueling end.It did still suck though. I finished that thing in a minute flat, then twisted the faucet tooff.The water didn’t stop.I tried twisting it the other way. The water only got stronger. And the drain in the floor― it had stopped working. Freezing water was building up in a puddle. Soon, it overflowed the lip of the shower, and onto the tile.I sighed, dressed, and went for the door. My shower sandals slapped all the way there. It was locked. I flipped the lock back and forth, but any way I attempted, the door wouldn’t budge. I pounded at it until the cold touch of water licked my ankles.It was around then I realized I was in trouble.“Hey!” I screamed repeatedly, but nobody seemed to hear me. The water was at my knees now.How is it coming so fast?I waded back to the shower, tried the handle again, then did my first truly stupid thing of this incident (you all know by now I’m bound to do something stupid eventually). I bound my towel around the showerhead to stop the flow, which didn’t work a bit. Then I proceeded to slip, trip, and yank the towel with me. The showerhead tore off.The rate of water doubled.It was at my shoulders now. The water started pumping out brown and sludgy. It was too murky to see through, and my feet― things began tobrushagainst them.Just my clothes,I told myself, but since when did my clothes have scales?I pounded at the door. I stood on the handle to keep my face above the water. There had to be some way out. I couldn’t die like this. There was only a foot of breathable air now. Then six inches. Then one.I gasped a final breath as the slimy, scaled things wrapped around my ankles and jerked me down. I flailed to escape, but where would I go? There was no more air. The entire room was full of glacier water.My vision started dimming. I felt my throat convulsing, begging me to breathe. I couldn’t resist anymore―The door flew open. Hundreds of gallons of water sloshed out of the bathing room into the hallway. It slammed me against the wall, but I gasped and struggled to my feet.When I stood, the hallway was dry. The shower room was dry. My dirty clothes were in a heap on the bench where I’d left them, totally―you guessed it―dry. The only thing that was sopping wet was me.Tiff walked into the hallway a few seconds later with a garbage bag. She glanced from me in my sopping clothes to the open door of the shower room, then back to me. “I told you you shouldn’t have said that.”“What just happened?” I demanded, followed by a fountain of colorful words.“A threat. The road doesn’t like to give up things it's claimed for its own. Don’t try to help me escape, Brendon.”With that, she shook her head, stepped over the puddle at my feet, and carried the trash down the hallway.It took me some time to change my clothes, dry off, and even more time to calm down. Once I had, I was finally able to thinkThe way Tiff had told me not to help her had been calm. Resigned. She’d given up years ago. She’d accepted this truck stop and its miniature diner was her life now, because the only alternative was something worse.The road had claimed her. It wanted her to stay, and it would hurt anyone who tried to take her―except it couldn’t hurt me.That realization. That shining understanding, more golden than any moment of happiness, filled me with hope. Route 333 couldn’t hurt me because I had nothing I cared about. It could kill me, but so what? Why should that bother me?My life didn’t matter to me, which meant I could defy the road all I wanted. Tiff might have given up, but I hadn't. I was going to get her out or die trying. I’d finally found something I hadn't had in years.A reason.Keep reading",

      "content_preview": "When I was just a girl, i used to play teacher with my dolls almost every day. I’d lay them in a row on the carpet, dress them in little uniforms, and position their little plastic bodies in studious, ready-to-learn positions. I’d strut around my room with a bedtime story in my grip, pretending like I was teaching them important life lessons. My fantasies could never compare to the real thing, though.Nothingcompares to the real life fulfillment of feeling like you’re making a difference in a child’s life- seeing the light in their eyes instead of the soulless plastic faces I was used to.  After I started teaching for real, I threw away all of my dolls. Couldn’t stand their plastic faces anymore, it felt blasphemous.I want to preface this by clarifying I remember each student I’ve ever had the privilege of meeting. It might take me longer sometimes to get my memory of them going, but eventually Ialwaysremember. I remember them all. And I loved them all (I still do). I can’t figure out why or how this is happening, and I honestly feel quite humbled. Maybe I don’t know everything and some things are better left unexplained. It seems like there’s nothing Ican doanyways, so maybe I should just live in a blissful state of blind delusion? It all comes down to one kid, anyways. One singular child who has caused me to question and doubt every basic law of human nature and existence. If i can get rid of him, or forget him, or make someonebelieve memaybe I can find myself again. I don’t know. It’s probably too late for that.It was my second year of teaching and my first year at the private school I’m at now. It was such a jarring switch from public school- perfectly wealthy families wrapped up with a pretty bow on top. I was there to teach them skills they’d probably never need beyond their schooling, because daddy’s company would immediately hire them post grad. It felt like my kids were always the sweetest ones. Bright-eyed third graders, ready and eager to learn. The school I teach at is Montessori-esque, basically a fancy word for hands on learning. It was very different from the conventional practice of teaching, but it does allow you to form a stronger bond with your students.Hedidn’t show up on meet the teacher day, or the day after. It was on the second real day of school. I thought he was a lost kid at first, and I was prepared to help him find the correct classroom. As the rest of the class played with their toys, I knelt down beside him at the door.“Hey buddy. Do you need some help finding your class?”He nodded.“Let me help you out, sweetie. What’s that piece of paper you have in your hands?”He handed it over, eyes never leaving mine.It was his class assignment sheet in perfect condition. Sure enough, it had my class listed as where he was supposed to be. It read:ROOM 406 FLOOR 4 MS. DEGONIA RALPH MANHATTANI looked it over, confused. I hadn’t seen his name on my roster yesterday, and with a last name like that - I was sure I would’ve caught it.“Well, seems like you’re stuck with me then… Ralph! Come on in, we’re just getting started.”Ralph stayed close behind me and followed me into the class. I finished my introduction speech and glanced over at my roster again. Huh. Ihadmissed his name yesterday, i guess. I made a note to self to email my supervisor about that later.Ralph’s first year in my class was relatively normal, besides the fact that he had a few quirks. He was extremely shy and quiet, always observing the other kids. He sat in the same chair each class, and would get there early just to have it all to himself. One thing I found fascinating was his big, red scarf he’d wear just about everyday as well. Just regular, loner kid stuff.I’d love to skip ahead to the later years, but there are some important things Imustmention before I move ahead.Ralph never had any parents listed as contacts in his file. There was only an address and a phone number. When brought to administrative attention in later years, this was often brushed off as parent neglect.Ralph has blonde hair, green eyes, and a large freckle on his left cheek.Ralph is an only child, and has no documented siblings.After Ralph’s first year, he showed up in my class the next. Under almost the exact same circumstances as the year prior. He came to my room, holding the piece of paper with my class name on it, waiting to be let in. This time, I had called the administration immediately, as there had to have been some kind of mix-up. They assured me that he had gotten held back to re-do the third grade at the request of his family. This was concerning to me, as Ralph never struggled with his studies, and was consistently at the top of his grade. Anytime I tried to push for more information, the answers only got more vague and passive aggressive. So, I dropped it. Maybe it’s his home life, or something religious? I didn’t mind another year with the kid, despite the unjust circumstances.Year two was almost identical to his first. He talked a bit more, but only to me and in one word phrases, mostly. Ralph played by himself and chose to nap most recesses. He hadn’t aged a day and was significantly shorter than his old classmates. His old “friends” would wave at him in the halls politely, acknowledging his presence in a friendly manner as they made their way to the fourth grade room. Things were fine.Year three was where things began changing. Ralph had transferred schools. I was sad to see him go, until on the first day of my third year- there he was again- outside of my door with that damn class assignment sheet. I was beyond perplexed and called my colleague over to try and clear things up.Tyler Capone, the other third grade teacher, was about as much help as you’d expect.“I thought Ralph had transferred” I questioned through gritted teeth.“He did” My colleague’s eyebrows twisted into a perplexing expression. Why was he staring at me likeIwas the crazy one?“So, why is he standing right here?”Ralph looked up at me, blank expression on his face.“Oh, that’s Ryan. They look kind of similar”I looked at the sheet again. At second glance and in the blink of an eye, the sheethadchanged.ROOM 406 FLOOR 4 MS. DEGONIA RYAN MANHATTAN“They have the same last name, too?” I spat out, eyeing the sheet as hard as I could.“They’re probably related or something, I mean come on, you got ‘em mixed up yourself, Brooke!”I stared Tyler down, face contorting.“Oh, my bad. I mean come on, you got ‘em mixed up yourself,Ms. Degonia.” He replied, misreading my expression.Taking my silence as an opportunity, Mr. Capone Led Ralph into my classroom.“Cmon in to Ms. Degonia’s class, kiddo. You’re gonna love it there.”I pulled Tyler aside after the kids had settled into their classrooms.“Okay, we’re away from the kids now” I whispered to him, becoming very serious. “You can be honest with me, what’s up with that kid?”Tyler chuckled underneath his breath and placed a comforting hand on my shoulder.“Brooke, you gotta relax. Families are weird.Kidsare weird. I’ve learned to stop sticking my nose where it doesn’t need to be. No one’s dying. Let’s just do our jobs, okay? It’s probably just some random rich people family drama.”I looked up at Tyler and sighed. Maybe Iwasoverdoing it. I had family drama. Some stuff is better left alone.“Yeah, yeah I’ll drop it. For now”I turned back to the kids. Theywereall happy. No one was in danger. This was fine.Iwas fine.This year there were a few major developments. From this point on, Ralph came back each year as a different “R” name paired with the last name “Manhattan”.  Year Four, he was Richie, Year Five, he was Roscoe, and so on and so forth. Something would physically change about him every year as well, but it was so small, if you weren’t paying attention- you’d miss it. His hair would be bone straight one year, then a violent afro the next. He had these obnoxious glasses one year. He went through a year where he had a face full of pimples (that one was particularly unsettling). There was ALWAYS something different and no one seemed to care or notice. This wasclearlya different kid, and I’m being pushy for asking.Another change was Ralph’s in-class behavior. Around years three and four, he became very disruptive. He’d bust into tears in the middle of class, begin scratching at his neck so aggressively he’d bleed, he’d shove other kids over in class, things typically classified as “bad kid” behavior. I wasn’t inexperienced with a disrespectful kid or two, and we usually had a rambunctious one in the class anyways so I wasn’t too thrown off. He’d sit in class, in the back, scarf wrapped around his neck tightly, a grumpy look plastered on his face. He only hung around and talked to me, so I was able to keep him at bay most days.But one day- something changed.Year Five, on the third day of class, he came into class so pitifully exhausted. Head slumped over his shoulders and eyes sunken in. I was immediately concerned and nervously went over to talk to him. Was there abuse going on at home? Where evenwashis home? Who knows what this child is experiencing?I called Roscoe over to my desk.“Hey buddy. How we feeling today?”He remained silent and held his head even lower.“I’m tired of always coming back here, Ms. Degonia.”I was confused, but prepared to answer. Clearly, this kid doesn’t like school. I didn’t believe the whole “endless Manhattan relatives” thing, but (for the sake of my job)(and sanity) I had learned to stop asking questions at this point. I had assumed his condition was some kind of taboo learning disability some ultra rich parents wanted to keep away from the public eye. That, or he’s some freakish lab project.I had a speech prepared in my mind about the wonders of elementary education, and was reaching over to ruffle the hair on his head. As I placed my hand on top of his scalp, A few things immediately disturbed me.He wasabsolutely freezing. He waswet. He wassoft.Pressing down into his scalp was like sinking into quicksand, slowly delving into a deep and endless pit. He seemed unbothered by my hand, which had sunk several inches deep into his frontal cortex. I quickly lifted my hand out of his mop of hair, and suddenly realized my hand was covered in a black liquid.I mumbled curses underneath my breath and wiped off my hand on my blouse.“We need to get you to the nurse,now.”Year Five was a hard one for me. This was my breaking point where I realized the school was absolutely no help. Post nurse visit, Richie was discharged with a severe case of the Flu- Furiously, I rushed to the nurses to protest.When I brought my unnerving news to the nurses, she simply stared at me for several seconds. The subtle smile faded from her face, and her eyes went glassy.“It’s a classic case of the Flu.”“Do you think I’m stupid? This is some fucked up stuff going on. Have we contacted his parents? Does he have any? Ralph, Richie, Roscoe… whoever this kid is, he’s not, you know, the way a kid is supposed to be!” I felt like the room was spinning. Was I insane? I looked at the black stain on my hand. No, this was real.The nurse said nothing. The resting smile returned to her face and she continued on with her day as usual.I was yelling at full volume now.“I don’t know what thefuckis going on, and I’ve tried to keep my damn mouth shut, but I’m not doing this. There is something wrong about that kid, and I don’t want any part of it. Keep your money, I want out. I quit!”I had assumed that would work. Despite the fact that I would be losing the job I loved, i felt free that afternoon driving home from work- freer than I had in years, and freer than I would be for years to come.The next morning I woke up in my classroom, at my desk. My class was in front of me- faces smiling and ready for the day. My immediate instinct was to stand up, bolt for the door or window, and scream for help. But, I couldn’t. It was like my body was forcing me to get up and step over to the white board. I picked up my pen and began to write the agenda for the day. I gained control of my body for a brief moment and forced my head to turn back around at the class.Hewas in the corner, staring back at me. Black, beady eyes burning into my head. His legs were stretched and decomposing, and his arms were almost deconstructed. It looked fake. Like a glitch on a computer game. I thought it might have been my imagination at the time, but his foot was merging with the floor itself .That being said, none of it compared to this face. It was stiff, stretched back, and pale as a sheet of paper. The slits of his eyes peeled open permanently and his mouth hanging slightly ajar.He looked downright plastic.Evidently Soulless.And yet, I couldn’t resist looking at him.END OF PT. 1",
