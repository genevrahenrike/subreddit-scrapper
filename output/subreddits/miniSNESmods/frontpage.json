      "content_preview": "So for context. Back then I used hakchi to install all types of games (snes, genesis, nes) on my SNES mini. But that was long ago. Ever since then, I don't have my original pc anymore. I have backed up the hakchi app and folder I had on an external drive. The only problem is, I have two of them (hakchi 2 and hakchi 3) and I don't remember which I used. I'm a bit worried for a few reasons. One, I should check what version of hakchi I used, but I don't know how to check it. I think I used hakchi 2, but unsure. Is there a way to check with the system itself? Another thing that might be more important - knowing I don't have the original PC with me, would it be safe to use my SNES mini on hakchi, without it wiping away my imported games AND suspend points? The suspend points are pretty important for me. I remember I backed them up once, but now I don't know how to check them without having to use the app, which I'm afraid to do in case I do something wrong and all my games and save states are gone. Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I’ve been stuck on this for 2 days trying to mod my SNES Mini with Hakchi CE v3.9.3 and keep running into the same error: Here’s what I’ve tried so far: Installed Hakchi CE v3.9.3, always running as admin. Installed libusbK (3.1.0.0) via Zadig in flash mode. Device Manager shows Nintendo Classic under libusbK USB Devices when plugged in. Tried multiple USB ports (USB 2.0 + USB 3.0), direct cable, no hubs. Uninstalled/reinstalled drivers (libusbK, libusb-win32, WinUSB) multiple times. Disabled antivirus/firewall, removed RAV VPN. Multiple console resets (hold reset, unplug/plug back in). Current issue: Hakchi detects nothing during Kernel → Dump Original Kernel or Install/Repair . Error always says “Can’t open device,” with the WaitForFelOrMembootableShell line. System info: Windows 11 Hakchi CE v3.9.3 libusbK 3.1.0.0 driver SNES Mini (PAL / Europe) At this point, I’ve followed every guide and tried everything I could find on YouTube/forums. Any ideas what’s blocking communication? Is there some driver conflict I’m missing? Thanks in advance for any advice — I’m losing my mind over this.",

Tengo una SNES Classic Mini que hasta ahora, con el Hakchi 3.9.3 (portable) en un ordenador de Windows 10 y con en cable USB original, había podido configurar y cargarle juegos sin ningún problema. Ahora he cambiado el ordenador y tengo Windows 11, y el mismo Hakchi portable ya no me reconoce en ningún momento la consola, me pone Fuera de línea siempre haga lo que haga. El Windows 11 sí parece reconocer la consola, me aparece en el Administrador de dispositivos > Dispositivos USB como \"classic\". Parece que el problema es el Hakchi. Hasta ahora he probado sin éxito: Usar una descarga nueva de Hakchi portable. Reinstalar Kernel (parece que lo hace, pero en el momento en que dice que hay que reiniciar la consola, da un mensaje avisando de que no la detecta). Conectar en otro puerto USB. Deshabilitar cortafuegos No se me ocurre nada más. No sé si es un problema de compatibilidad del Hakchi con Windows 11, u otra cosa que se me escapa. Cualquier ayuda que me podáis dar os lo agradeceré mucho. Un saludo.",

Now, the games section is completely empty and every time I start hakchi I get an error message. I plugged in the snes mini and usb to try and fix it but failed. After unplugging everything again, and connecting the mini and usb to my tv they started acting weird, although now seem to work completely fine with everything inctact. I don't think I'm able to add games anymore with hakchi missing all of the games and folders I previously had. I'm thinking about completely resetting hakchi and the console and starting over again, but I'm no expert in that process and need advice on any other options, specifically the restore original games option.

      "content_preview": "To start off, my son & I were initially enjoying playing almost 300 (NES & SNES) games on my SNES Classic.  I have the RetroArch emulator installed.  Wanting to play some N64 games on it as well, I did a little research, and just recently installed the Mupen64Plus Xtreme on it, along with three N64 games.  Gauntlet Legends and Majora's Mask (Zelda) were two of these games.  Both games loaded up without a problem.  The problem was that there was no input response from my controller for these N64 games. After asking A.I. (Grok 3) what to do, it told me to go into the RetroArch settings and try checking out/changing a few things. (*Note: I only changed one thing at a time - restarting the console so that, if something didn't work, I could always change it back.) I realized I made a mistake when, after following the instruction to 'Reset the configuration settings back to the default settings', I could no longer play any of my games.  The games will load up without a problem. They are just no longer receiving any input from my controller. Upon starting the console, it would always let me know in the upper left-hand corner that the 'Clovercon Controller is plugged into Port #0'.  Now that message no longer appears. I have Hakchi CE (v3.9.3) installed on my laptop.  Everytime I try to dump the kernel (saving a copy of it to my computer) and the message pops up saying 'Unplug the power USB cable, turn the mini on, hold Reset, etc, it will not proceed properly.  The mini will turn on and load up as it should if I plug it directly into a receptacle (it shows all of my games, etc), but it's not letting me complete the process of dumping the kernel. I actually have three questions.  1) Is it even necessary for me to save a copy of the kernel since it was already flashed with the RetroArch emulator? 2) Is it possible to accidentally delete/erase the original SNES games that came with the console? 3) How can I minimize the damage done by restoring my ability to resume playing my games again - along with the N64 games that I just installed - without messing things up any further? Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hello. I modded my console in 2018. USB-host, and some games from the consoles in the title. It’s been working like a charm ever since and I haven’t felt the need to mess with it. Now I have a son who likes to play retro games with a happy father. 😄 I attempted to add some NES games and at first I didn’t even remember how to hook it up to the computer correctly. Eventually I realized the OTG-lead with USB drive had to be unplugged for it to be recognized by hakchi. I have a new install of hakchi ce v3.93 on a different computer than the one I modded the console with. I have moved the config, dump and game folder over. The problem now is that when starting any of the games from NES, genesis or PSX the screen goes dark and immediately opens up the menu again. The cores I initially had that are relevant were the following: Core_genesis_plus_gx_v_1_7_4a Core_snesx2016_v1_54_1a _km_pcsx_rearmed_neon_5_12_18 Hakchi_retroarch_neo_v1_7_1d I have tried to replace the retroarch with Official_Retroarch_v1_7_6 Added a core for NES (didn’t need one before though) Core_fxeumm Now when trying a NES game I sometimes see a starting screen for the game before it returns to the menu. If I start the game repeatedly the game is still on in the background and I can maneuver around a bit before eventually the screen goes black and I have to kill the power to restart the console. I can do the same with PSX. I chose each game in hakchi and manually chose the pcsx_rearmed core and for example final fantasy 9 could be started by starting it twice. What to do? Start over from the beginning? I have wanted to dabble with some N64 games as well but I can’t start adding things before I get the old stuff working again. One other problem is that previously the save data and save states were stored on the console. Whenever I have the USB-host connected hakchi created a save folder on the USB-drive and it looks for the saves there now where there is none. I synchronized all but the PSX games to the console so as long as the USB-host is disconnected all the SNES games with in game saves and save states are working. I’ve been looking through the KFMD’s mod hub but honestly I’m a bit overwhelmed. Where to start if do a fresh install.",

      "content_preview": "Hello! I wanted to post on here because I’ve recently found interest in modding my SNES Classic (European version) that I got from 2019. The potential of adding games that were snubbed of being featured in the main catalog of snes classics made me want to start. I have experience with modding my Wii, 2DS, and DS consoles. But I have a couple questions before modding my SNES classics. So I’m aware that SNES classics have 518gb of storage, but more than half of its storage is for the console itself. I don’t plan on going crazy with games I download. I mainly want to download a lot of SNES games, not the whole library, but ones im interested in, and rom hacks. Would this be enough storage for the console itself, or should I invest in a USB host, and what size flash drive should I invest in? Thank you for reading",
