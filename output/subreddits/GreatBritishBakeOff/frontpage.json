      "content_preview": "So I rewatched Series 8 to 15 when newly postpartum a few months ago and in one of the episodes one of the bakers made a cake that had literally all my OH's favourite ingredients in it. Problem is, I can't remember who or in what season. My OH has a birthday coming up and I'd love to figure out who it was to see if the recipe is available. To the best of my memory, it was a female baker. It may have been a showstopper, or a signature later in the series. There was peanut butter frosting involved and either maple or pecans...perhaps even a banana bread based cake. I know it's so vague but if anyone happens to know what the cake was I'd be eternally grateful! Edit: You are all amazing thank you so much. It was Dana's Gracie cake. I'll be making it but not in the shape of a dog!",

      "content_preview": "Hey fellow Bake Off fans! The wait is officially over ‚Äî the BSL trailer for The Great British Bake Off Series 16 has been released, and it‚Äôs available right now on Channel 4 streaming and linear TV. This is such an exciting step for accessibility in TV, and it means that Deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers can now fully enjoy the tent drama, the cake disasters, and the iconic showstoppers. If you want to watch the trailer right away, here‚Äôs the link to Channel 4 streaming: http://channel4.com/programmes/the-great-british-bake-off-signed/on-demand/78599-001 Series 16 with BSL starts next Tuesday , 2nd September, and will run every Tuesday for 10 weeks at 8pm. The show will air on 4seven, so you can watch it live with full BSL interpretation. Here are the channel numbers so you don‚Äôt miss it: Freeview 49 SkyQ 137 Virgin 143 Sky Glass 163 Freely 16 Freesat 127 This is a huge deal because Bake Off isn‚Äôt just a baking competition; it‚Äôs a cultural institution. For many, it‚Äôs a weekly ritual‚Äîgathering with friends, family, or community to cheer for their favorite bakers, gasp at the technical challenges, and of course, celebrate the showstopping bakes. Having BSL included means that everyone can participate in that shared experience, which is fantastic progress for inclusivity on mainstream TV. The trailer itself already gives us a glimpse of the upcoming season‚Äôs energy. We see the bakers‚Äô personalities shining through, the creative cakes, and of course, the tension that makes GBBO so beloved. Even if you‚Äôve watched previous seasons, this new trailer reminds us why the show continues to capture hearts year after year. I‚Äôm personally setting my reminders for next Tuesday and every Tuesday after that. Who else is excited to watch Series 16 in full BSL ? Let‚Äôs start a discussion here‚Äîwho do you think will shine in the tent this year, and which technical challenges are you hoping they get?",

      "content_preview": "Some great news to share with the community here ‚Äî I reached out to Channel 4 about whether the signed version of The Great British Bake Off would be continuing this year, and they‚Äôve confirmed in writing (email at 9:57am this morning ) that it absolutely will. For those who rely on it, the signed version of GBBO (with BSL signing and subtitles) will once again be available on 4Seven in the same time slot and format as the previous two years. That means: üìÖ Air time & date Every Tuesday at 8pm , in parallel with the main show. Starts from Tuesday 2nd September 2025 . üì° Channel numbers for 4Seven Freeview: 49 Sky Q: 137 Virgin: 143 Sky Stream / Sky Glass: 163 Freesat: 127 üåê Streaming availability The signed episodes will also be uploaded to the Channel 4 streaming app and the official Channel 4 website , giving people even more options to access them if live broadcast isn‚Äôt convenient. This is basically a continuation of what we‚Äôve had in 2023 and 2024 , so if you‚Äôve been used to finding the signed version in that time slot on 4Seven, nothing changes for 2025. That consistency is really valuable, especially for people who rely on signed broadcasts to follow along in real time with the rest of the Bake Off community. Honestly, I think this is a small but very positive piece of news. Too often, accessibility options end up being delayed, cut back, or treated as an afterthought. But in this case, Channel 4 are keeping things steady and ensuring that the signed version of The Great British Bake Off stays visible, accessible, and on schedule. So here‚Äôs the summary: Confirmed by Channel 4 at 9:57am today Signed version will continue on 4Seven Airs Tuesdays at 8pm, starting 2nd September 2025 BSL signing and subtitles included Same arrangement as 2023 and 2024 Available via TV (Freeview, Sky, Virgin, Freesat, etc.) and streaming I‚Äôve included the official promo image in this post so you can see the visual info as well. https://preview.redd.it/gbbo-signed-confirmed-to-return-on-4seven-this-year-full-v0-23ymwkhtgekf1.png",

Whether you‚Äôve tried making it at home or buying it/tried it if visiting the UK? Anecdotally my American uni friends went utterly mad for homemade Bakewell tart after I made one for a bake sale (the type of tart from the technical challenge in 2016 Pastry Week S7E5), and equally love a steamed pudding (though only one of them liked it with custard) Question also goes for anyone from any other country outside the UK too (or even any other Brits who discovered something new they didn‚Äôt know about before)",

However, these are the names of people taking part in the next series of Celebrity Bake Off. Molly Mae Hague, Mark Wright, Vicky Pattison, Jojo Siwa, Rose Ayling Ellis, Ambika Mod, Edith Bowman, Mutya Buena, Nella Rose, Rag N Bone Man, Babatunde Aleshe, Emmett Scanlan, Rose Matafeo and Jon Richardson. Has anyone heard of any other people participating? Prue's replacement next year is Cherish Finden. I gather that on the back of this year's Family Showdown, we may have some special episodes next year. We probably will have a second chance episode featuring past contestants and maybe a reality special. Also, I wonder if we will also have a celebrity Christmas special which will tape seperately and feature Prue as judge.",
