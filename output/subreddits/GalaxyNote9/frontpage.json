      "content_preview": "My S22 Ultra just started freezing up on me last week. Went through the emotions of not wanting to pay off another cell phone, and wasn't sure if they'd insure it. By the weekend it was brick; turns out the insurance replacement was only $5, but I won't get it for another week, so I went back to my note 9, and I don't hate the experience on it. It took a few hours to update everything to where my life's at now. There's some aspects of the older style graphics I like on it. Cameras I won't get to play with until next week with work. I sorta like the hand feel more as I play with the 2. Depending on how next week goes the replacement s22 ultra might go in the drawer as back up.",

      "content_preview": "I bought my Note 9 brand new in April of 2021. Fast forward to now, this thing STILL holds up without a problem! Occasionally a year after owning it, I'd end up switching to newer mid-rage/budget phones, but when those began failing and I needed a temporary replacement phone, my Note 9 came crawling right back into my life. In December, my Moto Razr Ultra's screen broke, and I had to use my Note 9. What was supposed to be only one month, turned into MONTHS of me daily driving it, and I'm not complaining! I love it's back camera design, in fact the thought of switching over to a new phone without the same beautiful design hurts! Surprisingly the battery still holds up as well! It has it's fair share of flaws like scratched up frame, rear cracked glass, the S pen snapped in half when I was a freshman in High School (Fun fact, I graduated high school this year with the same phone!) so I replaced it with a non-Bluetooth S pen (2 years later, lol). The screen has a screen burn-in issue which I've been needed to fix for some time now so that the screen feels nicer to look at, but It's not server. One UI 2.5 on it felt comfortable until I compared it side by side to my sister's Galaxy A53 5G after she got the One UI 7 update and WOW does it look outdated! I made good use of launchers to get a little taste of One UI 7 though! The cameras are decent, in fact I LOVE them since when taking selfies they hide some of my facial imperfections, lol! The point is that they're decent and the photos I take with them are still stunning, but that's just MY opinion. The main thing I love however, (aside from the design) is the headphone jack and Micro SD support! I think I made the right move by getting the model with 512gb of storage and 8gb of RAM because even after all this time, the phone doesn't feel slow or anything. A lot of apps that I use daily are still supported although my personal banking app doesn't work on the Note 9, but I think I'm fine with that! Overall, I'm in love with the Note 9, and while I am still thinking of maybe upgrading (possibly to my sister's A53 5g), I still plan to use this beauty until it dies. That's IF it dies, haha. https://preview.redd.it/note-9-refuses-to-die-v0-3i7fqeoh18kf1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/note-9-refuses-to-die-v0-l7g3teoh18kf1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/note-9-refuses-to-die-v0-ctnuwdoh18kf1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/note-9-refuses-to-die-v0-2ufkupoh18kf1.jpg The button on the cheap S pen replacement I bought feel off and got lost somewhere, lol.

Context: I took off my note 9's back cover (it had a tiny hairline crack, so broke while I took it off...). Its a spare phone and I can wait a while. I'm waiting for my aftermarket battery and need to order a new cover now. Also will those replacement covers online be the same quality as the original??",

      "content_preview": "Sad to see as the front page is filled with tons of posts saying farewell to this beautiful machine. And I thought I was about to make the same post. Yesterday my Note 9 won't charge, and it shows that there are moisture in the charging port. I didn't take it to shower and it wasn't near any body of water in days and was wondering where the heck could the moisture comes from. Sure as heck I didn't make it too excited that it become moist but whatever... I tried sticking a safety pin clothed in tissue paper to clean the port. Some smudges and dirty mark here and there but it still won't charge. Tried blowing with hairdryer in cool. It didn't work Cleaned it up with isopropyl alcohol. It didn't work Gently bang the fuck out of it for the dirt and water (if any) to drop. It didn't work. Sucked the hole hard like I was playing Harmonica. It didn't work However the wireless charging still works so I left it charging whole night. I woke up with it being fully charged, however the moisture notification is still there. Tried pegging it once again, didn't work. So I decided to take it to the Service Center after I get off from work. As the phone is turned now on, I tried clearing cache method. And guess what? It didn't work. It's still showing that it's moist. So the whole day at the office I tried to preserve its battery. Didn't watch Youtube on it. Didn't play games on it. Didn't text my baby mama and she's worried all day. Then during lunchtime, I just tried for the last time to clean the port. Grabbed a paperclip, clothed it in a tissue and start putting it in. I moved the clip nice and slowly, rubbing the walls of the hole. I makes sure it glides and pokes any crevices. Tap it once and twice. Then changed the tissue, and put it in slowly, and start rubbing it, in-and-out. Shit you not, the moisture notification goes away. it stopped being moist. Like I'm almost get insulted that it becomes dry after all those attempts. But I'm actually happy that it stopped showing the moist notification. I pegged it to check... ...and it charged. Holy shit. It lives another day. December 2018 and still going strong.",

I then restarted my phone again, and upon doing this noticed that it had stopped giving me notifications over the time it was open. I tried to use google, but it is registering that I'm holding things when I am tapping and only opens the keyboard about 50% of the time. Managed to get half of something in, to which there were no noticeable loading troubles upon searching, then turned my phone off, tried turning it back on but it was being very slow, now it has given up on turning on, but when I hold the power button it vibrates and lets me get about halfway to a full power off. What is happening?? Is there anything I can do to fix it or is the phone unusable now? Thanks for the help.",

      "content_preview": "Hey, so i've been using an old note 9, and while the back camera is broken, the front camera works just fine. the problem is, that when i open the camera app, the entire thing freezes and eventually displays \"camera failed\". So even though the front camera works, I cant use it in the camera app because the interface freezes before I am able to switch the the front camera. Can i configure this so it opens the front camera by defualt, its incredibly frustrating to deal with this stupid software PS. other apps that open the front facing camera by default(facebook, snapchat etc) work without issue",

Early this morning, on my S25 Ultra, 1Password updated through the Galaxy Play Store without any issue. But on my Samsung Note 9, 1Password (despite many tries) fails to update. On my Note 9, I deleted the cache from 1Password, the Google Play Store, and then restarted my Note 9. The 1Password update still could not install. Could it be because the Samsung Note 9 is too old, and 1Password is no longer compatible? UPDATE Aug. 12, '25: So after a couple of days, 1PASSWORD was finally able to update to the latest version on my Note 9. But now 2 other apps won't update: Files by Google, Google Drive. So the issue I had in updating 1PASSWORD is not specific to 1PASSWORD, but something having to do with my Note 9 (software too old?).",
