As such, I was wondering if, to the people who watch PhilosophyTube, especially those with a philosophy background, whether you agree with this sentiment that there could be something valuable and unique in Jordan Peterson‚Äôs ideas that could be salvaged.",

      "content_preview": "(I'm coming here right from re-watching the Rich have their own Ethics video. I also don't really watch MrBeast, I'm just going off of what Abby said about him. If it's been discovered since this game out that he's an abuser or something I'm not endorsing that). So having finished Abby's video, I'm left with the conclusion that I don't actually see any sort of problem with what MrBeast does, like when he pays for 1000 blind people to have operations to see. Even though I don't think for a moment that Beast actually sees these people as people , and instead just sees/uses them as content. Even if he's an unkind, uncaring sociopath who uses the poor for views, I think his channel is a good thing because at least now, there are 1000 people who can see who couldn't before. And like, isn't this the same kind of standard left wing argument? We always say \"It doesn't matter if you intended to be or say a racist thing, what matters is that you did a racism.\" Well shouldn't that apply here? It doesn't if you cared about, or intended to improve these people's lives. What matters is you did improve them/help them? Politics, or anything that makes the world better is NOT a friend group. I probably wouldn't like MrBeast in person, but I still think what he's doing is good even if it ironically feels gross because of how utterly exploitative it is. Just like I imagine that I probably would not get along with most of you here, but I'd want to work with/endorse your causes, cause I imagine we have most of the same values - pro-choice, pro-trans, pro-workers, anti-right wing, pro-climate justice, etc. I know there is an argument to be made for \"Actually we should try to change and challenge the systems that produce these inequalities in the first place.\" Which is true, however I think none of us think that means that we should only focus on funding policy change or revolution, and forget about things like feeding the poor or curing the sick after all.",

But also I love the ORDAAAAAAA in the background whenever she says something controversial (I miss John Bercow, he made British politics fun) and I love any news segment that has little joke news headlines that scroll by. But also as a cis male, I think about Rome at least once a day and I loved the nod to how Caesar became Caesar. Like yes his argument could be poked holes in, and considering he was arguing against Cicero, one of the greatest orators Rome ever had, it‚Äôs no surprise he lost. But the speech was mainly an excuse to get to Caesars point that executing people set a bad precedent for the stability of the republic. Because if you knew you‚Äôd be killed if you failed, why accept any peace settlement, it‚Äôs either all or nothing. This was one of Caesars greatest insights, that it‚Äôs better to make your enemies your friends, despite how brutal his campaign in Gaul was there‚Äôs multiple instances he pardoned entire tribes and seamlessly integrated them into the empire. And famously he pardoned everyone who fought against him in the civil war, because he didn‚Äôt want to create more instability, he believed that by placating his enemies there‚Äôd be no more reason to fight and there‚Äôd be peace, he was wrong, but still. I wouldn‚Äôt really compare him to Darth Vader, I think that‚Äôs a little harsh. But his speech in favor of exile as opposed to execution really did set Caesar on his path of going from an idealist to a pragmatist. That you can be right, but if you don‚Äôt have  power that doesn‚Äôt mean anything.",

      "content_preview": "I was watching a video about Breadtubers who've failed to advocate for Palestine and PhilosophyTube was brought up. I thought, \"that's not right, they just made a video about Native American genocide, and KJB has mentioned the genocide.\" Then I remembered, I think it's just Devon who brought up the genocide (correct me if I'm wrong). But again, I've been watching Abigail for years, I can't see how she wouldn't be Pro-Palestine. Then I remembered Anthony Fantano, a music Youtuber who has constantly brought up that Israel is committing a genoicide. And Xiran Jay Zhao, a author and largely former Youtuber who has multiple links to Pro-Palestine fundraisers on her Youtube page. And then looking through this subreddit I saw a post from over a tear ago where Abigail says she's working on a video about genocide. And like, yeah, that would cover it, but it's not quite the same thing. There are still people on the left who don't know Zionists have been trying to make their own colony for centuries, they originally wanted it in Africa. People who don't know that oranges were a symbol of Palestinian pride, the fucking Jaffa cakes literally came from a Palestinian city, and now Israel has coopted that cultural icon by using the land they stole. And it hurts, because even if it's not a full PhilosophyTube video, it could be a live stream fundraiser, a public donation, shouting out and platforming the many Palestinian content creators who swim in the same water as Abigail. I do not know Abigail, and she is not some enlightened philosopher queen that will have the perfect take to change all Zionists minds. But she is famous, and she has a massive platform, and even if it's just the comfort of someone that important saying \"I hear your pain, I see your suffering, I stand with you and support you.\" Think of what that could do. To quote Nina Simmone, another progressive and brilliant female artist: \"An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned, is to reflect the times. I choose to reflect the times and the situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty.\"",

      "content_preview": "Just read this paper and it kind of messed with how I think about AI. Not in the usual ‚Äúrobots are coming‚Äù way, but more in a philosophical and kind of intimate sense (I've tried chatgpt as a therapist). The paper uses Heidegger's ‚Äúready-to-hand‚Äù idea where tools are just background stuff we use without thinking. That‚Äôs how we usually treat digital machines: as things we wield, not things we dwell with. But this paper pushes back hard on that and says AI and other machines aren‚Äôt just tools anymore and that they‚Äôre becoming co-agents in the messy ecosystems of human life. We‚Äôre not just using AI to crunch numbers‚Äîwe‚Äôre partnering with it in deeply personal, embodied ways: in healthcare, sexual desire, emotional support, even creativity. The examples are brief but striking, and the argument is basically this: we need to stop thinking of machines as passive instruments and start thinking of them as co-dwellers, shaping and being shaped by the worlds we all live in. What I found especially compelling is that it‚Äôs more of a philosophical provocation: What does it mean when the boundaries between \"intelligent\" machines and flesh blur? What happens when AI stops being ‚Äúused‚Äù and starts becoming part of how we dwell in the world? If you're into Heideggers take on technology this one is worth a read. And if you‚Äôve been feeling like the usual ‚ÄúAI ethics‚Äù convos are a bit flat or overly instrumental, this offers something weirder and maybe more \"real.\" Curious what others here think. Are we ready to stop calling AI a tool and start thinking of it as a a thing living alongside us? https://www.jstor.org/stable/27348735?seq=1",

      "content_preview": "Sorry, I know I'm basically necroposting a four-year old video, but I recently argued with someone irl about the death penalty (since it's been rather topical with recent media narratives) and parroted the story of Andrew Brunning that Thorn mentions in her video . I figured it was sound because it's a Philosophy Tube video and because there are a bunch of spoon jokes later on in the video. But when I was challenged on the example, I could do little else than point at the video as my source, which is not great , so I've been trying to look into this and... did he actually swing? Covering the basics, the exact claim Thorn makes is: A lot of the new capital crimes where non-violent offences against property, like in 1801 a 13 year old homeless boy named Andrew Brunning was publicly hanged for stealing a spoon. Looking up the most likely source ( \"Brian P. Block & John Hostettler, Hanging in the Balance\" ), I found this on page 22 (you can find in the preview here ): On 18 January 1801 The Times reported that an urchin of 13 named Andrew Brunning was sentenced to death for stealing a spoon from a house. And there's this article from TIME, which states: In 1801, for example, Andrew Brenning, 13, was hanged for breaking into a house and stealing a spoon. And even found records from the Old Bailey , confirming that an Andrew Branning, 13, was sentenced to death for stealing a spoon on 14th January 1801: ANDREW BRANNING was indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling-house [...] and stealing a silver desert spoon [...] GUILTY, Death , aged 13. Except that this links to this page , which includes records of him being sent to a penal colony for a life term in lieu of execution on account of his youth and good behaviour. Now, I'm not defending the British justice system of 1801: he was sentenced to death and then sent to a penal colony for 21(?) years for stealing a spoon, which is unfathomably excessive, but this was not what was claimed. The claim was that he was publicly hanged... and yet I cannot find a record of a hanging for him (or the various spellings of his name) here or here . Was he actually hanged? EDIT The transportation record link is broken, but I found it here , which states an Andrew Branning arrived in Queensland in 1802: Andrew Branning, one of 272 convicts transported [...] Convicted at Middlesex Gaol Delivery for a term of life on 14 January 1801. And the Old Bailey reference includes that he was convicted by \"Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Baron Graham.\" EDIT 2 Also found this article in the student-operated McGill Law Journal which states: In 1801 Andrew Brenning, aged 13, was publicly hanged for stealing a spoon. And this Tehran Times article that repeats the claim: That is why, in 1801, thirteen-year-old Andrew Brenning was publicly hanged for breaking into a house by forcing the entrance and then stealing a spoon. But I'm noticing that all the sources stating he was hanged spell his name with an \"e\". EDIT 3 Found this within \"Penal Methods of the Middle Ages: Criminals, Witches, Lunatics\" : Thus through the ambitions of private members and the general callousness of the ruling class, the number of capital offences kept ever growing, until, in theory, there were more than two hundred of them. The law, however, had overreached; rough and often most brutal as the people of that day were, they would not enforce the penalties provided, so that the hangman‚Äôs ministrations were invoked for only twenty-five classes of offences in London, and for not more than thirty throughout England. In fact, it was found that conscientious people refused to prosecute for the lesser crimes, dreading to have a share in taking life. But actually the gallows load was heavy; an instance appeared in a Times paragraph‚Äî18th January 1801‚Äîwhich tells how a certain Andrew Branning, a luckless urchin aged only thirteen, had broken into a house and carried off a spoon. Others were with him, but they ran away, and only he was captured and brought to trial. His story ended in two words, which were short and customary: Guilty‚ÄîDeath. Thus transportation and the extreme penalty kept clearing the prisons... Which heavily implies with its \"But actually the gallows load was heavy\" and \"His story ended in two words\" that he was hanged? EDIT 4 Okay, have I just stumbled onto my own version of this and this ? EDIT 5 Found this in the National Archives: Also letter of 9 September from Flynn enclosing the petition to the Home Secretary of Andrew Branning (in his 12th year) and John Branning (in his 17th year), convicts on board the hulks, lying at Langston Harbour, near Portsmouth. The convicts were tried and convicted at the Old Bailey, Middlesex, in February 1801, for burglary of a silver spoon at the house of Sarah Dane in Oxford Road and were sentenced to death. This sentence was mitigated to transportation for life. Really starting to think that Andrew Branning was not publicly hanged given that all records seem to show that his sentence was switched to transportation. All the sources stating that he was hanged have this eerily similar phrasing, nor do they give any information as to where or when he was hanged - they just state that he was publicly hanged. Sidenote, this National Archives source also spells his name as \"Andrew Brannan\", like, this poor kid who experienced getting sentenced to death for stealing cutlery has a last name based on nothing but vibes xD",

The ones I noticed: Potawatomi, Chippewa, and Iroquois (and I expect someone in the youtube comments to point out that Iroquois is not their real name). Otherwise I enjoyed the video, especially Jonathan Frakes reading Jefferson's letters, sometimes as Dark Jefferson. If you're wondering, she said Potawa'TOmi instead of Pota'WAtomi, Chippeway, and Irokwah. I guess the google result says Irokwah, but I've only ever heard Ear uh coy. And they call themselves Haudenosaunee (HOdennoSHOnee) and prefer that anyway, but historical records will call them Iroquois.",
