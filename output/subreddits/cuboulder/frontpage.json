      "content_preview": "It’s a couple weeks until move in and many of you freshmen are poised to descend on the CU campus to begin what we hope will be a happy, successful, and quick stay void where prohibited, not valid in DC, AK, or HI, some exceptions apply at the home of the Buffs! In the vein of years past, we’re here to make sure you compromise on one of those adjectives above, max.  Preferably zero.  But at most one, for sure. I’m u/rijnzael , your not-so-benevolent-autocrat, why-is-he-still-here alum/mod, bringing you this year’s inaugural weekly exceptions definitely apply, void about half the time thread.  So, without further ado… Welcome to CU! I’m sure you’ve heard the spiel about this being you embarking on the first step toward your independence, how these are the moments that will define a lot of your life, so on and so forth, etc.  And while that’s a little dramatic, it’s true, and being successful in college will make your life a lot easier.  Fortunately, we’ve got this broken down in an easy step by step list.  This thread is geared toward freshmen, but this applies to transfer students and returning students too.  Read, upvote, downvote, check out the rules , feel free to comment or make a new post with any/all questions you might have , edit your flair right on over there --------------------> buckle your seatbelts, and enjoy your trip! Step 1) Prepare for Move In The next thing you’re going to have to do to be a CU Buff is move your stuff from wherever it is right now to a place pretty darn close to the 40th parallel, aka the CU campus.  People tend to overdo this, so here are some pointers: If it’s something you’re not going to use at least once a month, do you really need it? Laundry facilities are there for a reason, wash your clothes instead of bringing every t-shirt you’ve ever bought Hangers are far easier at keeping things tidy than folding and putting into drawers, consider your limited closet and drawer space and figure out what you really want to use each for Whatever you bring is going to have to go with you, so pack light That said, there is a list of essentials: Computer (ask if you need help picking) Fan (you and your roommate only need one per room) Laundry supplies Toiletries Winter wear Backpack/bag Clothes and hangers Water bottle Basic school supplies, like notebooks, folders, pencils, and pens for each class If you’re bringing a bike, bring a sturdy U-lock made of stainless steel, and a chain to lock the additional wheel to the U-lock. There’s more, but the mantra of using it at least once a month applies.  If it’s in your current routine, keep it.  Snowboard and skis?  Sure.  Winter shell that doubles as a rain jacket?  Absolutely.  Posters? You’ll look at those everyday.  Easter decorations?  Lol, no. There will also be some audibles called by the Housing folks during move-in week, so you will want to stay up-to-date on your CU email and keep track of what’s going on that way.  Haven’t already?  Get on it—you probably have so much email.  Do that and then keep doing it, from now on, forever. Also, don’t bring this stuff Finally, some of you may be bringing your favorite 30 rack of beer, drug paraphernalia, or preferred strain of marijuana, and I’m not turning this into a thread critical of what is surely a favorite pastime, but it may be wise to do this when RAs, police, and Housing big wigs aren’t scrambling all over the dorms helping people with move in.    Questions about this?  Ask as a comment.  Or don’t, you’re an adult that gets to make adult decisions with adult consequences.  Want to know what they are? Ask in the comments. During move-in, make sure to wear closed toe shoes, as you’re going to be scooting stuff around and moving furniture, and it’s not a fun experience to get stepped on or have a cabinet dropped on your foot, and far less so with your toes exposed.  Also, wear light clothing, because depending on the amount of stuff you’ve got, you might start breaking a sweat.  P.S. that means wear deodorant, please. Logistically, the RAs and Housing folks will make move-in pretty simple.  There will be big signs, you’ll have an assigned move-in time and know where to show up (please don’t show up before then, do hotels let you check in two days early? No, geez), and have designated instructions to follow in this area.  One key thing to note is that you’ll get your Buff OneCard if you don’t already have it.  Make sure to keep this thing on you at all times, as it’s your key to getting dining, getting into your room, getting into the dorms, getting into the rec, getting library books, … the list goes on.  Also, you’ll get your RTD pass.  That’s really important, as it lets you use all the city and regional busses for free.  Oh yeah, don't forget to bring ID, they don't let you pick up identification without already having identification.  Egg before the chicken right, or something? What tips do experienced CU students have in this area?  Leave a comment! Step 2) Make Some Friends This one may sound obvious, but its execution is often lost on people.  It’s a proven fact that people with a big support network of friends in their dorms, classes, and major have higher achievement.  You want to get the best bang for your buck on those student loans, right?  If so, your first priority on getting to the campus should be to make some friends.  Nervous?  Scared?  Don’t know how to go about it?  Well you’re in luck; you’re surrounded by a bunch of people in the same situation in a giant building purpose built for this very thing.  Tips: Offer to help people move their stuff when you’re done, they’ll be really appreciative, and it’s great for introductions! Offer to hang out with people and then follow-through.  Ask questions, get to know people. When you’re in your dorm room and you don’t need privacy, leave your door wide-open.  At the same time, troll the halls on the first days and introduce yourself, ask people questions, talk about your interests, and see if you have common ground.  Basically everyone going to or from Colorado loves the outdoors, pro-tip. When you get to class, do the same stuff.  If you hit it off with someone, get their deets: Instagram, cell #, email, whatever!  That why you can actually follow through on things. Have nothing to do?  Wrong, you can study.  But better, you can study in shared spaces in your dorm, at the C4C, newfound favorite coffee shop, wherever. Studied out, or literally have no homework?  Try to arrange fun stuff to do with your newfound friends.  There will be a ton of activities during move-in week and the first week of classes, and these are great ways to have fun and make friends.  Pay attention to your school email.  First week activities are actually pretty fun, too. CU vets, plz provide your expert friend making tips as a comment. I will note that Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp/Meta is a huge data warehouse that sucks all your and friends’ data into a big evil computer to try and sell you stuff, but it’s sort of indispensable for college students—sorry.  Same with other social apps like Snapchat, Twitter, and and Tik Tok.  You don’t have to be on all these platforms, and it has been shown that they tend to have some negative effects on the self-esteem of college students, but you also don’t want to miss out on the floor-wide invites to do cool stuff.  Actually, you might want to be the person putting those together even!  YMMV, proceed at your own risk. Step 3) Make Sure You’re Set for Housing + Class Housing Stuff Once you’ve started the on-going process of making some friends at CU, you’re now ready to make sure all your ducks are in a row to start class and live in the dorms.  Your RA, bless their heart, is going to drag you to a bunch of stuff they don’t want to do either.  Convocation is where you’re officially welcomed to CU by the school administration, and your RA will communicate to you how this works and what to do.  Your RA will probably also have a floor meeting or some such, to explain expectations for the year and generally just how this housing thing all works, so I won’t reiterate that here.  Just keep in mind that the \"room damage form\" they have you fill out at the beginning of the year will be checked diligently at the end of the year to see if you did anything unbecoming to your dorm room.  If so, expect a bill.  Also, people like lofted bed sometimes, so you might want to check that out here . Class Prep No, the reason you’re here in the first place is to go to class and get an education.  “But wait, what do I need for class?” you respond.  Well, you’ll largely figure that out on the first day.  “Syllabus week” as it is often called is the first week of classes, where instructors hand out the course syllabus (the contract between them and you for how things are graded, what the assignments are, late work policy, …).  This will explain what you need for class if you don’t already know.  Read it at least a couple times for each class, take all that stuff, put it in your preferred calendar, and be ready to stay on top of that pace of stuff for the whole semester.  Likewise, acquire anything you need according to the syllabus by the next class period, end of story. You don’t want to be the only one without a clicker or the clicker app on the second day of class where they take mandatory attendance and dock anyone who didn’t participate.  Make sure to stay on your email, as your instructors may have already made their expectations in this area clear.  If so, their word is gospel if you want to nail an A in their class—so follow through.  Okay, I'm getting a little ahead of myself since you won't have your syllabus yet but remember that stuff.  Continuing on.... You can’t go wrong by bringing the following to all your first week classes: Pencils and pens Notebooks Folders Calendar While it is assumed that everyone will bring a phone and possibly other electronic devices to class, different instructors have different takes here.  Make sure you have your phone’s sound settings under control, and if possible, get an idea of the laptop policy for class ahead of time.  Some instructors do not care about laptops, others consider them the bane of their existence and prohibit them in the classroom.  You do NOT want to be the student your professor makes an example of the first week of class on phone noise, nor the one and only person the whole semester who is told that laptops are prohibited in the classroom. Step 4) Cohabitate Like a Pro See above about making friends.  You want to be your roommate’s friend.  It makes things so much easier, so do everything within reason to make that happen.  If you can’t make that happen, at least be cordial. At the same time, sharing a room in the dorms is sometimes people’s first experience sharing a space with someone else, so here are some tips on discussing expectations with your roommate: Let them know about your sleep schedule and vice versa Talk about room cleanliness and each of your tolerance for clutter Share class schedules so you know when the others will be using the bathrooms (where applicable) For the love of all that is holy, if you have a peanut allergy or some other potentially life threatening medical issue, let your roommate and the hall staff know. Talking about when and where noise is okay and at what level Discussing when and on which days room guests need to leave so you can sleep You should be doing these things on a regular basis: Your own laundry and washing your sheets Cleaning your side of the room, at least so it looks and smells nice Taking the trash out Checking the fridge to make sure there’s nothing unbecoming growing in there Washing your hair Talking to your roommate about how things are going, at least until you have a feel for it You should be doing these things on a daily basis or more frequently: Taking a shower and washing your body Brushing your teeth Putting on deodorant Putting on clean clothes Roommate conflicts often stem from someone not doing things above, and these are the easy things that you can do to resolve those kinds of tensions.  If you read one of these items and think “hey, that doesn’t really apply to me” then you might be the smelly/dirty/crusty person people talk about.  Don’t be that person—you’ll make more friends and have an easier time with your roommate. What other cohabitation tips do people have?  Leave a comment! Step 5) Go To Class, Study, Wash, Rinse, Repeat Now you’ve got the basics down, you actually need to get to the culmination of all this and finally go to class.  Going to class each and every day is supremely important.  Obviously people get sick, and other stuff happens, but barring one of these dire situations, you should be in class each and every class.  After all, that’s a big chunk of what you’re paying CU for.  Do this stuff to prepare for that: Plan and Dry Run Plan out a routine for each day each week where you’ll get ready, eat, head out, arrive early to your first class, go to other classes, eat lunch, hang around in academic buildings, and head back to the dorms.  Plan to remain most of the day in academic buildings for class and fill any gaps with studying—that way you have time for fun when you get back to the dorms and can avoid distractions at the dorms, as there will be many. Recon some possible favorite study spots, like campus coffee shops Try to execute on your routine.  Head out from your dorm to your first class’s building during move-in week (pro-tip: this is a good activity to engage your dorm buddies in) and actually find the room you need.  Then head to your other buildings from there.  This will help you see how long you need for transit time and whether you might need a bike or longboard or some other such conveyance. Try on your backpack with all the stuff you plan to carry around and see what it will actually feel like.  Last thing you need after your first week is a slipped disc in your neck. Get your school supplies for your first day prepped and put into your backpack.  Make sure not to forget your glasses or contacts: you’ll need them to see the board a lot of times! Room numbers Key info: Your room numbers on your schedule will look something like ECST 1B21, MUEN 300, and so on.  That first chunk of letters is the building code, which abbreviates the building (and sometimes the wing of that building you’ll be in!) and can be found on the campus map.  The second part is the actual floor and room number and tells you where your class will actually be in that building (and building wing).  In the cases above, EC means engineering center, ST means south tower, 1B means first basement (one floor below the main level), and 21 is the room in that section.  Match your room number on your schedule to the room you’ve found and make sure it’s the same: otherwise you might end up in the wrong class.  Other buildings like MUEN only have one building code, but still different floors.  If there's no \"B\" in the room code, then that means the first digit (or two) are indicating the floor number, so MUEN 300 is some big lecture hall on the 3rd floor of Muenzinger (does that even exist? I have no idea). Seniors, grad students, and anyone else with an opinion: what are some favorite places to study, ways to develop a solid routine, and hard to find classrooms that you can help people navigate? Stick to it Once you have your routine ready, put it into practice on your first day.  Get to class early, chat up the instructor if there’s time in advance of class and they seem open to it (but don’t force it), get a good seat, and wait for the class to start.  The instructor will hand out the syllabus and probably start talking.  Listen to what they say and write it down in your notebook, highlight anything on the syllabus that is unclear or add anything to it that the instructor says but doesn’t seem to be reflected on the syllabus, and generally be attentive.  If there are ice breakers in the class, meet your fellow classmates and make friends (see above).  Then, as said earlier, make sure you get anything they say you need for the next class period.  Don’t talk while the instructor is addressing the class—that’s generally considered rude, and you don’t want to be that person who’s called out for interrupting lecture.  Done?  Great, do it again for each of the classes you have, and fill any empty time with studying or getting anything you need to get done for next class. You know that calendar I mentioned earlier?  Put your important class deadlines into it.  Put office hours in your calendar so you know which office hours you can make. Eventually, you’ll memorize your schedule and know where to go for everything and when.  Then you’ll adjust to it and figure out what you need to pay attention to in each class, what needs to be written down, what comments by the prof are random tangents without any applicability, and what the expectations are for you in class.  Keep going with this, intersperse it with turning in homework, taking tests, and doing projects, eating and sleeping, doing all the daily routine stuff I mentioned above in order to keep your roommate happy, and you’ve essentially got class down.  Congratulations, now do it for four or more years and you’ll get yourself a fancy bachelor’s degree. Final note: Go to class.  Seriously.  Each and every one.  Often times there is no mandatory attendance and skipping class won’t immediately impact your grade, but you’ll see it on homeworks and tests so so so much.  I cannot emphasize this enough, so I’ll just make it bold and reiterate that you need to go to class.  I’ll talk more about what can happen if you don’t later.   Professors don't handhold you like high school teachers and aren't evaluated on how well you do in the class, so you need to take personal responsibility to stay on top of class, and you will miss so many hints, minor announcements, extensions, date changes, and otherwise if you miss. What did I miss here?  Leave a comment! Step 6) Have Fun Remember where I said above that you should always fill your slack time with studying during the day so you don’t have much you have to do at the dorms?  Well it’s a good idea, and here’s why.  The dorms are full of people who are your new hall mates and friends who will happily distract you from whatever productive thing you need to do and do fun stuff instead.  And you should. What fun stuff?  Well, here’s a short list: Workout or take classes at the CU Rec Go on some adventures with the CU Rec Hit the slopes and search around for student discounts to Epic and Ikon mountains Hike Bike Climb a 14er Run for student government office Attend CU WelcomeFest or other on-campus concerts Bowl at the UMC Party Go to the club Hit up Red Rocks General shenanigans Date them Random friend-assisted Tinder-swiping sessions Debauchery Get involved Rush a frat Rush a sorority Of course you’ll realistically never fill all your free time during the day with homework, even though I said you should.  You'll eventually fill some slack time during the day with funtivities and hang out with friends in the dorms, and there will be times you have to cram for an exam at night or want to get a study group going with some friends.  That’s all well and good, just whatever routine you come up with, try to stick to it, and make sure to have fun while you’re at it. Buffs in the know, what else do I need to mention?  Leave a comment! Step 7) Adjust The first days after move-in and the first classes are a whirlwind.  You’ve gotta make friends, prepare for class, get a routine down, study, meet your roommate, do all the required activities, and on and on and on.  Well, fortunately, it tapers off and you get into a groove after a bit usually.  Finding that’s not the case?  Adjust! A lot of freshmen come into college thinking they’ve got to stick with their major or jump into a major right away and do exactly what their parents back home tell them.  Nope.  You’re the adult, your name is probably on the loans, and it’ll certainly be your name on the degree.  So if you’re finding this is all too much, dial it back.  This can mean, dropping some classes (aiming to stay above 12 credits to stay full-time), switch to some easier classes, taking more time for yourself, or even switching majors. At the end of the semester, you’re going to be getting graded, and it’s far better to get successful grades in fewer or easier classes, than it is to get non-successful grades in classes.  As you know from high school, your GPA follows you around for your entire college career, and you set the baseline for your GPA in your first semester at CU—so make it count.  If this means switching to some easier classes, so what?  You've got the rest of your college career to take your required classes, and it's preferable to digging yourself out of a GPA-hole instead. Think you're the exception, and you're gonna take all honors and advanced classes your first semester, and your parents and friends are putting all this pressure on you to take the biggest, hardest load possible?  You know you better than I do, and I hope that you do take those classes and excel at them.  But if not, guess what?  It's not the end of the world to drop them and completely change direction if it's not for you.  I've met academically stellar students on full academic engineering scholarships in the honors program figure out it was not going to be for them, or that their real priority first semester was not truly academics and smartly adjust their schedule until they figured it out more.  Remember, making friends is an investment that'll reap dividends your whole CU career.  One okay grade in an honors class first semester?  Think about it. If you need to do any of the above, keep in mind a couple things: Open enrollment, where you can participate in drop/add without worrying about an enrollment quota or appointment starts on August 14 The last day to add is August 29th The last day to drop without a \"W\" grade on your transcript and without tuition/fees is September 5th The last day to drop a class with a \"W\" grade on your transcript and with full tuition and fees October 28st The last day to withdraw from fall semester completely is December 5th Put these down in your calendar as check points, as it gets progressively harder to adjust as these deadlines pass.  The last checkpoint is truly the last opportunity you'll have to not feel significant academic consequences from poor performance in a class.  If you realize you're performing poorly in a course, often times it is better to drop rather than experience the impact on your GPA. Step 8) Plan It Out You don't need to have your whole life planned during your first semester, or even your whole college career, but you should have a rough direction and progressively dial it as you progress through.  I'm not going to try and give you academic or professional career planning advice here, but I will add some food for thought: Next Steps Lots of majors don't pay well out of school, or are barely employable Of those majors, you can increase your chances of getting a good job by getting a graduate (aka master's, doctorate, etc.) degree To get a grad degree, you have to start the whole process you just went through over again, but harder and against ostensibly fiercer academic competition.  Entrance exams?  GRE, GMAT, or LSAT.  GPAs?  Grad schools want mid-to-high 3.0's (of course, there are exceptions). Med schools, other professional programs, and the like all want a high GPA, completed course pre-requisites, and other stringent requirements. Certain highly competitive jobs want people to have rigorous academic workload (on average, generally speaking) throughout school, with excellent academic marks. As such, don't shoot yourself in the foot by tanking your GPA early.  Wade in and figure it out so you're not overwhelmed, and adjust as needed above.  If none of the above applies to you, the following might: Current Steps Exploratory studies is not a major you can graduate from at CU You have to pick a specific major Majors have requirements associated with them Requirements mean taking specific classes in a particular order and getting a certain grade These all have to be spread out amongst a number of semesters This means you need a general plan to get from where you are the first day of freshman year to the last day of senior year.  Your academic advisor will help you plan this, and there will be a broad plan to take core classes and electives that are applicable to all majors while you're open option.  Likewise, academic advisors will give you a proposed schedule of classes to get you to graduation if you actually have a major selected.  Even better, there's an automated system DARS to help you bang this out as well.  Try to stick to the plan, while judiciously adjusting per the above (especially in early semesters).  This helps you spend less money and graduate faster. Stand Out Developed a plan, stuck to it, and found you're excelling?  Great job, maybe you ought to consider really standing out.  You might try researching: Graduating with distinction Graduating with honors Serving in student government Adding a double (or more!) major, or minor Getting a certificate Working in a lab Go on Buff Portal and find a student job ... Step 9) Reach Out Find that things aren't going so well, or you're lost, homesick, hopeless, sleepless, or something's just not right?  These kinds of things are exceedingly common amongst freshmen, and even throughout a college career (if left unchecked).  There are SO many resources and people on campus who want to make sure you're successful. Counseling and Psychological Services provides free walk-in counseling for a variety of issues.  You know all the cool kids are in therapy these days, right? Office of Victim Assistance provides services to anyone who may have experienced trauma--whether recent or in the distant past RAs are a fantastic resource you live with who can connect you with immediate assistance in the vein of CAPS or OVA when you're experiencing something that cannot wait, as they can help you connect with immediate resources.  Likewise, they're seasoned students who have great tips on study habits, routine interpersonal issues, and questions on campus services. Buffs, what other fantastic services did I miss? Step 10) Enjoy the Ride College is a great time, and you're going to have a great ride.  Stop into the subreddit if ever you want tips, tricks, or advice about any of the above or anything else going on for you in college, and remember that this should be one of the best times of your life.  Do your best to balance hard work and fun, and remember, Sko Buffs!  We're excited to have you!",

I meet people in classes but it’s just superficial conversation that I don’t know how to turn into actual friendship. I sit next to people in the dining hall who are alone, but again, it’s the same thing. Went to the club fair but tbh I didn’t see all that many I would be interested in joining, and I can’t join that many anyways seeing as for some reason they all meet on the same day. Idk I’m just struggling, I thought it was going to be easier than this and that there would be more ways to meet people. Anybody else that is or has been in my position have any advice?",

Coming from a small country where we mostly hear about the U.S. in terms of gun violence, I’m wondering how this issue feels on the ground for students. Is gun violence something students at CU Boulder worry about in their day-to-day lives, or is it more of a background issue that doesn’t affect campus life much? I know it’s a serious topic in the U.S., but from a student perspective, do you generally feel safe at CU Boulder and in Boulder as a city? I’d really appreciate any insight to help me get a realistic idea of what to expect.",

      "content_preview": "*I posted this as a comment in another thread but that thread is old. I wanted this to have its own thread for my visibility and feedback. -I am currently in the program. The grading model of peer assignments is a nightmare. The grading rubric is clearly laid out but reviewers will often give you poor grades based on subjective criteria, not objectively in accordance with the rubric. I have had reviewers reccomend adding things to an assignment that are already included(i.e. like they didn't read the assignment or didn't undersrand what they were reading). I have even had some give me 1s and 2s out of 3s and give the feedback, \"good job.\" When it's your turn to review; expect a lot of clearly computer generated submissions that you have to flag, full assignments that are obviously copy and pasted straight from an AI generator, multiple people turning in the same assignment with one or two sentences changed and full assignments in gibberish. It is not a professional format. CU needs to have human monitors on their end weeding out the obvious nonsense. I value my time and the peer review process can lead to a lot of time wasted. Caveat: this is based on courses that I've worked ahead on via Coursera. The assignments that I have submitted after I have paid for the course and it's in \" for credit\" status just sit there ungraded. I turned in a final project and there were no other assignments to review. You don't get a grade until you do the required number of reviews. So this is a problem. I hope no one else has had a similar experience",
