      "content_preview": "Here are some characters I feel about this way, but feel free to share your characters or thoughts down bellow. Polly and Holly O'hare: Really, what do these two really even do for the plot? Polly and Holly only importance through the series is to give the girls the marketable outfits to wear and they get a minor amount of speaking lines, but apart from that they are extremely useless. Heck, I even forgot that they were even in the series prior to the re-banding for EAH, like they play such a insignificant role through the series that really didn't need to main focused characters. Especially during the re-branding, like Holly literally replaced Briar in that new intro, like Briar is much better and memorable character than Holly. Blondie Locke: Now there's nothing wrong with characters who just commentate on event or things happening in the moment, but the reason why Blondie doesn't work is because she's forced in to be a main cast character and gimmick as this commentator gets so annoying and old. Blondie doesn't provide any unique or personally to the plot as she's just primarily used for comedic relief, which isn't bad thing but we already have Maddie for that, so there's isn't anything for her to do others than to put on a marketable outfit to sell dolls of. I'll will admit, her little mini episode was nice and did explained somethings about Blondie really being royalty or what not, but it still has no importance what so ever and her annoying than engaging. C.A Cupid: This may be controversial but Cupid is really just the most unnecessary addtion to the series now that's not to say the concept of her character is garbage in fact to do like her connecting from MH to EAH, but the overall problem is how little of that is focused, instead we waste our time watching her fallen love with Dexter, a guy who has literally has no interested in her. Again, the concept of Cupid inclusion is not terrible but the time spent seeing her in this new world is pointless and irrelevant to overall conflict, apart from the True Hearts Day special. Plus, the writers probably knew this fact as they just did nothing with her at all, like once she's get over her crush on Dexter, what does she do? Nothing, not even like go back to MH or get any unique character development, just nothing. Again, her inclusion was so unnecessary considering as this was the character that was meant to be the bridge for EAH to MH, and she complete burned it by doing literally nothing.",

I watched Mlp Fim/EG, Miraculous Ladybug, monster High and EAh, i was deeply moved by those cartoons and felt like i was a child again hyped for the next episode. I always enyoed regal academy a show also about a school where the kids of fairytale figures attend. it has the same premise as EAH but in it the mc is the Granddaughter of Cinderella so i knew it wouldnt be the same but still i enjoyed EAH very much. I just hated to see that e very show i liked didnt continue like EAH or MLP or Regal academy. But im thankful there are still people active in this community. As a new fan i am still hoping for a continuation of Eah and any other series. I learned many things from the cartoons i watched but the most important thing i learned was that Friendship is very important and that friends help you everytime you are in trouble. Love The newest Eah fan Ps: I would like for you guys to answer my blog with your own feelings of my expiriences and say what you think about it and dont forget to give reagal academy a try 😊! Bye👋",

      "content_preview": "Na mes Diana Moonshadow Apollo Sunshade Birthdays Diana: May 24th Apollo: May 25th (Both age 17) Diana As the future protector of women and children, Diana firmly believes that anyone—especially girls—should be able to choose their own destiny. However, when it comes to herself and Apollo, she isn’t rebellious at all. In fact, parts of her myth have already come true: she helped her mother give birth to Apollo, and she has already sworn herself to eternal virginity at the age of 17. Diana can be a massive hypocrite, though. She defends Apollo no matter what, but at the same time hates the fact that he doesn’t want to accept his role as a god. She’s terrified that if he refuses, the entire Greek pantheon could collapse—or at the very least, Artemis and Apollo could fade away as concepts if their myths aren’t continued. Apollo Apollo doesn’t want to be a god, even though he knows it’s his destiny. The pressure is overwhelming, and he feels that his future as a god comes with too many setbacks. He knows he will never find true love—since in the myths, he never married, only took lovers—and the thought of living for thousands of years before eventually fading away for the next “Apollo” terrifies him. Still, he deeply loves his sister and fears that his choices might cause both of them to cease to exist. He’s torn between doing what Diana wants and pursuing the life he truly desires. General Information Diana is an expert with the bow and arrow and wishes Ever After High had a team for it. She would likely be close friends with Cerise, with the two often teasing each other and competing to see who’s stronger. She loves hunting, and her favorite animal is the deer. Apollo is naturally gifted with the lyre, and as the future god of prophecy, he can be blunt and has a sharp ability to detect lies. He admires eagles and often uses them to spy on his sister.",
