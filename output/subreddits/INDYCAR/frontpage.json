      "content_preview": "He quoted a conversation between Dixon and Pruett during last week where he said, with the added weight of the hybrid since last year raising wear across the board, that it's the super smooth throttle and brake application Palou has which has resulted in a big offset in tyre wear to the rest of the field. Basically, Palou is simply wearing the tyres less than everyone else, and so when it comes to the end of a stint, he has pace left in the tyres that nobody else has. I found it interesting that Dixon said it's something he couldn't match, as though it's something very challenging to learn, even for a driver of his caliber, and with all the relevant CGR data at his disposal. Interestingly, Pagenaud, a driver renowned for a smooth driving style, faced considerable trouble adapting to the added weight of the aeroscreen (he essentially never did). He was quoted as saying \"My team-mates found ways with their driving to get around the problem, and I haven’t. I have no shame in saying it.\" The aeroscreen-induced weakness behind Pagenaud’s tough 2020 So from 2020, you have a car in which drivers have already had to make adaptions to their driving styles to get good speed out of. It seems like the added weight of the hybrid has now placed the car in a very small window to both maximize speed and minimize tyre wear, and that window aligns well with Palou's natural driving style. That coupled with some flawless execution from the 10 crew has put them in the dominant position they're in. I think Palou recognizes he's fortunate that the current formula happens to favour his natural strengths, and no doubt it's part of his humility. I'm sure he likely would have won the championship this year even without the hybrid/tyres situation - possibly in a convincing way - but I doubt we would be seeing the same dominance that we've seen. It would be good if FOX broadcast would be up to date with their notes and get this info on the US broadcast, instead of merely talking about Palou being one of the greats without any context. I might be wrong, but I don't think they've ever talked about throttle/brake application being the reason for his ability to extract extra performance from the tyres. It's now up to the drivers and teams to try and find that same window and driving style over the next 2 years before the introduction of the 2028 car, or somehow find something else that works better. EDIT: Thinking about his improvement in single lap qualifying pace, Pato (with a more aggressive driving style) has said it's now much harder for him to extract single lap pace. So it seems Palou's smoother driving style also rewards single lap pace, for car balance, tyre warmup or soft tyre life reasons. Penske's falloff has also definitely helped make him look better on Saturdays. According to him, it's also the area he was working on hardest over last winter anyway.",

      "content_preview": "Right now, Colton Herta does have 35 Super License (SL) points. He got 1 point for finishing 10th in 2023, 30 points for finishing 2nd in 2024 and 4 points for finishing 7th in 2025. This puts him on 35 points, however he will lose his 1 point from 2023 due to the rule that applications for getting a Super License can only take account either three previous years or two previous years and the current year. Whichever method provides more points is chosen. So, in 2026, Herta can send his application for SL using points he collected either during years 2023-2025, or during years 2024-2026. Therefore, we can assume he has at least 34 points at the end of next year. In this post, I'm talking about realistic scenarios. We can assume Herta will drive either in Formula 2 or IndyCar next year, as apparently FIA has stopped Herta from racing in junior series. (Source: https://racingnews365.com/fia-stopped-herta-from-appearing-in-junior-racing-series ) So, we can assume Herta can't get SL points by winning Macau Grand Prix or driving in some winter series. Here's how Formula 2 and IndyCar give you SL points: Championship position Formula 2 IndyCar 1st 40 40 2nd 40 30 3rd 40 20 4th 30 10 5th 20 8 6th 10 6 7th 8 4 8th 6 3 9th 4 2 10th 3 1 11th or worse 0 0 No penalty points in a season +2 0 Additionally, you do get 1 extra point if you drive at least 100 km during Free Practice (FP) session in Formula 1 and you don't get any penalty points from that session. You can only get 1 point per World Championship event and you can obtain up to 10 points with this method. You must have either at least 25 SL points or have completed 6 events in Formula 2 championship. Because Herta has well over 25 points, he is allowed to drive in Free Practice sessions. And here's a recently changed part about this: \"Any such points awarded will be counted on top of his sporting results, calculated under Art 13.1.5 [basically that three-year rule] and shall be independent of the calendar year in which the free practice session(s) was completed . The bolded part didn't exist before as it was added in June 2025. If FIA does interpret this correctly, it means that Herta can use points he earned from seasons 2023-2025 and then add those SL points he gets from FP sessions he would drive in 2026. So technically, if Herta just simply drives in 5 FP sessions next (or this) year, he earns the super license by doing that. Of course, if he wants to play it safe, if Herta drives in 6 FP sessions next year, he definitely gets it. In any case, here are all scenarios where Herta can get his SL next year. In all scenarios, he gets exactly 40 points: If Herta stays in IndyCar, he will get his SL by: By finishing 6th or better next year, By finishing 7th and driving in 2 FP sessions, By finishing 8th and driving in 3 FP sessions By finishing 9th and driving in 4 FP sessions, By finishing 10th and driving in 5 FP sessions or By finishing 11th or worse and driving in 5 FP sessions, if FIA does interpret that new rule correctly. If they don't, then he has to drive in 6 FP sessions If Herta jumps into Formula 2, he will get his SL by: By finishing 8th or better next year, By finishing 9th and driving in 2 FP sessions, By finishing 9th and not collecting any penalty points during the Formula 2 season, By finishing 10th and driving in 3 FP sessions, By finishing 10th, driving in 1 FP session and not collecting any penalty points during the Formula 2 season, By finishing 11th or worse, driving in 4 FP sessions and not collecting any penalty points during the Formula 2 season or By finishing 11th or worse and driving in 5 FP sessions, if FIA does interpret that new rule correctly. If they don't, then he has to drive in 6 FP sessions If Herta decides to not take part at all in any championship, he will get his SL by: By driving in 5 FP sessions next year, if FIA does interpret that new rule correctly. If they don't, then he has to drive in 6 FP sessions next year or By driving in 5 FP sessions this year Had Herta finished 6th in IndyCar this year, he could've just driven those required 4 free practice sessions for Cadillac next year. I'm saying required, because as Cadillac doesn't have rookie drivers next year, they have to give up 2 free practice sessions per car (4 sessions in total) for a rookie driver. Rookie driver is anyone, who has raced in 2 or less F1 races. Because he finished 7th, he can still drive those required 4 free practice sessions and his championship position doesn't matter in Formula 2, provided he doesn't get any penalty points from that championship season! So yes, it is possible for Herta to just safely cruise the races in Formula 2 and get his SL. He just needs to cruise safely. And of course, if Herta gets at least 5, or just to be safe 6, SL points from Free Practice sessions , his championship position doesn't matter in either series! And finally, you have to drive at least 80% of the season in order to score those SL points. In Formula 2, this means driving in at least 11,2 of the 14 race weekends or in at least 22,4 of the 28 races. If we assume there are 17 races next year in IndyCar, Herta would need to drive in at least 13,6 races. I'm not sure how rounding decimal values in this scenario goes, are they rounded up or down, or is the normal rounding rule in effect, so that values 0,1-0,4 are rounded down and values 0,5-0,9 are rounded up? For those interested, you can find all the FIA Super License regulations from this document, which is Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code: https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/documents/appendix_l_2025_publie_le_10_juin_2025.pdf",
