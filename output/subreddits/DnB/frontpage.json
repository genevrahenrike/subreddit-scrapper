Billain - Mirror LP [Evolution Chamber] Kemal, MachineCode, Noisia: Recommended if you like It's always a special occasion when Bosnian multi-disciplinary artist and outright DnB legend Billain releases one of his many Dibidubs, but Adis Kutkut putting out a whole entire album, not to mention on the one and only Evolution Chamber , should constitute an international holiday of sort, at the very least. We've already done some digging on him for the last long player, Lands Unbreached , so let's just do a recap and then go straight into the music. 1.3. Conclusion Talking about the numerous of creative works that Billain has been involved in, is a bit of a fool's errand at this point, since there's always more to be uncovered, more to be heard, more to be seen - but I'll try. On the tailend of 2022, Adis not only unveiled his and Fugitive animator Cheng Weizhi 's short ROBOT EXPRESS , but also had the honour of providing the score for Ambre Verse 's short Without Frontiers for The Game Awards (yes, the ) and working on a collaboration between Chinese fashion giant Hamcus and Adidas . Of course, in 2023, the music eventually started flowing out of him again as well, with his Croatian Ambassador Music Award nominated rework of Noisia's Stigma , the meant-for-OWSLA beat package that he instead gave to fellow Bosnian rapper Frenkie to turn into the electronic Hiphop-Trap EP Dna , and the Different Eyes EP on VISION , which in turn was rightfully awarded with Best Bass Release Of The Year . However, 2024 proved to be a year of different artistic avenues. Most importantly, he embraced the online community aspect that Discord can provide with his very own Cyberneuro server, aiming to unite underground artists from any and all audio and/or visual mediums you can think of under the banner of one creative movement. As an extension of that, he crowdfunded more artistic projects in the realm of Cyberneuro, like his Module IN DOME exhibition in Taipei and the pilot episode of his CYBERNEURO series, both of which with created frequent collaborator Cheng Weizhi . Speaking of, Fugitive was still seeing a lot of successes coming its way, winning Best Animation awards at both San Francisco Frozen Film Festival and the Top Shorts awards, which means it has now garnered 27 awards all around the globe and over 50 film festival appearances. 2025 continued with more projects, like his musical contribution for Hamcus and Popmart 's unveiling of their Skullpanda figurine and the \"Cyberneuro Sonopticore establishment\" that is Cybe , but it also meant a return to music. Sure, there was Boomba on VISION 's Mission 03 , but the real highlight was the leadup to what we're here for today, the MIRROR LP on Evolution Chamber . We'll get to how out-there this project is on a musical level in a second, but I just have to mention how incredible every part surrounding it is as well. The distinct, futuristic and versatile artworks, the short stories that went along with some of the singles, the showcase and eyetifacts scavenger hunt at this year's Let It Roll - I've seen it called a multi-sensory experience of an album, and I'm inclined to agree with that assessment. Okay, so, what about the music? 1.2. MIRROR | ЯOЯЯIM .5.1 Unconventional and thematically cohesive as ever, Billain opens up this 17-piece Möbius loop of an album with Outro , a reversed, instrumental version of the LP closer Intro , before fully starting us off with Afterburner . Haunting, what I assume to be Bosnian, vocals on top of a steadily more imposing arrangement of orchestral goodness gently lead us into this cinematically dystopian world, until Billain fires off the titular engine, and with it an impressive assault of kicks, relentless hi-hats and larger-than-life bass hits. Over the course of this almost 7 minutes long (!) journey, drums get wilder, electric currents shoot around wherever they please, vocals get chopped and stretched to blue infinity, but Adis makes sure to end things on a hopeful note, with an outright gorgeous outro. In fact, the average tune on this album is so long, stop three Nubium Slap , with its 5 and a half minutes, is one of the shortest we got! However, it uses this \"brief\" amount of time with utmost efficiency, building up the tension with severely bit-crushed drums and rave-y samples, before laser-fueled rhythmics of funky yet almost imperceivably fast drums take us up, down and through the sea of smoggy clouds - I don't even have the words for the craziness unfolding in the second, Halftime half! Not one to follow trends, Adis rejects Baille Funk and insteads presents: Boole Funk ! Instead of the specific rhythms and summer-y vibes of its Brazilian name cousin, this one channels the Boolean logic even the most incomprehensibly complicated neurological networks are built from, with an arragement of impossibly fast drums and rays of pure energy passing through you quicker than even the most advanced contraption could react to. Contrasting this speed is Doomed Heart , an Ambient Halftime Triphop experience whose sheer mass and atmosphere outright oppresses the listener's ear, while a melodic glimmer of hope shines through the lethargic machinery - perhaps mirroring his apparently frustrating experience as an artist in Bosnia. Well, if everything sucks, everything might as well fuck, is what our next number, ESEF , argues. With what has to be the best vocal of the year, and an attitude that violently rejects modern industry trends, this one not only channels the anarchistic energy of 90s rave, it hypercharges it into a post-modern, stupidly loud pounder with subbass so loud it literally drowns out the other channels, clappy 4x4 snares and distortion that borders on insanity. Far away from the earthly squabbles of suckery, space adventure Centurion launches us straight into the stratosphere, with its protagonistic synths fighting through ups and downs of bass savagery, getting drowned out, being time dilated to sluggish speeds, and supercharged into oblivion, before we float out into the vast nothingness of space, with a stunning outro. Hunt keeps us on edge with its cinematic, brassy hits of atmospheric goodness, providing the soundtrack to our space adventure crew hiding from their adversaries amongst the stars, while navigating the otherworldly dangers of it all. Even more ambitious in its ambience is mid point Third Dream . A follow-up to Second Dream from Lands Unbreached and third in his series of Third -prefixed tracks (alongside World Murder and Impact ), this ten-and-a-half minute journey fully resets the mind and soul for the things to come. After so much pure Billainy, we now enter the collaborative territory, starting with none other than German legends Rawtekk on Dystopia ! Christine's breathtaking vocals tingle our spines while the dark and bubbly atmosphere rumble beneath it all, before it all crescendos into a gently rolling exploration of an auditory sewer system full of froggy growls and more and more (and more) clanky, metallic drumwork. Once again, topped off with an almost religious outro experience! We continue the out-of-body ride with Glass Fortress featuring Evolution Chambers very own Magnetude . A collaboration for the ages, this one builds up its wonderful melodic lead to the point of pure bliss, until eventually unleashing a truly incomprehensibly heavy drop, merging the dramatic melodicality and sharpness of the Russian-British duo infernale with the raw, fast-paced savagery only Billain could provide. Of course, this combination of melodic masters could only end with another stunning atmospheric finale, full of glassy, glittery, orchestral loveliness. Upping the energy once more, Pancir , slavic for body armor , assembles Jamaican MCing, overwhelmingly weighty bass hits and proper slapping snares into one wildly heavy tune - with an ending that I can only genuinely respect. Funnelling said energy and charging it up even more , Halftime-Triphop bass monster PSA Ketchup goes absurdly hard, with absolutely insanely, ridiculously loud bass that actively clips all over the place, while still staying coherent and whole, somehow. Opening quite dramatically, but instead opting for a more somber approach to buildups, Frozen Wind 's rain drops, steadily climbing in both multi- and amplitude, are a treat for the soul , but once they pass a certain intensity threshold, the Billaingine starts revving up into an equally intense drop. Once again progressing in an incredibly satisfying fashion, this one not only takes us through various melodic variations, we're also treated to a weather appropriate rainy outro. Hitting the home stretch of the album now, Forcefield fittingly kicks off a series of alarms, rave stabs and constant ticking noises that put us far over on edge, we fall down into a ravine of madness, where up to twenty things fly all over your faces at the same time, causing a sensory overload unlike any other. Even when it slows down into Halftime tempo, the shots keep flying past us at a relentless pace. I also very much appreciate the multiple videogame-y gunshots and forcefield failures in the rainy outro. Outside of the mirrored intro the grand finale, Timeless Mirror could not be a more appropriate fit for this slot. Spectacularly moody, while charging up all sorts of mind-bending alien weaponry, its lovely melodic quaintness is obviously contrasted incredibly heavily, but something about this merger of gentle countryside jamming, smooth rolling drums, and nuclear reactions of sound design going off does it for me. At 8 whole minutes, it's one of the longest on the album, but the progression is just so satisfying, the breakdown is just so outrageously beautiful, the second half is so maniacally aggressive, the orchestral outro is so goosebump-inducing, and everything clicks together so perfectly, that you just can't escape its grasp. Of course, we still need to close the reversed loop, with the closer Intro . In a normal world setting up, but in this twisted one more recontextualising, what we have just witnessed, this one leaves one with the desire to start this neurological futuristic journey anew. 1.1. Recap (2022 - 2025) Once more building a world of pure auditory creativity, infused with storytelling in the futuristic, dystopian realm of Cyberneuro, constantly pushing the boundaries of sound - that's a Billain album alright.

      "content_preview": "I've been to more music events than I can count through the years. Went through all the electronic music genres, tried out various non electronic stuff, concerts, latin dance classes, etc. But the single type of music I can say I really LOVE is DnB. That's the one type of sound that actually makes me move, gives me the impulse to socialize with people and share good vibes and laughs. I'm planning a cross country move for a new job within a year or so. I'm still in the looking phase and am flexible regarding location. My current #1 choice is Spain since I believe the lifestyle quality there is among the top of Europe. Up until this point I didn't take the DnB scene into consideration regarding my locations of choice. Now I'm thinking if that should be considered. As far as I'm aware, Spain doesn't have much to offer in that department. The countries which come to mind are: UK, Netherlands, Czech Republic. Now my concern with this type of selection is the possibility that the choice of music events is going to be great but that a whole lot of other stuff is going to suck big time (weather being the obvious one that comes to mind, feel free to fill me in on other minuses). On the flipside I see Spain as having a bunch of those other pluses so a lacking DnB scene might be a fair trade off. Another concern I have is that I might be getting too old to be thinking in this kind of direction. Currently in my mid 20s. It would be silly if I made a move based on this priority only to realize that most people in most venues are high school kids or students and that it's not as nearly as enticing as I thought it would be or that I don't have the stamina to go to events frequently anymore anyway. Perhaps it's better to leave the shits and giggles for the odd festival here and there which doesn't even depend on my country of residence. Genuinely curious if somebody else here had these kind of ideas, if you had the opportunity to make a move and if you did move in the end mainly for the music. Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences about this, thanks!",

For example, Kryptic Minds - One of Us voice samples are organic af and not distracting me that easy as vocalise moans in melodic DnB's.",
