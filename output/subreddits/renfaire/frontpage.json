      "content_preview": "I'm not sure how to start this since I'm still kind of uncomfortable but oh well. Also, correct me if pickle folk don't count as vendors! I'm assuming they do but still. I was at MN renfest a few days ago, in costume. Me and my group stopped to get a pickle before heading out for the day. When we were buying, the pickle guy started hitting on me. Like, almost aggressively? I don't remember everything he said but he called me hot multiple times and then made a joke about showering with me, among other things. At one point my friend told him to calm down but he kinda kept talking. I would've just left but we were in the process of buying a pickle from him. It doesn't help that I am 16 years old, either. (He didn't know that, but it definitely lead to me feeling more uncomfortable with the interaction.) I was in a pretty elaborate costume, and did end up having more cleavage than expected, so I guess it's kind of on me? All in all, really soured what was otherwise a really great day Anyways, this is all to say, is it normal for vendors to hit on patrons like that? I understand that the faire is a very playful space and it can definitely get a little raunchy, but this felt like a LOT. Is there a way to report this to fest staff, and would it be enough to report if so?? (Can't really report even if I wanted to though considering I have no clue who he is, but good to know for future reference.) EDIT: Thank you guys so much for the support, I didn't expect this! I definitely feel better knowing this is out of line and I'm reasonably weirded out. I'm going to poke around the website and see about contacting the faire to let them know what was up. I'll be going again, and try to buy pickles from less pushy people for sure. Nobody can stop me from my season pass money's worth!! 🫂",

Turns out, starting that very day, all rat costumes were officially banned. Why? Because apparently a different group of rat people had been stamping children without permission. I noticed lots of security stationed around compared to before too. Absolutely devastated. Spent so many hours on the mask and outfit. We had planned to pass out rat shaped trinkets…Hope everyone else got to enjoy the rat moments 😔 Still made the best of my day of course lol. Maybe don’t go around touching kids? (Or anyone) Rat fit here! Edit: They didn’t email back but I called them. Rat costumes are banned for the rest of the season and tbd for next year. You can however dress as any other animal just not rats specifically. This is due to a group of people stamping without permission and using not skin safe ink causing rashes.",

I'm fully aware this will most likely either be ignored or downvoted to oblivion, but as someone who's deeply interested in history, I genuinely don't understand the gatekeeping of fantasy, sci-fi, anime, furry, or otherwise \"non-Renaissance Faire\" costumes. The vast majority of costumes and a good number of the shops and stalls I've seen aren't even remotely from, or selling stuff inspired by, what we understand as the European Renaissance (commonly understood to occupy the 13th to 17th century CE). I've seen: 1st century CE Roman legionary with lorica segmentata or lorica musculata (not even something most legionaries would wear) 18th century British Royal Navy lieutenant 18th century Caribbean pirate 19th century American frontiersman 1st century BCE Greek hoplite 12th century Knights Templar 8th century Tang Chinese courtesan Steampunk shops and costumes USS Enterprise crew members Mandalorians Jesus Not to mention the masses of people just showing up in 21st century casual attire--are those people are shattering the thin veil of immersion for others? I'd like to exist with the maxim of \"live and let live.\" Would I ever personally wear anime costumes and fursuits to Renaissance Faires? I don't even do those for fan conventions, but that's because it's just not my thing. As long as those that do aren't hurting others, themselves, or their environment, and aren't promoting that sort of antisocial behavior, then respectfully, who the fuck cares? The Renaissance Faire isn't a funeral, or a formal gala, or a fancy restaurant, or a historical re-enactment.",

I will be going with a group that includes my toddler. We do dress up. I’ve posted my outfit here before- I have been building it for a couple years now and I do at least one thing to enhance it every year. Last year I added a layer to the dress and skirt hikes, this year I am making some accessories, starting with a beaded necklace we’ll see what else I can get done over this week. My husband and son will be dressing up, I don’t know if the rest of our group will or not. In the past I’ve been disappointed with things like vendors I wanted to visit not being present and missing events I wanted to see- so I know looking at the event schedule and planning ahead are vital. Trinket trading is still banned to my knowledge so I won’t be doing that- how else can I engage? I’d love to interact with more people but I feel like going with a group makes it kinda hard. Also: how can I make it more fun for my son? In past years he’s had to stay confined to his stroller, I’m hoping that we can make this year at least a little more fun.",

Stuff that felt like it'd be more at place in a more adults-only event vs one that was more family focused! I think consent with community is important in kink land. Is this a common thing? Saw some furry tails and other stuff, too!",

      "content_preview": "Hello all, I make handmade wooden fiber arts tools, handspun thread, and other handcrafted items and I'm trying to access what items would sell well at a Renaissance faire. The fiber arts tools I make include suspended and supported spindles for spinning yarn, niddy noddy and nostepinne for winding skeins and balls of yarn, tabletop looms for weaving, etc. Handspun thread is somewhat self explanatory. I source wool or other fiber from farmers and growers, prepare and wash it myself, and spin it into embroidery/sashiko thread by hand. I sell these in tiny skeins like what you'd find at a craft store. I offer a wide variety of others things as well. Hand turned wooden wands, dyed fiber for spinning and felting, needle felting supplies, tools, and kits, handmade lace jewelry (shuttle tatted and crocheted), and more. Is any of this stuff you have seen sold at a Ren faire? Or would buy if you saw it at a Ren faire? Any info y'all can share helps.",
