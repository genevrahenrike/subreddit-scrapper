      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/community-announcement-v0-scslylgwykgf1.png Hello everyone , I'm saddened to come to this again however in recent days Klab has displayed malicious intent toward their community both publicly and behind the scenes. Here's a short summary of the situation and what's coming next What's going on Photo Print Round 4 As many of you noticed Klab included the 10th Anniversary Units in their promotional support driving misleading communication about what the ticket would deliver once obtained Guild Quest Shadow Buff The community realised there was a shadow buff in the last two Guild Quest (Melee Espada  - Melee No Affiliation) , while this behavior is often seen in gacha games, communication remains the key for the community to not feel defrauded or pushed to summon unwillingly In the backstage Klab claimed it was a mistake and they were investigating this issue since Tuesday (JST), although no further communication was provided (Initial contact on Monday 28th) Soul Ascension Rukia - Ex Skill Malfunction Currently Rukia Ex Skill is said in the notice to be a separate multiplier skill, which after several tests, it is confirmed to actually be a similar additive skill In the backstage Klab doubled and tripled down that Rukia Skill was effectively a separate multiplier and working as intended (Initial contact on Sunday 27th) We will break this down in another thread [Soul Ascension Rukia - Ex Skill Malfunction] because there's not enough room here What is problematic While we often see issues, mistakes or oopsies from Klab, it's rare to have that many at once. This is problematic for a community action due to a  \" Divide to Conquer \" strategy. Without a coordinated effort, the community feedback will not be seen as important and Klab will simply brush away the concern aside and wait until the voice slowly go silent A good example would be one of Klab's answers this week which essentially was \" It's only a few that noticed such thing, it must not be that important ( or noticeable ) \" which basically mean, \"we can ignore it\" What's next First be aware that KLab was notified directly about all of the following points on Monday the 28th and Wednesday the 30th, so they are aware this action was a possibility Next Phases is to push for a new broad community action driven by the community itself. While Klab seems to believe that they have an upper hand right now, it's actually quite the opposite it's the perfect time for us to remind them that it's the community that make a game succeed or not In May, Klab asked 100 of their employee to leave voluntarily but only 47 (in July) agreed. This is compromising their short term their downsizing plans which mean that any action we take will have more impact right now We might not have a livestream to loudly express our displeasure but there's still a social media campaign around the EOM characters. Additionally the Monthly Pass canceling is one of our weapon especially since we just closed the 10th Anniversary and it will be felt by Klab more heavily now than it was in April due to their compromised immediate downsizing Phase Schedule Starting August 3rd : Soul Ascension Rukia - Bug Fix Push This is our first action, as character are the first to somewhat blend in the background and Klab is hosting an event with the character review format for the EOM (TYBW Manifestation characters! Post Campaign) on their social media until the 16th, feel free to use this template to POLITELY notify them across their platforms Inquiry Discord Email info-bleach-en@klab.com https://preview.redd.it/community-announcement-v0-8cwjkbnuykgf1.png English Version https://preview.redd.it/community-announcement-v0-bejuo0gvykgf1.png Japanese Version Additional Video Footage of the Bug Starting August 16th (MM Push) If Klab GQ Shadow Buff remains effective we will push on that front too for them to : Keep difficulties from Normal to Very Hard unchanged so it gives a ramp to new players Be more transparent about GQ values Eventually if they want to increase difficulty instead of shadow buffing they can add even more Extra wave or use the 5th Guild Quest difficulty level (Ultimate) that is waiting in the DB since 2 years now Why we should push for it It is understandable that a company has to make money, that's fact. However they still can have a respectful, transparent and accurate communication towards their community, us While we wish to not come to that extent, please be assured that it's not coming out of nowhere as we always engage with Klab directly and upfront in attempt to fix or suggest most of these things before the community usually notice it However, the community will always have a stronger voice when we act together Aren't you asking for too much Ultimately, I don't think we are. Every single one of the issues would have been fixed by easy and quick communication : We Apologize we made a mistake including 10th Units to Photo Print We Apologize we made a mistake in GQ settings / we didn't notify the difficulty would increase We Ap o logize we made a mistake in Rukia Ex Skill Calculation / we made a mistake around the detail of how Rukia Skill word in the notice",

They have a x3 or x5 damage multiplier. Top Tier SA Lead could be helpful even as off-killer lead. +30% Off-killer booster can be more effective than an old booster if you have good/strong assist unit Status effects For Damage Optimisation consider Weaken units, Weaken add a 1.5x damage multiplier when effect is active but be careful in GQ duration of Weaken is halved For Crowd Control consider Freeze/Paralysis it would stop mobs dealing damage to you, allowing you to maintain full stamina damage boost run more easily Burn/Lacerate/Poison DoT are nerfed in this game mode. However if you have such units consider to give them Dx bonus (Damage to X, X being Ailment they inflict) Transcendence/Link Slot This game mode requires Transcendence and LS to clear and to make it easy. Team set-up Ideal team set-ups: Fastest is 3x SP units (5/5 units) Vortex Leader can greatly increase the effectiveness of NA assist units You can also run 1 or 2 NAD units. Building your Lead SP unit < 20s You can start to build for Nuke strat with FSD/SAD links < 30s You should have a combination of FSD/SAR and SAD/SAR build to maximize damage multiplier > 30s You might need more consistent damage and SAD/SAR (eventually with one LDS) could help you if there no Crowd Control effect in your team Building your supports < 20s Your booster will not need SAR, > 30s it will likely need so you can boost multiple time If you don't have crowd control unit you might want some LDS/NAD link such as (S) Tatsuki as link If you are sure that your unit will survive you can pick full NAD, if you are sure they can keep full life then FSD/NAD build will push their damage. Ultimately if you are sure they will survive but reach quickly low stam you could consider LSD/NAD Boost For this week, Boost depends on your team composition. It's not mandatory, but it's nice. As for clearing the quest itself, focus on clearing the first few waves with your main SP unit and then retreat to recharge cooldowns while your NAD units focus the bosses. With NAD unit leads you basically just need to clear mobs as efficiently and quickly as you can with NAD and then focus down the bosses. Advanced clearing (weakening nuke at T6/5 + SP 2★ minimum): Time your SAs with a beam type SA2 from a 2/5 unit. Generally this gets you through to 5th boss from the get go.
