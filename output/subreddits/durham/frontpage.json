While he cannot control this program, he can advocate against it and discourage local businesses from using it, and the more people demanding action the better: Hello, I’m writing you today as a concerned citizen of the Durham Region. As we have all come to learn in the past few weeks, youth unemployment has reached recessionary levels across the country: throughout regions in Ontario it’s as high as 16%. The Greater Toronto Area as a whole has been massively impacted by the rising cost of living since COVID, an exploding population, and an extremely competitive job market offering low, inadequate wages. Young people are already struggling to find affordable homes and rentals, and now, employment of any kind. This is a travesty and a crisis, and what makes it even worse is that businesses across the Durham Region have been exploiting the LMIA program, choosing to hire temporary foreign workers over Canadian citizens and permanent residents, greatly exacerbating the issue. In the past week, I have come across two extremely dubious Job Banks postings from Durham Region businesses: Corrados in Whitby, and the Subway location at 600 Grandview St S, Oshawa. In each case, the establishments offered $36/hr for an assistant manager position (an incredibly high and unheard of wage for these positions) I have ample restaurant management experience, so I applied, and have yet to hear anything. I’ve found out from others they had the same experience, yet both establishments have applied for the LMIA program, attempting to bring a temporary foreign worker to fill the role on the basis that no Canadians are willing or able to do so - which is clearly untrue. Both listings have been reported by multiple people, including myself, on job banks. Since gaining attention on social media, the establishments have received a myriad of negative reviews from the community, as people are rightfully fed up with employers abusing this program as a way to avoid paying adequate wages to Canadian applicants. In many cases, LMIA applicants pay these establishments upwards of $10,000 for employment, and work for low wages in poor conditions simply as a way into Canada. I do not know if this is the case with these two particular establishments, but regardless, they are both clearly attempting to misuse the program. This exploitative practice only serves to keep youth unemployment up, and wages down. It plays a large role in why we have a youth unemployment crisis. It is rampant and frankly disgusting to see. While I understand you cannot control this program or who applies for it, I urge you to discourage Durham businesses from abusing it, and to instead prioritize hiring the plethora of unemployed Canadians already searching in the region. Young people have been disproportionately affected by inflation and all the other crisis’ this province faces. Please, speak up for our sake. No one else seems to be. Thank you,",
