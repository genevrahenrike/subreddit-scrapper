This is our first time going anywhere with steep grades on roads and we quickly learned that we don't want to use automatic on downhill steep grades or we may burn out the brakes. It seems very simple considering we probably want to stay at 3rd gear and uncommonly at 2nd - throw it in manual at around 25-35mph at the top of the hill and downshift if going too fast without hitting the brakes! If that sounds wrong, please give advice. We've literally never used manual a day in our lives lol. Thanks, everyone :)",

My top options are a Honda Element, Honda CR-V, or Toyota RAV4. (I actually prefer the older boxy looks, newer ones are out of range anyway.) What I need help with: Best years (and years to avoid) for each Which is roomiest/most comfortable to sleep and live in Reliability issues to watch out for on specific years How they handle bad weather, mountains, and snow — and does FWD vs AWD really matter? Real-world mpg when loaded with stuff Priorities: Reliability (must last ~2 years) Livability (flat sleep setup, cargo height/space) Gas mileage Would love any input from owners who’ve lived or traveled in these cars. Thanks 🙏 P.S. I only need this setup for about two years so I can get back on my feet. After that, I’ll be moving into a better living situation/different car options.",

It shined by providing a buffer for the fridge power and offering peace of mind as a jump-start backup. But what I like most of it is I almost made it the entire trip without once having to run the engine solely to charge something. That's it, just a simple sharing.",

I'm looking to add a CDH to the equation for redundancy and ease of refueling while in Finland; the only European country with no LPG refilling stations, meaning annoying bottle swaps instead of 5 minute gas station stops and running out of heat in the dead of a -10 celcius night due to being unable to top up the canister in advance. The heat from the Truma is distributed throughout the van with piping, including to the batteries in the back and the separate bathroom, and I'd love to hook up the CDH to the same piping. Has anyone done something similar? Do you foresee any issues with the heat from one heater being pushed to the one thats not being used? Should I add some flaps to stop this?",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! My partner and I have bought a GMC van which has previously been converted, and we have been travelling around Canada for the summer. Winter is coming up quickly and we will not be living in the van, so I am wondering what we need to do to prepare the van for intense winter conditions (snow and freezing temperatures etc). We are from New Zealand so we are not familiar with this at all! We have a solar panel on the roof so I’m not sure if we need to cover this? Do we disconnect the house batteries? Do people use additives for the fuel tank or engine oil so it doesn’t freeze? Thank you so much!!",

We both are perfectly happy and content with a simplified and minimized lifestyle, and we will probably be spending a lot of our time camping out of tents in state parks, but for the travel in between and seasonal labor we were going to use the van or a small trailer/camper. As a previous fabricator I have ideas, but would appreciate seeing some smaller builds so that I can try to draw inspiration from them. Thanks for reading that mess and any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",

The Qwest has more comfort and space for kids but I am worried it will limit our freedom. Concerned about driving in cities, tighter areas, and parking overnight. The Solis is smaller and easier to drive and park and seems better for city experiences and maybe stealth camping. But I am worried it will feel too cramped for four people on longer trips. We like the outdoors and want to be able to stay at trailheads and national parks, but we also like experiencing the cities we end up visiting. Ideally we would have flexibility to do both. A sales rep told me with kids to skip the small Class B and just get a Class C. I would like to hear real experiences from parents or non-parents who have done this. I'm open to other makes/models but these are mainly the two I have researched.",

Moved to a town where 4WD would be nice in the winter and want to downsize. However i still want a vehicle that has the potential to be lived in. What’s a reliable, semi affordable, 4WD vehicle you guys recommend? :)",

      "content_preview": "I have two Optima Blue Tops dated 2022 and I accidentally left a light on for 10 days while I was out of down and discharged the batteries. I can’t get them to charge back up for the life of me even using a known, good battery to use as a “jumper” while charging. I know they are 3 years old but they rarely got used and were always on a trickle. I’m trying to find any trick I can to maybe get them to come back to life but they are heating up way too hot which to me means they’re dead. Not even worth replacing them with like-for-like either. If I can’t get them to hold charge I’m going to upgrade to LiFePo4 which is a whole ordeal of upgrading the whole system",
