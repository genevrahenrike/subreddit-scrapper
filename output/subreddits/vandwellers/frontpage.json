I keep seeing people saying it costs 2500‚Ç¨ to ship a van on the atlantic, and other saying it costs 6500‚Ç¨. So i dont know what to believe. Maybe its prices before and after covid ? My van is small, its a VW Vanagon T3 Syncro 4x4 so what price could it be ? Keep in mind that i wont live in it in winter in canada so no need to tell me about heating or else. Thanks !",

      "content_preview": "I've made it across the country and am trying to settle into my new locale, but I find myself feeling bad that my dog is so bored all the time.Back in housed life, even though he was stuck at home all day, he had humans and another dog to keep him occupied. He also had a predictable routine to find solace in and a domain to guard and prowl call his own.On the road, though he didn't have the comfort of a routine, every day was an adventure and while some were kinda dull, most involved hikes and exploration and meeting new people and sniffing new smells.Now that we're settling into our new normal, it feels like the worst of both worlds: he's stuck in the van for most of the day while I either work or take care of my dad (the reason I'm here in the first place), with little interaction or room to roam.He loves being out of the van and going on walks and hikes, and hates coming back to the van and the change in mood is palpable as he climbs back into bed with resignation, sleeping away his boredom.I hate seeing him like this, but I've got a lot on my plate and there's only so much I can do to keep him engaged. How do your dogs spend their days? What do you do to keep them entertained and in good spirits while you go about your daily to-dos?EDIT TO ADD:I should probably also qualify that my dog is aToller, a high-energy breed that loves the outdoors and gets bored easily. He's not exactly built for just lounging around all day.EDIT 2:So I have no idea how the fuck people got the idea that I'm somehow neglecting my dog, so let me spell it out: except for when I need to tend to my dying father, I spendevery minute of the daywith my dog. It's just that much of the day, I'm in front of the computer, working, because, you know, I'm not independently wealthy. He spends that time sleeping or laying beside me, bored, which I feel guilty about. But when I'm not working, I'm either taking him for walks, hikes, or down to the water to play.I started this thread to try and get some tips on how to keep him engaged and entertained when I'm working, because I'm unable to actively play with him. How the everloving fuck that was interpreted as \"I abandon and neglect my dog\" is beyond me. I haven't edited the OP, so if someone wants to point out where they got that impression, I'd love to hear it. I love my dog. He is my world. I spend every minute I'm able to with him. There are just many minutes in the day that I'm UNable to lavish him with attention, and that's what I was here trying to get advice with. Instead I got judgmental pricks jumping to conclusions based on assumptions.",

Winter is coming up quickly and we will not be living in the van, so I am wondering what we need to do to prepare the van for intense winter conditions (snow and freezing temperatures etc). We are from New Zealand so we are not familiar with this at all!We have a solar panel on the roof so I‚Äôm not sure if we need to cover this? Do we disconnect the house batteries? Do people use additives for the fuel tank or engine oil so it doesn‚Äôt freeze?Thank you so much!!",

Are the roads bad there? is it hard to drive in a big van like that? Lastly, how's the parking situation in the busier parts of the town? Is it hard to find a parking spot for a big van like that? We're prepared to walk a bit just in case. Thanks for any info!",

      "content_preview": "Hey allBit of an atypical post for this sub maybe, but I don't really know where to go with it, mayber/CarTalkthough this is more specific towards vans... Feel free to point me in the right direction.Me and my wife scuba dive and we've started taking our two children on diving trips as well. We're also getting into camping more and more, but are sick and tired of trying to puzzle all our gear into our station wagon (Skoda Octavia) and then getting everything wet after a dive. Or having to go on holiday with a roof box which just sucks.So the idea is to buy a double cab van to replace the station wagon. We're about to pull the trigger on an L1 Ford Transit Custom. We'll have 5 seats, it's \"small\" enough to use as a daily driver car, but we also have a bulkhead and a separate cargo area to separate the traveling area from the \"wet and musty\" area.The idea is to provide some racking on one side of the cargo hold, and the other side have a little bench that can store dive bottles. I want to keep a length of floor available to store a bike as well.That's our situation, so the main thing I'm wondering about now: how do I handle the storage area for daily use? How do I prevent a crate with groceries or a book bag sliding about the storage area? Are there good divider tricks? Use a net? Any tips or inspiration welcome!",

The box is a total of 35 inches tall which is going to make my bed probably too tall. Should I cut 8-10 incehs off the top and remount everything? The only thing still not wired is the AC distribution which is going to goon the right side wall.Also small side question: what have you done to get the wires to not run over each other? Or is that just a reality and I should add a sleeve of some sort?",

They are clearly not NPT female fittings so why do they come with NPT male couplers? Will it be okay as long as I use a thread sealant?Similarly, does the silencer female swivel into the strainer NPS connector cause issues? This one seems like it should fit better as they are both straight walled and I would add thread sealant.Finally, there's the issue with the Shurflo strainer into the pump itself. It is an NPS female but the water pump has a NPT male. I am using the faroutride build as reference. They use the Shurflo pump which has an NPS in port so that makes sense that those match. Should I get an adapter? Do adapters like this exist? The only one I could find was this one from McMaster Carr:https://www.mcmaster.com/4685T13/but that's only male to male. (I found some more on ebay so maybe this is a worthwhile solution?(also is there anything wrong with the way I have my cold and hot water splits? It feels like it should be fine but I don't know. Maybe I need splitters that have open and close valves?)Let me know if you need any clarifications but thanks for any advice!",

      "content_preview": "I recently finished installing bump outs at the rear end of my van to extend my sleeping space. Since I'm building it alone, it was much easier for me to attach each piece individually to my frame than to build the box and install it as one large piece. The process went relatively smoothly, but I was left with exposed corners at the upper corners where the metal curves. What would be the best way to cover these? I've considered using a roll of super thin flexi ply, installing carpet all over the the bump out, or just cutting and installing small pieces to cover the edge - but I'm really not sure which option would work or look the best.https://preview.redd.it/ugly-corners-v0-7tag6rl2k0nf1.jpghttps://preview.redd.it/ugly-corners-v0-o1xfxy23k0nf1.jpg",
