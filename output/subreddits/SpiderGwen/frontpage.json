      "content_preview": "I was searching for reviews of the most recent Phillips run. For the most part all I could find for reviews is \"Comics sure are fun huh?\" Or only the first issue is covered. I think there should be a more intelligent critique of the run. For one to prove that there are intelligent people reading Spider Gwen comics. For two to prove that we deserve better. For three to expedite Phillips to writing for someone else. (I'd say to get her out of writing entirely but I really don't want to advocate someone losing their source of income.) I could write such a review. Is there anyone willing to help with a video portion? I believe a video is the best medium to properly critique this work of art. I wouldn't even know where to start on that front. So is there anyone here that would want to collaborate on a piece that demands we as readers be taken seriously?",

Her dad having a job as a cop seems like a massive plot hole conflicting with the fact George Stacy died so many years ago. That and Gwen being alive would harshly change history for Peter as well, which would probably change the history of other characters in a butterfly effect. My theory is that this \"Earth-616\" Gwen currently lives in is a pocket dimension created by the Cosmic Cube trying to meet her demands, hence everything going perfectly the way she wants. Maybe Tantrum is a red herring for \"selfishness coming back to bite\", and the truth is that this whole thing is Gwen fooling herself by giving a baddie to call consequences instead of facing reality. I suppose a good way to tell if this theory could be true or not is to watch out for her appearances in other books. She's meant to show up in ASM #12, so it's probably all just coping.",

      "content_preview": "I just caught up on the newest run of Spider-Gwen: The Ghost Spider. I think it is really cool where they brought the story. Seeing my favorite superhero getting elevated to cosmic level powers. Awesome. I do miss the Bodega Bandit too. I miss the charm of the world. Still hard to complain about seeing Gwen level up to the cosmic scale. But does anyone else get the impression that the real reason Gwen couldn't stay on her earth is because she was on the verge of becoming a gay icon? Where Spider-Gwen Smash and Giant Size Spider-Gwen (2024) left off with MJ and Gwen. It was an interesting take on: Spider person falls for MJ. A bit eye rollingly formulaic, but there was enough in this story to make it a unique take on it. Pair it all with the fact the Gwen wears the trans colors (likely not a deliberate choice. I dont know one way or another.) It is the makings of Gwen being a gay icon. Then they throw that all away in favor of turning Gwen into giggling school girl with a crush on the bad boy with a heart of gold. Like we needed this story again and the billionth time. It isnt even a good romance. Fabian says \"Coffee?\" And Gwen loses her shit. I get that she was isolated, but how long was she isolated? A week? And she flips out at the first guy that shows her the slightest amount of attention? She is willing to throw away all of the relationships on her earth at the drop of a hat? I spent 5 issues rolling my eyes. Then there are the more gross parts. Breaking into her apartment. Caressing her while she is unconscious. Eavesdropping on conversations. I'm not sure this bad boy has a heart of gold. Or if he does, this gold is severely tarnished. Then he dies. Admittedly sad. He deserved a retraining order. Not death. But then Gwen is willing to go on a cosmic journey to undo his death? For Temu Black Cat? For Mr. Molester? Wouldn't it work so much better if the relationship with MJ was developed? Wouldn't it be waaaayyyy more of a reason to go on a cosmic journey to save someone she has had a relationship with for more than a two weeks? Also, where the hell did the spider people disappear to? Haven't they faced down reality ending threats together. Don't they all know the weight of having to keep a secret from those you care about? Gwen won't tell them one thing that she is clearly struggling with. Then they dip out of New York entirely? And bring every single hero that isnt Luke Cage and Jessica Jones? Comics are so weird sometimes.",

Since now no earth 65 villains can be brought over to 616, Gwen has no personal stakes with antagonists in 616 like she did with Kingpin Murdock or MJ Carnage.  Nobody who she fights here like Chameleon or Black Tarantulas Senior can come close. This is why her former symbiote will become her big bad. It’s the only personal enemy she’ll have in 616 with ties to earth 65. This is unlike with Miles, who had his uncle Prowler, Bombshell’s mom, and The Maker come to 616.",
