An other function is sequencing. Its eight pots can be used to set a sequence of eight notes, perhaps more (16 or 32). It has 12 pus-buttons with LEDs that can be used to see walkthrough of sequence and othe rinfos. It has a 1,2\"-OLED-display and four buttons for parameter-settings. Inside is an ESP32-S3-WROOM, two 4-channel AD-converters and one 4-channel-DA-converter. Its possible to cable the outputs (four jacks) internally to use 0 to 5V or -5 to +5V-output-range. Perhaps i use eight jacks, with 5V and -+5V outputted parallel. Renderings from KiCAD Frontplate needs to be created (will be also done in KiCAD.",

I have a decent Fluke multimeter, but I always find it awkward to test individual components directly with the leads. It’s not that I can’t do it; it just feels slow and clumsy, especially with the wires moving around and knocking other things off the bench. I was thinking about building a small component tester where I could drop in parts one after another, but I figure something like this probably already exists. Ideally, it would be a compact unit with enough weight to stay put, banana jacks for the meter, a rail for each probe, and maybe even a small breadboard for components that are easier to plug in.",

I understand the basic theory behind a sample and hold, charging up a cap with certain voltages until the next trigger samples the next voltage.My goal is actually a sample rate reduction so the clock rate of my s&h has to be in a spectrum of bitcrushed goodness to somewhat clean sample rates. But I like bending and experimenting with circuits a bit and I wanted to ask more experienced tinkerer's wich sample and hold circuit is the most flexible or simple, so I can maybe break it a bit? I'm planning to operate in typical analog synth voltages but I'm still learning so idk if that's a dumb idea. If you've had particular fun with a circuit please share",

      "content_preview": "Hiya, Alongside my FM Drum Machine project I've written about a few times, I've been working on this for around 6 months and wanted to share it to you all: the MC8P , an 8-potentiometer standalone MIDI controller powered by a Teensy 4.0. https://preview.redd.it/introducing-the-mc8p-an-open-source-standalone-midi-v0-nbc5rqql0cmf1.jpg GitHub Repo with all build files, code, and docs: https://github.com/joebmz98/MC8P-Midi-Controller The main features: Teensy 4.0 brain TRS MIDI Type A output (to pair with the OP-XY). The main feature: Each pot can be assigned to control up to 10 different MIDI CCs. You can cycle through these CC's to up to control 80 parameters with just 8 knobs at once. Why did I build this? This project was born entirely from my frustration while using the teenage engineering OP-XY . It's an incredibly powerful tool that I absolutely love, but its' live performance workflow can involve a lot of  menu diving. Trying to build tension or transition smoothly meant jumping between pages and losing the flow. I needed a hardware companion that could give me immediate hands-on control over multiple parameters at once—filter sweeps, FX Sends, envelope settings, LFOs, you name it—without ever touching the OP-XY's screen during a performance. The MC8P is my solution. https://preview.redd.it/introducing-the-mc8p-an-open-source-standalone-midi-v0-yykdfadf1cmf1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/introducing-the-mc8p-an-open-source-standalone-midi-v0-bw67qpdf1cmf1.jpg The DIY Spirit This is and will remain a fully open-source project. I'm a huge believer in the DIY community here, and I want anyone to be able to build, modify, and improve upon this design. For the builders: All the KiCad files for the PCB, the Teensy code, the 3D print files for the case, and a full BOM are on the GitHub. It's a fun and relatively straightforward build, especially if you're comfortable with a soldering iron. Future plans: While the project is open for everyone to build themselves, the eventual plan is to also offer pre-made PCBs and potentially fully assembled units for those who don't want to source parts and solder. But again, the open-source design will always be available. I'd love to hear what you think! If you have any questions about the build process, the code, or how it integrates with the OP-XY (or any other synth!), ask away. Here's a brief video of it in action: https://preview.redd.it/knryl78k1cmf1.jpg Thanks all",

      "content_preview": "I've been tearing my hair out because a Kawai K1 that I put an OLED into won't work, but a regular LED replacement works just fine. After triple checking everything and trying with several different units(I have 5 of the same type), I was coming to the conclusion that the screens I had maybe were defective. Then I found this blog , which seems to be quite confident that an OLED will not work in a K4. I guess I didn't even realize that was a possibility. I've also tried and failed with a TD7 a while ago, and what would you know, that one is also listed on the blog as not working. Anyway, thanks to the person who put that info together. I think I'm mostly just ranting because the blog basically answers the question",

The input signal indicator is staying constant, so I imagine it's at the output stage. A bad opamp would be my best guess, but I'm not really sure. I've tried to bypass the analog part of the circuit (the GT part) at the patch level, but it could be in there as well. I don't think it's the pots since they work fine when the volume is normal and when its low. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I should go through and check voltages of the ic's starting at the output to diagnose? many thanks",

      "content_preview": "I have two diy modules that run off of +/-12V. I am using a MFOS 12v 1A bipolar power supply for my case/power rails. When I install both modules in the case they do not work. However, each of them work individually if only one is in the case, and both work when I have them running off separate power supplies (one in the case, 2nd one not and with it using a different power supply/wall wart.) But for some reason both of them cannot be in the case. Does this sound like a PSU problem? I wouldn’t expect only two modules to already be drawing at/over 1A that the wall wart provides. However, to get a rough idea of the load of each module: the first one is a VCO/VCF module combined into one that also has a sub-osc (uses a AS3340, two tl072’s, a 4013, a TL074, and a LM13700). The 2nd module is a quad EQ module that uses 4 TL072’s. So I guess you can argue this is more than “two” modules, but I still wouldn’t have expected to already be having load issues with just these circuits. The next best thing I should probably look at is the load that each is drawing with a multimeter, right? Anyone encounter issues like this before?",

The build went alright and all knopbs do alter the sound as expected. However, the amplitude (and decay) of the outgoing signal is fluctuating heavily. The decay might be the result of the amplitude. Im not sure about this. Had anyone similar problems? Or suggestions into repairing? I did a quick chech with a multimeter, but that is not really helping. I found that the results heavily depend on the position of the potentiometers. And i simply dont have the experience so I need to learn more. Next step is try and use a oscilloscope to see where it goes wrong. Cheers",

      "content_preview": "[SOLVED] Hiya guys, So I've been prototyping my FM Drum machine and specifically the analogue parts with the Virtual Ground solution I've mentioned in other posts. I tried to prototype the Moritz Klein Compressor circuit and I've been having some issues. I started by simply building it as he does in the video (VCA, then Peak detector etc.) and I couldn't get the VCA working consistently, although I think my breadboard connections are feeling a little loose and so the pots and other components are getting crap connection points. I decided, instead of fighting a breadboard, to simulate it in LTSpice and I've come to the point of implementing the Threshold. Unfortunately, my simulation stops processing after about the 50ms time frame of my transient analysis. My TA is set to 5 seconds as I'm sending the compressor circuit a BV node with a Kick drum voice. To clarify, it only does this when the red connections are made in this circuit: https://prnt.sc/RQ033_7EVmDl This it the reading on the peak detector output while these connections are made: https://prnt.sc/S6afNb5antWz Here's the full schematic: https://prnt.sc/_jVw_xnLGoAH Here's what the drum voice from the bv object looks like: https://prnt.sc/AVkq-aJ6-K94 [ It is simulating a DC Biased Line level kick drum ] Anyone got any advice? EDIT: My U2 op-amp was up-side down so the negative feedback was actually connected to the non-inverting input",

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/cassette-and-square-pulse-wave-synthesizer-v0-0z71kmu8oykf1.jpg Mostly tested, final wiring up phase! The cassette synth is basically a synth, which has a tape as the oscillator voice.  It's possible to insert any audio into the VCF-VCA instead of the tape, and also it has on board square and pulse wave generation.  Using Moritz Klein designs for the VCF, VCA and ENV. I added a lot of functionality alongside the Klein circuits with opamps.  See input/output on the panel.  Vactrol CV input to the ENV creates an interesting 'wave' across the A and D control (linked in the ENV design). Manual ENV trigger.  External resonance feedback loop, with toggle - this sounds great.  Both those ideas inspired by the Doepfer DIY A100 manual. The power requirements are interesting because 3.3v is needed at a high current to run the tape deck.  I'm using a recycled printer PSU which is DCDCd into +/-15v.  And an old rasp pi PSU for 5v, which DCDCs to 3.3v 3A.  Both PSUs take 220vAC. The case is too small really for the PSU, however I will make sure it's all double insulated and install a primary fuse (both PSUs have internal fuse/shutdown as well) As well as shielding it from switching HF and EMF. Pulse wave I designed a comparator to generate a pulse on the EON (falling) phase of the ENV signal. Width is generated manually, and CV controlled too, you can combine them.  Part of the width is set with a trimpot internally.  It's easy to lose the pulse if you can set both, I found it better to only have one control exposed on the panel. Taking the trigger output from the ENV trigger - there is a full rail pulse which, through a diode, gives a positive trigger. If you trigger the ENV at a slow rate, you can use the trigger and pulse output for Rhythmical purposes.  However, triggering the ENV very rapidly, creates a trigger AND a pulse wave audio output. Then, controlling the VCA and VCF with external CV, the trigger and pulse wave can be used as a synth voice. (FM the ENV gate input and it will track notes if you FM it with notes) The square and pulse waves can be selected internally (with a CD4052 as electronic switch - I wanted a 3 way switch for cassette, pulse, or square wave to VCA internally)  Both square and pulse are also output externally.   These should sound great, when XOR'd or other logic functioned together!! All ENV CV outputs are selectable internally via switches, and available external output at the same time. LEDs are driven from VCF VCA inputs, which can be selected to Gate, ENV, and standard or inverted ENV selected also.  Sounds great to invert the VCA and VCF with standard, and vice versa. VCA hold for use with external oscillator or audio source. Voltage inputs are protected with diode/transistor/reference voltage eg, the tape deck CV motor speed input can't receive more than 8v. I still have quite some wiring to do now, the pots, switches and jacks all need connecting.  However everything is tested working, there will doubtless be some small connection issues during panel wiring.  I have all PCB connections ready with JST plug headers, so it's really just the panel which requires soldering up. The panel I made in Kicad.  It's copper filled and connects to ground plane.  Signal GND connects to chassis through a capacitor star ground as per RANE grounding scheme. Case is a recycled keypad comms unit, was on the wall in the University of Amsterdam at some point. You would press keys, and connect to an operator via a mic and speaker. Will follow up when it's finished. https://preview.redd.it/cassette-and-square-pulse-wave-synthesizer-v0-rn18verioykf1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/cassette-and-square-pulse-wave-synthesizer-v0-hoxspfrioykf1.jpg",

      "content_preview": "Hiya guys, Not too long ago I posted in this sub with my design for a digital FM drum machine. It's come a long way and I'm down to the final Analogue hardware sections. Here are some of the changes I've made: I implemented a button matrix alongside an LED matrix with a MAX7219 chip to reduce the pins used on the arduino nano I've successfully DC biased the line out from the PCM5102A DACs to feed into the analogue circuitry without a negative voltage rail I created a virtual ground power supply I've changed the analogue pathing and design - I'm now using Moritz Klein's models for an LPF, HPF and Compressor. I created my own soft-clipping section on the master out to add some extra beef. The Nano now outputs MIDI to the Teensy to reduce the pins needed. Now, I've modelled these circuits in only Falstad at the moment. I've broken each section down individually and tested their output in the scope tool and it seems fine but I'm worried about the noise from the DC biasing. Will it be much of an issue? Here's a folder full of screenshots of the schematics: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12FNEjhXgYY0hsxrcZ2XYvooLtIUSqgSY?usp=sharing For reference, the signal flow is: DACs -> Passive Attenuators -> DC Biasing -> Mixer -> Compressor -> Filters -> Soft Clip -> Master Out | L -> Voice Buffers -> Voice Outputs I'd love some feedback on the analogue circuitry specifically! If you would like to see the FULL schematic, I can get a link to the github repo :)",

      "content_preview": "Trying to learn KiCad and have been working on my first PCB layout. It's heavily based (*copied - I just removed the +5v tie in at the end) from the FC-Power design ( https://frequencycentral.co.uk/product/fc-power/ ) touted by Look Mum (No Computers). I read somewhere that a power supply like this would be a good project for a first PCB - then of course I read somewhere else that it would be the worst idea possible for a first PCB and I'll almost certainly die as a result. Regardless, I've been having fun and learning a lot. If anyone would like to check my work and let me know if I'm about to burn my house down, I'd appreciate it. The thing I'm really not sure about still is the trace size (I've currently got them beefed up to 1.5mm - not represented in this pic, but I'm freely admitting that I just kinda arbitrarily picked that). https://preview.redd.it/first-pcb-12v-power-supply-v0-kdufh7gjw6mf1.png https://preview.redd.it/first-pcb-12v-power-supply-v0-uoyza7gjw6mf1.png",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone Apologies if this is the wrong sub, I'm still new to designing synths and looking for guidance. In short: I'm building a Eurorack version of the Yamaha SK series synths. It will be a 4 voice polyphonic circuit with two primary sound source section: a drawbar Organ section with 7 footages, and a String section with 2 different footages available. The organ section (as of now) will be a DCO using a series of divide-down square waves from a single oscillator for phase locked waveforms - 7 in total, one for each footage - and each will then be sent through a fixed filter to shave the waves down to what is almost a perfect sine wave. These will be 2 pole LP filters. Each footage will then go through its own VCA (a fader) before being, before being summer and going through a 1-Pole LP VCF (fader controlled) and then split for dry and wet signal chains. The String section will use the 16' and 8' footages from the divide down circuit, beginning as Square waves, before being filtered down, and the blended with a filtered Saw tooth wave, with each footage going to its own VCA (also a fader). Like the Organ section, both footages will then sum to a 1-Pole LP VCF, and then split into dry and wet signal paths. The unit will have a built in Vibrato circuit which will send Vibrato to the DCO allowing for pitch modulation, identical to that on the original units. External CV control for Vibrato will also be available. In addition to Vibrato Rate and Depth controls, the unit will have a Delay circuit for the Vibrato, which will be a triggered EG with a single Attack+Sustain control to allow a delayed onset of the vibrato circuit. The organ section will have an external gate control to trigger a percussive VCA envelope (for the entire summer organ, or perhaps to the footage faders?) with a variable Attack/Sustain control The Organ section will have built in and external controls for a Tremolo circuit. Each voice will have its own V/Oct input which can be Normalled/synced to the first Voice. Finally, there will be an Ensemble Chorus circuit. The SK's ensemble circuit is pretty much identical to the Solina circuit which is a three phase BBD circuit, where two LFOs send three phase locked (0, 120, and 240 degrees) to the BBD ICs for swirly chorus. One LFO is set to a slower speed and higher depth (chorus) and the other is at a higher speed and lesser depth (vibrato) and both CVs are summed before hitting the BBD ICs. There will be an ideal fixed point potentiometer for the depth and speed of each LFO should the user want more or less of either LFO. The Organ and Strings will have separate mix controls for the Ensemble Circuit. Ideas I am exploring: • Separate external FM/Vibrato CV controls per voice • separate 100% wet outputs for the Ensemble Circuit • normalling the EG/Percussive control to the Vibrato Delay control for shared triggers • Potentiometer and external CV controls over fixed filters to allow for greater range of sounds beyond the pre-deternined tones • seperate external EG or VCA control over footage? • Normalled L/C/R outputs allowing for separate outputs for each Phase of the Ensemble Circuit, where the user can get either Summed Mono, separate Stereo (L+C, R+C) or full L-C-R outputs. • separate Square and Saw blend controls for each footage of the String Section • adding separate outputs for each footage (similar to the Verbos Harmonic Oscillator) • adding a Sub/32' • adding an optional daughter board for separate per-voice, per-footage • external/aux audio input to use the Ensemble section as an external effects unit • adding tuner LEDs similar to the Furthrrrr Generator for easy tuning of multiple voices Given all that, I'm at the stage where I want to begin proto-typing and would love if anyone could bestow some wisdom onto me. My goal is eventually to turn this into a fully assembled proper Eurorack module with PCBs populated with components, even if it's just for my own personal use, as the alternative is a million individual, expensive, messy patched up modules.",
