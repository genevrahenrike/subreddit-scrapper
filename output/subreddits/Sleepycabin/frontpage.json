We would take calls and emails about people who used to work a big construction gig making a shit ton of money, they would get hurt or whatever and get sent to a Dr and be given Oxycontin. Since its an opioid it was extremely addicting due to how euphoric it made you but once you ran out and the dr didnt want to prescribe more, most would go to the closest thing to it that could ellicit the same feeling: Heroin. We would take hour long calls about people explaining how they lost all their shit due to getting started on oxy and getting progressively more addicted.  Worse, we would take calls on behalf of people who's relative had fucking straight up DIED due to oxy. Would go from earning shit tons of money to sucking dangus for pennies. Im really glad jeff never developed any sort of craving for that shit it is really fucking addicting.",

They're so completely and utterly wrong about how foreskin works, yet they spew their ignorance with the confidence of an expert. All while telling Chris and Niall how wrong they are, when they actually have foreskin. This was just complete stupidity, but not the fun, usually intentional kind that they're known for. It was confident ignorance, and I have to skip that part of the episode every time I listen to it. Thankfully, it's right at the end of the episode, so it's easy.",
