Hypothetical posts should clearly label themselves and use the flair. AI posts are not allowed and will be removed. Yes, even if you only used it as a writing tool.

Has given us 2 grandkids.  We married within a year, moved out, and raised him together. His father was never in the picture, he was in and out of jail and was physically abusive to both my son and my wife so he had no custody or visitation.Once every few years, we’d receive a check for a few hundred dollars. We’d give some to our son and use the rest towards bills. To this day he owes well over a 50k. Today, to our surprise, we received a payment for $3000.My wife wants to give our son half, but we both know that our son will not only insist on the full amount being given to him, he’ll get very upset about it as well. His wife, knowing her for many years, will likely also tell him he deserves all of it. I believe my wife is entitled to at least half for obvious reasons.We are considering giving him the money but not telling him where it came from.  AITAH",

      "content_preview": "My (25F) girlfriend Amy (27F) is a wonderful person. She's very smart, she works in a clean room with computer chips and stuff. But she's also something of a germaphobe. To the point that she keeps her tooth brush in the hallway outside the bathroom in a zip locked bag. Her apartment is always spotless, she showers twice-thrice a day, even her car somehow never has any dirt on the floor. She hand washes all of her clothes as soon as she's done wearing them. It's both impressive and intimidating.I'm not the messiest person on the planet by any means, I don't have massive piles of unwashed dishes or a leaning tower of used pizza boxes or anything, but I'm not as clean as she is. I'm not against making some adjustments, but we've been talking more about the future now that we're getting serious and I've come across a problem.Amy wants kids. Desperately, wants kids. I'd like kids too. But she's never been around babies or little kids before in her life and seems to think she'll be able to keep the house just as clean as it is now and keep the baby spotless too.I'm the oldest of four, and the oldest cousin of nine. I grew up around kids, I've been baby sitting since I was ten. There's no such thing as a clean toddler, not for longer than ten minutes at the very most. She thinks if we just work at it, we have a spotless house and a spotless kid.I told her (gently) that that's just not possible, and asked how she plans on handling diapers, vomit, frogs smuggled into the house, jam going everywhere, soup bowls tipped over for fun, spilled grape juice, nail polish on the walls and the like. She insisted that the kids who do that are just 'poorly trained' and don't have good boundaries.I told her that they're kids without fine motor control or impulse regulation, and accidents will always happen. And if she wants to have kids she's going to have to accept that they're going to get messy and our house will get messy.Amy accused me of not being supportive and trying to find excuses not to have kids with her and trying to guilt her into being sloppier. This is dissolving into an actual fight instead of a discussion and I'm starting to second guess myself. Maybe my family was just excessively messy because we were rural and poor, maybe my standards are too low and we really haven't tried hard enough. It's very frustrating and I want some outside perspective. Parental perspective especially.",

      "content_preview": "I (19m) always knew my dad wasn't my bio dad and it was never a huge deal. I knew I was loved either way. Mom always told us my bio father hadn't wanted to be a dad and walked away once he learned she was pregnant. When I was 12 I started struggling with health issues and we were repeatedly asked for family medical background. Mom swore she reached out to ask bio for any insight on his side but he refused to give it. At the time we were told it would be ideal to find out more if we could but if not we would do our best to treat me.My dad and I talked about it a lot and he comforted me when I was upset that this guy who made me hated me so much that he wouldn't even help for a medical problem. It meant added complications and always having to explain to new doctors I was referred to that I only had half my family medical history and could not get more. And really it just sucked to think he cared so little if I could be seriously ill or not.A year ago my aunt (mom's sister) told me that things might not be like they seemed and maybe it would be a good idea to search for answers myself. She said the worst that could happen is he refuses to answer or gets mad at me for making contact. I asked her what she meant about things not being what they seemed but she was tight lipped on it so I did a 23&Me. I ended up matched with a paternal aunt and from there mom's lies were exposed to me.My paternal aunt was shocked to learn about me and she told me she was 100% certain her brother had no idea either. She was a go between for us at first to help set up contacting and a face to face meeting. When we met he had medical info waiting for me and he told me it was a thing I inherited from his side and he would be a donor if I ever needed one. He was also apologizing the whole time for not knowing me and he swore he was never told mom was pregnant. They broke up because she cheated and he never heard from her again or her sister (aunt who pushed me to search) who he got along with during his relationship with mom. The medical info helped and I told him I'd have way more questions once I processed.Then I went to talk to mom. At first she said it was all lies. Then asked why I searched without saying anything and when I told her why she admitted it was true. She said she met dad after the guy she cheated on my bio father with left her and she came up with the lie so we could be a normal family. And she never told my bio about me even after I got sick because she wanted to keep things as they were.I was hurt but so was my dad. He was mad she denied my bio father and me the chance to know each other. But also that she lied to him the whole time they had known each other. He felt like she made him complicit in keeping me and my bio father apart. And he was super angry she was willing to make my health stuff more difficult because I didn't have the full background rather than do the right thing and expose her lies years ago for my sake.The medical info I got was actually helpful for my medical team so it was worth it in that sense. But it has ruined my relationship with mom and my parents marriage is done. Dad wants a divorce and already moved out of their house. My siblings blame me for it because they know what went down between us all.AITA?",

      "content_preview": "Please just hear me out before you jump on the drama and gossip train. I( 16F)had been friends with this girl (17F) for 3 years, and coincidentally had also been friends with her now ex boyfriend 16m who also dated one of my childhood best friends for five years, before his last relationship, the one where this story takes place.For this story ill be using fake names, ill call my ex bsf isabella, and her boyfriend gus. it all started at the start of the school year in february when gus moved to me and isabellas school, they had been dating for around 5 months before this. we were all in the same friend group because i had a failed talking stage with gus’ friend, (M16), which didnt work out because he was hot but so boring to talk to, i started being dry so he’d stop wanting to talk to me, which worked. plus gus’ other friends were just as hot, and i wasn’t over my ex who doesnt consider me an ex because we both cheated on our partners with eachother mid last year. Okay whatever I’ll get back to that later.Anyway, Gus moved here at the start of the school year and we had started getting closer, i started hanging out with him and isabella a lot, to the point where i considered both of them my close friends. at some point in the year isabella grew distant from gus, she was very busy with school and didnt make time for him. i knew that gus and isabella were only still together because they were playing the main characters in our schools production, which was happening in june. during this time i hung out mainly with gus and my other two friends, emma and ella, (F16) at the time, ella being my bestfriend for two years who was dating my ex when i cheated on my boyfriend at the time with them. but i barely remember it and i knew them so much better anyway. because of everything that happened last year some people already didnt like me and thought that me and gus’ friendship was strange (thats weird because guys and girls can be friends…) few months passed of me and gus growing closer. he was sad about his girlfriend being distant, i was also distant from her at this time and closer to gus so i did what any bestfriend would do and comforted him, while also making fun of his girlfriend, which was fine because they were gonna break up soon anyway, the play was like a week away. when talking to my mum about this she told me i should always stick with my girls which doesnt make sense because im closer to gus anyway.Around this time at a party while we were both really high we held hands, and i could tell he was getting a little frisky, we slept on the same couch but i didn’t do anything about it or tell isabella because i didnt want to sway their breakup or anything. also it was BARELY hand holding. a few days after the play he broke up with her, and a few days after that we hung out and because i suspected he had already likes me for a few weeks i kissed him in the same place me and my ex who i cheated on had our first kiss, which i thought was kinda funny. the kissing turned to making out and as soon as i got home i decided to tell my other bestfriend ella, who hadn’t been talking to me for a few days which i thought was so strange because i havent done anything notable in like a year. i texted her and said i dont care if she doesnt like me i have to tell her this. i told her to not tell anyone which i noticed she never directly agreed to. it felt like she was just trying to get more information about it out of me, which i just tried to ignore.I woke up the next day to very harsh texts from another girl i used to be friends with, before she started hating me for everything that happened last year. she said i was a horrible person, bit vague but okay. i texted emma asking genuinely what i did wrong, because everyone else was being weird about it. we got into a big argument and were texting for hours, i was defending myself, i really do think guys and girls can just be friends. she just kept piling it on, which i dont get why she couldn’t just see it from my perspective for a second before jumping on the drama and gossip. i said this to her but she didnt understand. she said i was a shit friend and i was alienating her and ella but i really dont know what that means. she kept telling me to apologise for what i’ve done but i didnt even do anything to her so i don’t know what she wants me to do. she pointed out me and gus’ “transphobic” jokes, but hes literally not transphobic so i told her not to tell anyone that, plus ive literally said way worse to ella. i messaged ella because genuinely what does she gain. what does she gain from telling people about a one time thing with a guy who’s single. she told me that isabella is her good friend, and isabella could do what she wanted with that information. i was a way closer friend to ella than isabella was, and i still don’t know what she would gain tbh. a few days later emma texted me to let me know that ella doesnt like me, which i figured.Gus cut me off after that and since then i havent talked to any of them, and no one seems to be on my side. everyone kind of goes crazy when they stop being my friend, i dont know why they all care so much about what i do it’s my life, they’re not inside my head. Some of this might sound bad but no one knows what it’s like being me. redditors assemble: am i the asshole?",

My wife had been divorced for many years and shared custody of her 15 and 16 year old's with her ex until a few months ago when he was granted permission to move to another state with their kids, because their kids wanted to go with their dad.My wife doesn't want to be away from her kids for long periods of time and she has told me she's moving. She feels like she needs to be near her kids. I support this. But I won't move my kids away from family, friends and stability to do this. My kids don't want to move either. They heard my wife mention it several weeks ago and they told me they don't want to leave. They'd miss everyone too much.I already know the life my kids have here is what they need and where they thrive. I explained this to my wife and she was defeated. She told me we can't make a marriage work if I'm here and she's there and I said I agree and I told her I believe the best way forward would be to divorce. She was upset by this, of course, and we talked and I comforted her and she asked me if there was anything she could say or do to make me reconsider. I told her I won't move my children and I would never ask her to be apart from her kids for months at a time. I said we're both committed to the best interest of our individual children and that means doing what's right for them even if it's not right for us as a couple.She asked for us to talk it out some more and we have. We've talked about it extensively but all the while she has been making arrangements for a place where her ex and kids now live and a new job. I think she believed I would change my mind the more we discussed everything but I have not and now she's angry that I would rather our marriage end than move so we can all be together as a family.But I know this is not what's best for my kids.AITA?",

      "content_preview": "So I (26F) have this one dress I really like. It’s not expensive or fancy, but it fits me well and I just feel good in it. I bought it a few years ago and I wear it on special occasions, like birthdays or nice dinners.Last weekend my brother’s girlfriend (24F) asked me if she could borrow it for a wedding she was going to. I said no because I was planning to wear it myself next month to a friend’s engagement party. Also, I just… don’t really like lending clothes. I’m always worried they might get stained or stretched out, and honestly I just like having my own things.She kind of laughed and said I was being selfish because “it’s just a dress” and she would give it back. My brother also made a face like I was overreacting. I got embarrassed and mumbled something about it being important to me. She rolled her eyes and said fine, and then things were awkward for the rest of the evening.Now I keep thinking maybe I was selfish? It feels silly because it’s just fabric, but at the same time it’s mine and I bought it with my money. I feel bad though because she seemed upset and my brother hasn’t talked to me much since.AITA?",

      "content_preview": "My wife and I have twin daughters who started high school this year. (Anya and Elia)My twins are nothing alike.This year Anya got accepted in a school for gifted kids. It's a very good school and extremely hard to get into. They only accept the brightest kids.Unfortunately Elia didn't get accepted.The problem is, the school is also very expensive but we can afford it if we send Elia to a public school near our house. It's a very good school.My wife thinks we shouldn't send Anya to that school and should send both kids to a private school instead.I don't think this is right. This is a really good opportunity for Anya, one she can't miss.Also Elia doesn't need a private school. She is not exactly book smart and I think it's better if we don't pressure her too much.We had disagreements and some fights about this and one day I found out Anya is looking up how to get emancipated because apparently she feels like we don't care about her and what is best for her.So I enrolled her in the school for gifted and told my wife afterwards about what I had done.Now she thinks I'm an asshole and we haven't really talked since then.Edit: You know what? I'm sick of these comments and I'm sick of my wife acting like her opinion is always the right opinion.I'll treat the kids equally, fine.Elia is interested in art. That sh*t is expensive as hell. I'm gonna stop buying her art supplies from now on and no more painting classes as well.Next year she is gonna go to a private school with the money we have saved from art supplies.This is just equal right? Both kids go to private school and neither gets expensive art supplies.Problem solved.Let's see how they like it.The public school has a really good art program as well, but who cares, right?",

My son's (14m) first girlfriend is an African American girl (13f), who we'll call Nina. Usually, when I see her, she's a bubbly social butterfly. She smiles a lot and is very talkative.Recently, I noticed Nina seeming less confident the times I see her. Her change in demeanor was the most noticeable change but I also noticed the recent lack of wig, makeup, and jewelry. I didn't even realize the two things were connected.One day, I was to drive them to a party. My son was upstairs and Nina was downstairs. She looked like she was dreading going to this party, and I asked her what's wrong. She said she doesn't feel pretty. I asked her why and she said she's still getting used to showing her natural hair. I asked her if she feels uncomfortable showing her hair, why is she doing it. She said my son thinks she looks cooler this way. I told her I used to do things just to impress boys when I was her age. I told her she can wear a wig even if my son doesn't want her to.Days later, I've never seen my son more angry with me than that day. He said I'm a white woman and I shouldn't be advising a black girl how to look. He said called me an overhearing mom and a Karen. I was too shocked to speak as I never seen him so angry.

      "content_preview": "So I reported my colleague to HR. After my husband kept telling me if it was the other way around, I would report it, I did it. I told HR that I don't want any investigation or to hurt her in any way, I just want to be on the record that it happened. HR assured me no further action would be taken unless I want it, and it will be kept anonymous. I felt so bad for doing it, I thought I made a big mistake by reporting a misunderstanding.My colleague missed work the next couple of days and when she came back she was visibly changed. Very annoyed. Since we still sit one next to another in the office, I behave normally and we don't speak about that day.Today she scoffed when a colleague from a different department passed by. I looked at her with the corner of my eye, but she saw it, and she leaned over to me and probably felt like it was a good time to dish some tea. She told me she has been called to HR and given a lecture about work harassment and has a couple of in-person courses on this. I honestly froze at that moment. Sandy then proceeds to tell me that coworker who just passed must have reported her because they were flirting and she made some jokes that might not have landed well with that colleague. I was there looking at her like an idiot not knowing what to say while she went on a rant about how this place is so against LGBTQ people and you can't make a joke or flirt without someone taking offence. She told me she is just trying to find people to have fun with and encourage them to explore their options. She even gave me as an example \"I tried to help you as well but for sure you weren't ready for it\". I did not say a word and just looked at her for a second before coming back to my work.I felt like an idiot. I really thought she made a mistake by kissing me, and defended her so much to my husband, saying that it was a simple misunderstanding and she felt so embarrassed. now I know I was one of the people she tries to \"help explore\".I don't know what to do with this information. I still believe misunderstandings can happen, but I don't feel that bad for reporting her anymore. My husband was right. You guys were right.",

      "content_preview": "In the middle of June, I had just picked up a custom chocolate cake from a bakery that cost $65. On my way back to the car, a woman and her two kids were coming out of a church across the street where a wedding was taking place. I crossed at a crosswalk about half a block from the church. I saw the mother telling her little girl, maybe four or five years old and dressed in a very nice white dress, to stop jumping around and stay still. The girl didn’t listen. She ran off, laughing and looking backward instead of paying attention, and ran straight into me. I dropped the cake, and it hit the ground on impact. Chocolate went everywhere, on the pavement, on me, and all over the little girl’s dress.The mother came running, screaming at me. There were at least two people behind me and another woman on the church property who saw it happen. The mother kept yelling that I had ruined her daughter’s dress, that I owed her money for a new one, and that I needed to give her cash so she could buy a replacement before the ceremony. I told her it was an accident. Her daughter ran into me and I wasn’t paying for it. She kept screaming profanity, loud enough that someone called the police.When officers arrived, she tried to claim I threw the cake on her daughter and should pay for the dress. But another witness confirmed what really happened. The mother had told the girl to stop running, the girl ignored her, and she crashed into me, causing the cake to fall. The woman still wouldn’t calm down until the police nearly arrested her, and then only after her relatives came out of the church to help. She demanded reimbursement and threatened to sue me.At the time, no one exchanged information, but somehow she found out my name and address. Later, I learned someone had filmed the whole thing and the video got back to me. Sure enough, she served me with papers. She’s suing me for $3,000 for a new dress, assault, and emotional distress.Would I be the asshole if I countersued for the cost of the cake her daughter ruined because of her poor parenting? Honestly, I’m not too worried about winning or losing since I have video evidence and multiple witnesses showing it was an accident and her child caused it.Updating to clarify a few things, instead of keep repeating it in the comments.The cake was in a box with a lid, but when it hit the ground, it opened and exploded. It was a soft cake with a lot of chocolate icing, so it got all over my pants and the bottom of the little girl’s dress. It was enough that it was really noticeable.To clarify, I’m not mad at the little girl. I’m just completely gobsmacked by how her mother handled the situation. She could have taken some accountability, apologized, or even made it a learning opportunity for her child. Something as simple as, \"This is why when I tell you to stop running and listen, because now your dress is soiled for the wedding.\" But instead, she threw a fit, accused everyone else of her own poor parenting, and it escalated to the point where the police were called. After embarrassing herself and almost getting arrested, she still managed to act like the victim. She could have just let it go and moved on.For those wondering how she got my name and address: I don’t live in a highly populated area. I’m on social media, and the video of the incident was sent to me by someone I didn’t even know. Someone she knew must have recognized me. Once you have a name, finding an address isn’t difficult. She even had a processor serve me. I haven’t had any contact with her in any way since the incident.I’m also surprised by how many people believe you need a lawyer to file in small claims court. All I have to pay to countersue is $100. From what I’ve read, I technically can claim lost wages, but they won’t be granted. Realistically, the most I’d get back is my filing fee and the cost of replacing the cake.Some people have also said I should have been able to prevent the accident because I saw them before I crossed the street. That’s true, I did see them. But the little girl was on the grass the entire time. At no point did she step onto the sidewalk until the moment of impact. I’m not psychic, and there was no way I could have predicted she would suddenly run off the grass and straight into me. It all happened in literal seconds.Another Update:Tomorrow I'm going down to file my counterclaim, as today is a holiday. I spent the better part of a few days researching, and I think I'm going to ask for 1.00 plus my filing fee, and take a page out of celebrities who have been wrongly sued for stuff to prove a point. I don't want to look petty, but I sure want the judge to rip that woman a new one for bringing this fiviolous court to court. Thanks everyone.",

      "content_preview": "Previous post 1Previous post 2Thanks to everyone who took the time out to reply in my previous 2 posts btw. Really appreciate it.1st and foremost - I didn't get that job. Got a call from my old client contact to say they're going to try and cope with the resources they have in house for the foreseeable future and see if it's a success. But he stressed they thought I was great, I'm the sort of person they'd recruit if they were going to recruit so he said he'd keep my CV and details on file and if it doesn't work 6-12 months from now, I'd be first on the list for an interview. I personally think it's all a load of bollocks and I'll never hear from him again so if I do, I'll eat my own arse.I've also been applying for more jobs. One, a recruitment agent rang me about and it seemed promising but as typical UK recruitment agent bullshit, they then contacted me back not long after saying they didn't go for me but they'd keep my details on file, get in contact if there's anything suitable etc etc. Everything else is no good - either for less money or if it is ok, too far away in the country to even commute realistically. But I'm keeping my eyes open, and am very selective.I've checked out at work now and am doing the basics - I've had enough now, just don't want to be here anymore. I'm doing the minimum this week and also doing my contracted Hours - getting in on time, leaving on time, having my exact lunch break and not eating at my desk. People keep on asking me if I'm ok, I've just said yeah I'm fine. Also asking for my usual dad jokes as it's been a couple of weeks and I've said I don't have any.Our department deputy manager (Big Boss' deputy, not recently promoted colleague) came back from holiday Monday and was talking to us all and they mentioned about this work experience person who's coming in next month and she said the plan was for her to sit with me for the time she's with us and get me to show her things, Train her etc. I said no, I don't think I'm comfortable with it and to get her to sit with someone else. She said why and I said to chat with our manager/newly promoted colleague about it. She just went quiet and I didn't hear anymore (manager has been working from home so I haven't seen him).Also, we've been taking in some different work from the whole restructuring thing and there's this one task/procedure we're going to have to do - a few people in my team were talking about it including promoted colleague. Instantly, I knew the sorts of things we should do - create a new database/spreadsheet, get IT to write particular codes, write this sort of report to use and have people check in a certain way. But I kept quiet. Didn't say anything. Someone asked me \"what do you think, this is right up your alley this?\" I just said no idea, I think management should look at it. Which kind of ended my input in the conversation.Promoted colleague is now starting to train with the deputy in the tasks that she's going to take over from her and the manager in the restructure. Also she's been included in the teams managers calls/meeting. And I've seen it all in front of me. Feels like rubbing salt into the wound.I also didn't go to the celebratory meal that was held to celebrate promoted colleagues promotion last night - deputy manager and another colleague who's been on holiday too decided to book something as soon as they heard about the promotion and said we need an excuse to do something social. I said no, it's my Karate class and I'm not missing a lesson and people were going no come, don't be a Grinch, you can miss a lesson mate and weren't really giving me an opportunity to say no so I said I'll see what I can do (and we're at me all week) - and then I just didn't turn up. I had a few WhatsApp messages in the work group chat and texts but I said sorry, can't leave my class early. I just guarantee they'd be bitching about me, lol.It's my WFH day today myself and I've not heard from anyone this morning yet, not even to ask me any questions. I think people are catching on now. I dare say when I'm back in next week and manager is in the office, I'll probably be having a sit down with him and the deputy and have another \"chat\". Look forward to it (not), lol.",

      "content_preview": "It’s been like 2 days since my first post and so many people asked for an update and I definitely feel better when I get people’s advice but even before I made the post it had been maybe a week since the incident so I’ve had time to process everything since my post.Anyways, I have had very limited contact with my dad since the situation, I started my fall classes on the 27th  and before what happened I spoke to him everyday and told him about my classes but I’ve stopped and will only respond very small sentences if he texts me first because of how disgusted I am with him and I’m highly considering going no-contact.Yesterday morning, I convinced my mom to reach out to her mom over Facebook as she’s obviously closer to her than I am which she did. To paraphrase the message she told her about the relationship and that the entire neighborhood knew of the relationship and how she’s concerned about the power dynamic as the timeline doesn’t make sense since it’s hard to go from cordial neighbors to having sex all within just a week. Her mom responded saying that she’d be disgusted if she found out that what my mom was saying was the truth and that she and her husband (Kira’s father) would look into it.This morning my mom spoke to the woman who was the one that told her about the relationship and apparently there has been no peace in the neighborhood this morning and everyone’s talking about it apparently Kira’s dad and my dad had a veryyyy heated argument that ended with my dad storming away in his car, that Kira hasn’t been seen since yesterday afternoon and even this morning, and her car has been parked in the same spot all day. My mom texted Kira’s mom to ask about what happened after she got the news and Kira’s mom told her that she went through her phone when she fell asleep on the couch last night, everyone knows that Kira’s password is her birthday, and found messages that had subtle hints of flirting while she was still 16/17 but not enough to actually go to the police and say that they had a sexual relationship before her 18th birthday but two days after her party, my dad started sending her messages talking about how beautiful she looked which Kira thanked him for and sent a few flirty messages of her own, the messages turned sexual very fast and they went from texting each other about movies or Kira asking for advice on her car (before her birthday) to him asking her to do things to him and her happily accepting.According to the neighbor, Kira’s dad went over to my dads place at around 6am and beat on his door until he answered, a lot of the people on that street have jobs or have kids that have school and it woke them all up. They argued, Kira’s dad shoved him and the HOA man came over and broke it up which is why my dad left. When I was getting ready for class at around 12 today, he texted me telling me that I didn’t have to get Kira’s parents involved as she was an adult and that we could’ve talked it out as adults, I told him that he was still my dad and I love him as the man that raised me but I’m gonna love him from a major distance as I can’t get it out of my head that he more than likely groomed this girl. He said that I took their entire relationship out of context and that Kira was a willing participant. I told him that if I was in her spot and he was her dad then he’d be pissed. He completely ignored that message and started a new conversation about how legal was legal and despite her parents interfering, Kira wasn’t gonna stop loving him and he wasn’t going to stop what he was doing because the parents of an adult got involved. (Not the exact words but it gets the point across.)I told my mom about the conversation and she said that she’s sick thinking about the times Kira came over when we were a bit younger, maybe 16 and 13 and how he might’ve already been having ideas about her and how good she’d look when she turned 18. I don’t know when I’ll stop looking at my dad as a predator as I know how much I love the comfortable father/daughter relationship we had but I won’t allow him to normalize what he’s doing and can’t bring myself to even ask him what he’s gonna eat for dinner.Once again thanks for the advice guys and as her parents are just finding out I’ll probably have more updates depending on what happens.",

      "content_preview": "Our son (just turned 16) had a girlfriend (she's 16, almost 17) but they broke up about a month ago. About three weeks ago we were informed by her parents that she is pregnant. She is slightly showing. The dates line up with my son's relationship. My wife and I went into full panic mode.We waited a couple days before telling our son, who didn't know. He immediately said \"it's not mine, I never fucked her\". I didnt believe him as I know he is \"active\". He did the sensible thing and asked me for \"protection\".However he kept on saying they never did it. He said he cheated on her. I had a heart to heart with him and he is an absolute shithead but I began to believe him. He said he always wraps and he has asked for \"restocks\". My wife, on the other hand, still didn't believe him.Both families met. My wife started the conversation just accepting that our son is the father and was trying to figure out a solution, funding etc. My son spoke up saying it's not his baby as they never had sex. He was genuinely angry. Then he made a comment that Im going to rephrase. Apparently they only ever did a certain act which can't result in a baby and it was unsatisfactory so he never went any further with her. An absolute shithead and we raged at him over it.His ex girlfriend admits they rarely did it but explained the \"event\" (the when and where) and I will say it was believable too. I know hes a complete liar. I know he is an absolute dog but I believe him still.My wife, however, is angry with me for playing into his \"nonsense\". She said I'm part of the boy culture. She said children born to teen parents are more likely to be teen parents and we were both 17 when my wife got pregnant. She said I'm worsening the situation by not living in reality and she is left to figure out what to do on her own. To her point, I am hands off on further meetings with the other family. I don't believe we should have those discussions until its proven he's the dad.AITAH. Also this is really ranty. Im sorry but I needed to leave off some steam.Just to add: her parents don't want to do a paternity test until after the child is born. They said it could harm the baby but apparently its harmless so I don't know. So we cannot get a test done before then. Courts can't order one til birth.Another addition: I'm in the UK",

      "content_preview": "So my wedding was two weeks ago and I feel like I'm living in the wreckage of a bomb I set off myself. I’m so lost and I need to know if I’m the monster my family is making me out to be.I (28F) just married the love of my life (30M). His family is Arab Muslim, and they are, without exaggeration, the best people I have ever known. I’m an only child and my own family is really “complicated” And husband’s family welcomed me with open arms from day one, so for the first time, I felt like I had a real, supportive family unit. I’m basically an only child. My half-brother from my dad’s side is much older and he currently lives in Japan, and even though we don’t talk much, he still called me to congratulate me. As for my parents, they weren’t even supportive of my marriage until I told them I’d cut them off if they kept pushing. So yeah, I already knew going in that I couldn’t count on them for anything but drama.The wedding itself was perfect, for a while. Everyone was happy, even my parents were smiling at some point. Then there’s my cousin, “Mark” (35M). My aunt begged me to invite him and honestly - and yes I regret this - I couldn’t really say no because I didn’t want any drama. Mark is a walking disaster. He is a womanizer, has three children with three different women he abandoned, and his own father is the one sending them money. He’s just a user. But for my aunt, the sun shines out of his 🍑.So the night is winding down when I hear a scream. Not a happy one. I turn and see my youngest sister-in-law, “Layla” (19F), backed against a wall. My cousin Mark is standing in front of her, and he’s dripping wet. She’s the one who screamed, and she’s holding an empty water glass. So when I rushed over, Layla was visibly trembling. My other SIL told me what happened. Mark had cornered her, telling her she was \"too pretty to be hiding under that thing\" (her hijab) and that she was \"wasting her perfect face.\" Then, the part that made me even angrier, he apparently reached out and tried to tug it off her head to \"see her beautiful hair.\"(Backstory: my SIL had a traumatic accident years ago, and ever since then, she’s been uncomfortable around men. Even hugging her own dad and brother took years of patience and trust. So for her to be cornered at my wedding by my cousin telling her to take off her hijab, saying she was “too pretty” to be covering her hair, and pushing her like that…she was literally shaking).My older SIL, who is a force of nature, was already there and getting in his face. It was about to get physical. My father-in-law calmly stepped between them, looked at Mark, and said quietly but with absolute finality “It is time for you to leave my son's wedding.\"I thought that would be the end of it and was ready to console Layla. But then my aunt, Mark’s mother, stormed over. \"You can't kick him out! He was just joking with her! She’s being too sensitive!\" (First it was “he was complimenting her” then it became “he was just joking”).Before I could even speak, my own mother pipes up, \"I’m sorry but she’s right. This is a huge overreaction. Mark didn't mean any harm, that’s just how he is.\"Seeing Layla still shaking and looking so scared, and hearing my OWN mother defend this creep who had just assaulted my new sister… a switch flipped inside me and I just snapped.I looked straight at my aunt and said, \"No, he needs to leave. Now.\"She started up again, \"OP, you are not going to disrespect your family like this!”And I just let her have it. \"My family? You don’t get to lecture me about family, this is actually why your own is broken. This blind worship of your useless, good-for-nothing son is the reason you have one child who ruins every event he attends, and another who hasn't spoken to you in five years. And you dare wonder why your own daughter went no-contact? It’s because of THIS. Because you will always choose him over the people he hurts. So yes, he is leaving and you can leave with him if you want.\"The entire area went dead silent. Then my aunt started crying and stormed out with my cousin and my parents trailing behind after they gave me one of their classic “you are a disappointment” looks.My phone has been a nightmare since. Texts from my parents calling me cruel, vicious, and saying I used a family tragedy (my other cousin leaving) as a weapon. Telling me about how my aunt has just been sending them messages about how I broke her heart.My husband had been supportive, he kept telling me I was just defending Layla and that my family showed their true colors. But I can't get rid of these moments of guilt. Mark was 100% in the wrong. I’ve already cut him off, I don’t want him anywhere near me or my husband’s family again. But the part I keep thinking about is what I said to my aunt. I don’t regret defending my SIL (she was scared out of her mind, and I will always pick her over him) but maybe I went too far bringing up her daughter leaving. I know that’s a sore spot and I basically twisted the knife. I feel like I dropped a nuke to win a fistfight and now my entire family is radioactive. AITAH?",

      "content_preview": "The father of my son (4) left me for someone else when I (25f) was 6 months pregnant. Ex and this woman \"Mavis\" married when my son was 3 weeks old roughly. They demanded she come to his visits with our son and I refused. My reason? They said he needed to get to know his mom as well as his dad and she was definitely his mom now. They were married and everything! And yeah that's how they argued it.I never stopped him from seeing our son but I didn't allow her anywhere near my home and our son was 10 months old before ex could take him out for visitation. Then I could do nothing about her being there but at least she wasn't calling herself my son's mom in my home. She did join my ex every time he dropped our son home with me and she would try to start a fight because I wouldn't let her hold him to say goodbye once ex handed our son to me. She'd get mad I would refuse to let her spend time alone with our son too.Ex was awarded every other weekend visitation when our son was 18 months old. He lost that visitation when our son was 2 because his wife tried to take our son out of daycare without permission and the cops had to be called. He went back to visits at my house and she was not allowed near my house or my son. That softened after a few more months. She had to issue an apology and take some classes and then every other weekend restarted.Then my ex died last year. My son was with me at the time so there was no fight to get him back or her trying to run with him or anything, and I think she'd have tried to keep my son if ex died during his visitation weekends.Mavis then tried to sue me for shared custody as his other parent. That case was thrown out because she was not a legal parent and had no parental rights to my son. Instead she tried to sue for visitation and unfortunately that went to court. It took a few months and we had two dates before the judge in order to get a ruling. She was denied visitation. It was decided she had not played a big enough role in my son's life AND she wasn't his family anymore. I was relieved. Mavis was screaming about appeals as we left court.She tried to confront me a week after court and I was feeling so done with her shit and I taunted her and told her she would never be in my son's life again and go fuck herself because she's all alone now and with the way she acts it didn't surprise me. She started screaming after me but I kept going.It was only afterward I wondered if it was unfair because she did lose my ex and she might have felt some genuine care for my son. IDK. I think she's just unhinged. But maybe I was still an AH.AITA?",

      "content_preview": "Throwaway account,I had an affair with a married man, I had no idea that he was married but once i found out it took some time for me to cut it off ( 2 days) because i was looking for a way to end it without ME getting the blame from my parent., i was pregnant and by that time it was too late to abort my daughter, I came to find out that his wife was also pregnant and about to give birth in a couple of weeks, i told her and she cursed me out and told me to leave her husband alone even though that's what I planned on doing. I was able to find his parents contact info and messaged them asking if they wanted a relationship with their grandchild and telling them about the affair etc, i felt that there was no need for my daughter to be deprived of having grandparents because her father lied, his parents demanded a paternity test and when it was revealed that their son was the father they ended up calling me a homewrecker and other degrading words, they called MY daughter a bastard and said that she wouldn't be apart of their family.They compared my daughter to their daughter in laws soon to be born child and said that they wanted a real grandchild, fast forward, their \"real\" grandchild ends up having down syndrome, my daughters fathers siblings came to find out through their parents that i had a child and wanted to be apart of her life, it turns out that their sil ( my daughters fathers wife) was a \"daughter in law from hell\" and that they did not like her behaviour, that she was rude, racist, etc. I agreed to let them have a relationship with my daughter as she was their kids' cousins.I ended up meeting my current husband and together we have 4 kids, my daughters aunts and uncles ended up going NC with their parents and their brother ( my daughters BIO dad) after they tried multiple times to invite themselves to their house when ever my daughters aunts and uncles had her for a sleepover or just to get a glimpse of her and take pictures to SEND THEM to her son and daughter in law, for what reason? I have no idea,My daughter is currently 17 and she KNOWS that she has a half sibling who has down syndrome and that she is an affair child. She has a good relationship with her cousins, aunts and her \"half siblings\"( my other kids from my husband). My in-laws sent me a message that they were going for \"grandparent rights\" and that my daughter's biological father and his wife were going to court to get some kind of custody  of MY daughter. Mind you, my daughter has NEVER once met them and refuses to meet them.AITA??",

But she hated her new body, and she felt ugly despite all my compliments. Over the years, she gained more weight and felt worse about herself. More recently, she cheated on me. She had felt so low about herself she wanted to see if men who \"didn't have to love her\" would find her sexy. I \"didn't have to love her\" because we have a child together, I love her because she's her. We're getting a divorce and I wanted the process to be peaceful.

      "content_preview": "My mom died when I (16) was a baby. When I was 4.5 my dad remarried my stepmom and her and my stepsister (same age as me) moved in with us. After my dad remarried he told my maternal family that they had to treat my stepsister like a grandchild/niece/cousin or they wouldn't get to see me and they refused so dad stopped them seeing me for a while, which gave them a case to take to court and they were given court appointed visitation with me because it was considered in my best interest. It wasn't a lot of contact but I used to love getting to see and spend time with them.It always caused trouble with my dad and stepmom and my stepsister because they didn't think it was fair. My dad used to badmouth my maternal family all the time to me. He told me they were tiny people who couldn't open their hearts and homes to another grandchild and he said that was wrong because blood doesn't make a family and they should have accepted anyone from his family into theirs. After a couple of years my dad and stepmom both tried to reconcile with their own families but it didn't work out. My stepsister didn't know her dad's family and because of that I was told it was cruel to keep the relationship with my extended family when she wasn't included. My stepmom tried to adopt me a few times and she told me I was hers as much as my stepsister and we'd all be one family if we adopted each other. I wasn't on board and I found out a few months ago adoption was mentioned because it would have ended all visits between me and my maternal family.Things only got worse when my half sister was born and my dad tried to fight the visitation order. He even tried to move us but they couldn't secure jobs or a home for us in any of the states where the visitation would be ignored. They did try moving us a few hours away but it just meant actual overnights with my grandparents.Last Christmas things got a lot more troubled because my grandparents bought me a car and my dad was furious because I left it at my grandparents house. He and my stepmom wanted my sister and I to share it and I told them there was no way that was happening. Then my half sister had a recital that fell on an already planned overnight with my grandparents and I refused to change the date to be at the recital. My stepsister complained that she had to be there but not me, which I was blamed for her attitude toward our half sister. On another visitation overnight my grandparents took me and some friends to a concert and my stepsister was going with her friends but ended up having to call my stepmom to pick her up. My grandparents wouldn't take her with us and even though my stepsister had already called her mom to come and get her it was like my grandparents were the most evil ever for saying no.When I got back to dad's house I was told I had to make a decision and choose who mattered more my blended family or my maternal family and I said my maternal family. So dad and my stepmom told my grandparents to come take me to live with them since I had chosen them. They didn't think my grandparents would actually come but they did and they made sure they got my birth certificate and other stuff before we left.My dad's still angry that I chose my maternal family and he says he can't believe I would choose them over my immediate family as he called it. I told him they never spoke bad about him or my blended family like they did all my immediate family. Even kid cousins who are literally younger than me!! My stepmom left me a voice message where she was crying that I shouldn't have left, she misses me and feels like she lost a child and how I should come back and all will be okay. When I didn't call her back she left an angry one saying I'm a cold hearted b#tch to not say anything or even reassure her that I still love her.AITA?",

      "content_preview": "Last weekend, I (39M) helped my son (14M) dye his hair purple. (Or, my good friend who actually knew what he was doing helped dye my son's hair while I was there for music requests and object fetching.) It was such a fun day, and I could tell how happy it made my boy.I didn't tell my wife before we did this, and that was the catalyst to the fight we're currently having. But for me, it's so much more than this one incident.My wife has been hands off with our child for a while now. His soccer games, little road trips to nearby amusement parks, back to school shopping. She's too busy with work, or too tired from work. So, I've mostly just stopped having the conversations. Why would I waste my breath to have the same conversations on repeat?The night we dyed his hair, she started crying while we were talking saying we were making all of these memories without her. I asked he what she expected me to do. If we waited for her to make memories, we would be sitting in a dark room 100% of the time. My son isn't even really comfortable with her anymore. There is no 'I can't take you, go ask your mom.' Now it's, 'I'm sorry I can't take you, let me see if (friend) is free that day.'My wife isn't speaking to me now, and I'm wondering if I took it too far. I don't know. I was hoping some brutal honesty would change something. I would've loved having more kids, but I guess it's for the best now that she said no.EDIT: I’m a stay at home dad. The original plan was for me to start working again when our son went to kindergarten, but my wife was gunning for a promotion around that time and asked me to stay out home longer. Once she got the promotion, her hours increased, so that time was extended once again. I am responsible for all the household chores and general home-making tasks. I cook, clean, do all the yard work, all the grocery shopping, etc. I do enjoy being a stay at home dad, but I’ve been ready and willing to rejoin the workforce for a decade now. At this point, I will be getting a job when my son turns 16 and can get himself to and from school.But my wife still refuses to cut her hours even if I get a job, and gets frustrated every time I bring it up. There is no point in me forcing my son to ride the bus or figure out a ride for himself if my wife still won’t make the effort or compromise in order to spend time with him.",

We both love horror movies, and I especially enjoy the Conjuring franchise. Since the trailer came out, I reminded her multiple times about our plan and how excited I was.Two weeks ago, she suddenly told me she’d be going with her boyfriend and two guy friends to watch the movie at night, and she wanted to include me too. I felt a little bad because she didn’t ask me first before changing our original plan, but I agreed anyway.This month, I kept reminding her to book tickets since seats were filling fast. She told me not to worry because her friend would handle it. Then, two days ago, she came to my room and said, “I’ve got bad news,” while smiling. I immediately guessed she had canceled. She explained that one of her guy friend’s moms had invited them all for lunch the same day as our plan, and after lunch, they would also be going to watch the same movie. She told me she wouldn’t be coming with me.I had no problem with her going to the lunch, but I felt hurt that she still went ahead with the movie plan with them when she already knew how excited I was to watch it together. I felt disregarded because she had seen me eagerly waiting, updating her daily, and reminding her about tickets. What made it worse was the way she broke the news while smiling, as if it didn’t matter.We argued, and I ended up saying “f you,” which I regret. Later, she said she’d go with me another day, but I don’t want her to come just out of obligation.I know it’s a small incident, but I felt disrespected, ignored, hurt, and lonely. She’s one of my best friends, and I thought she would understand without me having to explain. I’m not angry, just hurt. She did reach out today asking if I’m still mad, and I told her I need some time.I love her dearly, and I know things will go back to normal soon, but right now I don’t feel like talking to her.So, AITA for feeling this way?",

      "content_preview": "First time using redit. So hopefully I can get some advice. So basically I found out that my (I'm 21)younger sister (she's 16) is had sex with a 18 year old. She, in the past was in a relationship and has told me she had sex with him too. But they have broken up. She has recently started going for walks with a guy saying they were just friends. It has been about a month or so. And she said last week something happened when they were out. ( She isn't on birth control, but apparently wrapped it) I had a chat with her and told her how stupid it is that she shouldn't even be doing that at 16. She told me that she knows that it is a bad decision but I said if you know it is a bad decision why would you continue to make the bad decision. It doesn't make sense to me. I am wondering if I should tell my mom even though I would be betraying her. But I would hopefully stop her from making bad decisions. I would hope my mom would stop her from going out. But I am not sure she would. I have told her before that I have caught her smoking joints and Mom hasn't done anything. When I had a chat with my sister she was laughing under her breath. I told her that it isn't funny. I know some of you could think I am being a prude, but seriously this is disgusting and controlling. But this makes me feel sick, I shouldnt turn my back on my sister but I don't want to be around her.Please I need some advice. I need do something I think. Part of me thinks I should tell mom in front of my sister so she can't back track and she has to face it.",

My boyfriend was already up and in the bathroom. When he came back I asked him if he spilled something in the bed or knew why it was wet. He told me that he thinks he peed the bed. I asked him again and said “wait are you serious??” And he said “I think I peed in my dream and peed in real life.We are both half awake at this point and I’m just surprised that he actually did wet the bed. I asked him to go grab stuff to clean it up and he told me that it was fine. I asked him what he meant by that and he grabbed a towel, laid it on the wet spot and got back into bed to go to sleep.I pulled the covers off of him and told him that he needs to go grab stuff to clean it up because I don’t want it to get stained and it’s a new mattress and we don’t have a mattress cover for it yet. He told me that it was fine and I’m over reacting. That statement naturally pissed me off and I told him I’m not going to sleep in his piss and that’s not fair to me. He told me he’d clean it in the morning and that it’s not a big deal and doesn’t warrant the reaction I have.That was not the solution I wanted so I took all the sheets off the bed and threw them at him and told him to sleep on the couch. It was very irritating hearing him tell me that I’m over reacting because I asked him to clean up his peed in the bed we both slept in.He then knocked on the door ten minutes later asking for a new blanket because the one I gave him smelled like pee.So, AITAH for over reacting to my boyfriend not cleaning up the pee in the bed right away?Update: belowhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/hFQm5yYIyK",

I was pregnant however we hadn’t told anyone yet because we were waiting on my doctor appointment to officially confirm.Anyways my husband asked my MIL IF we can sleep in her upstairs in her moms old room (which used to be my husband room) and that she didn’t need to clean it we just needed some new sheets and stuff because it’s close to the bathroom and has better air circulation. She agreed and said yes!The week before we are about to leave she calls crying and saying she doesn’t feel comfortable with us sleeping in there and if we don’t want to stay in the basement then we need to stay in the hotel. Now a hotel wasn’t initially in our cards because we were only staying for a short time but I then felt uncomfortable and we paid for the hotel.2 weeks later I heard that she allowed her family friend to stay in the same room we asked to stay in and she didn’t feel uncomfortable with her.It’s been 4 years now and we have yet to stay at her house again.  And she doesn’t even offer!",

I would save the rest for whatever I needed to spend it on. My husband decided that was the wrong way to use it and he needs to pay off his CC first so he can buy all his other things he “needs” to buy. (Basically racking his card back up to $2k after he pays off his CC). I wouldn't see a dime to help my bills at all. He says it’s for the good of the family but I have a different idea of how that should go to help us. I am pissed. He doesn’t think I should be.

      "content_preview": "For context, 29 F 32 weeks pregnant. His moms were extremely pushy on me getting pregnant as we were a new couple, I get pregnant in January found out 5 weeks later and that’s when they started planning everything. Booking halls, caterers, ect. No matter how many times I told them I didn’t want it to be big or do too much bc I’m just not that kind of person they assured me they wanted it big so they will take care of it. All I had to do was show up. Fast forward to this week where they then say they can no longer pay for it and expect us to shell out 2000$ in the next week or 2 to pay for the whole thing knowing we just had to move, I’m working less bc I’m extremely pregnant and going on leave in about a month or so. I said cancel it. I just won’t have one. Which is hard to do since this is my first baby I’ve dreamed about the shower since they started planning it. Did I mention his mom is supposed to make all the decorations and the hall we were having it at was a friend of hers who gave us a “big discount”? Now she’s telling me she feels bad for the hall lady bc she could have given the date to someone else but not for me who is missing out on a shower for my first baby and their grandchild? It’s not worth the stress of trying to throw something else together or put ourselves behind to pay for this shower right before baby comes? I feel cheated. I didn’t get the maturnity pictures or 3D ultrasound they promised either. Feeling defeated. AITAH?",

      "content_preview": "My daughter (16f) and I (43f) love eating at authentic Asian restaurants. We had to pick my son (12) up at a Korean BBQ about 40 mins from our house (it was a party with another family). I suggested to my husband (44M) of 25 years that he and the two other kids can have whatever they wanted for dinner and my daughter and I would get Korean BBQ at this restaurant. He said no, we should all go as a family. I reminded him that he and the other kids aren't big fans of Korean BBQ and it would be cheaper to eat separately. He insisted on everyone going.When we get to the restaurant and he sees the menu he complains he doesn't know what to order and complains about the price. The other kids followed suit. I suggested they go eat in another restaurant in the plaza andy daughter and I will get the Korean food. It smelled so amazing btw. We waited 20 mins for a table and he continued to make comments about the price. Even told me \"you better not order anything fancy\". That was the last straw. I got up and went to the van. Everyone followed. I said I was taking everyone home and my daughter and I would go on our own to a local Korean BBQ.We did exactly that. Everyone else had McDonald's and played Roblox. I get home and he is fuming saying that I owe everyone an apology. I refused. I said I had zero remorse. It seemed like everyone was happy but him and went to bed. I slept perfectly fine. He's still mad. So, AITA for taking my daughter out for a dinner and leaving everyone else to do their own thing?",

      "content_preview": "I (30f) recently got married and had a baby.  My sister (24) does not like my husband and will not tell me why.  When I first brought him home to introduce everyone, she was a bit standoffish but in general she doesn't really like people, very few friends, never brings anyone home to meet the family and has never wanted to spend time with anyone I brought home.  Before my husband and I got married, I asked her if she had any issues with him, she said no and and that he seemed nice.  I asked her to be my maid of honor and thought all was well.Fast forward to last week, my husband goes to drop off something at the family home (sister lives with my parents) and came back looking shaken.  I asked him what happened and he said he knocked and went into the kitchen and my sister told him my parents weren't home.  He said he tried to give her the stuff I had asked him to drop off and she told him to put it in the garage (it was food), even though they were in the kitchen.  He said as he was picking the stuff back up to go he tried making small talk, commenting about the weather and she snapped at him, saying don't $&@#ing talk to her and stormed out of the room.My husband has never given me reason to worry about him being inappropriate or anything but that was where my mind first went.  We live near them and he had been gone for less than 5 minutes.  I called my sister to ask what happened and she hung up on me, messaged her and she ignored me until this morning when I bombarded her phone with messages because I wanted to resolve whatever was going on.  She finally replied and basically said she hates him, has always hated him and her only boundary is that he never talks to her.  In the 7 years we have been together, they've spoken maybe 5 times and that was mostly him greeting her .I asked her why and she said she doesn't need a reason, she just doesn't like him and doesn't want him around. I asked her point blank if he had done or said something to make her feel like that and she said he didn't do anything and that she doesn't need a reason to feel how she does.Now my family is very close, my other sibling (brother 29)  and I sometimes dropped by unannounced to help my mom cook dinner or just hang out, my parents encourage this as they say they like having us around.  I told her it's going to be weird if he can't even just greet her when we come over.  She said she was sick of me having a stranger in her home .  I told her I didn't realize she felt that way about him and said I wouldn't ask him to drop stuff without me being around anymore.  (Mind you she's had 7 years to get to know him and I didn't realize she still considered him a stranger).She then said that that was not the point, that she didn't want him talking to her at all and that was the boundary she wanted respected.  I told her that I would tell him and try to keep them apart but that would mean her time with my son, her nephew (6 months) would be affected because my husband will not be comfortable with our son being around someone who hates him (frankly I'm now uncomfortable with it too because I don't know what ideas she will try to put in his head).  It's also going to affect my parents time with him because if my husband can't bring him around it's going to affect the amount of times he goes over there, I didn't tell her but that hurts my heart because they absolutely adore my son, he's their first and only grandchild so far and they love spending time with him, always telling us to bring him over.She said I was playing the victim, painting her as a *itch and trying to trample the only boundary that she has set for herself.  I'm currently thoroughly lost and trying to figure out the best way forward. AITAH here (and is there any way I can fix this situation).Edit I never expected so many replies in such a short time, but I appreciate the responses. To clarify a few things and answer some questions:I've mentioned it to my parents and they're aware of what happened, my mom said she'll sit my sister down for a conversation but from what I hear my sister keeps making reasons to avoid it (busy, tired, wanting more time etc).  My dad says not to worry about it and it will blow over, my dad had a heart attack recently and is currently recovering so I don't want to push it with them right now and stress him out so I left it at that with him and changed the subject.My partner is amazing and has never given me reason to worry about him being around any females, I admit I was worried he had done something when he told me how she responded because I can't wrap my brain around why she would blow up over just small talk but she herself said he didn't do anything.I know my brother has had partners but he hasn't brought any home, I myself didn't bring anyone home until I was serious about them and thought there might be a future (brought home a grand total of 2 guys, current partner and my ex from college).Regarding her mental health, she has always had a bad temper, has snapped at me many times with no apology even when she realized later she was wrong (e.g accused me of taking her shoes which she had actually just left in the vehicle).  There has never been anything on this level before.",

      "content_preview": "Am I the asshole for asking my husband to shower (2nd shower of the day) before I give him a bj?Context: he showers in the morning. Our schedules usually align at night and that’s when we do the deed. He walked the dog after work and since I know he wants a bj, I asked him to shower. He jokingly asked “ why the stipulations? You used to always do that after we’d been at the bar all night, etc”. And he’s right, but that’s when we were young and drunk. I just told him it’s more pleasurable for me if he’s clean. He has good hygiene but after 12 hours + walking the dog, it’s bound to be a little funky.Edit: I shower twice day because I like going to work and bed clean. So not an issue on my endEdit: this isn’t a joke. Simply wanting to know if my request is unreasonable. I don’t ask him to shower every time- sometimes he’s already showered beforehand. But I have asked him to shower a few times and his response has always been that he didn’t sweat and showered earlier in the day. I never want to make him do anything or give him an “ultimatum” but the comments were definitely helpful for both of us!FINAL UPDATE: after a few days, I learned my husbands biggest question with my request to shower was “why the change?” Well it’s not sudden- I’ve always preferred a shower fresh D. We’ve been together 7 years and I’m no longer 23, drunk and in lust. His definition of a “shower” is different than mine. I take many types of showers- sometimes solely to shave, a body rinse, or a full hair wash shower. His only definition of a shower is a full hair wash routine or he doesn’t feel clean. We’ve come to an understanding, are happily married, and neither of us are assholes.",

      "content_preview": "I (20m) moved out of my mom's (42f) house a couple of years ago when I went to college. Until 10 months ago I had my own room there but her fiancé (45m) and his two kids (6m and 4f) moved in with her. The 4 year old has a host of disabilities. I know they have a seizure disorder and a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta. But I believe there's another one involving paralysis or spasms of the stomach/esophagus. My mom took classes for over two months before her fiancé moved in so she would know how to take care of his daughter. Her fiancé's ex is totally out of the picture so mom decided she would need to step up completely, which I get.I have been back twice since mom's fiancé moved in with his kids. The first time was at Christmas and I stayed with my grandparents because my old room went to the 4 year old and there was no spare room for me. My mom was disappointed but I pointed out it would stop me getting in the way of their routine too.The second time was late June/early July I was home for a few weeks and again stayed with my grandparents. Mom offered to buy a pull out bed for me but I said I was good with my grandparents. When I was home and whenever I went to mom's I was asked if I had looked into taking the same classes mom had or if I'd like them to set me up with them. I said no and asked why I'd need to take them. Mom said she had hoped I would want to help them. She said it would mean I could step in if an emergency came up and I told mom she'd be better to find someone professional for that because I was not taking on that responsibility. Her fiancé asked if I'm just never going to stay at the house and I said yes. I told them I would have zero privacy if I slept there and it wouldn't benefit any of us. I pointed out how they'd be so busy anyway that I wouldn't have time with mom that much and I'd get just as much staying somewhere else and planning ahead of time to visit when she's not super busy.Her fiancé then said it sounded like I didn't want to learn how to care for his daughter and planned to be limitedly involved with him and his kids. I said I'll see them when I see mom but I won't be signing up for babysitting or future caregiver responsibilities. Mom and I went for a walk together after I said that and she told me she got it but that she hoped I'd be willing. She said it's a lot to ask and I don't even live that close anymore so it would never be all the time but she asked me if I was really that unwilling to even give them a few hours off when I would visit. She said it would be so helpful. I told her I would visit and want to spend time with her but babysitting her future stepkids was not in my plans. And especially not one so medically complex and in need of specific care. She was upset but let it go.Her fiancé is holding a grudge about it. He brought it up to my grandparents when Christmas was brought up. They said they got the feeling he was also annoyed they gave me a place to stay during my visits because it gives me an excuse not to get closer to his kids and therefore be more willing to learn how to take care of his daughter.AITA?",

      "content_preview": "I know how nuts this sounds, but my mother is extremely Catholic.I (38 F) had to move back in with family after I lost my apartment. I'm grateful to have a roof over my head, and I do love my family. My father (the sane parent) is having some health issues, and I'm staying here also to look after him, and assist my family finanicially, as it's a big help when my mother doesn't work, and hasn't in years.However, moving back in seems to have given my mother the idea that I've turned back into an underage teenager.I have a gay friend, \"Gary.\" I cannot admit to having gay friends due to my mother's extreme religious views. She believes associating with gay people can lead to \"demons attaching themselves to you\" and would go on a screeching, crying war-path if she ever found out that I have several gay friends. Therefore, I've just never mentioned Gary is gay. Gary is fine with this, he actually thinks it's absolutely hilarious that she somehow thinks he's straight.Gary asked me to stay at his, as he's just had a bad breakup and needed a friend. I mentioned I was staying at his, said he'd just split up with someone and needed me (didn't mention he'd broken up with another man) and I wouldn't be home, now my mother thinks something romantic is going on between us.She asked me \"well, where are you sleeping at his?\" annoyed, I said \"wherever I pass out\" to which she replied \"you said he's just had a breakup, but what if he wants something from you now that he's single?? What if he has bad intentions and wants something else from you?!\"Decades of repression, forced secrecy and rage suddenly came to the surface. I laughed in her face, called her ridiculous, and said \"well, if he does, I'll be very happy since I've not had sex a while, and frankly, I miss it!\"This is first time I've ever admitted to being a sexual being to my mother, and I'm pushing 40. You would think I'd just slapped her. She started crying, wailing, trashing the hallway, ripped down all the family photos off the walls and kept screaming that I'd \"ripped her heart out\" and \"destroyed the family.\"That was last weekend, and she's barely left her room since. She has been lying in bed all week, crying and refusing food because her nearly 40 year old daughter isn't a virgin anymore. I haven't been a virgin for nearly 20 years, and I deeply resent all the time I had to pretend to be one, just to stop her histrionics. She says she can't even look at me and I apparently have \"no respect for myself.\"My dad admits she's going way overboard, but says I shouldn't have said what I did as she is a sensitive person, this wasn't the hill to die on, and how much sex deeply offends her. She cannot even say the word \"sex\" without whispering, and here I was admitting to having it.I get that her religious beliefs are strong, but at the same time, I feel she needs to get a stronger grip on reality and stop with the endless dramatics. I am not a child anymore. I am not bringing men to her house, I have never even asked to do that, despite assisting her house financially. My body is simply not hers to control outside of the house. I probably shouldn't have said it so crudely, but who gets upset, let alone THIS UPSET that their nearly 40 year old daughter has the audacity to have a sex life?",

      "content_preview": "My mom hardly ever throws parties for her birthday, but this year for her 50th birthday she wanted to do something special and we were all excited to do it, but I found out that my youngest sister would be attending. And I refuse to go.My sister said a little over a year in prison for her part and some pretty aggressive bullying of a young girl that went to her high school. This ended with a young girl taking her own life. My sister was 18 at the time so she was charged as an adult still getting a pretty small charge. Only serving about 1 1/2 years of it. She’s just got out and is doing probation.She’s staying with her dad for most of this so I didn’t expect her to come to the birthday party, but after finding out that she would be invited I quickly canceled. Stating outright that I would not come if she came.Legitimately I’ve always seen my younger sister as a mean girl. She’s always been mean she’s just always been a bad person in my view. Since about middle school, we’ve had issues with her bullying girls. She doesn’t get along with other girls. She’s extremely pretty so she’s been able to easily attract boys that she really just used, and had already started cheating when she was 15. She’s just never treated another human with respect.after I decided I wasn’t going to come my mom tried to guilt trip me saying that my younger sister had had a hard time and that she miss me. I told her I really didn’t care and that I was disgusted with how she had behaved so my mom went into a rant about how my younger sister had a horrible time, locked up and had suffered a lot of abuse ranging from being attacked by other inmates to being SA’d. I told her that no one deserve to be treated that way, but I have no empathy for my sister. The way she had treated other human beings and especially that young girl were so inhuman that I had no empathy to spare for her.My mom feels like I’m being too harsh on her and that it’s not right for me to not feel bad for her to not come, but honestly, I don’t know if I can hold my temper there, especially if she’s trying to victimize herself.Am I the A hole?",

We both adore chickens and animals in general, she met my lizards and loved them. She also wants to be a veterinarian. Everything was great!Until we went out to eat with our other friend Emma. I got chicken tenders and Lindsey's face just dropped and she says, \"I thought you loved chickens\". I said \"I do, after reptiles ducks and chickens are my favorite animals, but I'm not vegan or vegetarian.'I didn’t think anything of it until she goes, \"If you really loved animals you wouldn't eat them.\" I was shocked and my friend Emma was uncomfortable. I said I do love animals and they saved my life growing up in an horrible home and I couldn't live without my skink.She then goes on to tell me that she thought better of me since I wanted to be a vet and had animals but it was unfortunate how I was a fake animal lover. She even went so far to say I shouldn't own animals if I eat them. My skink saved me from suicide multiple times so I got so mad and told her if she felt that way maybe she should make sure to only make vegan friends in the future and left.She has tried to text me that she was only trying to help me out by seeing the truth and I clearly hate vegans but I blocked her. I didn't want to hear it. She texted Emma about it, Emma is on my side but thinks I should hear her out because we had hit it off so well. We've only been friends for a month but Emma says it's not worth ruining a friendship over and we should smooth things out.",

      "content_preview": "My parents are divorced and they have me (16m) as their only kid. My dad's still single but my mom's married again. Her husband has a 10 year old daughter so my stepsister. I split time equally between my parents. I'm at mom's house for a week then I go home to dad the other week and I switch back over. My relationship with dad is better. Mom's always been a little too demanding. One thing that has pissed people off is she texts me during school and expects me to answer. She asks me to do stuff for her and I could be in the middle of class. My dad and most of my teachers encouraged me to let her know my phone was going on silent until I was finished for the day and I started doing it.My mom even called my school before to say they needed to get me to text her back or call her. And I wish I was joking but I'm not.Stuff she'll ask is for me to pick up milk at the store on my way home, or to pick up takeout that she ordered and since she got married again it might be to walk my stepsister home from school or to take her somewhere. I don't drive so mom gets me to do it walking. She even made me stand outside my stepsister's basketball practice for an hour once because she insisted I had to go and pick her up before going to her house.Back in April I had after school stuff and I kept my phone on silent and didn't check because I didn't want to deal with mom saying she needed me to pick up something or whatever. When I was finished I saw mom had texted and said I needed to pick my stepsister up from some girl scouts/camping thing. Then there was a call I missed and a voice note where mom was screaming at me because they got a call that my stepsister had been knocked down by a bike and was at the hospital. I get to mom's house and nobody's there so I just do my homework and wait. Mom gets home a few hours later and tells me my stepsister walked on her own because nobody came to pick her up and she wasn't being careful and got run over. And that she was too young to walk alone. I told mom it wasn't my fault and it made mom blow a fuse because she thought I should feel more bad or whatever. We argued over how she knows I have after school stuff and she said family should take priority over any stuff.She chewed dad out for siding with the school on the phone thing and he chewed her out for blaming me.Now every time I'm at her house we fight and she told me I should be ashamed for my lack of feeling bad. Her husband is 100% on her side and he's an ass anyway so that doesn't surprise me. My stepsister broke one of her legs and she has damage done to her other knee and it's likely a long term/forever thing. But I don't feel like it's my fault when I never agreed to pick her up. They just didn't plan better.My mom keeps saying it's disgusting that I keep defending myself over this.AITA?",

He reached out to me (30 M) to crash on my couch for a bit until he gets his life together. I agreed and have been buying him groceries and putting gas in his car until he finds his footing. I only had ONE rule: he cant bring any girls over to stay the night. Its been 3 weeks and he has done it twice now.. The first time he said he was drunk and it was an accident. This second time he just blatantly said \"I'm sorry I need to get one out.\" I told him its fine she can stay the night but he has to leave with her in the morning. It wasn't me being jealous, its just a matter of respect.",

      "content_preview": "I (34f) have a 14 year old son with my ex (34m). There has been a lot of difficulty in our relationship as parents and I cannot call us co-parents. I have tried a few times. But my ex hates me, blames me for his bad choices and holds it against me that I would not let his wife, aka the woman he left me for while I was pregnant, to our son's birth. Because I wouldn't allow his wife (girlfriend at the time) to be in the delivery room with me he refused to come and he has spent 14 years blaming me for that.He has stated I took away his chance to be present for the birth of his first child. But not only that, he also accused me of keeping him away from our son for the first five months of his life when HE was the one who did not reply to any texts or attempts to set up time for him to meet and spend time with our son. His extended family all met our son before he did. Even a couple of his cousins who live in another state met our son before him.Eventually he filed for full custody and was awarded visitation instead. We were forced to take co-parenting classes together and he tried to include his wife, who was his wife by this point, but the judge told him co-parenting would be between me and him, not me and his wife. The classes didn't help. Instead of taking anything said on board he decided he would forever tell our son he wasn't at his birth and didn't meet him until he was 5 months old. Of course he told our son I was the reason for all of this. My son was so confused for a while. But once my son knew the truth or a version of it, his relationship with his dad and his dad's wife suffered. The reason his relationship with her suffered is because she was right alongside my ex blaming me and she had her own part to play in things my son was told.Add to this my ex has repeatedly said around or to our son that he was lucky to be at the birth of the four children he had with his wife. How it made a big difference to the bond and relationship. How he felt like a real father when he finally saw his child being brought into the world. My ex thought it would make our son hate me, he thought our son would believe everything he and his wife told our son. But all it did was push our son away and strain all the relationships.My ex didn't want our son in therapy but I petitioned the court for him to receive therapy and I have petitioned for full custody before. Even with the backing of my son's therapist custody remains 50-50 and my son needs to be 16 before he could influence custody. For more than four years now he has wanted to live with me full time but it's just not happening.Recently my son was in the hospital for a small surgery. It was relatively minor and he's doing great since. But ex didn't show up until after our son was taken to the operating room and he didn't show up to see our son but to whine to me about our son not liking him or his family. He told me I need to fix whatever I did because I have cost him enough of a relationship with our son. He said he couldn't understand our son's bad relationship with him and his family. That he was so sure our son would love the other kids and his wife because they're a family. I told him to look in the mirror instead of pointing fingers at me, that he's been an awful father to our son and if he took any time to reflect on his choices regarding him then he would see it.My ex left the hospital after again blaming me for everything around the birth and the first five months. He said if I hadn't been spiteful and just let his woman (what he called her) be there then none of this would have happened. He accused me of being vindictive in keeping THEM from the birth of THEIR first born.He has sent around a dozen messages through the co-parenting app blaming me for everything and saying I'm still vindictive and petty. My attorney has made a note of everything and at this time I don't plan to go for custody again unless something bigger changes because I'll be throwing money away. None of this is hugely different to any other time I tried so I feel very stuck. And the reason I'm posting here is I worry this will make things worse for my son because I pissed his father, and probably his wife, off more than they already were.AITA?",

      "content_preview": "I (25F) work in a fairly large lab where we have to get into suits to work with our equipment everyday. I’m the only woman so they use my changing area as extra storage for the lab.  Due to this one of my male supervisors (M60s) keeps crossing lines.First time: he walked straight into the women’s changing area while I was mid-change. No knock, no warning. I don’t know if he saw me undressed because he left very quickly after I yelled “hello?” He later told me he was going in there to grab something.Second time: he actually announced himself before coming in, but then brought in contractor/maintenance worker I didn’t know, saying she (the contractor) needed to “check something.” The doorway was blocked so I couldn’t leave, and when I said I wasn’t comfortable, I was told multiple times to “just deal with it because she’s a woman.” I felt trapped  and humiliated.For the record: I don’t mind changing around other woman coworkers (if I had any…) But strangers being walked in without warning is not the same. He could have called or texted me to warn me about her.Third time: I was working on an experiment in the lab (using sensitive equipment to record measurements), and he kept interfering — opening and closing parts of the setup while I was running data collection, which completely messed up my results. I asked him to stop, he didn’t. The second I called another supervisor over, he suddenly shut it down and acted totally normal.I filed a formal complaint and even asked that he not be in authority over me while this is sorted out, because I was worried about retaliation. HR basically brushed it off, acted like no rules were broken, and refused to take any action. Now I feel like I always have to have another person around anytime I interact with him, just to protect myself.So now I’m second-guessing: AITA for reporting him at all when HR doesn’t think it’s a big deal?TL;DR: Male supervisor walked into the women’s changing area without warning, later brought in a contractor/maintenance worker while I was changing and told me to “just deal with it,” then sabotaged my lab work until another boss showed up. I filed a complaint, but HR acted like no rules were broken and refused to act. AITA?",

We don’t really talk to his family much since the divorce outside of this one cousin or two that are really nice. Our cousin had their engagement party on Saturday.Here’s what happened. Basically, dad (59) was cheating on our mom with an employee of his. Dad runs a company, and “Carla” (33) had been his employee for 3 or 4 years. We found out about the affair because my dad is stupid. My dad didn’t want coworkers and employees finding out. He told Carla that if she quits, he will pay her out the rest of her yearly salary in a lump sum and help her get a job with a partner company. Mom found out because the bank contacted her as a trusted contact person because they couldn’t get a hold of dad. They thought it was suspicious that there was a withdrawal or close to 80K. That’s what dad took out to give to Carla. Long story short the divorce imploded and dad moved on. Yeah, the age gap is fucking weird too. Like I could have conceivably been in high school with Carla.This may not be relevant but his side of the family was sympathetic to my sister and I for like maybe 2 weeks. Then they just started acting like Carla was part of the family. Like aunts and uncles, grandparents, are just tagging Carla on stuff on Facebook with my dad. My 2 aunts just posted a picture with them and Carla.At the party, me and my sister weren’t really talking with dad. Then at dinner people were telling stories about the newly engaged couple. My dad spoke about how happy everyone is to add another great woman into the family. He looked at Carla and said she’s an example of the last great woman added.I spoke up, loudly, and said “yeah, we need more great women who sleep with their married boss, while they themselves live with a boyfriend”. The place went silent and Carla just put her head down. My dad yelled in front of everyone calling me disgusting. My sister and I said we were leaving. My cousin getting married told me he thought it was kinda funny and so did his fiancé. My dad’s 2 sisters cornered us as we left and said we owe Carla, and dad, and the wedding couple an apology. My dad’s dad said we were acting like children.My dad texted and said we will be cut out of any inheritance if we do not call Carla and apologize. I want the money, but I also think Carla is a bitch and my dad is an asshole.",

I work in a restaurant serving tables, and there is a busser who has repeatedly tried to get with me for about a month now, and I've told himnomultiple times and told him I'm in a committed relationship. My brother (27 M) has worked here as a barback for about a year now (for context). I've told him about this busser trying to get with me before. Today, when I got to work, my brother came up to me and said, \"That busser (not going to say his name) likes you and wanted me to hook you both up, I get Rebeckah and he gets you.\" Rebeckah is another server there, and he likes her, but she has a boyfriend. Anyways, I told him \"you know I'm in a 5-year committed relationship bro\" and he says \"oh so you're not interested?\", that suddenly made my bloodboil. He basically just disrespected my gf and I and our relationship. I texted my gf and told her what happened, and she immediately started texting him because it obviously made her very angry. This led to an even bigger argument with the two going back and forth through text, he started making personal attacks on her character, and it seemed like he was trying to ruin my relationship. In the end, my brother tried saying he was just joking, but I don't see how any of it was funny. He brought up the fact that I \"always\" ask if he's okay and that I'm \"pushing\" an idea onto him that he's depressed. He has shown signs of depression, and I've checked on him maybe 3 times in the past year to see if he was okay, and he got angry with me the very last time I did that, saying I'm pressuring him... I don't understand what I did wrong. I care about my brother and just want to make sure he's okay. He told my gf that I've been disrespecting him by doing so and proceeded to say he can \"cut us off with no problem\". He never asks me how I'm doingever.I finally had enough because it went on all night for hours, and so I told him he doesn't ever have to worry about me checking on him again, and I cut him off.

      "content_preview": "I don’t think my parents have Reddit, but this has been eating at me for the better part of over a decade… I (35F) have grown up in a household where my mother and father were split after only about a year after my birth. No biggie. My mom married my stepdad when I was about 8 (they started dating when I was 1-2, so he’s been around for s as long as I can remember). There was always some friction, but through the years I actually got along well with my stepdad and we had a good relationship. The big issue came when years passed. Growing up, I was expected to work full time just for the opportunity of using my car (which neither my mom or stepdad gave me, my dad did). I was in extracurricular activities, mostly theatre, which I won multiple awards for, and would often be at rehearsals till 8pm. I graduated with a 4.3 GPA and got scholarships for college. Not a full ride, but a good sum. Upon going to college, my mom and stepdad told me that I was no longer “living at home” and I had to pay for a storage unit for all my things I couldn’t bring to my dorm. I was also responsible for more than half my living expenses (food/books/etc). Fine…I had been working FT since I was 15. My little sister, however…none of this applied.  Sure never worked, complained about her first car (a really nice used jeep), because she didn’t want to learn how to drive a manual transmission. I learned on a manual, and that’s what I drove until the poor car literally caught fire due to a short in the starter (again, not anything they gave me, my dad gave it to me). Even in college, she’s never had a real job. She didn’t graduate with the same grades I did, but my mom still thinks the sun rises and sets on her. I’ve tried to explain my frustrations of the obvious favoritism, but she makes me to always be the villain. I’ve straight up gone very minimal contact. Being new to actually posting on Reddit…AITA?",

Trust me, I was dealing with alot more than just her insistence on searching my phone constantly.(2) I have been doing individual counseling for six years. I want to do couples counseling and Jen to do individual counseling.(3) I left because Jen lied to me.POSTMy GF (Jen) and I have been together for 4 years. Back in April, two great things happened: we found out Jen is pregnant and I closed on a house for us to move into. Our family and friends know about the pregnancy, including Jen's best childhood friend (Amanda). I will admit, I never liked the dynamic between Ananda and Jen, but it did not really affect our relationship since Amanda lived across the country.After finding out about the pregnancy, Amanda decided to move back home (we live in Jen and Amanda's hometown). Amanda has been back since late May and all hell has broke loose. Jen has always felt a little self-conscious in our relationship. I work construction and do personal training. She feels intimidated by small girls, but I have no idea way. She is a sexy AF woman with amazing curves.Amanda has done nothing but played into Jen's insecurities and anxieties since being back. Jen and I have never been the tracking location couple or looking through phone's couple. We always considered that a red flag in a relationship. Amanda has convinced Jen that she needs to start doing that. So, she has been looking through my phone on a regular and finding nothing. I have communicated my hurt and frustration and that I think she needs to distance herself from Amanda. She kept rebuffing my concerns.About two weeks ago, Jen again asked to look through my phone. I told her in no uncertain terms that this will be the last time she looks through my phone. If she again sees nothing suspicious, then she needs to agree to go to counseling and distance herself from Amanda. She agreed, looked through my phone, and found nothing suspicious. But, she soon reneged on her promise to do counseling and distancing herself from Amanda.I decided to move out. We are currently on a month-to-month lease in an apartment until renovations get done on the house I bought. I am staying with a friend until the house is ready and then I will move in alone. Jen has asked me to reconsider, I refuse. She will likely need to move in with her mother, which is not ideal given the limited space, which I feel terrible about for my child.AITA?",

      "content_preview": "My husband 34 male and I 38 female have been married for 6 years together for 9. We have had our ups and downs but the biggest down is how he speaks to me. I just had our son 1 year ago. When I was 10 months postpartum he was telling ne I am fat and lazy and all I do is take care of the baby and work. As I still had baby weight on navigating new routines, work and caring for our baby AND 4 other children while working 40hrs a week. On my birthday he demanded I not leave the house or he would divorce me. Just so happened my daughter had an appointment at UCLA for her teeth the morning of my birthday, so I took her. Needless to say he didnt even say hello to me and slept in his game room. He has been sleeping there since. Its been 2 months. He told everyone he was divorcing me, spoke to an attorney and everything before even telling me he wanted a divorce. He told me I was not the prize, im almost 40 and have 4 kids 3 who are minors. He said hes the prize, hes in his prime and makes good money and any women would love to be in my shoes and take care of his kids. He even went as far as inviting his baby mother into the house to visit while I was out.Fast forward he looses his job and telling me to wait to move. He then starts talking nicer to me and acting different then before. I told him I was still moving out and going forward with seperating because his actions did not align with someone who wanted to be with me. It feels more like im his only option at the moment. Now hes going around saying I am a gold digger and leave as soon as he looses his job. Hes saying he wanted to try to make it work but I am the one choosing to leave to all his family and friends.So am I the asshole for following through with what he initiated even after he lost his job?",

      "content_preview": "I(36f) refuse to forgive my ex(39m) after what he said to me in front of our children. Things had been rocky in our relationship for years and it finally came to a head when he said some things that should not have been said in front of our kids. My ex wasn't always a jerk, but after a family member of his passed, he changed. We would constantly argue and I started to feel like I had to constantly walk on eggshells. He was drinking heavily and wouldn't hold down a job. I had to take care of everything myself. The kids, the household, cooking, working full-time, the whole 9 yards. He stayed at home getting drunk, playing video games, etc. He would constantly accuse me of cheating when I was working and get mad when I didn't want to be intimate due to exhaustion and hurting (due to health issues). It got to the point that I would go to work, come home take care of the kids, and then go to my room. I was tired of being treated poorly. In addition to accusing me of cheating he started calling me names. I would just ignore him. He would then threaten things to try and control me and manipulate my feelings more. The final straw was when he told me that I should end it like my brother did (he unalived himself) and that our kids should not have been born (said all of this in front of them). I kicked him out that day.I refuse to talk to him. He keeps sending me messages trying to get me to talk to him. He'll apologize in these messages and then go back to calling me names when I don't respond. He then will try and twist everything all over again, saying I never loved him, that everything I said about wanting our relationship to work was all a lie... etc. I left him 2.5 years ago we were together for 7 years.

      "content_preview": "Ok, I live in England and I don't know if this... aesthetic? has a name but I'm really attracted to it. From personal experience everyone who had this exact aesthetic have been the nicest guys I've ever met without fail. I've seen so many people wear this specific look I'm sure it must have a name so I could search itThey're usually guys, always white, they wear baseball hats, usually branded by some sports company like Montirex or Nike. Funnily enough, none of the ones I've met actually do any sports, despite all the sportswear that they wear everywhere all the time. They wear grey or black branded tracksuits that match in colour. They have these costly trainers that have bubbles in the soles. The guys wear this really glinty jewelry that's always gold, such as little ear studs, rings. Usually it's gold earrings the guys wear, plus a gold chain around their neck, which is often paired with a gold bracelet. They also wear these gold rings on their fingers. They often have these tribal tattoos but not always, the gold jewelry is much more common and pretty much universal. They kind of have this bad boy attitude going on, they're loud and they use a lot of slang. They're rough around the edges but really nice and very protective of people and I find that extremely hot. They're not usually muscular, they're often skinny but I get this vibe that they'd fight to the death for someone they love anyway.I seriously want someone like this as a husband, but I have no idea what it is I'm actually into and can't put a name to my type. If it helps, they usually hang out with others who look like them and my town is almost swarming with them",
