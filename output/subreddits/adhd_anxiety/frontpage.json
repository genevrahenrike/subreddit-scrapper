      "content_preview": "Hi, I'm (29/m) I was diagnosed with ADD last year, I've always had anxiety my whole life (without realizing it until a few years ago but wasn't clear that it controls a lot of things for me ) and I had some traumatic event right after my ADD diagnosis (not related), after a couple of months I decided to give a try for ADHD medication, I started with Ritalin, on small dose 5 mg then 10mg (was sort of ok, but did nothing as it was initial dose) then went on long release Concerta with higher dose 18mg and then I had a huge agitation the first two days that I managed, the 3rd day sent me to the ER :( then I stopped right away, moved on and after like 4 months I started to Buspirone for Anxiety 20mg (I'm not sure if it's really helping tbh, but it was very mild meds as I was afraid to try out SSRI) then 4 months later I decided to try non stimulant (Strattera) the first 3 days were ok, the 4th and 5th I had palpitations, and then my anxiety was almost going into panic, so I stopped as well... I'm really desperate, because Idk if meds will ever work for me, I really wanted the help of the meds for the ADD, I've survived all my life without them, but it's terrible to live and specially to work or to study with ADD without being medicated, I tried everything but it only helps as coping for a while then I forget about them, I barely survived, but with lots of melt downs, anxiety, frustration, and loss of energy. I don't want to mention how it also affects relationships. Did anyone has similar experience, and how could you manage to take medicine without having some side effect that are all related to anxiety (palpitations, agitation, anxious, etc...) Thanks for reading.",

      "content_preview": "Do you constantly find yourself cringing at things that happened in the past. Or things that haven‚Äôt even happened that you‚Äôre afraid of happening. Do you feel embarrassed to just be around other humans and take up space and air. Like I don‚Äôt want to be dead but I don‚Äôt want to exist in my body and have people perceive me. I feel like people can see through my facade of what is essentially a tightly wrapped and packaged bundle of anxiety bursting at the seams. At home every time I think of something embarrassing I make a strange sound like the bit of anxiety is releasing from inside me, but when I‚Äôm in public I must muster the strength to keep the front going. If only people knew that I‚Äôm not even really a human - I might even be a collection of fears, rational and irrational. Maybe just leftovers of traumas from a past life.",

      "content_preview": "TLDR VERSION: Felt pressured throughout credit card application process and the worker used guesstimates of mine and my family who I‚Äôve temporarily been living with on the application. Now I‚Äôve received a card with required min income for individual or household and I‚Äôm panicking because on my own I don‚Äôt actually meet that amount. FULL VERS: Late 20s and only just got around to applying for a credit card.  My parents weren‚Äôt great with finances growing up / I didn‚Äôt have anyone to really advise me on it all. I was approached in the store I was planning to apply for a card from, and they started my application on the spot. For my address I explained that it‚Äôs complicated since I moved out and back to my family‚Äôs home a few times now rent free but will be moving out again soon. (However I had lived there total for 10+ years since it was my childhood home. ) When it finally came to questions about my income, I flat out told him I wasn‚Äôt sure/couldn‚Äôt remember so maybe I should come back another time. (I‚Äôm awful at remembering numbers + my hours/position at my job changed since I started.) I checked my online banking for my regular pay and he did the math. (Again, Im bad with numbers and was too anxious to calculate anything at that time.) Then he asked my households income. I also have NO CLUE what they make for income other than it‚Äôs more than what I make. At this point we‚Äôd spent so long getting this far in the application I felt awful wasting his time. He pushed and asked if its more than me, I said yes, and he went with a random guesstimate off that. Now my card arrived but I realized it‚Äôs one up from the basic one and that you or your household must meet the requirements of a certain income for it. I checked my T4 now that I‚Äôm at home as well as paystubs and realised on my own I don‚Äôt meet that amount. My stomach dropped and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll sleep tonight I‚Äôm so worried over this. I feel so stupid and like I can‚Äôt do anything right. I know it‚Äôs on me that I didn‚Äôt read everything thoroughly / make sure I understood before signing but I felt so anxious and like I was on autopilot, then personally knowing so many people who signed up without issues I figured it would all be ok üòû Went with empathy flair cause I‚Äôm still freaking out about this, but I could really use some advice as well",

      "content_preview": "For executive dysfunction try the hack of \"Mise en Place.\" It's a cooking term meaning \"put in place,\" where chefs gather and prep all ingredients/tools before cooking. Don't think about the completing the task in front think only about the Elements needed to accomplish the task, if feels like we are putting a puzzle together, and, for me, it takes a lot of the pressure off... So, What are the elements? :) I always think, \"what are the elements?,\" Break it down into physical/mental items needed. E.g., for \"clean the kitchen,\" list: gloves, sponge, cleaner, trash bag, playlist for motivation Just focus on collecting/prepping these items in one spot. No pressure to start the actual work yet. This \"setup\" tricks your brain into momentum without the full commitment. Once everything's \"in place,\" the barrier to beginning drops. Often, you'll naturally flow into the task because the setup feels like progress. This has helped me tons by bypassing the \"all or nothing\" mindset. It's low-dopamine friendly and builds wins early. Anyone else try something similar? Or adaptations for your routines? Share below! TLDR: Prep like a chef‚Äîgather tools first, conquer tasks later. Always ask yourself, \"What are the elements?\"",

I am nervous that it will kill my personality and turn me into an emotionless zombie. I am also nervous that it will make me violent and impulsive and start hurting the people around me which is the last thing I want. I started these meds because my life was chaotic without them I can‚Äôt focus or sit still normally, I can‚Äôt work or pay attention in school without them and I want to be able to function as a normal human being but I am scared they will kill who I once was and make me unstable. I have seen people share there experiences and it‚Äôs definitely a possibility If anyone could offer me some advice on what to do or share with me experiences they have that would be amazing.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I‚Äôm 26F and  got diagnosed with adhd earlier this year. I‚Äôm on adhd medication and some antydepresant that should help with my anxiety. During past months I also started to notice some autistic traits in me. I‚Äôm in a relationship with an autistic person. She is the greatest relationship I‚Äôve ever had. I love her very much but I really struggle with our differences sometimes. I always try to support her in her struggles, give her what she needs and respect her boundaries. She is currently away on vacation with her close friends. We agreed that we will call each other every day same hour but it‚Äôs not happening. In one voice message she said that she would really want to hear me but she promised a friend that they would watch a movie and that she will also not call the next day. I did not expect from her to call me and talk for hours. 10 minutes would be nice. I went to sleep crying that day, thinking that a movie cannot wait 5 minutes. She is not good at communicating when we don‚Äôt see each other. She says she doesn‚Äôt like using phone. On the other hand she still uses it for checking instagram. I really try to understand that but sometimes I feel really hurt. My father died in June and I felt really bad the past few weeks. She tried to support me with that but I noticed that she sometimes cuts me off when I try to talk about this topic. I already talked with her a couple of times about the fact that she is not checking in on me or not texting me for the whole day. She says she struggle with autism and it‚Äôs really difficult for her to keep in touch via phone. I really understand that but sometimes it would be nice to get  a message from her once a day, asking how I feel or telling me that she loves me. I don‚Äôt want to ruin her vacation, we already had a talk during this time about her not making an effort. This whole situation gives me such strong anxiety. I want to be the best partner for her and understand her but when I‚Äôm telling her about my needs I don‚Äôt feel understood. I get in my head all the time, spiralling about potential breakup and that maybe she does not care about me so much. Rejection sensitivity is really strong, I‚Äôm gonna bring this up on my therapy session this week but I would really appreciate any advice from you guys üñ§",

      "content_preview": "I have had panic attacks since I was a child and was diagnosed with severe ADHD at 18. Did some deep research and found that many kids have the same problem. They come in with chronic anxiety often for no trauma related reasons, but come to find out they have ADHD. For some reason the lack of dopamine I had caused some type of hypersensitivity to change in my surroundings and within my body. If I ate something and it made me feel the slightest off I would focus very hard on it unintentionally till I got anxious and eventually panic. I remember once I was rearranging my room and got a panic attack bc it was changed it was different than before and I didn‚Äôt know if it was good or bad. This made making friends very difficult bc they always wanted me to spend the night at their house but I nvr wanted to due to sleeping in another bed and waking up in a different house, or eating something I wasn‚Äôt used to. So as you can probably assume that has led me to not liking people that much, they are huge variables and I never can trust them personally. Everyone has a probability and if it is not in the percentage I want I can‚Äôt take that risk of freaking out and being humiliated. At 20yrs I was put on Stratterra. It helps a lot but numbs the mind a lot too. If yall have any relatable stories or tips and tricks shoot them my way, I am 21 and turning a new page. Trying to find a new job and looking for tools to battle my mind to keep me from getting panic attacks. Don‚Äôt give me book recommendations please.",

I take Vyvanse and everything, but my fear and procrastination starts to make me nervous when starting something. I can only do things through breaking things down. Any tips? I have C-PTSD, trauma, Autism, and ADHD as well as OCD. I'm currently in the middle of a project (it involves a BookTube and BookTok channel). I'm preparing videos for later, and it just seems so daunting. I don't know what to do sometimes. I've gotten lots of work done, at least, but there's plenty of work left to do, I think. I've been trying to find a job as well. I feel like I can only do one thing at once... But when I do one thing, I feel the need to multi-task or else I get bored easily. I'm really passionate about this, but I'm also depressed or have depression. I just wish I knew techniques, tips, tricks, etc. on how to break tasks down and do them. I want to complete things NOW, but can't; so I break things into separate tasks, which helps, but sometimes, even they seem daunting, at least at times... I haven't relaxed for a while now; it's just been me forcing myself to work in front of my laptop or tablet. At times, I end up scrolling endlessly on YouTube or watching YouTube videos and I feel compelled to do so. I am on 70 mg Vyvanse as well as Lexapro and Abilify; also, Guanfacine later in the day. I am trans and BIPOC, if that counts for anything. I really am passionate about this, but I get procrastination and do other things, at least sometimes, and I end up doing something monotonously for two or three hours before coming to, and realizing that I've wasted time. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's just me relaxing. Lately, I've realized that I can't focus on my reading for more than 30 seconds or a minute. I read, pause and recuperate. Read, and then briefly do something else. Then read again. Is that normal? Am I just dumb? Am I just overthinking things? I feel like a dunce, to be honest. What am I doing wrong? And am I doing anything wrong at all or is it just me overthinking things? Well, that's all I have to say. I have a checklist that I use to keep busy. Let me know if that helps. But otherwise, I don't know what else to do. I'm worried about my executive functioning. I'm worried that I'm not working hard enough or lazy. Do I have a barrier? What can I do to have extra focus or attention on things? Seems I'm getting distracted by everything because I feel like I have to be paying attention to everything all the time all at once. Everything is distracting me. YouTube, social media, etc. And when I do the work, I get nervous, it reminds me of all things that can go wrong. I have general anxiety disorder, by the way. I'm trying to invest in analog so I'm not constantly looking at a screen. But all the same, I just don't know what to do. I will go back to work on my checklist, but I feel like I can't have too much there or else I'll get nervous and not do them. But when I have one task, it's easy, even a big or small task, regardless. But then, I also need to keep track of what I'm doing and what I need to do that day! Seems like I'm also doing too many things at once. I want to do this project AND consume media so I'm not \"left out of the loop\" or due to FOMO. I play video games and watch media just so I'm not \"left behind\" and it sucks. I mean, I enjoy it, but much of the fun has been taken out of it. What do I do? What tips, tricks, techniques, etc. can I use to get my life and attention back on track?",

      "content_preview": "I'll try not to go on a rant here but basically I live with my bf. We were roommates first, we're both in our late twenties, both diagnosed, I'm currently unmedicated but doing okay-ish. I'm pretty sure he's unmedicated as well due to stimulants making his anxiety worse. He's a super smart guy, can be very introspective, has maybe 30 hobbies but I'm very much into that. The reason I'm posting here is because over this past month, he went off at me for the most random reasons (some I admit I deserved, some I still can't comprehened) and it's always the same pattern: I screw something up (either for real or in his eyes) He gets mad, calls me names or shuts me out for half a day I go quiet and go do my thing instead (work, gym, bike) He comes back acting like nothing happened. Examples: I accidentally washed his cycling clothes with softener because he left them in the washing machine and I didn't think to check before throwing my stuff in. Completely my fault, I offered to replace everything later. When he realized what happened he went completely non-verbal and wouldn't talk to me until the next morning. Again, stupid mistake but the door handle on his door had been hanging on by a thread for a few months. A week ago either I pulled on it and didn't notice until the morning or the cat jumped on it but basically, he woke up and realized we were locked out. He swore at me for several minutes until he unlocked it with a credit card. I was at a friend's birthday party and asked him if he wanted to come for a bit because everyone was excited to meet him. He came and after a while lashed out at me for \"touching him three times in ten minutes\" and left. I wasn't groping him or anything, just had my hand on his thigh because I thought it was a nice gesture since he didn't know anybody there. I was looking after his cat and he (the cat) ate the humidity absorbing packet from his treats that I didn't even know were there (so he must've left the empty packet somewhere in the room) - again, he lashed out at me, said we had to keep an eye out at him because he didn't know when it happened but then he went cycling anyway. It's always stuff like this - some things are serious, some are straight up dumb but I never know how he's going to react. I never know if it's okay to touch him or not and some reactions don't make sense to me no matter how hard I try to understand. I admit, I often retreat to my room or go take a walk so I don't say things in anger. But then he starts texting/calling me? I tried explaining how I felt and that I wasn't sure if I could exist in this environment but he told me I also had mental issues because I was reacting this way to his blowups :D Is there even a way to set healthy boundaries in this situation?",

      "content_preview": "So happy and proud of myself and I wanted to share within this community, so back story I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but didn‚Äôt get treated / support during this time. I have a long and I mean a very long history with behavioural problems with being impulsive / attention issues and not being able to have a long term employment, relationships and all I  have wanted was a quiet brain. I realise and wanted better for myself so I decided to get into therapy and have been doing it for a whole year and my psychologist said very honestly I think you should see a psychiatrist for your ADHD and get the support and treatment you deserve and it has been the best thing I have ever done. I was open and honest about myself and self-destructive behaviour and what I wanted from the appointment and I finally felt in my life I was listened to and understood. I was diagnosed with Combined ADHD at a Severe level I also have anxiety, depression and PTSD due to childhood trauma. I was a high school dropout and didn‚Äôt graduate but did my cert 3 in community services and now I am a support worker and I finally feel like I can have the life I wanted and deserve and help other people who struggle with their own mental health. My treatment plan is Dexamphetamine, 2 of the 5mg two or three times a day when needed and it has changed my life and just wanting other people‚Äôs experiences with ADHD and the treatment. I feel like getting treatment and being so open and honest about my struggles was the best thing and I feel like Dex has helped with having with. Clear mind and not over thinking Being more self aware and not being impulsive Not over talking like I usually do Able to focus on what I need to do without being distracted I am more positive in myself and I want to do and with getting stuff accomplished. Thank you if you got the end of this hahah Let me know your experience üôÇ",

Every time you leave the house? I've come across all of these and personally only unplug everything when staying somewhere overnight, as I tell my brain if something happens and I'm in town, I can easily come home (not that it makes any sense whatsoever) but I get very anxious when doing this every time (AuDHD here) and kind of feel obsessive. I know this issue is more common than I originally believed so I thought I'd test my luck here to see if anyone else has this. Or maybe tips on how to soothe this? I think the reason I'm struggling with this is because I tell my brain it's actually a valid concern because \"most fires start from household electronics and could be avoided with removing them from their power source\".

Starting meds has helped me a lot, but sadly my anxiety never really went away. Over the past year, my anxiety has been the worst it has ever been( probably because I overloaded and pushed myself way too hard) , and in June my body basically hit a breaking point. I started spiraling over small things, feeling tense, with a racing heartbeat and fast breathing whenever I tried to do anything productive. I also started having trouble falling and staying asleep, and I couldn‚Äôt take Ritalin anymore because it made the insomnia and anxiety worse (even though it never caused any of those issues before). I‚Äôve since then started taking complete rest from everything, and I‚Äôve also started using cbt techniques for my anxiety along with sleep therapy. I‚Äôm already doing better, but still struggling‚Ä¶I‚Äôve also tried restarting Ritalin twice. The first time I tried restarting Ritalin I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all. Two weeks later, I tried again and managed to sleep 3-4 hours, but that‚Äôs it. Today my psychiatrist said it would be fine to try taking Ritalin again, but I‚Äôm not so sure. My sleep isn‚Äôt back to normal yet, and I‚Äôm honestly scared that my body still won‚Äôt be able to handle it. I really want to get back on my meds because managing my ADHD without them has been incredibly hard and Ritalin has made a huge difference in my quality of life. Now I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll never be able to take them again and that my body will stay in this reactive state forever. Has anyone else (with both Adhd and anxiety) gone through something similar? Were you eventually able get back on your  meds?",

I have been in this depression since late April and did not notice any weight gain at the time in fact I lost weight. This is specifically after starting to take the medication. Also, I am not seeing it anywhere else on my body unfortunately. I was hoping maybe it was going to go to my butt. It‚Äôs all in my stomach. I do not fluctuate in weight when I am healthy,  I do go to the gym regularly but as most of you know, the Jim and I have become estranged have not done one squat since May I actually have the opposite problem in gaining weight (and I‚Äôm not complaining about it) before people start to make comments That being said, I‚Äôve noticed the last week no joke, I have developed a fairly substantial amount of fat on my stomach and sides. It literally looks like it showed up overnight. And I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but it feels like it‚Äôs increasing daily. I don‚Äôt carry fat in my stomach, so this is the first. I can acknowledge that I have not been going to the gym at all however, I have also not been eating Has anybody else had this specific problem regarding rapid stomach fat weight gain and if so, what was the outcome? Did you change medications, how much weight did you gain? Does anyone know any alternatives such as Wellbutrin?",

I‚Äôve been studying for the LSAT (pray for me), and my distractedness has been out of control. I‚Äôve always done well in school, graduated with honors in Pre-Law, but I wanted to get a handle on my ADHD before law school. I‚Äôm bubbly, social, and a ‚ÄúMost Spirited‚Äù award winner in high school, lol. Everyone around me has always said I have ADHD‚ÄîI misplace things, forget mid-sentence, and I‚Äôm high energy. So I finally decided to start the process. I booked with a psychiatric NP I found on Zocdoc, and while the quick availability should‚Äôve been a red flag, I went for it. At the appointment (less than 18 hours later), the unprofessionalism was obvious. When I said I wanted an ADHD evaluation, she immediately told me she couldn‚Äôt diagnose ADHD. I‚Äôd already paid $200, so I stayed. She asked why I thought I had ADHD, and then veered into abandonment issues, my father cheating on my mom, and made me tear up. Then she asked about my spirituality; I shared that I‚Äôm a devout Christian, talked about my best friend‚Äôs cancer and a recent loss, but also how I still find joy through faith. She just responded with, ‚ÄúMmm.‚Äù We discussed anxiety, control, and how I feel validated by good grades. After just 30 minutes, she diagnosed me with ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder . Bipolar?! I‚Äôve never once thought that. She said, ‚ÄúBeing this happy all the time isn‚Äôt normal,‚Äù and claimed my joy after good grades was ‚Äúmanic‚Äù and that she could see my mood swings in the short session. I explained that I simply love school and feel proud when I achieve‚Äîbut she still insisted it was mania. For background: I‚Äôve never been on medication. Yet she wanted me to start Latuda (an antipsychotic) for two weeks ‚Äúto rule out bipolar.‚Äù My stomach dropped. Medication already makes me anxious, and I felt blindsided. She brushed it off like it was no big deal, but I left knowing I‚Äôd never go back. I went home, researched Latuda, and was floored. This whole experience left me confused, overwhelmed, and honestly stunned at how quickly such a heavy diagnosis and medication were handed down in a 30-minute session. I will definitely be seeking a second opinion.",

The thing is that Ive started with Concerta 18, everything was good but I felt the effect to be a bit low specially after lunch, so my doctor went up to 36. First day a bit anxious at the beginning of the day but after that everything seemed good. I would say my focus and even nervous tics I had they improved. The thing is that I started my treatment on holidays, so very relaxed and all. These week I started working again (pretty stressful job) and I had a huge fight with my girlfriend. 3 days ago I was SUPER anxious all day. Yesterday it was better again, focused and not really super nervous (just the bit of energy that stimulants should give). But today, again, I was super anxious, feeling uneasy, thinking a lot on my girl, building imaginary scenarios (and not good ones, ofc), worrying about work. I ve been having a hard time, but I dont know if Im not an adhd and after the initial motivation spike the stimulants are starting to fuck all my \"normal\" brain. Im an adhd but the Concerta makes me feel more focused also in the bad things and not being able to detach from this kind of problems I need to wait until my body gets used to the dose and meds. Thanks for your help in advance! Also, how can i stop doubting about if I am really am ADHD or just missdiagnosed? I would appreciate some help with that too :)",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I am a 25-year-old male, I have been diagnosed with autism, ADHD, OCD, dyslexia and anxiety, I feel super stressed and without motivation to live. My favorite hobbies are making art and playing video games. I've never had a fixed job, but I've been able to sell a lot of art, but I feel like I have a weird learning disability that I've never been able to understand. I feel very pressured because I need make money, but I do not have the courage to find any job because I get super anxious and whenever I think about it I end up feeling like giving up on life. I've tried to start a tattoo business, but I have a hard time learning more and improving in addition to having social anxiety. I feel some hope that is gradually fading away. Sometimes I feel that I am too emotional and stressed and I hate myself too much for being like this, I hate my personality and sometimes I do not understand my role in this life. I am Portuguese so I apologize for my English!",

I used to by on Vyvnase a number of years ago but stopped due to the price. Now that generic is out, I can afford it again. Vyvanse worked best for me over Adderall/Concerta/Etc. I am also on 20mg of Prozac for anxiety, 2mg of Intuniv (non-stimulant ADHD medication), 25mg of Trazodone for sleep at night, and then 5mg of crestor because I eat garbage like a raccoon. My Dr. has told me that I am on relatively low doses of everything, so serotonin syndrome is a low risk (still makes me nervous), but jumping from 10mg to 20mg of Vyvanse makes me feel like I just drank 3 energy drinks before it mellows out. I am completely caffeine free, btw. Does high protein help better in the mornings alongside Vyvanse? I stay plenty hydrated, but I just feel like I am falling apart most of the time lol. Especially since upping the vyvanse, I feel physically anxious and *wired*.",

      "content_preview": "I've seen others discuss this before, but I've essentially ignored it, as I've been trying to convince myself that generic is the exact same lol. I've been on vyvanse for years, sometimes paying hundreds of dollars a month when insurance was being annoying, just because its worked SO incredibly well for me. This has not been my experience with the generic now for awhile and I'm not sure what to do. I don't particularly want to go back to paying a ton of money or trying to convince my doctor that something isn't right here. I used to take it and it'd kick in anywhere between 45-65 minutes. Sometimes it will take a solid three hours to kick in now, frequently taking 2+ or up to 4. This throws off my timing, obviously, as I don't want to take it too late and have it keep me up or I‚Äôll wake up, take it, and need it to start accomplishing life within a reasonable time frame. Sometimes I don't really feel any effects at all, other times, it hits me so hard and I feel like I'm tweaking and get anxious. Generally, though, it‚Äôs been giving me a lot of anxiety, increased heart rate, and I don‚Äôt feel great. But when I don‚Äôt take it, I don‚Äôt feel like I can function, have no motivation, simple things feel like a mountain, and then I get stuck in the procrastination spiral and feel mentally terrible and down. I used to just take my vyvanse, it'd kick in in its normal time frame, sometimes I get a little jittery for 30 minutes, but overall it'd make me feel calm and I could function like a normal human. I slept better when I took it consistently. Every aspect of my life felt more stable. It worked better at regulating my mood than any antidepressant or anti-anxiety med I've ever tried. It just made me feel normal. Emptying the dishwasher no longer seemed like an unmanageable massive task. Now, if I even feel it do anything, I never know when it will kick in, if it‚Äôs going to ruin my day with anxiety and jitteriness, if it will make me moody, etc. Its not helping my mood at all. Honestly, it might be making it worse in ways. I don't feel stable and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I have a baby now and I crave the stability name brand vyvanse gave me, but more often than not, it kicks in and makes me more overwhelmed. Some days it feels like it‚Äôs working properly and I feel good, but it‚Äôs so rare. I feel so level when that happens. I don't know what to do. I didn't want to believe the generic could be that different, but this absolutely sucks. I've checked my past bottles and the pharmacy definitely shuffles through the different generic manufacturers and I haven't noticed one being better than the other. They've all sucked compared to my sweet, sweet name brand. I feel like I'm going crazy. Please share your insight and experiences! Editing to add- I‚Äôve tried concerta and adderall in the past, neither worked well for me. Vyvanse was light a magic switch to normal functioning. I got diagnosed around 20 when I was in college, living on my own, and the skills I used to get through my teen years were no longer enough to keep up and manage things. So much made sense about my life and struggles after diagnosis via a full day neuropsych work up.",

However, a lot of people mistake my adhd and ocd symptoms as factors of me potentially being autistic. I have been told I speak in a monotone tone often and that i don‚Äôt understand social norms and/or I‚Äôm too blunt. I personally believe that I don‚Äôt like playing games to get to a point. Things in my opinion are very obvious from the start and when you call them out, people get mad at me. Sometimes they say i even look, sound, or act autistic. I am not saying being autistic is bad, i relate to autistic people a lot as I know adhd and autistic symptoms overlap and display similarly. But for me i feel like some people specifically men and a handful of women seriously try to take a jab at me by labeling me as autistic when i do something i believe is related to my ocd or adhd instead. One thing, i know about ocd is that it is anxiety disorder so i feel most people label my anxiety as autism which further complicates why people misunderstand me and why i misunderstand myself.",

      "content_preview": "Hey there, I‚Äôm 20, a pretty built guy, and fairly tall. I‚Äôve known for a very long time that I‚Äôm terrible at confronting people. Terrible. I get all shaky, especially if a fight might start, even though I often spar with my friends. I know shaking is natural in these situations, but this isn‚Äôt normal shaking‚Äîit‚Äôs pure fear of the unknown. An example from today: My little sister (and her friends) got into some conflict with a group of boys. The girls, scared, came into our house and asked me to do something because there were some bad kids outside threatening them. In my head, I thought: ‚Äúoh sh **,‚Äù* and went outside to check. The boys were there, blasting loud music and acting all ‚Äúgangster.‚Äù I told them, in a pretty aggressive way, to leave and stop causing trouble. They left, but just as I was about to go back inside, I saw one laughing at me from a distance. And honestly, I just felt depressed. I know situations like this shouldn‚Äôt happen in the first place (assuming there weren‚Äôt so many dipsh*** in this world). But things like this happen from time to time. Maybe I tried to appear upset, but in my head all I wanted was to avoid a fight. What if I lose and a bunch of kids beat me up? What if, what if, what if‚Ä¶ In reality, that would most likely never happen, but in my head it‚Äôs all I can think about. What if I freeze in a situation like this and let something dumb sh*** happen? I really believe that while ADHD plays a part, this is more connected to past trauma. In my case, my father used to beat me up pretty often and yell at me constantly. Phrases like ‚ÄúCLOSE THAT PC OR I‚ÄôM GONNA K ** YOU!‚Äù* really plant deep roots in your mind. Meanwhile, kids who never experienced this just act insane. In their minds, they can fight anyone, and they won‚Äôt hesitate to throw a punch. And I don‚Äôt ever want to lose to my own brain and let something bad happen. Do you guys have any advice? Any books or practices that help you personally? You might say I should just avoid these situations‚Äîand I try, believe me‚Äîbut you never really know what could happen or just how crazy someone might be.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been struggling with a very specific type of anxiety for years, and I‚Äôm hoping someone here might relate or have advice. When I was in high school (about 12 years ago), I was recovering from a cold and sitting in class when I suddenly gagged out of nowhere. I wasn‚Äôt nauseous and didn‚Äôt have any other symptoms , just this unexpected gagging that completely shocked me. I felt embarrassed cause the whole class turned and looked at me while I ran to the bathroom. Ever since then, I‚Äôve been hyper-focused on my throat and mucus. I became afraid of it happening again, because I never understood why it happened the first time. Thinking back now I guess it could‚Äôve been post nasal drip but I‚Äôm not sure. Now, all these years later, it‚Äôs like my body memorized that fear. I still wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks, feeling like my throat is tight or full of mucus. The sensations make me anxious, and then the anxiety makes my throat feel even tighter, it turns into this loop that‚Äôs really hard to break. I‚Äôm currently in PA school, which is stressful enough on its own, and I know the stress is making everything worse. I‚Äôm on an SSRI and gabapentin, which help to some extent, but I still feel stuck in this cycle. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep and I need to in order to do well in school. I know some of it could be related to LPR (silent reflux), but the hardest part for me isn‚Äôt just the physical symptoms, it‚Äôs the panic that comes with them. The constant fear, the waking up panicked, the hyper-awareness of every sensation in my throat. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of cycle? How did you break free from it, especially the anxiety part? I feel like I‚Äôm stuck reliving that high school moment over and over, and I really want to find a way to move past it.",

      "content_preview": "This year is gonna be my senior year, im in a highly competitive school system where i have to rank on first 150 at least to get to the uni i want. Im not gonna rant about it, you could just understand the amount of frustration of having all those subjects accumulated and the year havent even officially started yet, and thats their reaction... I just wanna ask, as they're doctors (believe or not theyre) they are basically concerned about side effects and addiction/reliance risks, + they think it will not be \"that\" effective anyways, and  if i want to study I'll do its just \"inside my head\". How was your experience with meds?? Is it really worth trying again to get an appointment??",

      "content_preview": "I have anxiety mostly due to c-ptsd but I have managed it pretty well with therapy, meds, and coping mechanisms. My anxiety usually only flares up around triggers and controllable scenarios/situational like if I have too much caffeine. I‚Äôm currently taking atomoxetine for inattentive ADHD but don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs working for me for a number of reasons. My prescriber is pretty concerned about stimulants causing me anxiety or making my existing anxiety worse even though I have it pretty well under control. It‚Äôs made me start to kind of second guess myself and think ‚Äúokay maybe I just shouldn‚Äôt try any\", but I wanted to get other opinions first because they have agreed to put me on a stimulant if I have one more month of no progress on atomoxetine with an increased dose. So I‚Äôm just curious, has anyone with general anxiety or PTSD successfully taken stimulants without it making their anxiety worse ?",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm seeking a diagnosis as an adult, with the goal of trying medication. I‚Äôve suspected for a long while now that I could have ADHD but it‚Äôs only gotten worse with age, especially since I graduated and started working. The forgetfulness and lack of motivation is so debilitating! If meditation can make things even 10% easier I‚Äôd consider it worth it. The trouble is, I‚Äôm a pretty anxious person and have panic attacks sometimes in specific situations. I‚Äôm prescribed Propranolol which has been a godsend for this, it stops all the physical symptoms and helps to me break out of the anxious feedback loop. Stimulant medication is the first line of treatment for ADHD so I‚Äôd be keen to try it, but I‚Äôm a bit apprehensive of the impact it could have on my anxiety. Everyone responds differently, but I‚Äôm curious- If you‚Äôre on stimulant medication and also have anxiety, what‚Äôs been your experience? Has medicating your ADHD also helped your anxiety?",

The job is mostly talking to people over the phone and receiving calls as well, which is what I seem to have the most issues with. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm totally useless and I think I help things out throughout the day, but sometimes I‚Äôm not so sure.

      "content_preview": "I have this habit where I nod along like I understand even when I have no idea what someone is talking about.  Most of the time I am too embarrassed to ask them to repeat anything because I have been pretending to follow for too long. The worst is when they ask for my opinion and I get caught off guard. By now I'm become pretty good at bullshitting a response but it always feels terrible and disrespectful. My ADHD makes it very easy for me to lose track in a conversation and if anything I'm trying not be direspectful by not letting on that I haven't been listening the entire time.  Yesterday was the first time I can remember stopping someone the moment I realized I'd lost track. I told them I zoned out and they didn't mind repeating. It felt natural and I want to make this my new habit. The hard part is not doubting yourself when you realize you have not been listening at all. It will take time to get past that but I am glad I took a step in the right direction. Anybody else?",
