      "content_preview": "Apologies if others have made this same comment, but I don’t read too much here because I’m always a day or more late watching episodes and I want to avoid spoilers. But I had a realization today that perhaps the very presence of an old school “master” (Rachel) actually made the other cast members act weakly.  They are all so intimidated by her that they don’t know what to do. Maybe if she wasn’t part of the cast, the season would have turned out much more interesting, and the cast members would have actually played the game. Or maybe it’s all just a very weak cast.  It’s gotten to the point that I’m hoping people go home because they are such bad players. I can’t stand Rachel, but at this point I don’t really want anyone else to win.",

He’s obviously a people pleaser, has had a really good social game this season to the point where he had 5 ride or dies at various points in the season (Zach, Morgan, Lauren, Keanu and to some extent Kelley), 4 of whom are still in the game. He obviously has a lot of anxiety and is very self conscious of what other people think of him, which is partly why he’s both so good at BB socially but so bad when it comes to making tough decisions that might upset one of his allies. The old saying “when you try to make everyone happy, you end up making no one happy”. He is in a tough position with his 3 closest personal allies being on opposing sides of the house, and had to nominate almost half of the house as HoH. In pre BB26 world without a blockbuster and 3 HoH noms, his game would be almost airtight right now. Mickey winning blockbuster and veto back to back weeks was a pretty rough blow and the only scenario where he’d be in hot water right now. His fatal flaw is he’s trying too hard to play a “perfect game” rather than a winning game. And by not trying harder to explain to Morgan that Rachel is a bigger threat to them than Keanu, instead prioritizing Morgan’s game over his own.",

However, what really happens, and what people tell each other happens, are vastly different sometimes. I would love to see a reunion Big Brother Episode air sometime after the season ends. Maybe a month or two? Or maybe a month or two ahead of the next season to kind of hype the upcoming season? Did the showmance(s) last outside the house? Why? Why not? Did people become more or less about their votes after watching the season? What were the things the house guests only found out themselves after watching the season? Do they havemore/less respect for their allies and their gameplay? I think this could be a big hit to get everyone back together for interviews and a recap.",

He is responsible in one way or the other for every eviction except Zach. Time after time the Keanu side has given him another chance and he keeps screwing them over. I'm glad someone called him on it and is actually doing something about it. Also I'm interested in seeing how this will play out if Morgan does go home (haven't seen veto results yet, please no spoilers). Keanu's theory that Vince will become an ally has merit but idk if it'll play out that way. If Morgan is gone the judges won't keep him around for sure. If he's up against Morgan he goes home. Apologizing to Rachel and telling her he will keep Ashley off the block so she has an extra vote is a great move IMO. Rachel seems to cautiously be considering trusting him again but who knows if she'll really keep him around 🤷‍♀️ I just hope Keanu doesn't change his mind like we've seen him do in the past.",

I picked Ava because she was well liked and I thought she was going to cash in on her secret aura reading powers. I was disillusioned when I saw how much Ava liked a few players (I won’t name them here) that couldn’t possibly have “good” auras.  Then she started checking out and sleeping on the job. So I was on the hunt for a new flair, but didn’t have a strong desire to rally behind anyone until - Keanu (after winning HOH) told Vinny he wasn’t a good ally and was just matter-of-fact when the whiny rat weasel couldn’t persuade Keanu to keep him off the block. But then, as many of you know, Keanu really started digging DEEP to strategize a way to get his favorite rat weasel off the block. When Keanu came to Ava to get her say on the possibility of Rachel as a renon I was disappointed in him.  And when Ava shut that down and said Vinny needed to man up, I had no choice but to stan her again. This crazy cast got me to flip my flair!  How about the rest of you?  Have you changed your flair more than once this season?",

In like every other confessional you have you have person A saying \"I can't believe they went and told my plan, right after I just told another 2 people about their plan.\" GF is a massive big brother fan and she recently got me into it watching old seasons through the year and now watching the live season. Just over the wall of annoyed hearing the same people cry week after week about \"Why is everyone targeting me\" then \"Oh this person is literally the worst human every\"",

      "content_preview": "I am living this week as a Keanu-fan and Vince-hater. So far, this week has been poetic….and possibly even literary. The depiction of Vince’s gameplay has reminded me so much of when I analyzed the Shakespearean tragedy Hamlet in 10th grade English class. These old tragedies always portrayed the protagonist with a tragic flaw that leads to their downfall. For Hamlet, his indecisiveness and tendency to overthink led to inaction against what would be his falling. He was too scared to really get anything in motion. Reminds me of Vince: his inability to decide on a side to go with, his flip-flopping, and ambiguity of who he is aligned with has now turned people against him. He could only go so long without deciding something, but it is too late now. Keanu has him clocked and hopefully chooses to not work with him ever now (assuming he stays in the house). Just thought it was a cool connection between these stories. Kudos to the editors! Honestly, I love what Vince has brought to the show (mostly me laughing at how pathetic he looks when he’s begging for his life in the game and talking about how bad he is), but sorry Vince, looks like your time is running out!",
