I've been working on a map for a while, and that has included making custom models and textures. As you can see, I use the debug stick to get these specially-shaped shelves the way I want, but if for example, I wanted a shelf to appear during gameplay, it won't work with commands. Even if I use a structure block or a /fill command like /fill 512 187 -95 512 186 -90 minecraft:diorite_wall[east=low,north=tall,south=tall,up=false,west=low], the result is not what I want, because for the top row of blocks, it automatically sets north and south to low instead of tall no matter what. And the /data command doesn't work on wall blocks either. Also, please keep in mind I'm trying to keep the map fully playable in vanilla Minecraft only.",

I had a command that worked (deleted out of annoyance), it would check if there was a block above a player’s head but it would only check up to 160 blocks above the player’s head which could be disastrous if someone was in a really tall house. Are there any commands that could fix this problem? Another problem I have is if the command uses /damage @.s 1 fire, it would also make the player take damage in water.",
