My goal is to pull all Figma variables (colors, spacing, typography) directly into my codebase to match our design system. I know I can use Tokens Studio to export variables as JSON and transform them into Mantine‚Äôs theme system (e.g., theme.colors). However, I recently learned about Figma‚Äôs Dev Mode MCP Server, which seems to let me integrate variables into code via tools like Cursor without plugins. A few questions: Is it feasible to use the MCP Server to map all Figma variables to Mantine without Tokens Studio? How reliable is it for this? Are there specific use cases where Tokens Studio is still better? Any gotchas or limitations with the MCP Server I should watch out for? Thank you for any help!",

If anyone has transferred from XD, what are some of your favourite features only Figma has to offer that dramatically improved your work?",

However, yesterday I went to give an important presentation and it totally failed. I had stored an offline copy. I was met with a black and unresponsive screen on all of my figma tabs. Restarting the program was met with the exact same issue. It was working directly before the presentation and started working again after. It seems like it could be related to an update being pushed as I was prompted to update after. I tried my backup link, that also did not work. I ended up having to use a backup powerpoint file that was very inferior to my Figma slides. Totally ruined my presentation. Just some feedback that Figma Slides is not ready for primetime. I can‚Äôt use a program that might randomly completely fail for important presentations. Has anyone else had similar issues? How could this have been mitigated?",

From your perspective as designers and users: ‚Ä¢\tHow useful do you find these AI features in real workflows? ‚Ä¢\tDo you feel they‚Äôre improving your productivity or replacing too much of the creative process? ‚Ä¢\tAre these moves keeping Figma ahead of competitors like Adobe/Canva/Webflow, or do they feel like hype?
