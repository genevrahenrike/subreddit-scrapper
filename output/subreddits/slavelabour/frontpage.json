You‚Äôre working closely with a startup, so this is every day of the week, no weekends off. Some days you might only need to do half an hour, others up to 10 hours (depends on our volume). Smart, coachable person. If you repeat the same errors frequently, termination is possible. Your job will involve going through a list of phone contacts from individuals who applied to create content for us, and sending a message to them via our messaging software. We‚Äôre capped at 50 outgoing texts per day, and you‚Äôre expected to reach that goal. If you‚Äôve read this far, comment or DM your favorite animal to confirm and apply. Besides the 50 outgoing, you‚Äôll also be responsible for replying to everyone who responds. You‚Äôll get a very short ‚Äútemplate‚Äù to use, but you will often need to personalize replies. There is definitely room to grow. If you consistently contribute, pay can increase from $100 to $150, then next month from $150 to $200 with continued strong performance.",

I already have one unpublished Shopify store that I‚Äôve started working on, but it‚Äôs far from finished and I‚Äôd like someone experienced to step in, refine it, and get it properly structured for launch. After this, I am planning to create at least four additional supplementary stores, and I‚Äôd like the same person to help me with all of them so there‚Äôs consistency across the setup and branding. This is not just a one-off task ‚Äî I‚Äôm looking to hire someone long term, ideally someone who I can keep working with for ongoing updates, store optimization, and potentially even future product launches or expansions. If you‚Äôre reliable, organized, and know your way around Shopify‚Äôs features, apps, and customization options, this could be a good fit for you. üìå What I‚Äôm looking for: ‚úÖSomeone with Shopify experience (theme customization, product setup, navigation/collections, integrating apps, basic SEO, etc.). ‚úÖAn eye for detail when it comes to store layout and user-friendliness. ‚úÖComfortable working independently and keeping me updated on progress. ‚úÖ Ideally, someone who has handled multiple stores before or has experience scaling beyond a single shop. üìå Scope of work: Finishing the current store: polish the design, finalize collections, check integrations, ensure it‚Äôs ready for launch. Creating 4 additional supplementary stores: these will likely be connected thematically to the main one, so a good sense of branding continuity will be important. Ongoing support: regular updates, troubleshooting, and store improvements as needed. üìå Payment: This will be hourly pay. I‚Äôm not setting a fixed price because the work will vary over time depending on the tasks and complexity, but we can discuss your hourly rate upfront. Payment method can be arranged based on what‚Äôs most convenient and reliable for both of us. Application: If you‚Äôre interested, please send me your CV or portfolio via DM. If you have examples of previous Shopify stores you‚Äôve worked on, that would be great to include as well. I‚Äôd really like to find someone I can count on for the long term, so if you‚Äôre looking for steady freelance work and you‚Äôre comfortable with Shopify, feel free to reach out. Thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you!",

Players chain receipt cards together under time pressure while avoiding audit detection. Think abstract tension, not literal offices. Deliverables : Three distinct concept art pieces , each presenting a possible visual direction for the game. Piece 1 ‚Äì The Core Loop : A mockup of the game screen, showing a player's hand of receipts/cards, a shop area, basic UI (colors, typography). Players need to quickly see which cards connect to others. Clarity is key ‚Äî this is the \"functional\" one. Piece 2 ‚Äì Psychological Lens : A reimagining of the same loop but infused with thriller/psychological energy ‚Äî paranoia, mounting pressure, the feeling of being watched or caught. Interpret freely: distorted visuals, surreal cues, oppressive atmosphere. Piece 3 ‚Äì Wild Card : A complete departure ‚Äî abstract, symbolic, unexpected. Could lean into metaphor, art-style experimentation, or thematic exaggeration. Important Notes : Decisions are made under time pressure, so visual clarity matters for quick reading. Avoid clich√©s like desks, cubicles, neon \"office dystopia\" ‚Äî unless you arrive there naturally. Don't design assets or final sprites ‚Äî focus on concept vision and mood. Typography, color palette, and overall feel matter more than polish. Budget: $50 for creative direction and mood guidance. Goal: give me direction, typography and color palette to execute the final art myself.",
