      "content_preview": "I have a tuned BMW 330i xDrive that was having issues with jerking at low RPMs while driving on the highway. I managed to resolve the issue by unplugging the downstream O2 sensor. Does anyone know if it’s safe to leave it unplugged? From what I understand, the downstream sensor isn’t used for AFR calculations and is mainly for emissions monitoring. My tune is supposed to have catalyst monitoring disabled, so I’m not sure why the sensor still seems active when it’s connected.",

Thinking this might be the EGR valve, anyone have any other ideas? Update, turns out all it takes to get an engine light and some codes is to say you don't have them. So the engine codes that popped up are: 29F5 and 29CF",

When driving there are no issues at all. When the engine warms up I get like a pulsating idle on P and N, but not in D or R (The revs doesn't move at all). Next thing, when you want to get moving, when in D feels like a bump or something like that and than it starts moving normally. And always getting to a stop before fully warmed engine feels like there is a little more vibration. Than 1-2 seconds after the stop (still in D) feels like something moved and the vibration get little smaller than before. Than again starting to move again feeling a bump, but if I move instantly after stop everything is ok. And the third problem, I checked the injectors (all good), changed the washers, intake manifold gaskets, EGR was programmed before and now the closed the vacuum. The engine started to shake when turning off and on... And this problem occured when i did all these things..",

I’m having cranking issues when it gets cold, and I’ve replaced the crankshaft position sensor which had a crack in the housing. During that repair I noticed a lot of oil in the connector and harness. I am planning to overlay the harness with new pigtail and wiring, but when looking for a schematic for the crank sensor circuit, I’m coming up with dead ends. Can anyone locate a schematic for me please? Just trying to see what the circuit looks like and if there’s a junction in the wiring or if I can just go straight to the DME. Thanks in advance!",

Luckily insurance covers everything so i picked new BBS rims and the workshop installed them. I went with the BBS XR 8,5x19 ET35. According to their site those are only allowed to be driven with FA: 225/35R19 RA: 245/30R19. Today i learnt that the rolling circumference has to be the same on both axles to not damage the xdrive components. Also the different tire sizes on the same sized rims looks a bit weird. Before i had smaller rims in the front and bigger ones in the back but the same tires that i mentioned above. So my main concern now is if this combination of tires and rims will damage my car or not?",

It would only crank. I called a second locksmith thinking that first locksmith might have missed something. After the second locksmith tried to add a new key, the car would not shut off the radio / navigation screen. The gas pump seemed to get stuck on and the trunk would not open so I could not get to disconnecting the battery (trust me. I tried everything). Second locksmith told me that the first locksmith erased the codes and a restore would not be possible and that the dealer would want to replace the whole DME due to them not restoring tempered ones. He suggested getting the DME restored with an online service. I have two options at this point. I can take the car to a dealership or a specialized shop. Any suggestions on what to do here? Can specialized shops fix these types of issues?",
