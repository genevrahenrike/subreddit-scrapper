Either my player would move too much in one direction or he'd lean hard to the side by doing something totally unnecessary as the dribbler goes by. Any help is much appreciated.",

That would sadden me and the entire community since this is the only viable NBA 2K alternative. I only picked up this game a few months ago and I wish I knew about it years ago. Can we continually @ EASPORTSNBA on Twitter or do something to get some kind of confirmation from EA that NBA Live 19 is done for good? Let me know your thoughts and any info you have.",

How do i play defense properly? It seems some ppl do LB/L1 others use LT/L2 but no matter wut i do i get beat off the dribble alot, is my build just terrible or is there stuff idk? Explanations n guides would help alot but every guide on youtube is essentially hold LB and others say hold LT. Send the tips n tricks soni can start clamping guys up",
