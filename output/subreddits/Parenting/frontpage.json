From the early stages of pregnancy to when your teenagers are finally ready to leave the nest (even if they don't want to) we're here to help you through this crazy thing called parenting. \n\nYou can get advice on potty training, talk about breastfeeding, discuss how to get your baby to sleep or ask if that one weird thing your kid does is normal.",

It's probably uncommon that both you and your spouse live close to both your own parents and in laws (unless from same area). Which parents did you choose to move closer to? My guess is the ones that help with childcare the most.My wife and I (and daughter) moved 2.5 hour drive away from my parents recently (my dad has Parkinson's Disease) and my mom doesn't really know how to care for him (both late 60s). My sister already moved away years ago (also 2.5 hours away from them so yes you guessed it - we relocated to be closer to my sister and her family. Plus we are closer now to my wife's sister and their family). Here's what happened though - we moved because I did not want to be the sole caregiver to my dad (as mentioned my mom can barely take care of herself).I know what you're thinking - how awful their son must be to move 2.5 hours away and not help care for his dad. Here's the problem - when we lived closer to them - I was expected to help with everything. It took time away from my wife, daughter and resentment was building so deep something was going to happen. I got to the point where I said screw this shit, this isn't fair to me or my own family. Keep in mind I suggested in home nurses/caregivers to help with my dad's care to assist my mom. But they didn't want to spend the money on it (and they have quite a bit of money). Story of my life where their priorities lie (I remember when my grandma passed and left a large amount of money to them my dad took a pic of the inheritance received and sent it directly to me. Who the F does that? Its not like he intended to send anything to his own kids). But thats another topic.I told my wife and daughter we were moving to be closer to my sister (and also my wife's sister) so I wouldn't have to be the sole burden of care for them. I do feel guilty, but it's not fair to my own family for me to be caring for my dad (no sibling help nearby) and if they want to move closer to both my sister and I for help, theyre welcome to (which they won't because of my dad's PD). They're not helping themselves (and I think resentment on my part over the years fueled the move).Funny thing is, my wife's parents decided to move closer to us when we made the move back in April. But they take more of an interest in our daughters day to day activities and help childcare.Should I have stayed with my parents? The guilt is real but so is resentment. We do make the drive once a month (since we moved) to visit and it usually involves doing things around the house for them.",

      "content_preview": "I have three adult children in their 20s. I raised them on my own, with the youngest being 3 and the oldest 7, when they saw their dad for the last time. Their dad was a coke and heroin addict, and it took me a few years to leave‚Äîeverything you‚Äôd imagine came with it, from financial ruin to domestic violence. The moment my ex turned on the children, I left.Anyway, I had no family to turn to, nothing. We were homeless at times, we moved a lot, even countries, and even stayed on trails in tents, trying to hide, because my ex was trying to find and hurt us. But over time, though, we started healing. I went to therapy, focused on raising the kids, trying to make a living, and keeping us at least somewhat afloat. We all worked hard. My kids worked for a few dollars anywhere they could so we could buy food or pay the electricity bill. Meanwhile, they went to school and studied. I went to every school event I possibly could, cheered them on in any way I could, and tried to find solutions for anything they wanted to do that we couldn‚Äôt afford or didn‚Äôt have the means for. Above all, my routine with them stayed consistent; for example, every evening after homework, we ate dinner together, and I read them a bedtime story when they were little, or we went to the local libraries every Saturday, stuff like that, no matter where we were and how bad it was.Fast forward to today: I just hung up the phone with my oldest. He works in a job he loves and moved in with a sweet girlfriend who cooks for him daily‚Äîhis biggest worry right now is the resulting weight gain. My other son just finished his master‚Äôs and is job hunting in a new city with his girlfriend, calling me for advice on job interviews and fashion choices. And my daughter‚Äîshe‚Äôs finishing her doctorate, takes care of four pets, visits me daily because she lives close by, and is basically like my best friend.The reason I‚Äôm writing all this is not just because I‚Äôm obviously immensely proud. No, it‚Äôs because I realized that all my children are kind, caring, educated, hardworking adults. I was so scared when they were growing up, because I had nothing, at times not even running water or a roof over our heads. But I marched on. I made sure they knew how to be consistent, ambitious, and hardworking. It wasn‚Äôt that I sent them to special schools, or that they had some incredible coach or life-changing experience. No, they were just kids who knew what my expectations were, and they also knew I was proud of them, supported them, and would go through fire for them if needed. Somehow, that seemed to be the most important thing.I‚Äôm not saying that providing all the other things parents (myself included) worry about aren‚Äôt important. But I want every worried parent out there to know: you don‚Äôt need to be perfect‚Äîyou just need tobe there. At times, all I had to give was simplybeing there. But that seems to have been enough to raise adults with both drive and empathy.Wishing you all a good night, y'all are doing great <3",

      "content_preview": "Hello, I have two kids. Ages 8 and 6.I separated from their father two years ago after he up and left (turns out he was cheating- I don‚Äôt know how I was so blinded- anyway). I have them full time. with occasional visits from their dad when he‚Äôs in town.The eldest has been giving me such a hard time that I genuinely do not like spending time with him. His younger brother is following his footstepsI know it‚Äôs partly his age, partly not having a man figure, partly iPad/screen. He loves his iPad and Netflix/disney+. He‚Äôs generally a nice boy to hang with his friends. But‚Ä¶. With me‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs an asshole.And the burden of being alone, a full time corporate employee, still not over being cheated on (I know my ex got married this summer- so I am battling resentment), and my sons‚Äô not following simple instructions is slowly draining all the love I have for them. It kills me to write this.These boys were my world- I used to be the mom Jumping on the trampoline with them, running after them at parks, waking up at 6 am because I don‚Äôt want to miss 1 minute.Now, they are a responsibility. Make sure they are fed and drop them at school. That‚Äôs it.I am emotionally distant from them. They can feel it.The behavior I can‚Äôt handle is the disrespect. The amount of times I have heard ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wish you are dead‚Äù this summer is more than I can bear.I always try to plan play dates, at least 3-4 times a week (during summer break). But getting them out the door screaming and shouting is getting on my last nerves. They don‚Äôt want to leave the house. I end up dragging them by their shirts to the outing. The eldest shouts and screams the entire drive about how I‚Äôm a horrible mom, forcing him to go out, forcing him to do things he doesn‚Äôt want, how he hates me, wishes I never existed.Then I end up asking them 12736 times to leave the play area. Then my son would say ‚Äúsorry I was mean‚Äù. But I just don‚Äôt care anymore. I would rather he doesn‚Äôt talk to me anymore.Everything is tiring. I know it‚Äôs probably screen addiction. But without screens to distract him, I would go crazy.The embarrassing part is my brother and his wife and my cousin look at me like I‚Äôm not a good parent when they‚Äôre on their iPads, then they look at me like I‚Äôm not a good parent when they‚Äôre having their tantrum.I don‚Äôt know how to discipline. I don‚Äôt know how to make them follow simple instructions like brush your teeth and put on your shoes.What angered me enough to write this post is that over the weekend, at my parent‚Äôs house (the whole family was gathered for the weekend), my kids woke up early so they sat watching tv while we were all sleeping (7 am) I woke up at 8:30 (it‚Äôs the weekend). Anyway I let them watch tv so I can drink my coffee, brush my teeth change my clothes (etc). I started telling them to turn off their iPads/tv by 9:15 and just go outside and play (this kept going). Later by 11 I gave them squares of aluminum foil and scissors and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make swords!! Or a robot!‚Äù. Shouts and screams like I had hit them. I kept turning off electronics and telling them to go play outside on the bikes, check the plants, etc. cue screams and shouts and tears. But when your son screams at the top of his lung and says the rudest meanest things infront of people, you tend to just want him to shut up and give you peace.I gave up. Then when I was packing to go back home, they went outside to explore, and made a Huge fuss about going back home and that they wanted to check the ants and bugs outside.I‚Äôm going out of my mind. I don‚Äôt want to be a mom.I know it‚Äôs also probably resentment knowing that their father is living his single life while I am ‚Äútrying‚Äù to parent and failing. It‚Äôs also them knowing how to manipulate the situation in their favor. But I don‚Äôt care if they spend 17 hours a days on screen anymore. They‚Äôll live.But the guilt is too strong",

I thought about reprimanding her but she was right, Im a failure and a lame excuse of for a mother. Their dad was out of the picture and being a single mom has been nothing but a struggle.My kid went home crying last friday and explained how she was being bullied for her clothes. Asked me if I can buy her new stuff and I straight up told her we can‚Äôt afford anything at the moment. Truth be told, I‚Äôve been trying my hardest and has been skipping meal at work for over a year now just so I could afford to pay bills and rent.She later apologized with her older brother and that made it even worse for me because I feel like she had the right to be upset. I grew up poor so I know firsthand how it feels to be bullied for simply not affording things that my classmates have. Theyre both good kids and they deserved a better parent but I‚Äôm genuinely trying my hardest. i plan on taking a payday loan to get her some new clothes but I‚Äôm not sure if thats the smartest idea but I just want my kid to be happy.Edit: I wont take the payday loan cause I know how it will ruin me more financially. Just considered it because I wanted my kid to have something new since her birthday is coming up in about 2 weeks too. Thanks everyone for the kind words, some of it made me cry.

      "content_preview": "Edit to add there isn't a dance. This is for the homecoming football game. Football and homecoming is a big deal here in the southI want to preface this with I completely understand where his parents are coming from and do not fault them at all. This is just my heart breaking for my daughter.My daughter(7th grade), asked a boy \"friend\" to homecoming. She didn't tell us that she was even thinking of asking anyone as she never talks about him in a romantic way. The boy said, \"Sure, why not?\"Girls are getting asked to homecoming left and right and for the 2nd year no one has asked her. Everyone shows off their giant mums and garters on game day. This boy is on her cross country team and they sit next to each other in one class. Unlike many boys their age, he's always been friendly, nice, and funny. After asking if he thinks of her more than friends, she says he's like that with everyone and she doesn't think he likes her like \"that.\" Her intention was as a friend who wanted to go to homecoming but didn't want to go with a gross and disrespectful boy.This morning his mom let me know that the family agreed that he was too young to \"date\" this year and he couldn't go to homecoming/dances. He was aware of this and said yes anyway. The mom said he was very flattered and most likely caught up in the excitement of being asked. That said, the boundary is strict and he has to back out of it. Again, I understand and respect this fully!It's been a conversation with her friends that they've said yes to boys only to be nice. As a mom, it was my worry that he said yes out of feeling on the spot and not wanting to hurt her feelings. I small part of me thinks his mom is covering him on this part. Of course, feel bad thinking this way about it. She's not ugly at all but a little different in style(not sporty clothes)/interests(Korean stuff) than her peers. She isn't flirty and isn't as interested in non-platonic relationships as other girls. She's had crushes, and has told them she likes them, but none of them ever liked her back.It takes guts to ask a boy out and I'm so proud of her for taking it into her own hands. Her confidence is my biggest worry. I was thinking of showing her the text the mom sent as it's neutral and kind. I haven't even responded to the mom yet as I'm still processing it.",

I told her she hadn‚Äôt, but their lunch AND recess time is a combined 35 minutes so I wasn‚Äôt surprised others were having problems. But today, when I picked up my daughter I asked her how her lunch was (today was mini corn dogs which she loves), she said ‚ÄúIt was good but I didn‚Äôt have time to eat my banana. It was so short‚Äù and it made me so sad ü•∫ she had to wait in line for her lunch because she had school lunch, and then sat down, and didn‚Äôt even have time to finish her food (food we pay for, not to be a karen or anything lol.) The school day is 7 hours, why can‚Äôt they make lunch longer? (And before anyone asks, they can‚Äôt dump their food and go straight to recess, the teachers excuse them to recess and then everyone has to go at once.)",

I didn't know the answer so I pulled it my cell phone and asked Google Gemini what countries still have polio. I started reading the response and my son (12) jumped in with all of the dripping saracasm he could muster and said \"According to AI...\"I said, \"That's fair.\" And then tapped on a more reliable source to continue reading the answer.

She was crying cause she had recently lost her dad. My daughter reported it to the school. The school did nothing, they also let the bully and her friends know who reported it. So that put a target on my daughters back. She ended up being bullied for the rest of high school form these girls. Time frame they graduated in 2019. Now I was already concerned about preschool, after speaking to another parent they observed the class for a day last year. The mom told me they were not watching the children, and instead were standing around gossiping about people, and A child that was being bullied was told that he would go inside and get no playground time if he didn‚Äôt get along, because he spoke up. So problem is I went to my toddler‚Äôs preschool testing and my older daughter‚Äôs bully and one of her close friends are the teachers aids. Apparently the bully has a family member that works at the preschool.  So im now the second parent in our parent group not sending their child to preschool because we don‚Äôt feel safe.

      "content_preview": "Yesterday I was lying on the bed with our 10 week old son whilst my partner was taking some time for himself next door playing his PlayStation game for about an hour. My partner finished up and came into the room where he then looked at me and could see I looked tired so he said to me ‚ÄòI‚Äôll take him for a bit so you can have some time for yourself‚Äô which I appreciated. He then followed with ‚Äòbut I‚Äôll get this time back to play more of my game later‚Äô as if his time is owed and he is doing me a favour?I then become upset about this, because this is not the first time he has said this he also said the same thing when I was bathing our son a few nights ago and he offered to help followed with the same statement ‚ÄòI‚Äôll just be owed this time back for my game‚Äô, to where I said well no then it doesn‚Äôt matter I‚Äôll bath him on my own.I am absolutely baffled why he would say this, or even think his time is ‚Äòowed back‚Äô for looking after our child which is both our responsibility!? If I was owed all my time back for when I look after him jeeze it would be hours or days on end.I become pissed off and we argued and have fallen out because he doesn‚Äôt see how he is in the wrong for saying this. I explained to him I don‚Äôt like the way he‚Äôs worded it, as it implies he is keeping score/tabs on how much time one has time to themselves while the other looks after baby. It also comes across to me like he‚Äôs doing me a favour, where I don‚Äôt need a favour I just need us to parent equally together.Am I seriously wrong for feeling this way??",

      "content_preview": "My 6 year old son is usually my easier kiddo but has been going through a major defiance/testing boundaries phase lately. We‚Äôve had to be a little more stern than usual with him but it seems to be helping for the most part. He‚Äôs stopping and thinking about his actions before he acts out, but his impulses definitely take over from time to time. His emotions can definitely take over his rational thinking as well but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs normal for this age to a point.He started a new reading challenge at school that was 100% voluntary on his part. If the students read a book a night for a month they get a prize. He‚Äôs all about it. I asked him if he wanted to do his book in the hammock out back tonight and he excitedly agreed.We get out to the hammock and he immediately starts being a turd. He grabbed the book out of my hands without warning and tore a page. He then started whining and crying about how he didn‚Äôt want to read anymore. I didn‚Äôt push him and said ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm heading inside.‚Äù He lost his mind. I told him if he calmed down we could try again. Instead he lashed out and punched my arm. I was completely shocked since it‚Äôs out of character for him. I said ‚ÄúAlright. Seems like you‚Äôre tired because you cannot control yourself right now. Let‚Äôs get to bed.‚Äù He started yelling and screaming. I still guided him upstairs. He was tucked in fighting and it was about 45 min before we typically start getting him ready for bed.I would have happily helped him work through whatever he was feeling but he was just absolutely out of his own body tonight. He fell asleep quickly so that tells me he was tired, but I can‚Äôt help but feel bad about using bed time as a consequence for hitting me. He also lost tv time for tomorrow because he banged so hard on his door that it went past the door jam and pulled a screw out. He will be helping dad fix that tomorrow after school instead of sitting down to watch a show like he normally does. I guess I was just looking for a place to vent. I dunno.",

NO ONE SAW IT. No one saw him sneak into the pool after his dad took his swim vest off. No one heard him struggle. By the grace of God, he is okay (we will be monitoring him for secondary drowning symptoms tonight).Please, PLEASE do not think for one second that a kid will listen when you ask them to wait for you. My husband walked 15 ft to get his goggles. In that time he went into the water. I'm still replaying this in my head as I am THE cautious parent of our friends. I'm the one who has anxiety about everything and yet, this happened to my kid.My husband and I are revisiting our swim practices, tagging each other in and out and NEVER, ever taking his vest off without the other knowing.My son has been in Goldfish lessons for 3 years, once a week.

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone,After years of trying and multiple miscarriages, I‚Äôm (36F) 20 weeks pregnant and expecting a girl in January. My husband and I are obviously thrilled, but there‚Äôs something nagging at me and that something is my mom.My mom has histrionic personality disorder and therefore has issues with respecting other people‚Äôs boundaries. Like when I ask her not to mention my pregnancy to people I don‚Äôt know, she tries to post it on Facebook anyway. Or when I ask her not to buy me a million baby clothes, she does so anyway. Or sometimes it‚Äôs more serious, for example when I ask her not to smoke in front of me now that I‚Äôm pregnant and she does it anyway. That kind of stuff. Apart from this personality disorder she‚Äôs chronically on high doses of morphine for back issues and will drink wine with it in the evening, although she says ‚Äòit‚Äôs not much‚Äô. She has a history of alcohol addiction when I was a child, so I‚Äôm very weary and don‚Äôt like to be around her at night.Now the current issue: she‚Äôs made multiple comments on how she wants/expects to babysit when baby is here. My husband and I are apprehensive because of her opioid use and her breaking promises like not smoking around me while I‚Äôm pregnant etc. On the other hand: my dad is in assisted living with dementia and my in laws are deceased, so we have a very little ‚Äòvillage‚Äô so to speak. On the one hand she‚Äôs the only grandparent my daughter will have. My sister lives in another country and my husband isn‚Äôt in contact with his siblings.What do we do?! Allow her to babysit short amounts of time? Just at our house? Or no babysitting at all and just visiting? Maybe when the child is a bit older? She commented on us getting an extra bed in the house so she can stay over all the time, so she‚Äôs very set on it. How do I set and enforce boundaries, or is that wishful thinking?I know my main focus should be the safety of my child and not my mother‚Äôs feelings, I‚Äôm just lost how to go about it. Any experience or advice is welcome, also please let me know if you think I‚Äôm just overreacting - my upbringing with her alcohol abuse was quite traumatic at times, so it could blur my vision. I‚Äôm also looking to find advice in that regard: would others also not let her babysit?",

      "content_preview": "Today my 10 year old came home shaking and crying immediately off the bus about him and other students throwing rocks at a tree trying to kill a spider.  Then one of the rocks hit another student causing major bleeding and for extra caution student had to be transferred by ambulance.  Apparently there was- lot of blood. After the injured student was gone they talked to many students 8 names came up including my son. Quickly my son admitted to being of the kids throwing rocks. He was extremely concerned for other student, showed signs of remorse and visibly shaking up.   I reached out to the school first (surprised they didn‚Äôt do it first? ) they explained situation and also notified me the cameras did not show him physically doing itThey did not want to punish him however they are keeping him in the office tomorrow all day because they are worried other students might show anger towards him & cause him added anxiety. He also gets to be with the counselor a lot tomorrow which will be helpful.    They understand and completely agree that this wasn‚Äôt something done on purpose.However I can‚Äôt help but feel so sad, anxious , frustrated for not only the kids parents but the entire situation.  My son is already bullied a lot because kids don‚Äôt understand autism. I‚Äôm worried about getting sued by this kids parents even tho there‚Äôs no video evidence.  They plan on having a 4th grade assembly tomorrow about this entire situation (obviously not including my son because he will be in the office) that the student (my son) did not mean to do this and this being a good lesson for thinking about your actions.I‚Äôm just beside myself about this whole thing.Has anyone been through something similar and how did it work out for you?",

      "content_preview": "For back story and context : my grandma lives in a duplex with us. She lives on one side, and we (me, my husband, and 2 kids ages 10 and 11) live on the other side.Last year my kids were going to a school out of district. I wanted them to go to the one that is literally 6 houses down from us but my grandma and mom didn‚Äôt agree and ended up saying they‚Äôd pay the tuition for the other school and contribute in to driving them as they thought the out of district school was better. I ended up giving in as long as they kept their end of the deal. Throughout the year it became a fight because they no longer wanted to be in charge of driving them. (I couldn‚Äôt be there to drive them every day). So for this year I switched them to the school down the street to avoid more fighting. The out of district school clearly wasn‚Äôt working out and resentment was growing.Well, now they‚Äôre walkers. They seem to like it. I like it. It‚Äôs so much easier and I assumed my grandma would have nothing to anrgue about with me. However she‚Äôs still inserting herself. She doesn‚Äôt like that I don‚Äôt physically walk them. I did at first so they‚Äôd know what to do, but now Ive trusted them to do it themselves. I wait on the porch for them after school and every day my grandma has yelled at me about how I‚Äôm not doing it right and should be walking to get them.Today it came to a heated discussion because it was raining. I had warned my kids that it would be raining when they got done with school and had asked if they wanted picked up. They both said they were fine and that they enjoy their walk home alone so I just made sure they‚Äôd be dressed appropriately for the rain. My grandmother ended up leaving the house to walk down to get them with an umbrella for really no reason at all imo. It was sprinkling by time they were done. When they returned it turned in to a disagreement between her and I. That‚Äôs kind of whatever to me at this point and I‚Äôm not asking what to do about my relationship with her. it ended with me saying that maybe she should take a break from involving herself with my children since it‚Äôs clearly stressing her out.But now that I‚Äôve had some time to think about what has been said to me I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing for my children. Like are my kids too young to be walking themselves? Am I being an inadequate parent by letting them walk in the rain at all? I just don‚Äôt know what to do or what the right answer is for us going forward.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all,I'm the dad of a wonderful 11 year old daughter that just entered 6th grade. Mom and I have been separated for 9 years. Daughter spends close to equal time with both of us.My daughter has been struggling in school the last few years. Last year I got her diagnosed with ADHD at the end of the year and got her on an IEP. She certainly has ADD- but a lot of her struggles have been due to not putting in the effort- likely because of the ADHD.Well its a fresh start this year in middle school. And for the first time, she is properly medicated. I got her a phone last year because there were two days a week where she would have to be alone for about an hour. But I got a massive promotion and now work from home.I told my daughter before school started that she would have to be involved in some kind of extra curricular that has a GPA requirement in order to have an unlocked phone.Daughter agreed- but when school started she said it wasn't fair and complained to her mom. Her mom got extremely upset abd said I was being unfair and that she doesnt want our daughter doing extra curricular because she wants her help at home with the baby.Mom also moved 1.5 hours away and I'm sure the commute is also an issue- even though I said I would do all the driving.I backed off a little and said if she wants her phone- she will need to have a very high GPA with zero missing assignments. And her phone would be locked until she proves she is doing the right thing.Mom called this rediculous and said she would just buy her a phone if I don't relent.I don't feel like I am out of line here. In my mind- a phone for an 11 year old is not a necessity. It's something extra. And if she wants it, then she should put in extra effort.To my daughter's credit- she has been doing amazing in school. Though its only been about 6 weeks. But she really is out of chances with ne when it comes to school.Now I am the bad guy for having standards- which I am fine with. But I am frustrated and disappointed by both of them.Am I taking crazy pills? Or is there something I am missing about my position?Just to note- an accusation Mom made is that i am trying to \"force her to be an athlete\". But it's made it clear from day 1 she could choose any extra curricular she wants.Please help me out here.",

She‚Äôs been there for 2 weeks and is getting used to being in this new environment, which is great, it makes me so happy for her to be able to be interacting with kids her age.So, today I come and pick her up after 2 hours there. The daycare worker tells me she‚Äôs been sleeping for about 25 minutes so I wait a little as she is not used to sleeping without me helping her so I think it is good practice.After a while, I decide to go and get her in the room. I don‚Äôt find her in any of the bed. I ask the caregiver ‚Äúshe‚Äôs in this room?‚Äù And then she comes with me. She then proceeds to lift the blanket of what I originally thought was a toy and there was my baby, completely covered with the blanket, from head to toe. I did not know what to say, I was just shocked. I asked and my baby did not put the blanket on her head by herself, she was put to sleep like that. For 35 minutes.To me, it feels like the most basic thing NOT to do. Should I just tell them my boundaries? What tells me they won‚Äôt do it again? Part of me just wants to keep her home with me now, as I could manage it with her dad/my partner.Help",

      "content_preview": "My freshly three year old has been doing this for a while now. Any time my husband tries to talk to me or vice versa, sometimes while I'm talking to other adults or children (though less often as when it's just my husband and me), she'll interrupt abruptly with \"talk to me!\" and she's pretty rude about it. And she has nothing really to say, it's just that she doesn't like that we're not talking to her right that second. We've been teaching her, repeatedly, that we need to talk to others, and that she can gently let us know when she has something she needs to tell us.I have tried the \"tap my arm when you have something you need to tell me, then I'll give you a signal to let you know I understand, and when I'm done talking to someone else, we can talk\", or the \"sometimes I do need to talk to other adults\" etc. It's been months of telling her this, and it still happens often.What has worked with your kiddos? Are there any books for kids that seem to get the message across? I know this is probably one of those lessons we'll have to repeat over and over and over again until it finally sticks. But maybe we're not explaining things well. All suggestions welcome!",

His genetics don‚Äôt carry him very far on their own, but like me, he‚Äôs scrappy.  He knows the game extremely well, he gets along with his teammates on and off the field, he has been to all practices, summer camps, conditioning‚Ä¶. Along with being a bit small, he doesn‚Äôt speak up for himself much, he is a people pleaser, so he draws very little attention.Long story, medium, every other player got time, every. (it was a scrimmage). He was called up a couple times only to be turned back around by a field coach.  Needless to say, he is upset and frustrated by not knowing why.I am trying to be thoughtful about how I handle it, or if I should stay out of it, or so on.I have always been hands off with my children enabling them to solve their own problems.  I‚Äôm supportive but I try to guide them through the probing using their own actions.There have been a couple of times I was torn on my decision to jump in or not, even in hindsight.I recognize that this is likely just an oversight, but man, 1 out of say 60?As I see it, here are my options:Stay out of it and support my son, from sideline and at home.Coach my son and prepare him to meet with his coach to inquire as to what happened.Set up a meeting with coach myselfEmail coach to directlyThose are all I have come up with, please let me know what you think I‚Äôm missing or ideas/approaches.Oh, I forgot to mention, I have yet to personally meet the coach.",
