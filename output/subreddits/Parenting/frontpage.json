From the early stages of pregnancy to when your teenagers are finally ready to leave the nest (even if they don't want to) we're here to help you through this crazy thing called parenting. \n\nYou can get advice on potty training, talk about breastfeeding, discuss how to get your baby to sleep or ask if that one weird thing your kid does is normal.",

It's probably uncommon that both you and your spouse live close to both your own parents and in laws (unless from same area). Which parents did you choose to move closer to? My guess is the ones that help with childcare the most.My wife and I (and daughter) moved 2.5 hour drive away from my parents recently (my dad has Parkinson's Disease) and my mom doesn't really know how to care for him (both late 60s). My sister already moved away years ago (also 2.5 hours away from them so yes you guessed it - we relocated to be closer to my sister and her family. Plus we are closer now to my wife's sister and their family). Here's what happened though - we moved because I did not want to be the sole caregiver to my dad (as mentioned my mom can barely take care of herself).I know what you're thinking - how awful their son must be to move 2.5 hours away and not help care for his dad. Here's the problem - when we lived closer to them - I was expected to help with everything. It took time away from my wife, daughter and resentment was building so deep something was going to happen. I got to the point where I said screw this shit, this isn't fair to me or my own family. Keep in mind I suggested in home nurses/caregivers to help with my dad's care to assist my mom. But they didn't want to spend the money on it (and they have quite a bit of money). Story of my life where their priorities lie (I remember when my grandma passed and left a large amount of money to them my dad took a pic of the inheritance received and sent it directly to me. Who the F does that? Its not like he intended to send anything to his own kids). But thats another topic.I told my wife and daughter we were moving to be closer to my sister (and also my wife's sister) so I wouldn't have to be the sole burden of care for them. I do feel guilty, but it's not fair to my own family for me to be caring for my dad (no sibling help nearby) and if they want to move closer to both my sister and I for help, theyre welcome to (which they won't because of my dad's PD). They're not helping themselves (and I think resentment on my part over the years fueled the move).Funny thing is, my wife's parents decided to move closer to us when we made the move back in April. But they take more of an interest in our daughters day to day activities and help childcare.Should I have stayed with my parents? The guilt is real but so is resentment. We do make the drive once a month (since we moved) to visit and it usually involves doing things around the house for them.",

Getting her every day gives me motivation that would just be spent playing video games.

      "content_preview": "I have three adult children in their 20s. I raised them on my own, with the youngest being 3 and the oldest 7, when they saw their dad for the last time. Their dad was a coke and heroin addict, and it took me a few years to leave‚Äîeverything you‚Äôd imagine came with it, from financial ruin to domestic violence. The moment my ex turned on the children, I left.Anyway, I had no family to turn to, nothing. We were homeless at times, we moved a lot, even countries, and even stayed on trails in tents, trying to hide, because my ex was trying to find and hurt us. But over time, though, we started healing. I went to therapy, focused on raising the kids, trying to make a living, and keeping us at least somewhat afloat. We all worked hard. My kids worked for a few dollars anywhere they could so we could buy food or pay the electricity bill. Meanwhile, they went to school and studied. I went to every school event I possibly could, cheered them on in any way I could, and tried to find solutions for anything they wanted to do that we couldn‚Äôt afford or didn‚Äôt have the means for. Above all, my routine with them stayed consistent; for example, every evening after homework, we ate dinner together, and I read them a bedtime story when they were little, or we went to the local libraries every Saturday, stuff like that, no matter where we were and how bad it was.Fast forward to today: I just hung up the phone with my oldest. He works in a job he loves and moved in with a sweet girlfriend who cooks for him daily‚Äîhis biggest worry right now is the resulting weight gain. My other son just finished his master‚Äôs and is job hunting in a new city with his girlfriend, calling me for advice on job interviews and fashion choices. And my daughter‚Äîshe‚Äôs finishing her doctorate, takes care of four pets, visits me daily because she lives close by, and is basically like my best friend.The reason I‚Äôm writing all this is not just because I‚Äôm obviously immensely proud. No, it‚Äôs because I realized that all my children are kind, caring, educated, hardworking adults. I was so scared when they were growing up, because I had nothing, at times not even running water or a roof over our heads. But I marched on. I made sure they knew how to be consistent, ambitious, and hardworking. It wasn‚Äôt that I sent them to special schools, or that they had some incredible coach or life-changing experience. No, they were just kids who knew what my expectations were, and they also knew I was proud of them, supported them, and would go through fire for them if needed. Somehow, that seemed to be the most important thing.I‚Äôm not saying that providing all the other things parents (myself included) worry about aren‚Äôt important. But I want every worried parent out there to know: you don‚Äôt need to be perfect‚Äîyou just need tobe there. At times, all I had to give was simplybeing there. But that seems to have been enough to raise adults with both drive and empathy.Wishing you all a good night, y'all are doing great <3",

      "content_preview": "Hello, I have two kids. Ages 8 and 6.I separated from their father two years ago after he up and left (turns out he was cheating- I don‚Äôt know how I was so blinded- anyway). I have them full time. with occasional visits from their dad when he‚Äôs in town.The eldest has been giving me such a hard time that I genuinely do not like spending time with him. His younger brother is following his footstepsI know it‚Äôs partly his age, partly not having a man figure, partly iPad/screen. He loves his iPad and Netflix/disney+. He‚Äôs generally a nice boy to hang with his friends. But‚Ä¶. With me‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs an asshole.And the burden of being alone, a full time corporate employee, still not over being cheated on (I know my ex got married this summer- so I am battling resentment), and my sons‚Äô not following simple instructions is slowly draining all the love I have for them. It kills me to write this.These boys were my world- I used to be the mom Jumping on the trampoline with them, running after them at parks, waking up at 6 am because I don‚Äôt want to miss 1 minute.Now, they are a responsibility. Make sure they are fed and drop them at school. That‚Äôs it.I am emotionally distant from them. They can feel it.The behavior I can‚Äôt handle is the disrespect. The amount of times I have heard ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wish you are dead‚Äù this summer is more than I can bear.I always try to plan play dates, at least 3-4 times a week (during summer break). But getting them out the door screaming and shouting is getting on my last nerves. They don‚Äôt want to leave the house. I end up dragging them by their shirts to the outing. The eldest shouts and screams the entire drive about how I‚Äôm a horrible mom, forcing him to go out, forcing him to do things he doesn‚Äôt want, how he hates me, wishes I never existed.Then I end up asking them 12736 times to leave the play area. Then my son would say ‚Äúsorry I was mean‚Äù. But I just don‚Äôt care anymore. I would rather he doesn‚Äôt talk to me anymore.Everything is tiring. I know it‚Äôs probably screen addiction. But without screens to distract him, I would go crazy.The embarrassing part is my brother and his wife and my cousin look at me like I‚Äôm not a good parent when they‚Äôre on their iPads, then they look at me like I‚Äôm not a good parent when they‚Äôre having their tantrum.I don‚Äôt know how to discipline. I don‚Äôt know how to make them follow simple instructions like brush your teeth and put on your shoes.What angered me enough to write this post is that over the weekend, at my parent‚Äôs house (the whole family was gathered for the weekend), my kids woke up early so they sat watching tv while we were all sleeping (7 am) I woke up at 8:30 (it‚Äôs the weekend). Anyway I let them watch tv so I can drink my coffee, brush my teeth change my clothes (etc). I started telling them to turn off their iPads/tv by 9:15 and just go outside and play (this kept going). Later by 11 I gave them squares of aluminum foil and scissors and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make swords!! Or a robot!‚Äù. Shouts and screams like I had hit them. I kept turning off electronics and telling them to go play outside on the bikes, check the plants, etc. cue screams and shouts and tears. But when your son screams at the top of his lung and says the rudest meanest things infront of people, you tend to just want him to shut up and give you peace.I gave up. Then when I was packing to go back home, they went outside to explore, and made a Huge fuss about going back home and that they wanted to check the ants and bugs outside.I‚Äôm going out of my mind. I don‚Äôt want to be a mom.I know it‚Äôs also probably resentment knowing that their father is living his single life while I am ‚Äútrying‚Äù to parent and failing. It‚Äôs also them knowing how to manipulate the situation in their favor. But I don‚Äôt care if they spend 17 hours a days on screen anymore. They‚Äôll live.But the guilt is too strong",

I thought about reprimanding her but she was right, Im a failure and a lame excuse of for a mother. Their dad was out of the picture and being a single mom has been nothing but a struggle.My kid went home crying last friday and explained how she was being bullied for her clothes. Asked me if I can buy her new stuff and I straight up told her we can‚Äôt afford anything at the moment. Truth be told, I‚Äôve been trying my hardest and has been skipping meal at work for over a year now just so I could afford to pay bills and rent.She later apologized with her older brother and that made it even worse for me because I feel like she had the right to be upset. I grew up poor so I know firsthand how it feels to be bullied for simply not affording things that my classmates have. Theyre both good kids and they deserved a better parent but I‚Äôm genuinely trying my hardest. i plan on taking a payday loan to get her some new clothes but I‚Äôm not sure if thats the smartest idea but I just want my kid to be happy.Edit: I wont take the payday loan cause I know how it will ruin me more financially. Just considered it because I wanted my kid to have something new since her birthday is coming up in about 2 weeks too. Thanks everyone for the kind words, some of it made me cry. Sorry I couldnt reply to everyone, didnt expect for this to blow up.",

      "content_preview": "Edit to add there isn't a dance. This is for the homecoming football game. Football and homecoming is a big deal here in the southI want to preface this with I completely understand where his parents are coming from and do not fault them at all. This is just my heart breaking for my daughter.My daughter(7th grade), asked a boy \"friend\" to homecoming. She didn't tell us that she was even thinking of asking anyone as she never talks about him in a romantic way. The boy said, \"Sure, why not?\"Girls are getting asked to homecoming left and right and for the 2nd year no one has asked her. Everyone shows off their giant mums and garters on game day. This boy is on her cross country team and they sit next to each other in one class. Unlike many boys their age, he's always been friendly, nice, and funny. After asking if he thinks of her more than friends, she says he's like that with everyone and she doesn't think he likes her like \"that.\" Her intention was as a friend who wanted to go to homecoming but didn't want to go with a gross and disrespectful boy.This morning his mom let me know that the family agreed that he was too young to \"date\" this year and he couldn't go to homecoming/dances. He was aware of this and said yes anyway. The mom said he was very flattered and most likely caught up in the excitement of being asked. That said, the boundary is strict and he has to back out of it. Again, I understand and respect this fully!It's been a conversation with her friends that they've said yes to boys only to be nice. As a mom, it was my worry that he said yes out of feeling on the spot and not wanting to hurt her feelings. I small part of me thinks his mom is covering him on this part. Of course, feel bad thinking this way about it. She's not ugly at all but a little different in style(not sporty clothes)/interests(Korean stuff) than her peers. She isn't flirty and isn't as interested in non-platonic relationships as other girls. She's had crushes, and has told them she likes them, but none of them ever liked her back.It takes guts to ask a boy out and I'm so proud of her for taking it into her own hands. Her confidence is my biggest worry. I was thinking of showing her the text the mom sent as it's neutral and kind. I haven't even responded to the mom yet as I'm still processing it.",

She is crying and so upset she lost her Barbie, and now she cant feed the baby doll because it is clogged.

He would embarrass my son in front of others and slowly pull all the other boys away from him. And it worked. He loved the control, he thrived on it.By the end of last school year, my son‚Äôs whole group of friends had turned on him. The boys he felt safe and comfortable with ‚Äî gone. Now he sits with kids at lunch that he doesn‚Äôt really connect with, just to have someone to sit with. But he misses his old friends so much.He‚Äôs about to turn 13. This is supposed to be the time he‚Äôs finding himself and building those lifelong bonds, and instead he‚Äôs dealing with betrayal and isolation. It breaks my heart to watch him go through this.How do I help him heal and move on when he still misses them so much?",

I told her she hadn‚Äôt, but their lunch AND recess time is a combined 35 minutes so I wasn‚Äôt surprised others were having problems. But today, when I picked up my daughter I asked her how her lunch was (today was mini corn dogs which she loves), she said ‚ÄúIt was good but I didn‚Äôt have time to eat my banana. It was so short‚Äù and it made me so sad ü•∫ she had to wait in line for her lunch because she had school lunch, and then sat down, and didn‚Äôt even have time to finish her food (food we pay for, not to be a karen or anything lol.) The school day is 7 hours, why can‚Äôt they make lunch longer? (And before anyone asks, they can‚Äôt dump their food and go straight to recess, the teachers excuse them to recess and then everyone has to go at once.)",

I didn't know the answer so I pulled it my cell phone and asked Google Gemini what countries still have polio. I started reading the response and my son (12) jumped in with all of the dripping saracasm he could muster and said \"According to AI...\"I said, \"That's fair.\" And then tapped on a more reliable source to continue reading the answer.

My daughter wants to wake up very early because she says she \"needs that time to get ready and have a good day.\"  She is refusing to wake up any time other than 3:45 AM.  And if she sleeps late because she sleeps through her alarm, she fights us in the morning about going to school because she didn't get to do her morning things.  She said whether or not we want her to do it, she will not wake up any later than 3:45.Is this normal?  How would you handle this?My wife and I are on the same page about 5 AM being the earliest she should wake up in the morning.  And yes, that also means that she wants to go to bed around 8 PM.",

My partner finished up and came into the room where he then looked at me and could see I looked tired so he said to me ‚ÄòI‚Äôll take him for a bit so you can have some time for yourself‚Äô which I appreciated. He then followed with ‚Äòbut I‚Äôll get this time back to play more of my game later‚Äô as if his time is owed and he is doing me a favour?I then become upset about this, because this is not the first time he has said this he also said the same thing when I was bathing our son a few nights ago and he offered to help followed with the same statement ‚ÄòI‚Äôll just be owed this time back for my game‚Äô, to where I said well no then it doesn‚Äôt matter I‚Äôll bath him on my own.I am absolutely baffled why he would say this, or even think his time is ‚Äòowed back‚Äô for looking after our child which is both our responsibility!? If I was owed all my time back for when I look after him jeeze it would be hours or days on end.I become pissed off and we argued and have fallen out because he doesn‚Äôt see how he is in the wrong for saying this. I explained to him I don‚Äôt like the way he‚Äôs worded it, as it implies he is keeping score/tabs on how much time one has time to themselves while the other looks after baby. It also comes across to me like he‚Äôs doing me a favour, where I don‚Äôt need a favour I just need us to parent equally together.Am I seriously wrong for feeling this way??",

We‚Äôve had to be a little more stern than usual with him but it seems to be helping for the most part. He‚Äôs stopping and thinking about his actions before he acts out, but his impulses definitely take over from time to time. His emotions can definitely take over his rational thinking as well but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs normal for this age to a point.He started a new reading challenge at school that was 100% voluntary on his part. If the students read a book a night for a month they get a prize. He‚Äôs all about it. I asked him if he wanted to do his book in the hammock out back tonight and he excitedly agreed.We get out to the hammock and he immediately starts being a turd. He grabbed the book out of my hands without warning and tore a page. He then started whining and crying about how he didn‚Äôt want to read anymore. I didn‚Äôt push him and said ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm heading inside.‚Äù He lost his mind. I told him if he calmed down we could try again. Instead he lashed out and punched my arm. I was completely shocked since it‚Äôs out of character for him. I said ‚ÄúAlright. Seems like you‚Äôre tired because you cannot control yourself right now. Let‚Äôs get to bed.‚Äù He started yelling and screaming. I still guided him upstairs. He was tucked in fighting and it was about 45 min before we typically start getting him ready for bed.I would have happily helped him work through whatever he was feeling but he was just absolutely out of his own body tonight. He fell asleep quickly so that tells me he was tired, but I can‚Äôt help but feel bad about using bed time as a consequence for hitting me. He also lost tv time for tomorrow because he banged so hard on his door that it went past the door jam and pulled a screw out. He will be helping dad fix that tomorrow after school instead of sitting down to watch a show like he normally does. I guess I was just looking for a place to vent. I dunno.",

      "content_preview": "I know lying is wrong, but he started to lie habitually (and refused each time that he did that) so I wanted to make him stop. He's now extra cautious when he's about to lie, sometimes he covers his forehead when he lies. I'm also careful when I call him out on it, because if he tells the truth but I assume it's a lie, and tell him \"your light turned on\", he might realize that the light isn't reliable and stop caring about it.So when I think he lies, I bend a little so my eyes are on the level of his forehead, and stare at this forehead. Then say: \"I'm about to ask you again, and if the light turns on, we're gonna have to talk it out. If you tell me the truth, whatever that is, our convo about it will be short and nobody will get sad because we lied to each other\". I did that yesterday, and despite him lying 5 seconds prior, he folded and told me the truth. I only said: \"I'm proud that you told me the truth, I'll never get mad if you're honest with me. Honesty is the most important thing in a relationship, it makes people trust you\". I hope it will stick with him eventually.I kinda feel guilty about it, but for now I'm enjoying a sincere relationship with him, while explaining how wrong lying is.ETA: Thank you for proving why Reddit is the most toxic community. This is the equivalent of a white lie, and literally the only one. This is not that serious. We never lie in our family and this is why I took this measure, to stop it in its tracks. I explain to him daily why we shouldn't lie, but this was my way to make him admit he lies. To anyone wondering \"maybe figure out why your kid is lying?\" - well maybe because he's a kid and doesn't realize yet how wrong it is? This is a common problem among his classmates. For anyone getting the spears out for something like that.. Seriously get help ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

The daycare worker tells me she‚Äôs been sleeping for about 25 minutes so I wait a little as she is not used to sleeping without me helping her so I think it is good practice.After a while, I decide to go and get her in the room. I don‚Äôt find her in any of the bed. I ask the caregiver ‚Äúshe‚Äôs in this room?‚Äù And then she comes with me. She then proceeds to lift the blanket of what I originally thought was a toy and there was my baby, completely covered with the blanket, from head to toe. I did not know what to say, I was just shocked. I asked and my baby did not put the blanket on her head by herself, she was put to sleep like that. For 35 minutes.To me, it feels like the most basic thing NOT to do. Should I just tell them my boundaries? What tells me they won‚Äôt do it again? Part of me just wants to keep her home with me now, as I could manage it with her dad/my partner.Help",

      "content_preview": "My son is 13 and he's a great kid. He's never been in any serious trouble and he has shown that he will come to my husband and I if something happens that he knows isn't okay, or if he has questions about something, no matter how awkward. His internet use is monitored, and we have had many many conversations about internet safety. He hangs out with friends who have less restrictions and who knows what they're consuming.Cody (not his real name) is at the age of \"peer pressure\" and he's the target demographic for ultra conservative media. This is my main concern. My husband and I are both pretty liberal and have tattoos and grew up being generally \"alternative\". Naturally, our son doesn't want to be like his parents, so his way of rebellion is to conform. Which is fine with us! We encourage him to be true to himself and that it's okay to have different views than us.I want to have a conversation with Cody about how damaging these algorithms are that are targeting boys his age. We already dealt with Andrew Tate a couple of years ago. Cody learned what human trafficking is and agreed that Tate sucks. But now there's SO much going around and targeting kids about having these ultra conservative values that are rooted in misogyny and racism. My worry is that Cody will retort with \"just because you don't agree with it, doesn't mean it's wrong\" or something along those lines.I'm looking for advice about how to present this concern as more of a difference between right and wrong as opposed to a difference of opinion.

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone,After years of trying and multiple miscarriages, I‚Äôm (36F) 20 weeks pregnant and expecting a girl in January. My husband and I are obviously thrilled, but there‚Äôs something nagging at me and that something is my mom.My mom has histrionic personality disorder and therefore has issues with respecting other people‚Äôs boundaries. Like when I ask her not to mention my pregnancy to people I don‚Äôt know, she tries to post it on Facebook anyway. Or when I ask her not to buy me a million baby clothes, she does so anyway. Or sometimes it‚Äôs more serious, for example when I ask her not to smoke in front of me now that I‚Äôm pregnant and she does it anyway. That kind of stuff. Apart from this personality disorder she‚Äôs chronically on high doses of morphine for back issues and will drink wine with it in the evening, although she says ‚Äòit‚Äôs not much‚Äô. She has a history of alcohol addiction when I was a child, so I‚Äôm very weary and don‚Äôt like to be around her at night.Now the current issue: she‚Äôs made multiple comments on how she wants/expects to babysit when baby is here. My husband and I are apprehensive because of her opioid use and her breaking promises like not smoking around me while I‚Äôm pregnant etc. On the other hand: my dad is in assisted living with dementia and my in laws are deceased, so we have a very little ‚Äòvillage‚Äô so to speak. On the one hand she‚Äôs the only grandparent my daughter will have. My sister lives in another country and my husband isn‚Äôt in contact with his siblings.What do we do?! Allow her to babysit short amounts of time? Just at our house? Or no babysitting at all and just visiting? Maybe when the child is a bit older? She commented on us getting an extra bed in the house so she can stay over all the time, so she‚Äôs very set on it. How do I set and enforce boundaries, or is that wishful thinking?I know my main focus should be the safety of my child and not my mother‚Äôs feelings, I‚Äôm just lost how to go about it. Any experience or advice is welcome, also please let me know if you think I‚Äôm just overreacting - my upbringing with her alcohol abuse was quite traumatic at times, so it could blur my vision. I‚Äôm also looking to find advice in that regard: would others also not let her babysit?",

After the injured student was gone they talked to many students 8 names came up including my son. Quickly my son admitted to being of the kids throwing rocks.

I reached out to the school first (surprised they didn‚Äôt do it first? ) they explained situation and also notified me the cameras did not show him physically doing itThey did not want to punish him however they are keeping him in the office tomorrow all day because they are worried other students might show anger towards him & cause him added anxiety. He also gets to be with the counselor a lot tomorrow which will be helpful.    They understand and completely agree that this wasn‚Äôt something done on purpose.However I can‚Äôt help but feel so sad, anxious , frustrated for not only the kids parents but the entire situation.  My son is already bullied a lot because kids don‚Äôt understand autism. I‚Äôm worried about getting sued by this kids parents even tho there‚Äôs no video evidence.  They plan on having a 4th grade assembly tomorrow about this entire situation (obviously not including my son because he will be in the office) that the student (my son) did not mean to do this and this being a good lesson for thinking about your actions.I‚Äôm just beside myself about this whole thing.Has anyone been through something similar and how did it work out for you?",

It started around 10th grade when the bully recorded one of my daughters friends crying in class and sent it to a group chat making fun of the girl. She was crying cause she had recently lost her dad. My daughter reported it to the school. The school did nothing, they also let the bully and her friends know who reported it. So that put a target on my daughters back. She ended up being bullied for the rest of high school form these girls. Time frame they graduated in 2019. Now I was already concerned about preschool, after speaking to another parent they observed the class for a day last year. The mom told me they were not watching the children, and instead were standing around gossiping about people, and A child that was being bullied was told that he would go inside and get no playground time if he didn‚Äôt get along, because he spoke up. So problem is I went to my toddler‚Äôs preschool testing and my older daughter‚Äôs bully and one of her close friends are the teachers aids. Apparently the bully has a family member that works at the preschool.  So im now the second parent in our parent group not sending their child to preschool because we don‚Äôt feel safe. A I really don‚Äôt believe that these girls should be working with children or for the school system.",

      "content_preview": "My daughter just came home from a birthday party in tears, and it completely broke my heart. It was a small gathering with four girls in total (including her), all from her class last year.She has played with each of these girls one on one before and always had good experiences, but being in a group felt very different for her. She said the other three seemed closer to each other and she felt left out while they played together.She also mentioned that the birthday girl was very bossy. My daughter is more sensitive and tends to pick up on the mood around her, so she felt uncomfortable. The others were being silly, farting in front of each other, not washing their hands after using the bathroom, and then touching her and the food, which really grossed her out.She told me she was so relieved to come home and missed us so much. At bedtime she cried her eyes out and said she feels like nobody likes her or wants to play with her. She described feeling excluded, uncomfortable, and out of place.There were also some hurtful comments. The birthday girl teased her about being short, and another girl looked down her shirt and said she was ‚Äúgrowing little boobs.‚Äù Whenever my daughter suggested something, her ideas were dismissed by the bossy friend. Later, when the others decided to join in with her game, the birthday girl yelled at her for not knowing the rules.What makes it extra hard is how much effort my daughter put into this friendship. She carefully chose a full outfit for the birthday girl as a gift and spent time making a heartfelt card. She truly values her friendships and puts her whole heart into them, so when she is treated this way it is very discouraging for her.Lately she has been especially sensitive when it comes to her friendships, and I am wondering if this is something other parents have also seen/ having advice on what to do?",

      "content_preview": "For back story and context : my grandma lives in a duplex with us. She lives on one side, and we (me, my husband, and 2 kids ages 10 and 11) live on the other side.Last year my kids were going to a school out of district. I wanted them to go to the one that is literally 6 houses down from us but my grandma and mom didn‚Äôt agree and ended up saying they‚Äôd pay the tuition for the other school and contribute in to driving them as they thought the out of district school was better. I ended up giving in as long as they kept their end of the deal. Throughout the year it became a fight because they no longer wanted to be in charge of driving them. (I couldn‚Äôt be there to drive them every day). So for this year I switched them to the school down the street to avoid more fighting. The out of district school clearly wasn‚Äôt working out and resentment was growing.Well, now they‚Äôre walkers. They seem to like it. I like it. It‚Äôs so much easier and I assumed my grandma would have nothing to anrgue about with me. However she‚Äôs still inserting herself. She doesn‚Äôt like that I don‚Äôt physically walk them. I did at first so they‚Äôd know what to do, but now Ive trusted them to do it themselves. I wait on the porch for them after school and every day my grandma has yelled at me about how I‚Äôm not doing it right and should be walking to get them.Today it came to a heated discussion because it was raining. I had warned my kids that it would be raining when they got done with school and had asked if they wanted picked up. They both said they were fine and that they enjoy their walk home alone so I just made sure they‚Äôd be dressed appropriately for the rain. My grandmother ended up leaving the house to walk down to get them with an umbrella for really no reason at all imo. It was sprinkling by time they were done. When they returned it turned in to a disagreement between her and I. That‚Äôs kind of whatever to me at this point and I‚Äôm not asking what to do about my relationship with her. it ended with me saying that maybe she should take a break from involving herself with my children since it‚Äôs clearly stressing her out.But now that I‚Äôve had some time to think about what has been said to me I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing for my children. Like are my kids too young to be walking themselves? Am I being an inadequate parent by letting them walk in the rain at all? I just don‚Äôt know what to do or what the right answer is for us going forward.",

      "content_preview": "My original post generated hundreds of comments:https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/16ye1pb/should_i_force_my_daughter_to_go_to_summer_camp/tl;dr from the original: I really wanted to send my daughter to a wonderful old-school summer camp for a 3+ week session. I was pretty confident she would thrive, but she was dead set against it. And I was looking for advice on what to do.The response: Most people thought it was a horrible idea to compel her to go. Lots shared stories of their own sleepaway camp nightmares. Though a number of people disagreed, and several reached out via PM to encourage me to sign her up. But in the end, the wife and I agreed not to force it.The update: Her best friend went to this camp without her. She must have enjoyed it enough to convince my daughter, because in the fall my daughter asked if she could also attend the camp. So we very happily signed her up.This summer, she spent 3.5 weeks away from us at camp. She thrived. She's already excited for next year. And the kicker? She told me that I should have made her go last year even though she really didn't want to.Did I learn anything? Not really, no. If I had made her go, maybe she would have thrived and loved it. But maybe she would have rebelled and hated it. My instincts that she would do well at camp were good, but it's very possible she wasn't ready for it in 2024. We'll never know. But I'm pleased that it all worked out well.",
