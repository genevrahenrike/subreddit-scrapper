      "content_preview": "I did some battery tests in several smartphones and came to the conclusion that 5,000mAh lithium batteries are not able to last a whole day in 5G with these extremely powerful hardware like the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and a future Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 makes no sense to consider.So these HUGE Carbon Silicon batteries are inevitable for future hardware.The result was as follows:TheiPhone 16 Pro(3.582mAh) does 4 hours of screen on 5G with great difficulty, and can't make it to the end of the day, while theiPhone 16e(3.961mAh) makes 6 hours of screen time with the new C1 modem, a huge differential.TheGalaxy S23 Plusfor example, has 7 hours of screen time on 5G with its 4,700mAh, with 10 hours on stand-by.TheS24 Plus(4,900mAh) andS25 Plus(4,900mAh) fare worse in 5G than the S23 Plus because it has more hardware and a small battery, 2 mistakes in a row that Samsung has made... both do 6 hours of screen time on 5G, but with a worse autonomy.If you take anIQoo Z10(7,500mAh), for example, it does 11 hours of screen time on 5G normally, with 20 hours on Stand-by, but it has average hardware.Silicon Carbon Batteries have an absurd autonomy, even with a modem that is bad in autonomy in 5G.9-millimeter phones with 15,000mAh battery is crazy, but it's already a reality in the newRealmemodels.And so far I haven't seen anything in Snapdragon that comes close to Apple's C1 modem in energy efficiency, the latest Dimensity has a better autonomy in 5G. The S25 Ultra does poorly in 5G, gets very hot and consumes a lot of energy. The best argument is that Qualcomm's processors are too powerful compared to the competition, and small lithium batteries are not able to sustain all that power, and it also lacks a more efficient modem like Apple's C1 in Snapdragon, of course Apple's hardware uses much less power than Qualcomm's,  which has better energy efficiency.I don't know if theS26line will come with the new 2-millimeter Exynos 2600, the first in the world. But if they actually perform 15-20% better than the Snapdragon 8 Elite and have better energy efficiency with possibly a Modem comparable to or better than Apple's C1, it will be a good excuse from Samsung for not using Silicon Carbon batteries yet.The battery test of the S25 Edge was so bad that I didn't want to put the results, but it didn't reach 3 hours of screen time on 5G, one of the few smartphones with a worse battery than the Pro line of iPhones I've ever seen, putting so much power in a battery of that size doesn't even make logical sense, the result was an abnormal price drop due to too low sales in such a short time.",

It's been 5 years since I've had an android and everything feels newish to me. So much has changed and everything feels so different esp. after being indoctrinated into the apple ecosystem.I've watched those \"first 10 things to do with your pixel\" videos on youtube, but a lot of them seem to be generic bs while I'm looking for something more advanced. I remember being able to customize the heck out of my pixel (had a 3xl before) and use different launchers and keyboards and file management, but that was the extent of the customization I did back then. Looking to get deeper into that with my new pixel. Any apps, features or hacks i should know about?One e.g. i really liked was the MT capsule app that make your front facing camera similar to the iphone's live island.",

      "content_preview": "HelloFive years ago, I built an eBook reader app for Windows (Aquile Reader), born out of a personal need for a modern, user-friendly reading experience on the platform. However, I found myself not using it so often, as most of my reading was happening on mobile. Syncing progress between devices was a hassle, and issues like manually copying files, fragmented reading stats, and lack of continuity made the experience clunky.Recognizing this gap, I spent the last 2 years developing an Android version of the app as a side project, that supports seamless cross-device sync of books, annotations and reading progress between Windows and Android apps. The app offers a full-featured reading experience, including annotations, text-to-speech, reading insights, UI customization, built-in dictionary, translation, and more.The app is still evolving, but I’m proud of how far it has come. I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback from the community!Android Play Store linkWindows Store link",

First time poster here, but been using android for the past 15-odd years.As long as i have been using android, at every reset/new phone, I have always set the locale to my country (MY).What is the advantage if i set my phone to the US locale?

      "content_preview": "Alright guys.. after 30 days of use, I’m ready to give my detailed thoughts on the Xiaomi 15.Here we go!So prior to swapping to the Xiaomi 15, I was using the iPhone 13 Pro max. An awesome device, with a fantastic camera and even better battery life. But I eventually got sick and tired of how heavy the device was. Carrying a brick in your pocket gets tiresome after a few years. Reading in bed, or trying to use the device with one hand was basically impossible. So I went on the hunt for a new device. For me, it had to have the following:A great displayA great battery lifeA flagship cameraA smaller footprintGood speakersFast charging/Wireless chargingAt first, I was going to opt for the s25 or Pixel 9. Both great devices, but I felt both devices were lacking something.. So I keep hunting for something else. I was super close to buying the Vivo X200FE, but it lacked wireless - something I use every night. I found a used Xiaomi 15 (Global) on eBay for $750 AUD. It was only used for a few days, so I made the decision to snap it up. I also made a YouTube video over the course of 30 days to share my experience of using the device if you want tocheck it out.Okay, so… here’s my pros and cons to begin with:Pros:I love the size of the device. It’s slightly taller than the s24/s25 series, but still feels small in my hand.It’s also a nice weight. Feels solid. Really well built.It’s extremely well balanced. My finger rests perfectly on the bottom of the camera bump and it has minimal table wobble.Battery life is 1.5 days for me. I typically end most days with 50% or more. I think you could probably kill the battery in a day if you do a lot of maps and gaming though. (I don't game).Camera is really snappy and does a great job with moving objects. (I have kids so this is a big win for me).Camera is true flagship. Some of the images I’ve captured with this device are awesome - the detail is insane even when you zoom in and pixel peep. (check the link below for Google photos link)Speakers are full for a device that’s pretty small.All the AI junk is hidden for the most part. If you don’t want to use AI, you don’t have to. I think that’s a win lol.The Snapdragon 8 Elite is powerful and there’s nothing this phone can’t handleCons:The software is okay atm, but HyperOS 3.0 will be a welcome update (based on what I’m seeing on Youtube).I had some weird heat issues when I first started using the device. From what I can tell, it was related to YouTube. I don't have any heating issues now.I hate the Xiaomi theme store. It feels cheap and spammy.I hate that I can’t uninstall certain apps. Xiaomi locks down lots of apps that can only be removed using abd.Flash charger only works if I use a worldwide charging adapter. Power delivery chargers only deliver a max of 20w charging which is a bit disappointing.And thats it! Overall, I really like the Xiaomi 15. It’s well built, has a GREAT camera, solid software and really reliable battery life.This is the first time in a few years that I’ve used an Android device, so it took some getting used to. In saying that, I don’t miss my iPhone 13 PM nearly as much as I thought I would. I don’t miss iMessage at all and RCS is solid.I’m looking forward to testing out HyperOS 3.0 once it’s available - it looks really cool and the \"dynamic island\" looks awesome. Once that drops I’ll do a follow up review.If you'd like to see a photo walk I did with the Xiaomi 15click here.",

      "content_preview": "I think Google’s decision to restrict sideloading apps from unknown developers is actually a good move. My reasoning is tied to AI progression. As AI becomes more advanced, it will be able to generate complex code that can quickly be packaged into apps. People could then sideload these apps without realizing the risks. For example, such apps might secretly upload your photos to external servers or capture your passwords.Yes, Android has security protections, but for how long? It could easily turn into an endless cat-and-mouse game. Trying to patch each new exploit is like trying to stop a flood with a bucket—it doesn’t solve the core problem. By blocking unverified sideloading at its root, Google is taking a future-proof approach to safety.That said, I don’t believe Google is doing this purely out of concern for users. Their motives are likely profit-driven. Still, from a security perspective, the move makes sense. Android stays relatively open, since sideloading isn’t gone entirely. But things like heavily modded apps and free APKs will be affected.Even though I personally use a lot of modded apps, I recognize that I’ll eventually need to let them go. In the bigger picture, this decision brings both benefits and drawbacks, but I can see how it ultimately strengthens user safety.This text was made cleaner and simplified by using ChatGPT-5.",

I would install the apks on my phone for testing, and i assume that will be impossible with this new term",
