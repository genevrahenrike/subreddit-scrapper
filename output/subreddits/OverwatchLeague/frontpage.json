I never watched OWL on overwatch 2, and I understand that 5v5, hero bans, and a different design philosophy has made fights much more scrappy, and heros generally have a lot less survivability, but I can't help but feel like they are just not as good and in sync as old OWL teams, specifically at the beginning of 2020 after role queue was introduced and the became started becoming super straightforward and optimized. Im watching OWCS NA playoffs day 2 vod and even though I recognize a lot of names, I can recognize the way these tanks are losing space and control without gaining much in return, specifically some of this orisa gameplay, where I see heesung just throwing himself forward and backward not paying attention to important cooldowns like his juno or opposing orisa. Ive watched about 12 maps worth from 4 games and it just seems like everyone is doing there thing, even with hero picks. The game doesn't feel this balanced in normal comp so how is there such a variety of damage selections even within a map or point? Maybe im reading too much into this and the game has just fundamentally changed too much for me to understand pro play and whats a small mistake that you can only see with hindsight vs a large one with game changing consequence.",

      "content_preview": "Over the years, I've kinda ended up with an insane amount of signed OWL trading cards, from opening boxes of the multiple different series they made. (Do not ask how much I've spent please) I genuinely have over 300 different autographed cards at this point, so I think it might be time for me to start moving of some of them. My collection is currently a bit split up though, with around 80% of it still being in the US, while I live in Canada. https://imgur.com/a/d3QurDO I have all the cards in these two photos with me in Canada right now, ready to be shipped anywhere in the world. I have cheap global shipping options, so please don't hesitate to inquire if you live somewhere foreign. Okay, now about pricing. Gonna be honest, there is virtually no sales data for this stuff, especially higher end cards like trio autos which are really hard to find/pull. I'm not expecting to make back any of what I spent actually opening these cards. If you just make me a reasonable offer for the stuff you want, we should be able to work something out :). I can also take USD or CAD payments, Paypal G&S works too if you are a bit hesitant to trust a Reddit stranger lol. If there is a specific player / card you are looking for PLEASE JUST MESSAGE ME. I'm going back to the US this summer, and I'm going to be picking up the rest of my collection. I literally have more autos for Lip, Sparkle, Hanbin, Smurf, Fielder, Fearless, Alarm, Pelican, Bumper, Happy, among countless other players. Unless you are a big Rakattack fan (Rakattack never got any autos), I defenitely have your favorite players autograph in my collection. My DM's are open for all messages! Thanks for reading this far, have a great day! Edit: I'm getting asked quite a bit about s5 and s6 rookies. Unfortunately the owl cards only go up to s4, with Proper being the only exception. I don't have autos for players who joined after s4.",

      "content_preview": "OWL was my first experience with E-sports. I knew people were doing StarCraft tournaments when I was in college, and I saw clips from time to time of competitive COD, but could barely have named any professional e-sports orgs... maybe FAZE clan. I streamed some TF2 matches and learned a few org names that way, but never enough to remember more than a really talented name or two. I was really into Overwatch when OWL came out. I picked a favorite team based on locality (SF Shock), and a second favorite based on colors/Logo (London Spitfire). I watched streamed matches, knew players names, knew the announcers and everything. I still remember how mad I was when they added OP Brig in the middle of the season and it shut down Tracer, and my favorite players were all Tracer mains. And right at the height of it, I was in LA, and there was a match in Burbank. I knew my wife would not want to go, and I'm kind of a go-with-the-flow kind of person, so I brought it up once, acting like it was a joke, and when she said no, I let it go. Only after I missed it did I realize how much I really wanted to see a match live, and so I decided that the next time I was in the area during a match, I would just go without my wife and see if I could arrange a spa day for her or something. Then of course the league shuttered. I missed my chance! I've never gotten into any of the other leagues; I would occasionally watch Contenders, especially around the time the Hangzhou Spark were making a splash (I don't remember clearly, but I think they made so much noise in Contenders before joining OWL that I might have watched before, or else I started watching shortly after when I realized how strong those teams were that one could be directly promoted into OWL.) But it was never really about the skill-- I mean I want to say \"holy cow how did he do that\" once in awhile, but I also cared about the branding-- cheering for the local team, learning who the kindhearted players were, learning which orgs sucked and could be viewed as the heels, and so on. So anyway. It doesn't necessarily have to be Overwatch, but I'm curious if there's an e-sport for OW or any other game that comes close to what OWL had, that I could start to get interested in and, if I enjoy it enough, watch live. To put it another way, do you have a recommendation for an e-sport league/group/competition that has: -A game with an active online community with some form of SBMM so that I could join and not get rolled all day every day (I'm not that good, barely made plat by the end of OW1 and never got past plat in OW2). It's okay if it's toxic, but even better if it's not. -A professional league with memorable personalities doing the casting, player interviews, highlights, etc -Teams that have physical location (I enjoy cheering for the home team, rooting against Wisconsin teams if I have a chance, and so on) or at the very least a tangible team personality or something else bringing them together besides a contract telling them who is paying them. -A season with regular matches and a championship tournament, not just annual or sporadic individual tournaments and prizes -Matches that are occasionally played in a physical studio so that I could have a chance to watch. I mean, my ideal would be that there's a really good Overwatch e-sport league where a lot of the OWL talent migrated to, but I'm open to other options.",

      "content_preview": "This is a simple question but one that has so many different possibilities. There has clearly been so many different metas in Overwatch's history but not all of them are very interesting. I'm simply interested in which one is your FAVORITE, not which one is the best. For an example, I think one of the conceptually bad metas is the 2021 June Joust (East) meta consisting of: Reaper Echo Winston/Wrecking Ball D.Va Moira Lucio Conceptually, this meta sucks. In practice it was a chaotic mess. I am willing to admit that this meta sucks, but for some reason I love it. It's just so chaotic and everything hinges on the ultimates I'm not quite sure why I love this meta so much but, I just do. Now, if I had to pick an absolute favorite I'm not quite sure I could but I can give you a few of my all-timers. IN NO SPECIFIC ORDER 2022 Summer Showdown Meta Genji Sojourn Junker Queen Lucio Brigitte 2023 OWL Championship Meta Reaper Sojourn Winston Kiriko Lucio 2020 Summer Showdown Meta (BROKEN Genji meta) Genji Widow/Ashe Orisa Sigma Baptiste Brigitte 2021 June Joust Meta Reaper Echo Winston/Wrecking Ball D.va Moira Lucio It's a bit difficult to name more of my favorite metas than that. I LOVE Genji metas because Genji is one of the most interesting characters to watch at a high level. I'm a die-hard Dragons fan aswell so Whoru helps with that a lot. I feel like the major problem with metas at times is the meta can be fine but there's one character who kind of just sours it completely. For instance just look at OWCS Championships last year. Most people ran some variation of: Reaper Echo Mauga Juno Lucio Conceptually, I do like every character on the board. Except for one. The most important one. Mauga. Mauga has single-handedly stunk up so many different metas that otherwise would've been perfectly fine, which is why I can't call some metas some of my favorites. His presence taints them. Anyways, those are just my thoughts. I'm very curious to hear what you think about metas. Oh and real quickly I'll mention GOATS because it's the most prominent meta of all time. While I hate GOATs, I respect what it did for the game. It pretty much on its own forced role queue into competitive because it sucked to watch that bad.",
