      "content_preview": "I (28f) lost both of my parents when I was a teenager. My father was a terrible cook and started a fire trying to make mac and cheese. My mother was in the kitchen with him, so they both died in the fire. This obviously made life harder for me. As an adult, I feel so much resentment that everyone else has their parents and not me. Therefore, I thought I would kill some parent sims and make their kids orphans, just like me. I invited Bella and Mortimer Goth as well as Geoffrey and Nancy Landgraab to a pool party at my place. When they all got in the pool, I built a wall around it so they couldn’t get out. They all drowned and their urns were in front of the pool. I later invited Cassandra, Alexander, and Malcolm to see that their parents had died and to celebrate us being orphans coming together. However, they all started crying. I did not want them to cry, so I sold the urns to get their minds off of the situation, but they continued to look sad. AITA? Was this the right decision, or should I also trap these kids in the pool since they’re being ungrateful?",

      "content_preview": "I know, the title sounds bad, but hear me out. I (YA f) never had much luck in love. After a few dates with a local Trader it was clear we weren't going to work out, we were compatible on some levels but I wasn't going to let a Kleptomaniac steal my heart and my home decor. I needed to drown my sorrows and wanted to avoid the local watering holes for fear of running into him. I'd heard of a bar called Grimtooth's that caters to all kinds of occults, functioning as a neutral ground, somewhere I could be as Disruptive as I liked without the Fairy Council breathing down my neck. That's where I met C, the bartender. She was breathtaking, truly beautiful. Her scars told me she may be a Werewolf, but apparently the lycan life wasn't for her. Even after taking the cure she didn't want to return to her family in Ciudad Enamorada, she liked the new town and seemed settled. We had a shared history of terrible dates with terrible thieves, it seemed like we were meant to be. I threw caution to the wind, asking her out at the end of her shift. The next few weeks were like a dream: picnics in the park, romantic hikes, Woohoo everywhere and anywhere. I thought she was The One. After a while though, C became withdrawn, something was on her mind. She was evasive, turning me down when I asked her to move in with me. It hurt, but maybe she just needed more time, or maybe she didn't want to leave the town. I offered to move in with her instead, leaving my cosy home in Innisgreen, but still no! We argued, I said some things I probably shouldn't have, I never met her mother but she probably isn't a llama. Eventually the truth came out: there was someone else. During her brief spell as a Werewolf she'd formed a bond with somebody, a pack leader who was chaos incarnate. C confided that every time the moon was full her heart ached, she couldn't stop thinking about this other woman. She swore she hadn't acted on this while we were together, but her sick puppy-love was enough of a betrayal. I didn't understand, they seemed so incompatible. I offered to use my powers to rid her of this sentiment, so we could enjoy the moonlit nights together without her being plagued by thoughts of R. But C declined, she said it was too painful, she couldn't defy fate. My own heart was broken. I'd fallen for the wrong person yet again. The years passed and occasionally I heard whispers from Moonwood Mill. They married not long after C rejoined the Pack, shedding her humanity to be with R completely. They welcomed pups together, a boy and a girl. Meanwhile I threw myself into my work, advancing in my career, developing my abilities, dating whenever the opportunity arose. I met someone new, I think she might be My Person - for real this time. She's a bit younger than me, yes, but her parents were stifling her in their tech-polluted home and she needed somewhere to go. We moved in together and, while I haven't wanted to put a label on it, we're definitely more than just roommates. She's about to start her own Fairy journey, I can't wait for her to join me. A few days ago I had a singing gig at a lounge. My set was well received, beguiling even, and I indulged in a drink once I finished. I was about to invite My Person to join me, but somebody across the bar caught my attention. It was R. Bold as brass, fully transformed, sat watching some stupid sports-ball match on the TV with - ew - a Spellcaster. I listened into their conversation, practically dry-heaving while they gushed about their respective partners and swapped baby pictures. Even worse: the Spellcaster is married to a Vampire - and R didn't have a problem with this!? C had clearly fallen for an idiot, moon magic be damned. I couldn't sit by and watch, I had to intervene. It was just one teeny-tiny bit of Emotional Magic, a small flick of my fingers, and before I knew it they were throwing themselves at each other. Just for a moment, before the screaming started. R was howling, she looked like she was in physical pain. I savoured their emotions, taking in just enough before being overcome by my own playfulness. I made myself scarce, leaving them to argue over who kissed who. l was still on cloud nine when I got home to My Person. We spent the night snuggled on the settee, I stroked her hair while she leafed her way through yet another Apothecary book. It was peaceful, I felt truly content… until my phone rang. I was greeted by a voice I hadn't heard in almost a decade. I went to another room to take the call, My Person didn't need to hear this. “R told me everything. Don't try to deny it, I know it was you.” The fairy dust in R’s fur was a dead giveaway. I'd been sloppy. I played dumb, reminding C I'm not the only disruptive force in town, maybe she should check in with the Summerdreams? C shut me down at every excuse, but I refused to give in. I heard a baby crying on the other end of the line and she ended the call, not before hurling a few insults my way. When I returned to the living room, My Person wasn't alone: there was a woman on our settee. There was something… dark about her. This must be the Vampire wife. My Person looked distressed. She wasn't dazed so she'd seemingly let this creature into my home willingly. I considered for a moment stripping her of her powers, absorbing her dark magic before she could hurt either of us. I deeply regret not acting on that impulse. Like R, her spouse had told her everything, grovelling and begging forgiveness as soon as they returned home - truly pathetic behaviour. And she had given it. Again, I'd left an unintentional calling card on their clothing. C must have pointed her in my direction. I expected a fight, but she tore me down with just her words instead. “Just because C didn't want you doesn't mean you're unlovable. It's your actions that do. If you come near my spouse or my friends ever again, I will rip those wings from your back and break every bone in your body. Do we understand each other?” I nodded, grudgingly, and she left. I had expected My Person to speak up, defend me against the “unlovable” allegations at least, but she was silent. I reached to hold her hand but she recoiled, refusing to listen as I protested my innocence. She knew about my history with C and how painful the breakup had been. It was different for her, I was her first everything, she'd never been through a heartbreak. We argued into the early hours of the morning. My Person had taken the word of a Vampire of all creatures over my own. In the end she packed a bag and left to stay with a friend. It's been a few days now, my calls and texts have gone unanswered. It seems that R has cost me another chance at love. Is this really my fault? I saw an opportunity and I took it, that's all. Am I the Llama here?",

      "content_preview": "So I married an elder Sim with a lot of money. (Don’t judge — I wanted a pool and nice furniture before my YA years were over and comfy life for my cats.) Anyway, we (he) purchased a house, but I didn’t really feel like sharing the main bedroom. So I designed a “guest suite” for him… except it’s also where I keep the cats’ litter boxes and other junk. Now he keeps waking up miserable and because the cats are meowing all night and the “Uncomfortable” moodlet from the smell won’t go away. He complains constantly and is grumpy. I argue he should be grateful he’s still in a room with a bed, walls, and even a nightstand, and mostly, still married to me. Plus, the cats like him more now so I don’t need to worry if they are uncomfortable with him being there in their private room. My cats are 6 and 18, well behaved and sweet but they can be very picky who they let in their life so obviously I feel very responsible when introducing new partner they will need to cohabit with. My Sim friends think I’m being cold and should give him a proper space in master bedroom. But he’s old and snores and it makes me resent him. AITA?",

      "content_preview": "I (ya, m) am friends with “Jen” (ya, f) and D (ya, m). When we were seniors in high school we attended a get together around graduation together along with my boyfriend. Something about Jen and D is that they’ve been best friends for most of high school since Jen moved into the area, and briefly dated for a few sim months at the time of the party they weren’t dating but had history. I don’t know why they broke up but they were always amicable with each other. Took a break from hanging out together all the time and branched out a bit more. D had a date who joined us at the party, “NC”. Anyway, we were all getting along, Jen had gotten a glass of punch, and I noticed the party host seemed to collide with her as she left the refreshment table. I couldn’t be sure but it looked like he may have spiked her punch with something. I didn’t want to say anything if I was wrong, so I made a point of staying close by incase I was right. Jen finished her punch and started stumbling around, slurring her words and acting like she was drunk. I’ve seen her wasted before and trust me when I say that girl can drink. One glass of anything doesn’t get her like that. Immediately the host, JH, tried to get her into a bedroom. I hollered for D and acted like a barrier until he came over to us. I relayed what I’d witnessed and like I thought, D let loose on JH, while my boyfriend and I helped Jen out of the party. We took her back to my place, constantly checking on her vitals while she slept it off on my couch and had a garbage bin next to her incase she got sick when she woke up. Now since then, NC has been blowing up my phone and social bunny about how I  ruined her date with D. D’s thanked me for looking out for Jen. Jen thanked me and D when she woke up. I’m a comedian and D’s a bartender at one of the bars where I perform. Recently NC and JH started heckling me about being a buzz kill and a cock block at one of my gigs. I just asked the audience to voice their opinions on rapists and enablers, causing them to get booed out of the establishment, and now I’m getting bombarded again telling me I need to stop over stepping. AITA for stepping in for my friend?",

      "content_preview": "I ([redacted] f) have an unconventional living arrangement. I left my husband when it became clear my powers far exceeded his, taking our son S with me to the city. I hate children, but his father comes from a long line of Master Vampires, and I wanted to cement my position in that lineage. Unfortunately my ex seems to be getting… soft as the years pass, and even I couldn't expose a child to that. I moved my underlings, K and M, into the home so the boy would have a strong male role model, and somebody for me to pawn the more cumbersome duties of motherhood onto. I tried on several step-fathers for size but none were compatible, with one disappearing entirely to avoid myself and the child. Of course the little brat didn't appreciate my efforts, he even had a Clingy phase just to spite me. Just thinking about his sticky hands reaching out for a cuddle still makes me shudder. I thought it would get easier once S became a teenager. He grew into a handsome young man that I could mould in my own image, instilling in him the superiority of our kind and training him to be a master of the craft. He disappointed me, just like his father, showing far more interest in music of all things rather than developing his powers. He began answering back, butting heads with M and K, demanding they put clothes on in the communal areas of my home! The final straw came the day I found out one of my creations had married a - I can't even write the word, it's too disgusting. A beast is all I will say. One of those knuckleheads calling themselves Wildfangs. I was beside myself, distraught. I had been very fond of C, he had so much potential. S had the audacity to ask what the problem was with such a union. The informality I could almost excuse, he is a teenager after all, but the wilful ignorance in the face of my grief was unforgivable. I tried to make him understand how it violates the natural order, going against everything we fought for through the Centuries Conflict. I may have called him a disappointment and a weakling like his father, amongst other things. I stand by the remarks but he is still my son - there's nothing I can do about that. My ex came to collect him the same night, I should never have given the boy a phone, taking him back to Forgotten Hollow. My house was peaceful once again, allowing me time to devote to my studies and refining my powers. I could enjoy time with my underlings without complaints about the noise or his eyes. We talk twice a week - no more, no less - using all of my self-control to keep the calls civil. The conversations are exhausting, but I prefer to keep communication open with him should he ever see sense and wish to return. S would bore me with accounts of his school days, what he'd been up to with his little friends, probably more but I could only feign enthusiasm for so long before asking how his lore studies were going, ensuring his weakling father was at least trying to push him when they sparred. K and M could see I needed frivolity, they're so attentive to my needs. Dressed in our finest, they took me to my favourite haunt, Die Fledermaus. The bartenders make the best Plasmapolitans this side of Moonlight Falls and keep a fresh supply of Donors in the basement for discerning customers. I'm assured that they're willing, you can always taste the difference, though I do prefer my food with a little fight in it. After drinking my fill, lounging away the impending food coma, I savoured the lull in our conversation and listened to the other patrons gossip. Between the usual hair-brained plots to put down that mongrel Greg, something caught my attention - and it was spreading quickly through the bar. Apparently the teenage son of a Master Vampire had struck up a friendship with the son of a dog pack leader. Worse still, it was those hippie-dippy peace-loving Moonwood Mutts, the humiliation!! I momentarily revelled in that poor Vamp’s shame, how could they show their face in refined society after a scandal like this? I was desperate to know who it was, one of the Van Gould children perhaps. But the question crept in: could it be that my own son had betrayed not just me, but our kind as a whole? The next evening I confided in K and M. They could tell something was troubling me, I wasn't as punishing and domineering with them as I usually am during our trysts. I expected them to react with the same revulsion I had, unable to comprehend how my own little Hell-spawn could have acted out like this, how far the plasma fruit had fallen from the tree. Instead they offered help. For now it was all just rumour, I had no confirmation that S was the deviant everyone was whispering about. M’s plan was to try and catch them in the act, he would sacrifice his own comfort to stake out Moonwood Mill. A week passed, K and I heard nothing from him. She did her best to tend to my needs alone, but they've always worked better as a team. I could tell she was worried, distracted from her duties. M eventually returned with a fanciful tale, smelling of Spellcaster, and a souvenir: his own gravestone. I struggled to believe his story. He hadn't witnessed anything of importance, instead lingering too long while watching the Collective Cabin for any movement. Before he knew it the sun was coming up and there was nowhere to hide. His sun resistance isn't as developed as it should be, but it isn't too much of an issue here in the shadows of the city. M was surprised I hadn't seen anything about his demise, a bystander had shared a photograph of Grim standing over his charred body to Simstagram captioned “YOLO” while another filthy mortal did push-ups beside the grave. How undignified. Worse still, once Grim had departed, M’s tombstone was picked up by the leader of the Moonwood Mutts and taken to the Sage of Mischief Magic. As grateful as I am for her de-deathifying him, that seductress has no business interfering and playing with MY creation. His tombstone was pretty, there's no denying that, but I didn't want it in the house after it had been pawed by that creature. M and K found a spot for it in the shade of Myshuno Meadows, they could have sent it to Sixam for all I care. M has been distant since his experience, perhaps I should be more sympathetic. Yes, technically he did die, but he's fine now - and more importantly he failed in his mission. Now I feel that both he and K are slacking, just going through the motions, our encounters lack the passion they usually do. I overheard them talking in the early hours of the morning, upset by my lack of emotion over M’s temporary death, and how hell-bent I was on confirming my son's transgressions - going as far as calling it llama-like behaviour. What do they expect me to do, talk to the boy!? Are they right, am I the llama? All because I don't want my son bringing shame on me, his family name and our kind as a whole? I don't think I am, but K and M are making me question this. Would it be easier if I disposed of them and started again? Any suggestions are welcome. ETA: Somebody was kind enough to send me the video of M's demise , how embarrassing! That meddling mutt should've left him where he fell.",

      "content_preview": "I (teen f) don't even know where to begin. It should've been the best weekend of my life: prom with my crush (S), partying, and my first kiss. He even asked me to be his girlfriend. Now I'm second-guessing saying yes. He's hiding something from me, I know it's big and I know it involves his best friend J. S started at our school partway through the year, I was instantly infatuated before I even knew his name or anything about him. I found myself distracted in class, fighting the urge to stroke his long hair, fixated by every slight movement, those perfectly straight teeth every time he smiled at me… it's pathetic, isn't it? I confided in my best friend G and (once she got past teasing me relentlessly) she found ways for us to spend time together, wandering off with her boyfriend J if we went anywhere as a group and leaving me alone with S. I've often envied her relationship with J, they're so in tune with each other, always seeming to know what the other is thinking. He always says it's fate. I envy a lot about G actually. Her confidence, her powers as a spellcaster, her emotional control. She's so clever too, her latest fixation seems to be Vampire lore. Even as children, I wouldn't say boo to a goose while she had no qualms about setting her familiar on the boy who pulled my pigtails - 10 years on and M is still terrified of her. On our last outing to the ancient ruins we were left alone again - J wanted to climb them and G didn't trust him not to fall. S suggested we watch the stars to pass the time, he always seems different once the sun goes down. At school he's quiet, verging on anxious, but here he was: an arm around me and pointing out the constellations against the indigo sky. I didn't take in a word he said, instead I was savouring the sensation of being so close to him, consumed by my own thoughts of what this could mean. Did he feel the same? I got my answer the next morning in the form of a note on my locked in his impossibly neat handwriting asking me to prom. Not as friends but as his date. I wanted to scream with excitement. I told G as soon as I'd given my “yes!”. I thought she'd be just as happy as I was. She said she was, but her eyes said apprehensive, almost worried. I shouldn't have but I brushed it off. Mam was so excited for me, she and Dad were high school sweethearts and I think she's always hoped the same would happen for me. We got ready together at G's on Saturday. I stole a few cuddles from her cat Menace before putting my dress on, flinching every time G came near my face with the makeup brush. I couldn't take my eyes off S all night, we danced and flirted and I didn't want the night to end, suggesting we keep it going at Plumbite Pier. We shared our first kiss at the foot of the Ferris wheel and he asked me to be his girlfriend there and then. It was the perfect night - for a while anyway. I lost track of S at some point when taking pictures with our other friends, I still wanted some more before the night was over. I asked G to help me find him and, while she seemed reluctant, it felt more like she was guiding me than searching. She muttered something about bats and echolocation but maybe I misheard, her familiar is a phoenix after all and he'd been left at home for the night. I put it down to one too many sips from the hip flask wedged down the front of her dress. We found S with J in the park. I could hear J laughing before we saw them, but S didn't look happy at all. I've never seen him like that - angry, disgusted even. I tried asking him about it as he walked me home but he kept changing the subject, even the kiss goodnight felt distant. It was like all the excitement had left him in the park. G invited me to spend Sunday in the Realm, I needed something to take my mind off last night. My chest tightened when she told me S had gone to see J. I can't put my finger on why, but I tried to push the feeling aside and focus on the duels going on around us. I sat down with her mentor L while G rummaged through the shelves for tomes. L was very interested in hearing about Mam's mediumship skills, giving me tips on developing my own abilities and telling me all the gossip and goings-on about the local occults. She seemed particularly excited about the rumoured friendship between the sons of a Master Vampire and a prominent Werewolf pack leader - supposedly the scandal of the year. Even with my limited knowledge I know that a friendship like that is unlikely, but good for them! A real Romeo and Juliet bromance. I just hope the gawkers and gossip doesn't get to them. I confessed my fears to G when we got back to hers, I still felt uneasy about last night. What could I have done to make him shift so fast? Or was it something J said? It's easy for G to say “just ask him”, she forgets that not everyone has the gift of the gab and sky-high confidence. The flippancy also made me think that maybe she knows more than she's letting on. A boy toying with my feelings I can sort of handle, or at least anticipate, but my best friend? My phone began lighting up with texts from S once I arrived home (Glimmerbrook is a bit of a dead spot for signal) saying how much fun he'd had last night, apologising for going weird on me, and asking if we could meet tomorrow after school. Once everyone else in the house was asleep, I set up the séance circle in my room. Mam doesn't like me communing with the spirits without her, but I didn’t want her sitting there listening to this and no doubt trying to give her own two simoleons. She drummed it into me from a young age to “never cry over a boy - or a girl, or anyone else”, which isn't the advice this Gloomy gal wants or needs right now - I'll cry if I want to! And T gets it. As spirit guides go she can be unpredictable, but she's never led me astray so far. She entered the spirit world angrily after her boyfriend left her for her sister. That kind of betrayal is enough to put anyone in an early grave. I could smell T before I saw her, like smoke and rust had filled my room. She doesn't make time for pleasantries so I skipped straight to pouring my heart out instead. I didn't realise I was crying until I felt a breeze against my cheek, T trying to wipe my tears away. She agreed with my suspicions, something was going on between S and J. It may not be something romantic, it may just be something trivial, but the level of secrecy made her think it could be dangerous - dangerous for me anyway. “How would you like me to help you?” Just the relief of having someone tell me I wasn't imagining things was enough, I honestly hadn’t thought this far ahead. I think I just wanted somebody to listen. And the kind of “help” T can offer isn’t always to everyone’s taste. It usually comes in two varieties: unparalleled wisdom or unmitigated vengeance. Or arson, that's her favourite. I didn't want anything like that. I thought she'd be angry at me for wasting her time, but instead she held my hand (as best as a spirit can) and offered a proposal. If I don't have the truth in a week's time, revenge is on the table. She'll do some of her own reconnaissance in the meantime to ensure what I'm told is the truth. T gave me one last Solace Embrace before departing, taking the worst of the smell with her. While I feel calmer and more clear-headed now, would I be the llama for taking her up on her offer of revenge?",

      "content_preview": "I (ya, f) and my queer platonic partner, D (ya, m) have been best friends since high school. He supported me through university, working as a painter and bartender. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be a scientist. So here's the thing, I'm heteroromantic asexual and I have a very low drive. He's... mostly the polar opposite. I mean we love each other, don't get me wrong. Either of us go through something the first person we think of is our other half. We share a bed, fall asleep cuddling and wake up still in each other's arms. I know that woohoo is important to him and he gets anxious if he hasn't had any in a while-- so I agreed to let him woohoo with other people, with a few rules: he can't bring them home. He always wears protection and still gets tested twice a month just incase. He showers before he comes back, and he always sleeps in our bed with me. If we decide to have children, if anything happens with our child and I need him home, he drops whatever with whomever and comes straight to us. Thing is, we weren't just best friends in high school, we date for a while. We lost our v's to each other while my parents were on their second honeymoon and he stayed the night. In the middle of the night I got up made the excuse of needing the washroom. Went into the shower and tried very hard to keep from sobbing while I cried. I didn't regret it, he was incredibly sweet, romantic, and just really considerate before, during and after-- but I didn't feel anything-- physically. I mean yes the emotional connection, definitely that's the only thing I liked about it-- but I couldn't see myself doing that act again. The next morning I said that I was still a bit sore from the previous night. A few times after he tried to initiate until I just blurted out that we needed to break up. He was taken aback a bit before asking if there was something I wasn't telling him. And I admitted there was, I just wasn't sure what it was yet. So we took some time distancing ourselves from each other, he started dating another girl or-- it seemed they were dating but she was just a hook up. Then there was the incident at the party--this guy, JH had a house party just before graduation-- and we both attended. At the party, someone spiked my drink and I couldn't get my bearings. I don't remember a lot of what happened, but I do remember D throwing hands with JH... and I remember D's date exclaiming that he was with her and why bother with me? My parents died in an accident trying to get to the hospital, D's parents had passed away from old age a few days prior. So he offered to move in with me so I could still attend school. I asked him, \"What about your dreams?\" He shrugged and replied, \"My dream is whatever makes you happy.\" He got a job bartending, and started selling his artwork on the side for some extra money. He kept up with that saying the whole time I was in university, and when I was about to graduate he asked if we could try being a couple again. Apparently, nobody else he's been with has ever made him feel like I did-- but I still didn't want anything to do with woohoo and now I had a name for the reason behind feeling that way, I was asexual. So we came up with our arrangement and tried again. Not too long ago he hooked up with a girl, he texted me to let me know he'd be home a little later than normal but he'd be in our bed when I woke up. The woman he hooked up with \"Sonia\" tracked me down and claimed he was a cheater and an abuser of women. I dismissed her and walked away while she laid into D about how he shouldn't be with me if I'm not meeting all of his needs. He crossed his arms over his chest and told her I meet 99% of his needs, there's just one thing that we differ on and it wasn't that big a deal to me if he sought it elsewhere. Our business is our business. She then tried to get him in trouble with his boss (jokes on her, he owns the bar, bought it from the previous owner my senior year in university), lastly, she tried to tell him that he's a llama for dating me while he seeks his woohoo satisfaction elsewhere, and telling me that I'm llama for using D to get ahead in life. Honestly I broke up with him in high school because I didn't want him to be in a woohooless relationship, he's the one who asked if we could get back together, I wouldn't have-- but I'd be lying if I said that I care about him any less now than I did in high school, if anything I care more than I did then. A lavender relationship isn't for everyone, but I feel like we're making it work. so, AITA for dating him? ETA: So someone thinks we're both llamas because we realize that woohoo isn't the foundation of a relationship, mutual respect, love, and trust are. I showed D the response we got and along with elopement, this was his response: loyalty is important, and we are each other's first priority",

Our parents passed unexpectedly, and for a time her older brother helped us out but then he got his gf pregnant- it's twins- so I mean, we both understand it. Anyways, our new place has a stocked bar so I helped myself to a few drinks, and got really wasted. I went off on an adventure while intoxicated. From what I've been able to piece together (I don't remember much), I first went to some car repair shop and yelled for a falafel. They said they don't sell falafels, so I yelled my order louder, at that point a mechanic threw a wrench at me. Then apparently I came across this fountain and decided to be a merman for a while, the video went viral. Then I went to a dance club and tried to dance battle someone, well they decided to beat the tar outta me instead. After that, I came across an ice cream truck and thought 'hey, I deserve a treat' so I climbed in through the window and started helping myself which finally landed me in the drunk tank overnight. Now everyone at school is whispering about my friend and mostly me, giving her side eyes, and asking how she could let me get so out of control. I keep telling people I did those things on my own, it had nothing to do with her, my friend keeps asking me how I could llama up my life so badly in one night. AITA for my adventure? Either way, probably not going to drink again for a long time.",

      "content_preview": "I (ya, m) am currently in a new relationship with J (ya, f). I'm a bartender, and she's a scientist. I love my job because, well who doesn't get flirty and chatty with the bartender? So anyway, when we started dating, J told me that she would be jealous for non physical flirting, physical flirting and woohoo. Now the first two, I can roll with, but J's asexual, and I'm not. While she is accepting of woohoo occasionally (we have once, and it was a bit awkward but overall a very satisfying encounter), it's not very common and I have a high drive. So I asked if she could accept me woohooing with others, and she agreed. A few rules about it include: I can't come home talking about it to her, she doesn't know what I get up to. I use protection every time, and even then still get tested at least once every other week to make sure I'm safe. Last rule is I don't bring these women home, and I don't stay overnight at their place. Technically our relationship is considered a Queer Platonic Relationship, or a QPR, we're together but more so as very close friends who interact romantically but don't (or rarely) engage in woohoo. I do love J, don't get me wrong--but that drive is a hard itch to ignore and there's only so many times you can self resolve it before it becomes-- well monotonous. Which was my motivation behind asking her to accept me woohooing with others. Recently a regular customer, let’s call her “Sonia” gave me her number. I met up with her, and we woohoo'd in a nearby bush. Honestly I felt amazing afterwards it had been a while, but she blabbed to my coworker who told the customer I was seeing J. Sonia then tracked down and told J about the rendezvous. J didn't care, but Sonia made a big scene about how I'm a low life and J needed to respect herself more. Honestly I can kind of see her perspective if J wasn’t asexual, but she is. I know why not just tell Sonia, right? Most aren't accepting of asexuality, and claim it's a made up orientation. I've known J since high school and I can say with absolute certainty, it is not made up. She has as much interest in woohoo as she does in setting herself on fire 98% of the time and reacts to it in very much the same way. Then there's the questions directed to J, \"do you have woohoo trauma?\" \"was it a bad relationship?\" \"are you actually lesbian?\" to name a few. I know she deals with that enough on her own without me adding to it because I explained our arrangement to someone who is a complete stranger who misunderstands and doesn't want to learn. I simply explained to the woman that we allow woohoo with others in our relationship, and have rules we adhere to when doing so. She couldn't understand this and asked how we'd manage having kids one day if we don't have a 'real relationship'. J and I have discussed it and we may have a science baby at some point in the near future. Obviously my priority then becomes making sure J and our child are okay before I even think of meeting this particular need I have. Sonia keeps saying I'm the llama for asking J to let me find woohoo satisfaction from others, so AITA? ETA: going to add a picture of me and J here, might help clear somethings up. https://preview.redd.it/aita-for-asking-her-to-accept-a-change-v0-xkgybw8900lf1.png",

I was conceived and born through magic (science baby), to answer the most common question I get asked and I’m a visual replica of my parent, except I have longer hair. Like my parent I’m a quick study with magic and I’ve learned several spells in the untamed arts (my parent’s specialty as it turns out). Recently I had a sleepover with some friends from school, towards the end, which one of my friends noticed a strange man lurking around outside, staring in, not saying anything. Then the man transformed into a werewolf. She tried to scream but her voice caught in her throat. Her brother went to find out what was going on and saw the wolf breaking in and lunging for her. He picked up a chair and threw it at the wolf’s head, then acted as a physical barrier between the wolf and my friend. I heard the glass shattering, then the clank of the metal chair hitting the tiled floor of the kitchen. I ran towards them and as the wolf was preparing to lunge again I used a Chillio spell to freeze him in place. I then had the humans lock themselves in a nearby bathroom so I’d have an easier time defending them. As my spell began to wear off my parent showed up and overwhelmed the wolf enough that he took off running. Like I said, former Sage of untamed magic, I’m not surprised. But I was surprised to find out that revealing myself as a spell caster is a big no-no in the magic community. My parent understands I was just doing what they’d taught me, but my mentor is acting like I committed a capital crime. AITA for revealing my magical abilities?",

Then she threw at me that I'm technically a dad of four since I adopted my ex-boyfrieind's son (B, ya, m) when I was living with them for several sim years. I argued that although that was technically true I missed out on the majority of his childhood and had just come back into his life in his late teen years (he and his dad reached out to me, yes I missed B, but I also knew I caused some pains for them so I waited for them to make the first move). As soon as I mentioned this she started blowing up at me about how it's unfair that I hadn't told her about B before we married. Truthfully, I thought that my ex would've removed me as a legal co-parent at that point, I was surprised to find out he hadn't.

      "content_preview": "I (36 m) and my homoerotic rival (36 m) recently moved into a beach side home with someone we met online named Linda Linda. Shes a perfectly fine roommate, and helps pay for our rent with her paintings. We've recently come under fire from our neighbors for having Linda Linda sleep in a casket outside instead of in the house. Yes it is monsoon season, and yes it's 80 degrees all the time as we are in the tropics BUT Linda Linda is kind of a freak and she enjoys strange things. Our neighbors think we're being cruel as they see her \"slaving\" for the household and paying all of our funds as me and my rivals do not have jobs. Rival and I are very busy with our homoerotic escapades so it's only natural Linda Linda takes care of everything! I don't think we're in the wrong, she likes her life, but I do want to know, are we the assholes here? EDIT: LINDA LINDA HAS PASSED AWAY It's a crazy situation, but Linda Linda, ever the eccentric, was grilling in the nude when she set the porch on fire. I tried to courageously put out the fire and ended up getting burnt badly. My Rival was trapped in a corner, thankfully safe but unable to help. Linda Linda, I don't know why she did it, but she just stood in the fire, catching alight, she perished before she reached the water. Unfortunately the casket was a good idea for a bed after all",

He woke up locked in one corner of my basement with no hope of getting out.

Poor guy didn't even have any water to drink the whole time we were doing this to him, and within only a few days, it was time for a visit from the Reaper. The worst part for him? He didn't even have a toilet in his cell, so he died filthy and miserable. Am I the llama?",

Short story, we never got along with our biological parents. We didn't care about grime and clogged toilets constantly until father had enough and put a suited up door in the bathroom. Recently, father looks sad since all that nature calling and doesn't do anything besides drinking himself out at the blue velvet. We did all the work of that calling while he was moping. But we found our mother's first husband after we signed up for Foxbury. He opened his own cafeteria after working so many years at chef. We just ate his famous pancakes and now decided to don't return to home anymore. In fact, my sister is thinking about marrying this old man. He is like us, doesn't give a fuck about clean place, spending a lot in random stuff or trying to control everything. He just lives carefree and says that after the divorce, he felt free even if he gave up his old house to our mother. He told us that he passed most of the time in a man cave at basement, just watching TV and eating pancakes. We don't remember that, there was no man cave in our basement, just a posh nectary with a dressed up door that lead to several nectar machines which is the only thing we miss about home. Well, now mom is throwing up one of her usual tantrums, our dad is unhappy and we told them that we are staying at Foxbury as permanent residents at the dinner and breakfast Cafe. I mean, we got the peace we never had since we were kids and spent our evenings fishing barefoot. Are we the llamas?",

      "content_preview": "Hello, all. Me (29, F) and my husband (35, M) have had a very rocky relationship over the past couple years. He's in the business career, and tends to work long hours even when at home. I, on the other hand, own a small but profitable bakery and have flexible hours. His lack of effort in our relationship has been a hot topic since his promotion 3 years ago, but he hasn't made an effort to change. Our romantic satisfaction is abysmal at this point! I've been trying to do my own thing lately. I recently took this really cool hobby class where I learned pottery! My teacher is this gorgeous blonde man, who is a master in the skill. The things he crafts? Stunning. I felt like a school girl crushing on him, but recently he invited me out to his place to talk art and have wine. I was on cloud nine! The night was amazing, our chemistry is through the room... and we did kiss, wrong I know. I felt so guilty, but I couldn't stay away. We've gone out almost every night for the past couple months, and have had \"woohoo\" many times. There's always fireworks. I recently discovered I was pregnant, he was so happy! I gave birth a few days later, and the baby is his little twin, such an angel. My husband is also blonde, so no one suspects anything. The issue came when my in laws had a holiday dinner, my husband was showing the baby off... it honestly made me mad. The man acted like a baby would ruin us, but now he loves the attention or something! I sprinkled cayenne pepper on the food, everyone was upset and their mouths were burning. I called my son's father to pick us up, when he came I met him with a kiss. Everyone was shocked, they all were angry with me, especially my husband. My husband was stomping then clutched his chest and fell... don't worry, the dramatic bastard didn't die, his mother saved him. He's back home now, and I've moved my boyfriend (he asked me to be his girlfriend, yay!) in while he was gone. He's been arguing with me about leaving, but this is my house too so I'll be damned. He wants a divorce, but I'm not signing until I have built a new home for my family to live in. He says I embarrassed him in front of everyone, but if he was a better husband this would've been his baby instead. My friends are supportive, but random people keep calling to chastise me.  AITA here?",

Both our trailer homes are two levels high, each level sporting its own bathroom. I have my own bedroom and so do most of the kids. Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney live in the upper level, while my bedroom, and Kendall and Kylie‘s shared bedroom are on the lower level. I forgot where Rob sleeps or if he even lives here, he’s very forgettable. Caitlyn recently transitioned, and we have been fighting loudly ever since. This is important because the neighbor who passed away used to come over and cheer on Caitlyn while we fought. I haven’t forgiven him for it. Thankfully, him and his old friend Elon have been getting into fights recently as well, so I could return the favor. Still, I haven’t felt satisfied by it. Then one day, while my daughter Kim and his wife Melania were doing yoga on our tiny lawn, I saw him stuff himself with burgers before trying out Caitlyn‘s old punching bag that was still hanging from our porch roof. It must have been too much for him, because he dropped dead next to it only moments later. I do feel kind of bad for his daughter, Invanka, who just had a baby, and that poor baby losing her granddad. But I still believe he had it coming. Which is why I didn’t even consider begging for his life, but instead asked the Grim Reaper for fashion advice. His whole aura was so commanding and yet elegant, I wanted to know his secrets. While others were crying over his body, I educated myself on what truly mattered. Kim told me that Ivanka thought I was so rude, but when I asked Melania about it she assured me I made the best of the situation. Still Kim insists that I embarrassed her in front of her friend. Is she right? AITA?",

I don’t care if you call the cops ok me because I will just beat them up, so keep that in mind before you decide to rat me out. My roommate lives in a cave, and while he technically is my maker, I can’t stand his guts. So I built a secret underground bunker that only I can enter, where I have a safe filled up with millions of Simoleons, and some collectibles I acquired. My roommate barely has enough food to eat, he constantly has to dive in trash cans, beg for money, or go foraging or fishing in order to feed himself. Yet still he’s consistently losing weight, and spends what little money he has on drugs, which causes him to forget about food altogether and starve himself even more. He thinks he’s such a genius, but his actions clearly tell a different story. His name is Elon Musk btw, so if you see him begging in your neighborhood, just keep walking. AITA for keeping my fortune a secret and letting him wither away in front of me?  I don’t think I am, but his lover Tristan side-eyed me when he saw me enter my bunker, so I figured I‘d ask a more unbiased audience about their thoughts on this.",

Truth to that, but not the full truth. I was on the run-- but not because I stole something. Bit of a deep dive background: I have an identical twin brother, I mean we look alike down to every mole, in every aspect, only thing is he's still human and I'm-- not-- that's a story for another time. Anyways, growing up I always had this compulsion to take things and I'd sometimes get caught which made me the 'bad twin' while my brother was the 'good twin'. 'Good' my rear-end! We have the same first initial so I'll just call him 'Fish', he always reminded me of a fish out of water. I always had a few friends, mainly because I was always up for adventure, down for whatever with a few limits of course, no harming girls or anybody younger than those in our circle. If a new kid was joining our group and hadn't tried alcohol or grass I'd stay sober so someone could make sure they stayed safe (yes, I admit I'm a thief, but I'm actually a nice guy). Fish would be the one to spike the fruit punch at a school dance and get the whole school wasted. Fish would slip grass into cookie batter and serve them at a winterfest party. Fish became the most notorious school dealer, but he never got caught cause he started wearing exactly what I'd wear every day. If I pierced my ears, so did he. If I started wearing  necklace, so did he. I grew my hair out, so did Fish. I painted my nails, guess what Fish did? At home wasn't much better either. Mom could tell the difference between us if we spoke, she said there was a different tone to our voices, and while Fish could mimic my octave and how I spoke to people he sounded forced and I sounded genuine. Dad could tell us apart because Fish was a half inch taller than me, even still Fish continuously tried to keep me from doing my chores around the house, or he'd try to bully me into doing his chores so he could make connections and sell more dope. If he saw me doing my homework, he'd knock over my Power sip and spill it on my books. Like dude, what is your damage? Mom and Dad had an idea of what was going on, but anytime they tried to punish him for something he'd go to the principal the next day and complain that he was being punished for what I did. Then mom got sick, Dad started drinking and things went down hill at home fast. Mom passed away in our junior year, and Dad in our senior year. Our Uncle financially supported us but not having someone there to make sure Fish stayed in line was a really bad thing. What finally took the cake for me was about two days after graduation, I heard Fish's girlfriend screaming and begging him to stop. I ran into his room and found him beating her, and she was bleeding-- but I don't mean from the injuries. I pulled him off her and KO'd him in one hit, then got her to the hospital. She'd lost a baby. My niece or nephew was gone because of him. Not too long after I caught word from someone I'd sometimes B & E with (another Kleptomaniac) that the younger brother of a well known gang member was given some bad stuff when he bought from a new supplier, and wasn't doing well. I thought, 'well, damn, sucks to be that dude'. Little did I know, they thought I had sold him the stuff. I hadn't even touched the stuff since freshman year! I knew Fish had been dropping my name when he made deals, likely to cover his own backside, but also one final middle finger to me for just existing. So I went into hiding, from there ya know the story, went on a date with a girl, yada, yada, yada, yada, got mauled and turned by Greg. Joined the wild fangs, then things change a bit. I met a spellcaster, we became friends, started dating, lost a baby, got married, had a baby boy, then had twins after that. My little girl is a bit of a Daddy's girl, the one thing that'll calm her if I'm not around is being outside. So when I got home from hanging out with my pack for a bit-- my wife was frazzled and stressed from caring for a toddler and two infants, one of which was extremely fussy. If you think sim toddlers are chaos, try werewolf toddlers. Our son chews up all of his toys, and potty training him takes some saintly level patience. Thankfully, my wife is equipped with the patience, and I got a few umm different toys to put in the freezer for our eldest to chew on. I took my daughter from my wife and told her to go do some self care stuff while I take care of the kids. She headed off to go on a jog, and that's when I caught it in the air, a scent I hadn't smelled before, but one similar enough to my own I knew who it was. I knew things between us would likely turn physical so I put my baby girl down on the grass, took a few steps away from her, and ordered Fish to come out from his hiding place. He did, and had the audacity to say, \"Well this puts a wrench in my plans. I was gonna do your jail time so you could come back and raise my little accident. Turns out you've got your own.\" Accident?! Once is an accident, twice is being stupid, especially since he hates kids and knew even in high school he never wanted them. Always boggled my mind why he didn't get sterilized, or at least get that contraception injection that blocks one of the tubes so you can't father a kid. Then this son of a llama has the nerve to assume that I'm the same as him. I love being a Daddy, our miscarriage was the saddest thing I've ever endured, but I got through it with my wife-- I don't think I could've survived it with anyone else. I felt the rage boiling up in me, my children, all three of them, were not only planned, we fought against infertility to have them. All of them. But he only knew about my daughter, not my sons. I could feel my control starting to slip when I snarled out, \"my daughter is not an accident! You shouldn't have come here! LEAVE!\" Fish turned fifty shades of white and ran off, I told my wife about what happened, and she was relieved that N and I are alright, and also that our sons, X and D weren't seen by him-- but-- I always feel bad when the beast takes control and I scare a human. Even though Fish and I are always at odds with each other-- he is biologically human when all's said and done. AITA for giving him a glimpse of my werewolf side and scaring him off?",

      "content_preview": "I (adult, m, werewolf) have an ex (ya, m, vampire) who had a an adopted son when we started dating (when we began dating, infant, m, human) let's call him 'Kitt',  whom he found after a well known viciously feral werewolf attacked and unalived his parents. I came into their life a little bit later, I was getting a hotdog at a food stand, and there was this absolutely gorgeous man. A little then known secret about me is that I'm bi, I lean a bit more towards women but yeah when I meet an attractive guy-- if I get hints the attraction's mutual, I'd shoot my shot. Well I caught him glancing at me a few times (I got a second hotdog for two reasons: one, hungry like the wolf-- pun intended, and second reason was to see if there was a hint of something there), so I struck up a conversation. We exchanged numbers and built a friendship. I babysat for him one time in an emergency situation and during that time I caught a scent from the infant I hadn't recognized before. Something about us wolves is some of us can identify supernatural sims by scent. The baby didn't smell like anything I had smelt before, but I could tell he wasn't exactly human either. It wasn't until I met my now wife (adult, f, spell caster) that things really clicked. She is kind of an unusual case in the sense that her mother was spell caster, but her father was a dormant wolf. Which meant that she is also a dormant wolf. Kitt had a similar scent to my wife, minus the spell caster aspect. Kind of canine but less pungent than I'd get from say, a packmate (spellcasters have a smell similar to that scent you smell just before it starts to rain on a summer's day, it's a lovely scent). I realized then that Kitt was in fact a dormant wolf, and its likely his parents were as well, which made me wonder if they had really passed away all those years ago. So I investigated a bit and confirmed that yes, they had in fact passed away. Here's the downside, Kitt's Dad and I didn't part on good terms (it's a long story but essentially he believes I cheated and for the sake of simplicity I've let him believe that the truth is much more dark and complicated). He's kept me in the loop with what was going on with Kitt because I did spend seven sim years helping to raise the boy-- but it made having difficult discussions that much more, well-- difficult. Kitt has since become a young adult himself, married, and has a little girl-- who basically confirmed what I'd suspected for a while. Her cries would occasionally sound like little howls, so Kitt got a paternity test just to be sure and confirmed that yes, he is without a doubt the father of a werewolf cub. The baby's mom knows she didn't have any werewolves in her family. She also had known that Kitt was being targeted by this infamous wolf, so before they married, she enlisted the help of my ex-boyfriend's spouse, a former sage of magic, to become a spell caster herself. She's confident that she could defend her family if she had to, but my ex has taken to patrolling in their area at night to ensure that Kitt and the baby stay safe. I'm going to be joining him in this, as are some other powerful werewolves. What I'm wondering is: am I the llama for not telling my ex the truth about his adopted son when I first realized why he was being targeted? Either way, there's now a question that Kitt has to figure out an answer to: does he want to be a wolf? If he does, I know a way to help him wolf out without having to be bit. He wouldn't need to have the painful experience I did (you feel like you're going to starve to death). If he does I'm fully prepared to take him under my wing and train him-- if he doesn't I'll protect him and his family like they're blood to me.",

Farah, Helga, and I were worried that because Bella has been eating so much, she would eat all the chocolate cake and there wouldn’t be any more for the rest of us. We agreed it would be best if we just invited Mortimer, Cassandra, and Alexander and leave Bella out. The birthday party went very well. We danced to the jukebox, had drinks, had pasta primavera for dinner, and Felicity blew out the candles on her chocolate cake (which everyone got a fair share of since Bella wasn’t around). A couple days passed and we saw Bella on our morning jog. Not only did Bella lose a ton of weight, but she had a beautiful baby in her arms that looked just like her and Mortimer. I’m proud of us knowing that Felicity got to have her cake and Bella was able to lose weight since we didn’t invite her. However, I still feel a tad guilty for excluding her. Are we TA’s?",

      "content_preview": "I (ya, m) am an identical twin. My brother and I both have three letter names that start with L, so for the purpose of this I'm just call my brother what he is, a Klepto. I first realized it when we were kids, he'd swipe things from school, hold onto them for a few days then mail it back anonymously. Weird quirk, right?  A couple of times he actually donated things that he stole. I'm not much better honestly, in some regards I might be worse. It started off kinda mild when we were in high school, I'd hit the green with some friends. At least I wasn't like Klepto stealing things, but I eventually decided I wanted to sell the stuff I was smoking, so I got into it. Made a real decent living at it too. Klepto snubbed his nose at me like he was somehow better than me. He's a thief, I'm a dealer, we're both criminals, he ain't better than me. I had a girlfriend, and he had his own, but after a while he broke things off with her, saying he didn't want anything long term, it freaked him out to think about being with one person forever. A while back, Klepto disappeared. I figured he swiped something and crossed a few people he shouldn't have so he took off and went into hiding. Around this time I found out my girl was expecting, I'm not big on kids, but I knew that Klepto was so I thought heck, I'll track him down and make him an offer, I'll do his jailtime if he'll raise my brat, one catch: he has to get into therapy. Yes, I know Kleptomania is a mental health condition, I know he can't help but give into the urge to swipe stuff every so often. Sad thing is, he's actually really intelligent. He could make something real of himself if he could get the keptomania under control. I got my ears pierced, got a necklace identical to his and began searching for him. I went to Moonwood Mill, thinking he'd figure that nobody would look for him in the middle of nowhere. Decided I'd start off at the local bar, the bartender there started pouring a drink and plopped a steak in front of me as if she knew me. Well, that kinda sealed that she had to know Klepto, or so I thought, one thing though, she hadn't cooked the steak right. Klepto likes his steaks medium, and that steak was so rare it was practically blue. So I told her to throw it back on the grill a bit longer and asked where I could find Klepto. She looked at me funny, then asked, \"Who are you?\" \"I'm his brother, L,\" was my answer. Realization dawned on her and to my surprise she actually said, \"You'd best turn tail and run outta town.\" Next thing I know, almost everyone in this 'bar' (it's really more of a kiosk soup truck type of deal) started looking at me funny. The hell, did my brother rat me out for my line of work or something? I decide to play the family card, \"Hey, chill. He's got a new niece thought he oughta know.\" \"We'll let him know. Finish up and get out,\" the bartender stated. \"And don't even think about wandering through the woods, especially if you see warning signs,\" she added, indicating a scar on her face, and then admitting she had a lot more than that. The hell? Did my brother do that? Now everyone's all tight lipped, someone ran off somewhere, and when I tried to follow them, thinking they'd lead me to Klepto, they surrounded me and started telling me to keep my head down and get out of town, and calling me a llama for looking for Klepto and telling me I should forget about my own brother. I got away from that group and started searching through town, I eventually found Klepto, but he went over to a pretty blonde woman and a little girl who looks a lot like my brother. The woman handed the little girl over to Klepto. The little girl was happy for a bit until the woman ran off somwehere. Then the baby started crying (I hate that sound) and the weird part is, her cries sounded like little howls at times. I have to be hallucinating, then my brother did something weird. He sniffed the air, and glared right at where I was hiding to observe from the fence. He laid the baby down on the ground and ordered, \"Come out, now.\" I'd never heard that edge to his voice before, I came out from my hiding spot and commented, \"Well this puts a wrench in my plans. I was gonna do your jail time so you could come back and raise my little accident. Turns out you've got your own.\" I'd swear he was so angry his eyes were glowing red while he shouted at me, \"my daughter is not an accident! You shouldn't have come here! LEAVE!\" I distinctly heard a snarl in his voice like a vicious dog about to attack something, so I left. Now I'm without a plan B to get out of my dilemma, and I'm not sure what's going on with Klepto. AITL for looking for my twin brother?",

      "content_preview": "I (ya, f) have been fascinated with werewolves ever since I first saw a wolfman movie in 7th grade. So I'm a freelance artist, and moved to Moonwood Mill after my grandfather passed away, inheriting a small one bedroom log cabin he owned there. Imagine my surprise when I found grandpa's journal and found that he had kept a secret from everyone: he was a werewolf. He'd been bitten by a feral werewolf while on a camping trip when my mom was a little girl, and had turned. Also, as it turns out, I'd always felt like someone or something was watching me, it was my grandpa. When I was a teenager and out with a boyfriend who was getting too pushy-- there was always something that would knock things over, and cause a bunch of commotion until my date would be so spooked he'd suggest we leave. That was Grandpa. he never showed himself to me, or anyone, as far as I know-- but he protected me. I had to find out more about this feral wolf-- and see if I could get him to make me a wolf as well. I began asking questions to the locals. Moonwood Mill isn't exactly a big town, so it's kind of like everybody knows everybody in one way or another. Anyways, I came across this bartender who talked about a bad date she had a while back but I didn't get many details from her. Then I was painting at my easel on my front porch and this guy about my age (and kinda cute), came up and started commenting on the piece I was working on. We discussed art for a while and we grew closer. Eventually he revealed to me that he was a werewolf as well-- he had been on a date with a girl (I'm guessing the bartender?) and went on a midnight walk in the forrest during a full moon. I gathered enough information from his story to have an idea on where to find this feral wolf and that night set out on a walk on my own. I wandered through the forrest and about an hour in started to feel eyes on me. I wandered a bit more until I saw the warning signs the guy had mentioned. I walked right past them, and found him, a feral werewolf, mostly grey with some black spots on his fur. He didn't seem too threatening at first, until I hit him with an empty can that was laying around. That finally provoked him enough and he attacked me. I don't know how or why but I passed out. When I woke up, I was back in my cabin, the cute guy was there, holding a cold compress to my forehead, and then to my neck. As soon as I was awake, he grabbed a glass filled with some kind of liquid, I'm not sure what, and told me to drink it, he knew for sure it would help. I looked at the glass and then to him, and asked, \"so that would make me a werewolf and spare me having to get bit?\" He looked at me like he'd just seen me devour a puppy, then he yelled at me that I had deliberately sought out Greg and demanded to know if I was faking being his friend just so I could become a werewolf. I told him the truth, yes I did seek out that feral werewolf, and no I wasn't faking anything I really did find him an interesting guy. He set the glass down on the night table and told me that while he liked being a werewolf, there were some parts about being a werewolf that not everyone could accept. I could lose family, friends, he'd seen it happen to other people. Well that's easy enough to fix, I'm the new girl in town, I have no living relatives. My grandpa was the last surviving one and clearly he was gone. He nodded his head a little, then invited me to move in with him in his two bedroom house, \"at least until the transformation happens and you learn how to control your inner wolf a bit.\" I accepted, and after the initial pain from the bite wore off and the hunger came, he made sure to keep a lot of food readily available, mostly steaks and hamburgers saying I'd need the protein. He's a freelance programmer, and hacker, which means he makes his own schedule, and earns a pretty decent living doing what he does. I've also noticed a few things show up that seem out of place. He got a little embarrassed and told me that he has a condition called Kleptomania, but he tries to resist the urge these days, since his urge to steal things is what lead to him hiding out in Moonwood Mill-- and everything that followed. He thinks I haven't noticed, but I've caught him looking at me with this sadness in his eyes a few times now. I think he blames himself for me becoming a werewolf because of the details he told me about the night he was bit. But this was my choice, what I wanted more than anything. AITA for seeking out Greg? ETA: I've transformed into a werewolf for the first time. My friend/roommate was able to pacify me and help me transform back, I guess that's one benefit to having a more experienced werewolf as a roommate. And on a side note, I’ve never known another guy to decorate with so much PINK! I mean every wall in his house either has pink wallpaper or pink tiles, and the tiled floors are a kind of coral. His whole place is basically pink and black, which he says are his favourite colours so I guess that makes sense.",

      "content_preview": "I guess you can say that my life has been a bit chaotic so far. I was adopted by the Goths and forced to grow up among them. Sure, they were mostly nice, but always gave me trouble for everything. Sneaking out at night to explore an abandoned orphanage was apparently \"dangerous\" or such and there was the whole drugs debacle. How else do you expect me to stay up all night and become a chessmaster, hmm???? I am sure by this point you understand the absolute parental pressure I was dealing with hence my need for a quick getaway. In high school I met this dude who turned out to be a vampire!! And the son of the Vladislaus Straud himself! I obviously jumped at the opportunity of making him think I was in love with him (heh, the moron!). Soon enough Silly Lovesick Boy was convinced to turn me as well and I finally got a taste of immortality! (Also being able to drain people's life spirit is amazing. I was able to reset so many from disliking me and repaired my reputation from my serial killer phase - what, you've never been a teen before??? It makes you crave violence!!!) Anyway apparently I had played my part a bit too well because after he turned me, Straud Junior wanted to get married?!?!??! But hey he has a mansion so I figured why not. Gave me an excuse to move away too. (And I got to make my adopted family all choke on grilled cheeses for what they put me through!!!) After the marriage, however, I got to meet Vladislaus himself and realized he is my actual soul mate! Like, he discusses evil plans with me! And helped me learn to play the organ! There is something about his dislike of people that makes me think he will be willing to go on a romantic killing spree with me too <33 As you see, I was (very justifiably) completely smitten with my new FIL. I really didn't think twice (I rarely do tbh) before setting my husband on deadly fire and scoring Vlad for myself! However he is a bit bummed that his son is dead now?!? And the Grim Reaper gave me a bit of a beating as well so for the first time in my life I am starting to wonder if I might be wrong. But that is silly right? I was just following my heart!! Your heart always knows what is best for you!!",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, so a few things have happened since my last post about my fiancée and I. For starters: she's now my wife. For another, after we got married we had our rainbow baby, a little boy. He's a wolf like me, I can already hear the little howls when he cries. We weren't being careful because truthfully it took sometime for us to get pregnant with our little man, but imagine our shock when she easily got pregnant after having him-- with twins! Another boy and a little girl, I think we may need to build another room somewhere--and I'm getting neutered cause three kids is plenty! I'm the beta of my pack currently and that's been whooping my tail, still I gotta say I'm honoured that my Alpha believes I'm capable of it. Even still-- the stress got to be enough that I've switched to freelance programming. My wife has become an art critic so I'm mostly going to be working from home with the pups while she works outside of the home, eh, whatever works. My wife and my Alpha have actually become friends as well and when my wife revealed to my alpha that she'd miscarried, she instantly felt bad about expecting me to ditch a spell caster for the pack. So yeah, that's my update on my (then) fiancée (now wife) vs pack dilemma. ETA: just wanted to show you guys our little miracle boy, and a beloved pregnancy photo Waiting on our little man oof, I am not looking forward to seeing her in this much pain again-- but the end result is something I wouldn't trade for anything It took a lot to get here, but we made it",

I jist don't think she's a great mother and her kid probably won't be either so I want to keep the baby and raise it myself but my son was like 'noooo ur the worst dad ever u can barely remember my name half the time' and then called me a llama and now he wants to move in with the Ursine's and I still want that baby.... AITA, or rather, WIBTA if I took the baby in to raise it? It hasn't been born yet which is why I keep.saying 'it', I hope it's a girl cause I sure hate raising boys.... .",

      "content_preview": "I (ya, m, werewolf) have been dating a vampire (ya, m) who has an adopted son (human, infant). Long story short, I didn't like the vampire at first, but then I found out that he was protecting the infant from Greg. Well, geez if we can't all relate to that. Everyone knows Greg is a problem. I was a Delta in my pack so what the heck, I joined in. Not the first time I protected a kid from Greg. After that, I told him if he ever needed a hand ... or paw, give a shout. I'm still not fond of most vampires, but he's okay in my books. One time he called me in a panic, he needed to go into the office, couldn't take his son with him, and his usual babysitters weren't available. Sure, why not watch the rugrat? Not like I can't smell when he needs a change, or hear when his stomach's getting empty, kinda makes baby care easier in that sense. So while he was gone I did tummy time with the baby, read to him, played peek-a-boo, and just narrated what I was doing around the place as I was doing it and held the little guy. I couldn't help it, I started to really care about the kid. Then I started to really care about the vampire. If you'd asked me when I first joined my pack if I ever saw that happening, I would've said no. Spell casters? Yeah, I could see that, I wouldn't have cared about getting with a spell caster. Nor would anyone in my pack care, but a vampire's a different story. Anyway-- I eventually formed a close friendship with the vampire, but there was a tension between us. We woohooed a couple of times before giving in and deciding to be boyfriends. So we move into a house a bit out of the way for when the full moon's out, but close enough to cities so my boyfriend can keep working (he's a food critic). I became the stay-at-home carer while my boyfriend worked. The baby aged up into a toddler, and I got promoted to Beta in my pack. I thought everything was going really well-- but then-- things changed. My Alpha was getting suspicious of this elusive boyfriend I never brought around-- so I challenged her for Alpha-- we brawled and I won, she became my Beta. Afterwards I started to notice this scent coming off her, she was in heat and I swear it's like the Wolf in me took complete control, I didn't realize we were woohooing as werewolves until-- well we were. Recently she invited us over to her house to meet her kids, Remy, Riley, and Lori-- and it's obvious they're my pups too. My boyfriend was beyond livid with me, and I don't blame him. We're both bi, and we're not jealous if we woohoo with women the only thing is we need to use protection. My stupid Wolf brain didn't think like that! As you might suspect, we broke up. I still try to stay close by in case Greg shows up and he needs back up to keep the kid safe-- but that's his adopted son, and I never officially co-adopted so--not my kid. Though I still think of him like he is. I get his anger, and I know he has reason to be form his stance, he doesn't understand how overwhelming those wild urges can get-- like you need to howl, you need to eat meat, you need to hunt-- and yeah, you need the other thing too apparently. I honestly have lost all respect for my former Alpha. She's been a werewolf longer than me, she knows how these things can impact us, and previously she'd never let any male in the pack anywhere near her during that time for her, for this very reason. I honestly think she's the llama for not sticking to her own rule about keeping distance from male pack members during her heat. I'll ask anyway: AITA for woohooing with my former Alpha?",

      "content_preview": "I (ya, m, werewolf) am currently engaged to my fiancée (ya, f, spellcaster) and we currently reside in Henford-on-Bagley, but we first met when she moved to Moonwood Mill, she was out jogging, and got too close to Greg's territory so I stopped her to say hi and guide her back away from danger (I wasn't in my wolf form at the time). She's a freelance writer, and I'm an e-sports gamer-- we make a pretty simoleon between us and in addition, I'm a Delta in my pack, she's a virtuoso spellcaster. So recently we had a surprise, we'd talked about it but we weren't really trying, however my fiancée became pregnant. We were shocked but excited-- until she started cramping towards the end of her first trimester, really strong cramps, and bleeding. We went to the hospital, but I could already smell it-- our baby was gone. We've been grieving, and supporting each other through this, perhaps more me supporting her than her supporting me. I was excited to be a Daddy, but she was already feeling the effects of the pregnancy on her body, morning sickness, cravings, some minor body changes-- she feels like her body betrayed her-- betrayed us. Recently my Alpha has told me that if I don't start focusing more on the pack and their values I'd be put on probation. I just about transformed then and there. My girl is going through one of the worst experiences of her life, I'm expected to ditch her for the pack? I'd sooner ditch them than her! Any other time, fine. Pack and my girl get even attention but right now, I can't bring myself to leave her. She's in a dark place. So, AITA for choosing my fiancée over my pack? ((OOC just to clear something up: I do play  multiple save files simultaneously, so all of this drama is not happening in the same save))",

We told our guests \"no dress code\" because we didn't want to micromanage what people wore. We figured they'd use common sense and dress at least somewhat nicely. Well, the guests arrived, and they all looked like no thought whatsoever had gone into their outfits. It was as if they were wearing a random sampling of all the clothes and accessories in existence! There were a lot of bad outfits, but my mother's was the worst by far. She was wearing: A pink bicycle helmet A lacey, Victorian-inspired blouse Cropped black yoga pants with a magenta stripe Lime green socks White hiking boots Talk about taking attention away from the bride! I'm still mad, but everyone keeps saying that I should have specified a dress code if I cared so much. AIO?",

Komorebi. Recently, my fiancée graduated from Foxbury with a degree in physics. We decided to throw a party in our Henford-on-Bagley home to celebrate. I, wanting to surprise her, started to learn from her mother about death and the different ways of achieving it. Fast forward to the day of the party, and I see that in the list of people invited, my fiancée's high school best friend (who she used to date) is there. I haven't met her a lot of times, but I deeply dislike her due to our clashing personalities (she implied my mother was a llama...) and interests. Honestly, I am upset that my fiancée didn't consult with me before inviting her, but I understand that they are still close. So, I decided the nest course of action was to show her I knew and was interested on her heritage by testing my learnings on her high school best friend. I prepared all the food while my fiancée was taking care of our farm, and decided to make an extra pufferfish nigiri. Now, everyone seems to be crying because the woman is dead on the floor. My fiancée isn't appreciating that I took the precious time to learn about her family's work. I have yet to understand if I did something wrong, but I don't think I did. Still, am I the llama?",

I knew he'd started living with some other people, which I don't care about... however this did lead to him not performing as well as I would've preferred. So eventually I was challenged for my alpha status, and I lost. Afterwards to soothe my wounds I bedded my former Beta (as I was now Beta). From this I became pregnant with triplets, two male, one female. I then told my Beta who panicked and begged me to keep their paternity secret so his boyfriend wouldn't find out he'd slipped up. I asked why he'd cheated on his boyfriend, and he told me that it wasn't cheating, they had an arrangement where they could sleep with women outside of their relationship, but protection had to be used effectively. Well that angered me. I'd hoped that the vampire he'd been associating with was just a friend, but nope! That creep was playing house with a plasma drinker, and now I'm knocked up with his pups!! So I've resolved to invite the household over once my Pups are born so his lovely vampire boyfriend can meet them, his step-children, after all. So, AITA for having pups with my Beta? ETA: so my pups have been born, we'll call them, Remy, Riley and Lori, they all met their vampire step-father, who realized instantly that his boyfriend had fathered my pups and caused a huge argument between them. Pretty sure my former Beta (who fought me to become Alpha) is now single. Take away my leadership, there's consequences!",

I was always more the type to learn the dark ways of the night children and sire many offspring while my sister who I'll call Manon was more interested in being the more good kind of vampire, she would ask permission before consuming plasma, made friends with the cattle but she was never as strong as I. One issue was that she never built up a tolerance for the sunlight unlike myself, a spellcaster that lives across the street from us has had to bring her back from the dead several times. Anyway this werewolf moved to the neighbourhood with his brother(yuck) naturally i didn't like them and I thought the same of Manon until my sisters latest stint with death and resurrection. One night I come home after a date with the grim reaper and I see my sister creating the cure for vampirism from my own bar and she drank it, centuries of accumulating power wasted and if this wasn't bad enough she told me she and the werewolf(andrew is its name) are getting married and moving, I couldn't look at her but that didn't stop her from walking out the door. I heard news of their marriage from our spellcaster friend and then I heard she then became a fairy, now she's a threat! One of my spawn got into a fight with her mutt boyfriend and so using her new powers stripped him of the gift I gave. Then to add insult to injury andrew then gave my sire the cursed bite. I went to their house and I disowned her, telling her I never wish to see her again. I've heard from mutual friends thay she's heartbroken and that I've gone too far. So AITA? TLDR: sister dated a werewolf, drank cure to vampirism, married werewolf and became a fairy, then cured my sire and her husband cursed him so I disowned her.",

      "content_preview": "I (teen f) have found myself in the middle of someone else’s drama. I know what you’re probably thinking, but I’m not a Drama Llama - far from it, I’m more of a Mischief and Magic gal. Recently there’s been a misunderstanding between my boyfriend, J, and his best friend S. It's a little bit funny actually. J and I are somewhat open about what we are, we don’t exactly advertise, some Sims are still unsure of occults. But if you ask then we’ll tell you. Plus there’s some frankly insulting rules at school which mean we can’t just go around eating lockers, biting other students, zipzapping the teacher - not that we’d do any of that! S is different though, he seems to think he’s alone here. Usually when a Sim like him meets someone like J it does not end well, at best they’ll exchange some insults and at worst…you’ll end up as some kind of trophy. J is super outgoing and incredibly friendly so unless you know what you’re looking for, you might not suspect him - especially as a vegetarian. Just don’t get him over-excited, I swear it’s like dating a Labrador at times. Like I said, we don’t advertise but that won’t stop me dropping hints. I’m well versed in vampire lore so occasionally I’ll drop it into conversation, making intentional mistakes to try and get a rise out of him. I’ve even gone as far as debating the existence of vampires - nothing! He didn’t even look up from his phone. I was prepared to stop pushing and let him live in ignorance, until he attracted the attention of my best friend. C and I have been friends since we were children, she's great. Her parents have always welcomed me, C’s mam may not be a Spellcaster but her mediumship and thanatology knowledge are unparalleled. I lost my own mam a few years ago during The Great Heatwave so it’s nice to have other adults looking out for me. Naturally I’ve told C about my powers, she would’ve noticed eventually and it’s not something you want to blindside your bestie with. When we were kids I may have set my familiar on that horrible Landgraab brat for pulling her pigtails, so it’s never been a secret. I haven’t told her about J though as it’s not my news to share. But she’s not stupid, she has her suspicions. She has a bad case of rose-tinted glasses when it comes to S though. The whole time she was crushing on him I tried to point out the obvious signs - “not a cloud in the sky and S is carrying an umbrella, isn’t that strange?”, “I swear I’ve never seen that boy eat, he can’t be surviving on Power Sip alone”. I hate keeping this secret from C. J and I were trying to figure out how to coax a confession out of S by the time prom came around, but they’d decided to go together before we could come up with anything. Prom itself was great and we continued the party down at Plumbite Pier. We kept an eye on S and C up until their first kiss and may have gotten a little…distracted by the fairground rides. When we came out of the cuddle carts S was gone so J went looking for him. I did my best to distract C in the meantime but I could only keep her away for so long. By the time we found them J was pulling down his sleeve and laughing hysterically, S looked pissed . I knew what must’ve happened and J confirmed it while walking me home, it was a genius move. They planned to meet up the next day and talk it out so I decided to run distraction again with C. I took her to the Realm for the day, we mooched around Casters Alley, watched some duels and I introduced her to my mentor L. L never got along well with my mam, but we bonded over a shared love of mischief and I’ve confided in her a few times about my current predicament. L is not above dropping hints of her own, gossiping with C about the son of a master vampire befriending the son of a prominent werewolf pack leader, telling her tales of their shared history, but it seemed to go completely over her head. L pulled me aside before we left and stressed that if S isn’t prepared to tell C, then I have to - for her own safety should he ever lose control. My older brother D and his fiancée E are my legal guardians now, they’re…okay. D is a bit of a hot-head, always trying to pick fights with the Sages, and E is nice, if a little bland. Against my better judgement, I decided to ask D for some advice when I got home. He was less than helpful. Apparently I’d just be stirring the cauldron unnecessarily and causing drama for my own amusement. That’s the last thing I want to do! I hate being in the middle of this. Oh, and I’m a nosy little so-and-so who should mind her own business and tidy her room. E just patted my head and told me I’m a good friend, but I should be worrying more about my grades than anything else (rude - I’m a straight B student thank you). So… do I tell her? At this point I’m not confident that S will ever come clean about this, and C surely has a right to know. Would I be the llama?",

      "content_preview": "I (adult, m) am a former vampire. I currently have two biological children A (infant, m) and B (infant, f), I also adopted my wife's twins from her previous marriage, D (teen, m) and R (teen, f). Lately I began to notice a few things about R that weren't alarm bells for me, or red flags at first, just kind of yellowish green I guess you could call them. Essentially I got the idea that maybe she was keeping something about her personal life from us. We'd already given them both the woohoo talk, and made sure they had access to contraceptives, so I wasn't too concerned at first until I began noticing a few personality shifts in her. She began locking herself in her room more often, I'd hear her yelling at someone on the phone, or I heard her furiously typing away at the keyboard. Not the kind of typing you'd hear if she was working on an assignment, angry typing (yes kids, parents can tell the difference). I then said that I'd call her out of school on Thursday, we'd go to the bowl-a-rama bonanza at the bowling ally, and I'd help her study for her exam on Friday. That night, I heard her sneak out. I had an idea of where she was going so I wasn't overly concerned (we have a family friend who lives close by, his son is about R and D's age). The following day I had confirmation that our friend's son (let's call him Oz) had a late night visitor. Which only made me more certain of what R's secret likely was. So change of plans, instead of going bowling, I took her to a karaoke place I know and used to frequent before I met her mom. Once we were in I asked them for a specific song. Before I got called up to sing (or more accurately rap), I looked the child who first made me a Dad in the eye and told her, \"You know-- I have a secret that I've kept from you kids. Your mom knows it but I'm thinking you would probably benefit from knowing it.\" R rolled her eyes and asked, \"What secret would that be?\" me: \"I'm Bi. Your mom knew before we got married-- heck, back when the two of you were newborn and I brought a guy home.\" She sat looking at me blinking for a bit, before I got called up. As I left our table I told her, \"you can join me if you like. It's cool either way.\" So I went up and sang the bisexual anthem changing a few lyrics cause, yeah I'm not a woman, lol. Towards the last parts, R came up, and started in with, \"I met a cute little shorty--\" you know the line, right? It was just a way for me to show her, that yeah I do have bi pride, and I will shout it from the roof tops. If someone's hassling her because she isn't straight, I'll stand by her through it. After that song, we got a few weird looks, a few people calling me a child lover because I'm there with a teen girl who looks nothing like me. I just laughed and said, \"That'd be especially gross. She's my daughter, I've been there since her first breath, and I'll be there til my last.\" I ordered us some pita and hummus, one of her favourites, and eventually she opened up, telling me about her ex-girlfriend \"Ocean\", and former crush \"River\". River as it turns out is a walking, talking, breathing container of judgement-- and if I'm gonna get crude he's probably over compensating for something he lacks in an area I don't want to know about. Then Ocean, well, sadly I'd be lying if I tried to claim I've never encountered biphobic homosexuals before. It's sad, but it's true. The general mindset being: \"it's the safe point between admitting you're gay and pretending to be straight\". Spare me the facades, I've been bi for the past 250 sim years, you'd think I'd be fully out of the closet by now if that were the case! So now I'm wondering-- I have a few friends who are still occult sims... namely my twin sister, who are also bi and I'm sure would rally up for the chance to give these phobics the scare of a life time. Oh by the way, we're talking vampires, spellcasters and a few werewolves I'm on neutral terms with. If I did arrange such a thing, would that make me the llama?",

      "content_preview": "I (teen m) recently played a trick on my best friend, kind of - let's call him S. We met when he started at my school and the Principal asked me to show him around, we've been inseparable ever since. I could tell straight away there was something different about him - in fact I could smell it on him. His surname was a giveaway too, the family line is somewhat infamous across SimNation. Historically, people like us haven't gotten along with each other. There's been full-blown wars over territory and how we treat other Sims, amongst other things. I was raised to always treat others with kindness and respect, and I wasn't going to let a centuries-old conflict stop me from making a new friend. I thought that S would've known about me straight away - usually they have some kind of enhanced senses - but apparently not in his case. A bit odd for the kid of two masters of the trade but I'm not here to judge his abilities, he'll no doubt grow into them. We all develop at our own pace and I believe in him! My girlfriend G noticed his condition straight away, you can't sneak anything past her. And this is where it starts to get complicated. Her friend C was crushing hard on S, and I knew he felt the same, but G didn't want anything to happen between the two of them until he - in her words - \"puts on his big-boy pants and owns up to what he is. If he can't tell you, his best friend, then how long will he take to tell C?\". A very fair point, as much as I don't like meddling in other people's love lives. But S and C went rogue and decided to go to prom together before we could start dropping hints. Prom itself was great and afterwards C suggested we keep the party going at Plumbite Pier. I kept a close eye on them, my hearing is fairly sensitive too so I listened in to see if he'd tell her. This may have bitten me in the butt when it came to their first kiss, there's some things you don't need to hear your best mate doing, so I tuned out and snuck away to the cuddle carts with G while I had the chance. When we emerged I couldn't see S. C was busy with our other friends taking pictures with the Frank the Flying Womp Womp statue. G joined them to make sure C stayed distracted while I looked for S. When I found him he looked frantic, searching his pockets but he wouldn't tell me what for - not that I had to ask. He thinks he's super subtle pouring his plasma packs into an old Power Sip can, but the last time I checked (well, G checked, I'm too excitable for that much caffeine) the LlamaBerry flavour isn't purple. So he confessed and said the words I've been waiting to hear for months: \"I'm a vampire\". And a forgetful one at that, he didn't have any snacks with him. I can kind of relate, I know what it’s like when you get hit by a craving and it makes you so angry... Anyway, this is the part where I'm probably the llama. I don't know why I did it, giddiness perhaps from all the excitement of the night. I've read enough vampire lore to know they hate the taste of folks like me, but regardless he was in a tight spot, and - as the saying goes - fed is best? I gave him a hug, thanked him for telling me, and offered him my wrist. I'm not going to lie, it hurt like a bitch, but I wasn't going to let that show. I was waiting to see what would happen. Before long he pulled away and his face was a picture, a mix of confusion and disgust with just a hint of anger. I couldn't help but laugh, and once I started I couldn't stop. I could practically see the cogs turning in his head until it clicked and he realised what I am. I wanted so badly to say something, explain myself, but by that point the girls were looking for us. G had tried her best but ran out of excuses for where we could've gone. I asked him to come over to my place the next day and we'd talk it out. I told G what had happened when I walked her home and she just thought it was hilarious. She's a total goofball so any kind of mischief is fine in her eyes - especially if it's for a good cause overall... I hope. Part of me expected him to not come over, and I wouldn't have blamed him if he never spoke to me again. We went down to the shore of Lake Lunvik and I told him all about how I ended up in Moonwood Mill. He actually helped me fill in some gaps of my own during our conversation. For a long time I secretly assumed that one of the things chasing me was his dad - I know, I need to address my own prejudices here. I know about Greg, we all know about Greg, he was there that night. Trying his best I suppose, he’s surprisingly good with kids. It's funny how memory works, there's so much about that night I don't remember, but one thing that I'll never forget was the hat it was wearing. If I wasn’t so scared I would’ve laughed, it was ridiculous . How it stayed on during the chase is beyond me, maybe it was cursed? S’s dad never had a hat like that, but one of his old step-dads did. I heard from one of dad’s old…friends (don’t ask) that she’s seen something that sounds very similar to it on Greg’s mantelpiece. A macabre trophy perhaps, because that’s when S said his step-dad stopped coming around. We went back to the cabin and I introduced S to my dad. He had a lot of questions about the history between our peoples and, while dad was a little hesitant, he said we're both grown-up enough now to know all the details - including some that S's parents had left out. S admitted he'd always just assumed that, since my dad is a bit of a hippie, my absence around the full moon was some ceremonial thing to do with the Full Moon Revelry. He'd put the shedding down to my dog Scout (he's a hairy boy) and my sparring scratches down to G's cat Menace - aka Señor Snuggles. I love the guy but he can be dumb as a bag of rocks at times. We'd pretty much patched everything up by the time S left and we agreed we’d work on how to tell C everything. Not just about S, but me and G too. It's only fair I suppose. I told dad about last night and, unsurprisingly, he was pretty disappointed in me. He says it was cruel and would only add to the misconceptions people have about us. It's the type of behaviour he'd expect from my Sister, not me, and that I could've gotten hurt. I don't think it's something Sis would do, there's no way she'd let herself be drank from for one. And it's been a long-time ambition of hers to beat up S's dad, despite never having met the guy - but dad says that's not the point and I shouldn't argue with my pack leader. For balance, I asked Sis too and, once she got over her initial reaction of \"why are you two friends?\" - her wife reminding her that \"R, your gym buddy is one, your best friend is married to one, don't be a Judgy Judith\" - Sis agreed that the method was unorthodox but the result was necessary. I know she'll still tease me about it, but that's what family is for, right? Even after clearing the air with S I still feel pretty bad so, as a... surprise? a peace offering maybe? I've planted a Plasma Fruit tree by my Pack's hangout. Dad loved the idea, something about \"the seeds of coexistence\" or whatever. W didn't have an option either way, he usually just goes along with whatever dad says - when they're not busy making wolf-eyes at each other (gross I know, I do NOT need to see my dad flirting!) but L was hesitant. And I understand, she and her cousins were terrorised by vampires when they were younger. The cousins ended up taken in by them while she stayed lost in the tunnels until dad found her. So now I feel bad for upsetting L too! It's the last thing I wanted, she's like a grandma to me, but the tree is magnificent and L always says she wants to reconcile with her cousins, wouldn't this help? So, between my trick on S, upsetting L with the tree, and hiding everything from C... Am I the Llama?",

      "content_preview": "I (teen, m) have been friends with \"R\" (teen, f) since we were toddlers (our parents are friends). I'm not sure what caused it, but she's been getting bullied and harassed a lot at school lately namely by two other students we'll call \"Ocean\" and \"River\". I try to step in and speak up when I witness it-- but I don't know the root cause of it... or I didn't. I'm not sure what happened but her twin brother, D started getting targeted by Ocean and River as well. I can't help very much if I don't know what's going on. I tried to talk with R about it, and she blew me off. Then late last night just before I turned in for bed, I heard someone tossing stones near my window. I went out to the balcony and quietly gestured for her to climb up the lattice. She did, and we talked for a while. It turns out it's rooted in biphobia. She had been dating one of them and then got a crush on the other so she broke it off with the first person. But now they're both harassing her over it. The guy's telling her that liking girls is unnatural, and the girl's saying she doesn't actually like girls. Well, one I'm not sure how to help her, short of telling her parents what's going on. I happen to know that her mom is a very vocal ally, and I think her Dad (not bio Dad, but may as well be since he raised her from birth) is also bi. Personally, I'm pan, so I mean-- I get her perspective on this, but that also makes things a bit dangerous too. If either of us get hurt it could be seen as a hate crime (yeah, my mom's a lawyer, and both of my parents are aromantic-- don't ask me how that works). Apparently D tried to press R to talk with him, and she snapped at him. So now her Dad, C, wants to take her bowling. Which is kind of code for daddy/daughter time. She doesn't want it to happen because she doesn't feel ready to tell them everything. I hugged her and told her I always have an ear and shoulder if she needs either, even if I don't have answers sometime it just helps to get it off your chest. This morning my Dad told me that if I sneak another person into my room I'll lose my balcony door. I tried to tell him that a friend was in a bit of a crisis, but he wasn't hearing it, apparently I'm interfering? I don't understand how? I literally just let her vent for an hour, I offered a bit of support, and told her about me so she knew she wasn't alone at school, that's it. AITA for sneaking a distressed friend into my room to literally just talk?",

I’ve gained a certain amount of renown around town - after all, and I don’t mean to brag, I am the fearless hero who recruited my fellow scientists and a few soldiers to defeat the Mother Plant that had been infecting Strangeville with her spores (and mucking up our plumbing). And, I will admit, during my quest to save us all, my work performance had dipped somewhat. I was mining the fields outside the lab for crystals and metals to fund the project, and neglected my analysis tasks. But my performance level was still above average, bordering on excellent. But that has no bearing on what has happened at the lab recently. Not to drag it out - I’m a ghost now. I was finally picking up my work slack when that jerk Malcolm Landgraab somehow set the bathroom on fire, and k1lled us all. He’s always had it out for me, since the first time I tried to ask him for a crystal, but this was just negligence. How do you set a toilet on fire, Malcolm? Anyway, he’s d3ad now. But that’s not my real problem - when I got home after my reaping (and after putting out the rest of Malcolm’s fires), I discovered that the laboratory had fired me! Here I was, the hero of Strangeville, newly unemployed and freshly unalived. It’s a disgrace. So, given that they are already advertising for my replacement, WIBTA if I applied for my old job again, just to sabotage their equipment and haunt them into a panic? I feel like they almost want me to do it, and now that I’ve built this rocket ship, I could really do some damage. Update: I took in a day at the GeekCon to clear my head, and when I came home, Nancy Landgraab had my power shut off! She claims it’s “squirrel maintenance.” I think their whole family has it out for me…",

      "content_preview": "I (teen, f), am currently in my freshman year of high school. I had a short high school romance for a little bit then we broke up with a girl we’ll call “Ocean” I realized that we weren’t compatible I developed a crush on someone else Thing is, Ocean keeps blowing up my phone, social bunny, trying to corner me during lunch or in the washroom. She keeps calling me a “fake d*%#” because the other person I started crushing on is a guy (we’ll call him “River”) and she figured it out. Then as it turns out River was almost as bad. He kept saying that lesbians and bi girls are just “confused” because they don’t have their Dads around. Non bio Dads don’t count and any mom who gets divorced is just a selfish gold digger. Needless to say I got over the crush pretty quick! Thing is he keeps at me too! Now, I don’t know what to do. Thankfully I don’t have classes with him but it’s always awkward passing by him in the hallway. He keeps sending me texts to article links that back up what he’s claiming. So I’ve blocked them both on everything and now they’re getting their friends involved!! I’m not out to anybody in my family, a few friends know I’m bi, but that’s it. I can just imagine what River would say if he finds out I’ve never met my bio Dad, my parents were divorcing when I was born, my step Dad was around before I was born and my only ex is a girl. Ocean just wants me to admit that I’m not attracted to girls, but that’s a lie, and on the flip side there’s River who thinks conversation therapy works, so I’m staying away (a nice face and body doesn’t make up for a llama butt personality, lesson learned!) So, AITA for giving them the cold shoulder? Some other students say that I am but I’d like an outside perspective. Edit to add: now they’re heckling my twin brother, D. He asked me about what was going on, I snapped at him to leave me alone, our Dad overheard and now he wants to take me bowling… great. Something to note: our Dad, the man who raises us and has raised us since we were born, has no biological link to us. He's married to our mom and officially adopted us when he married her.",

      "content_preview": "I (teen m) recently moved in with my dad. He and my mam went through a messy divorce when I was a child and initially I went to live with her in San Myshuno. Mam hates children so it wasn't the best arrangement to begin with, and I had to get out of there when she moved in her...underlings? lovers? pets? I don't know, and frankly I don't want to know. Whatever they've got going on is their own business, but I've seen more than enough of K and M to last me a lifetime or two. It's very different from San Mysh here, but dad's family have lived in this town for generations, well over 200 years - there's even a statue of my great-great-grandfather in the town square. Dad's a bit of a loner and mostly keeps to himself during the day, either reading some old tome or tinkering with his pipe organ in the basement. A new town also meant a new high school, and that's where I met J. The Principal assigned him to show me around on the first day and we just clicked. He's super outgoing and loves nature - one of those vegetarians. He's kind of easily excitable too but his girlfriend G always knows how to calm him down. He always jokes that she's got him on a short leash. Maybe I should've read more into that? Anyway, another thing to know about me is that I have a... condition. It's hereditary in my case, but almost anyone can catch it. It doesn't impact me too much, I just have to be careful about being out in the sun for too long, avoid certain foods, and I need to take a supplement of sorts to keep me going. There's other ways to get it but I prefer the pre-packed stuff you can get online. They're so convenient, I've taken to pouring them into an old Power Sip can for maximum subtly - LlamaBerry flavour if you're curious. Usually I keep a good supply with me but eventually it happened, I got caught out. After prom, my date (now girlfriend - C) asked if I wanted to go to Plumbite Pier and continue the party, so of course I said yes! J and G tagged along with some of our other friends and after a few rides (and my first kiss with C) the adrenaline wore off and the dizziness kicked in. I wandered away from the group and checked and double-checked my pockets, but I didn't have anything on me and I was beginning to panic. J came to check on me and I just broke down, I told him everything. I thought that was it, I was done, that he'd out me for the monster people usually think I am. But he didn't. He just gave me a hug, thanked me for coming clean about it, and offered me his wrist. I haven't had too much practice getting what I need this way, I'm a bit of a sloppy drinker and I was terrified of hurting him, but he was patient with me... then the taste hit. I can't even begin to describe it, it was like drinking wet dog!? I pulled away from him and he was laughing - the bastard actually laughed! Part of me was angry but more than anything I was confused. Then it dawned on me, what J is. Had he known about me all along, was our whole friendship just an elaborate ruse to get one over on me? I had so many questions but by then the girls were looking for us and it was getting late. We agreed to meet the next day to talk it out. I met him at his dad's place and we went for a walk down to the lake. J apologised for pulling such a mean prank. I was still bitter about it and still feel queasy thinking about it, but apparently him and G had known about my condition from Day 1 and were just waiting for me to tell them, then they'd figure out how to help me tell C as - get this - the only 'normal' one in our little group!? What does that make G!? But I had to, in their words, put on my big-boy pants and come out with it first. I asked J how he knew and he told me he's got quite a sensitive nose, \"not to make you self-conscious or anything. it's not a bad smell, just distinct\". Thanks dude, definitely not self-conscious now... /s. Then he told me about how he came to this town and I felt like such a llama. Guilt by association I suppose? His first run-in with someone like me happened when he was just a kid. A fire had broken out at his family's house and he ran into the woods with his sister to get away from it. They became separated and that's when he realised he was being tracked by something - and something else. The first 'thing' sounded like one of the cringe step-dads mam brought home (i still hate the guy, and his stupid hat). The other 'thing' was way more monstrous, pure unbridled fury. I'm guessing whatever that thing was took out cringe step-dad in the process because it lines up with the time he stopped coming around, not that I'm shedding any tears, but a fight broke out between the two and J was bitten in the process. He was found soon after by K, who adopted him and raised him from then on, teaching him their ways - i.e. not being a llama to non-werewolves. It feels so weird writing that out, the W word was practically a slur in mam's household. I clearly remember the day she hit the roof after finding out one of her creations had married one. I didn't get what the big deal was but she sat me down and explained the history between our peoples - Operation Eternal Flame, the Century Conflict and all that. I can't say I fully understood the nuances, that was over a hundred years ago, we're just kids. Back at J's his dad filled in some of the details that mam conveniently left out of her explanation. The encounter felt pretty awkward at first, he almost seemed hesitant to tell me, and I learned some uncomfortable truths about my parents at the same time. I expected him to be angry at me, but K is a nice guy, and told me I can't be help responsible for their mistakes. Mistakes seems a bit trivial for what they've done, but J did warn me that he's a bit of a hippie. When I got home that night dad went through the usual \"where have you been, who were you with, what did you do?\" with me and I didn't really know what to say, other than to just shrug and go to my room. I know he's done some messed up things but at the end of the day he's still my dad, and I still feel bad for lying to him. Dad always said that if I met someone like J then I'd \"know straight away\" - instant dislike, we wouldn't get along, Supernatural Smackdowns all round. I just put this down to his...eccentricities. But knowing what I do now I wonder if he was maybe trying to protect me from anyone out for revenge? So, be honest with me: am I the llama for not telling dad about my friendship with J? He's my best friend and I'd like to keep it that way. And what about C, how do I tell her what I am? Will she hate me for keeping it from her and making her the last to know? Help!",
