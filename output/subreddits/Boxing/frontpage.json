That’s not the same thing as being the kind of guy who gets dropped by a love tap. Obviously once you’ve taken a really big KO or two you’re more prone to it afterwards and you can develop a glass chin where there wasn’t one before, but I don’t recall either of them getting KO’d by damage that wouldn’t have done the same to 90% of elite fighters if they were taking that same punch. Certainly not often enough to warrant that becoming a major part of their reputation as a fighter.",

      "content_preview": "Given the upcoming fight, there has been a lot of speculation about how good Crawford is, how good he will be at the weight, and how likely he is to beat Canelo. I want to look at this from the perspective of how good Crawford stacks up against fighters with attributes that beat Canelo, in my opinion. The three fighters are Mayweather, Golovkin, and Bivol. All three of these fighters were defensively sound, had great jabs, were tough enough to take good shots when Canelo landed, and at least two of them had enough power to make Canelo worry about what they were throwing at him. So, in order from what I think is most to least important, I will be ranking how Crawford stacks up against these fighters in: Jab, Defensive Responsibility, Toughness/Punch Resistance, Power.Jab:This is, I think, the most important tool to beat Canelo, because it stops him from getting off his offense and sets up your offense. Out of these four, I think GGG had the most effective and stiff jabs. A lot of Bivol's effectiveness came from his size and natural strength. Not to say that Mayweather's jab wasn't also incredibly good, as it did a great job of frustrating Canelo, but it didn't do the damage of the other two fighters. For this reason, given that Crawford has a bit more power than Mayweather, I'm tempted to rank him third on this list, because he has a bit more pop than Mayweather which may give him just enough to have Canelo thinking a bit more. But Mayweather's jab was just so good, I don't think Crawford has the same versatility, and realistically, neither does Bivol's jab.Ranking:Golovkin, Mayweather, Bivol, Crawford.Defense:Unquestionably important here. Canelo hits hard and fast, and his punches catch the judges eyes. So it is almost equally important here to make sure that when Canelo throws he doesn't land, both to limit damage and automatic scoring. Mayweather seems the obvious choice, but interestingly Bivol got hit less when he fought Canelo. Still, Mayweather's track record puts him above Bivol. Golovkin was a pressure fighter, so he was much more willing to take a shot to give a shot. Crawford is usually a bit more of a middle distance to outside fighter who baits offense to counter athletically, but he can be ego-baited into a wild exchange. Still, he gets hit less than GGG, so I think I'll rank him above GGG.Ranking:Mayweather, Bivol, Crawford, GGG.Toughness:Not talking P4P here, just face value ability to take a punch. Bivol here takes the top spot because of his size. It seemed like nothing Canelo hit him with even so much as made him blink. He was able to assimilate many punches that Canelo was able to use against Charlo and even Kovalev, and we saw him go 24 against Beterbiev. GGG here takes the second spot. A truly titanium chin, but showed a bit of a weakness to the body in the second fight. Floyd has been rocked with a headshot before, but his toughness is extremely underrated; the only time he ever touched canvas was when he broke his hand and touched it himself. Crawford though does have a history of being rocked, and arguably dropped against Kavaliauskas. Still, he has showed good punch resistance as he has gone up in weight, but for me he falls under Floyd in this category. Given that he is moving up two weight classes against a reputable puncher, I wouldn't move him any higher.Ranking:Bivol, GGG, Mayweather, Crawford.Power:This is likely the least important of the four, but can make up for a deficiency in any of the above three. I'm tempted to put Bivol  up here because of his size, but if I remember correctly it was GGG who hurt Canelo with a right hand in the 10th round of their second fight, while Bivol had no such moment. Still, Bivol had enough natural pop to be able to stay light and loose and keep Canelo worried about what was coming back. I think we can all agree Crawford has more power than Mayweather, but I would definitely say less than Bivol or Golovkin.Ranking:GGG, Bivol, Crawford, Mayweather.So if we tally up points (4 points for first, 3 for second, 2 for third, 1 for last) we get:Mayweather: 10GGG: 12Bivol: 12Crawford: 6Without taking Power into consideration, we get:Mayweather: 9GGG: 8Bivol: 9Crawford: 4Putting Crawford up against Canelos 3 best previous opponents, I do have to say he ranks below them for me. For this reason I think for Crawford to win he has to fight the absolute perfect fight in the best condition of his life, while Canelo has to fight similarly to how he fought against Scull; this is Canelo's fight to lose. Crawford beating Canelo would be a tremendous upset for which Crawford deserves all the credit, but I just don't see that happening, IMO.Let me know what you think!",
