It was The Worst Justice League Ever CoG. I've been relistening to a bunch of old CoG extended audios and, having learned that Mayso did the above thing once, realized that it's this one. Unlike most CoG, James is just explaining the plot and Maso just reacts to James' thoughts. https://youtu.be/7PIwB7kJshs?si=6Ph4naeiis7uBOHb Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

Nick Mason was kidnapped by James Clement and replaced with a 72 year old British man named Oliver McBritish. I'm not sure why everyone is just accepting the “oh Mason’s got laryngitis” story like it was nothing. ​ Why did James kidnap Mason? Because old Maseau stole James's peanut butter sandwich. That’s right just peanut butter. No jelly. No banana. No honey. James is the kind of lunatic who thinks two slices of dry bread and Skippy is a meal.. you all know it. Also, I'm pretty sure this goes all the way to the top. There’s a good chance the Prime Minister of Australia himself signed off on this. Wake up. Mason didn’t lose his voice. James took it.",

I remember hearing James and Mason talk about it and that was around the time I started to listen to them weekly. If it was edited out I completely understand why. Edit: it has been found, episode 13 at the 1hour and 16 minute mark only on Spotify. Thanks Nivalnaut.",

I'm fairly certain my oldest daughter is around the same age, and she recently started getting into the show on her own.  She came to me and asked to watch with me, and we've been going through together.  I also did the same thing James mentioned, and overly explained the Flintstones opening so she would understand why it was so funny. She watched the first couple of seasons on her own, but she typically will tell me what episodes are coming up and we'll watch a lot of it together.  We'll watch two or three episodes a day together, and are somewhere in season 10 at the moment.  We watched the movie about two weeks ago, and it's been a really good time going back through a show I used to watch at her age and see her genuinely excited to watch it. I couldn't tell you the last time I watched the show, but once we get to the point I fell off, I'm sure it'll be more difficult to be interested in every single episode.  So what are some highlight episodes from the later half of the seasons?",

E.g. the big sandwich episode, the Old Rey episode, rude Obi-Wan Kenobi, etc. I also really often re-listen to their review of the Joker movie as Maso's rant about how it has absolutely no comic book elements in it is absolutely hilarious. Their Batman v Superman episode is great as well. The recent Alien Earth episode I think will go down as a classic as James just gets increasingly more unhinged towards the end, the insane Google search results, and Maso going on about dads not eating snacks. Anyway, tell me your favourite eps! Cheers",
