      "content_preview": "I've been playing since 2015 and I'd like to consider myself to be a relatively decent player. My best role right now is DPS and I'm currently sitting in Plat 3. With the release of the galactic Freja skin, I've been wanting to try push into Diamond to get it. I tried all 3 roles and DPS was my best placement, along with Open Queue which I've got to Plat 4. I feel like my best chance is to keep playing my DPS games and try to push higher there, but I've been struggling a bit so far. My wins are being offset by my losses and I'm stuck in Plat 3. I feel like a need a more consistent run of wins, but I can never see to get it. Are there any simple bits of advice that might help me to improve overall and possibly pick up more wins along the way? Things that I should be doing, that I might not be? Any help is greatly appreciated.",

      "content_preview": "I'm a tank player, pretty much only queue tank very seriously, placed masters 4 and not having much trouble getting up to 2, even played a placement match with a couple previous champs and gm's in the lobby and won (though it was close). I play mostly dva/ball/winston, and my aim is as good as it needs to be and no more. However, my dps role is in plat for a few reasons like not trying as hard on tank, not playing the role as effectively as tank, etc. But my god some people I encounter in this rank have DISGUSTING aim, like flick right and left. They position like a reinhardt no matter the hero, waste their cooldowns, don't track ults or flow of the game at all, but they can SHOOT. If I take a duel with any ashe/cass/widow/etc. I get smoked every time, I wonder if its because all they do to practice the game is aim training and nothing about self reviewing their gameplay as a whole. Has anyone else noticed this?",

      "content_preview": "so, for a bit of context, i have been on and off with this game for the past few years, recently deciding to pick it back up following a hiatus where i played more rivals (and other, less frustrating, games in general). since coming back, i have made a switch from being mostly a dps player (and borderline onetrick) to playing far more support. unfortunately, upon finishing placements and a few following games, i seem to still be where i was before. this wouldn't be bad, necessarily, but it is a bit frustrating when the people around me seem to always place and climb far higher than i have ever been able to. so, i figured that because this community has helped me in the past (i used to be bronze and posting here did help, with the help of a particular member), i could maybe find a better way forward than slamming my head into the same wall and failing over and over again. now, a few things about this vod: i know my gameplay was definitely lacking in a few different ways (my accuracy wasn't the best due to being generally shaky for my first game on, i played far too risky at times, i didn't switch off when i probably should have, etc.) the problem is, i am not the best at identifying these issues myself, which is why i thought it best to have other opinions. thank you in advance if you decided to either watch this vod or just give general advice! replay code: 4BEW5V battletag: PositivitEve platform: pc rank: gold 4/5 hero played: wuyang map: dorado",

I am in Gold and Plat lobbies and, yeah it's low ranks, but this should not be fundamentally misunderstood at this level. Yeah, I know Reinhardt is big and easy to hit and Orisa is scary, but if you want to win team fights, GO. FOR. THE. 16k HEALS. MERCY. Yeah, I know she flies around and is difficult to land shots on. It's so hard I know. But I don't know if you've noticed that you dominate every team fight as soon as a single support is gone. Especially if it's that stupid angel. Good Mercies know how to position so that you are forced to stand directly downsights of the enemy team. Welp, that's why we have dive. That's why we have high ground. That's why we think about baiting and forcing mistakes. That's why we think of this game as a team-dynamic, winning team fights and not just getting kills. This isn't COD. It's more than shoot big man. Beyond Mercy, please people, especially you DPS players, remember: the absence of any one support > the absence of that one frustrating DPS you want revenge on, and the absence of one support means a Tank's options are dramatically reduced and space can be taken.",

Team was also pretty spread out so we lost. Second round (Gardens), I swapped to Sym and using turrets I created a ton of pressure at different chokes and he couldn't enter point as much.  He did get in and killed me a few times but I did enough damage w/ primary fire and turrets for teammates to clean up. We won. Third round (City Center), I stayed Sym and he controlled high ground. Destroyed every turret I made and hard focused me when I was assisting the team. Team was spread out this game too so didn't get much help in fights against him. We lost. I acknowledge that it's definitely a skill issue (probably someone whose just played longer then me) but I was wondering if there's really anything I can do as a Sombra main to really mess up a pocketed Genji? I just can't figure out how to add value against someone whose just shredding me in 1's with that level of movement, burst damage, and a support in their back pocket.",

This was up until I managed to climb up to and peak at Diamond 2. Since then, I've believed that I can probably hit masters if I sink in decent practice and hours. However, I took a six month break since then to focus on school, and have picked up Overwatch again in the last month. Unfortunately, I've found myself hardstuck in high platinum, and after thinking it was just rust I was shaking off, I managed to place in plat 2 in the new season, indicating that I may need to reevaluate my gameplay. (And, needless to say, was pretty discouraging) In order to reach my goal of Masters+, I've set a six month deadline to work and improve my play (the end of my school's winter holiday). I can play roughly for 1.5-2 hours every day, so I figure this is doable. This replay is of a loss on Route 66. We were pretty effortlessly rolled up until the third point, but I chalk most of that final hold up to defender's advantage. We managed to come back and fight our way to meet the enemy at 3-3. We attacked first, as we had one minute less to work with. We were full held, which I believe is mostly my fault, as I failed to position correctly before the second fight, and held my ult for too long when I should have responded to the copy. In the end, we fought as hard as we could, but we were bested. I'm requesting a VOD review because I have little experience in the higher ranks, and would like a personalized opinion on how I can practice to take my gameplay to that level again. Replay Code: 9JCX2F Battletag: Shiba Heroes: Ashe, Cassidy Skill tier: Plat 4-Diamond 5",

      "content_preview": "My mom wants to play Overwatch with me, but she’s never really played shooters before. Her only FPS experience is a tiny bit of Fortnite, and… well, let’s just say aiming wasn’t her strong suit. Right now her biggest struggles are: She can’t aim at all (even with heroes that don’t really need much aim). She always stands completely still during fights. She has no idea what’s going on or what she’s supposed to do. I suggested she try Moira since she’s low-aim, but we still end up with games where she finishes with something like 50 damage / 6 healing total. One extra complication: I can’t really explain what buttons she should press because she’s on PS4 and I’m on Xbox and I’ve also completely rebound my controls, so my button layout is totally different from hers. Any tips on: How to teach her movement + aiming at the same time? Beginner-friendly drills or modes to get her familiar with the basics? Any other heroes better suited for absolute beginners? I want her to actually have fun, not just get lost in the chaos every match. Would love advice from anyone who’s taught a total beginner before.",

      "content_preview": "I'm new to overwatch (new as in literally like 30 minutes on the game) and I come from Valorant, so my aim is really good. But compared to Valorant, the agents in this game are extremely confusing. I queued all roles, got tank, selected the scottish guy, and got absolutely decimated. I don't know if the character is awful or if he's just not a beginner character, but dear god It was bad. I played another game and got DPS, selected the cyborg girl with the railgun (sandy I think? I forgot her name im sorry 😭) and it went significantly better, I still got lost a lot and didn't really understand my abilities, but I was able to hit my shots and at least not be a burden. So my question is, what characters are bad for beginners? I don't wanna be limited to just point and click characters because I installed the game to get a break from valorant which is basically exclusively aim. I wanna play more unique characters, but It's very overwhelming and I don't wanna develop bad habits. Any help is appreciated",

I wanted to collect every skin and cosmetic I could, so I linked all my social media accounts and platforms to claim the free rewards. But the moment I did that, everything was gone. All of my progress from Overwatch 1 hundreds of hours across different heroes, all my skins, and even my in-game currency completely disappeared. It was like my account got wiped and replaced with a brand-new one. The weirdest part is that my username stayed the same, almost like they just wanted me to start over. This happened a couple of months after Overwatch 2's launch, and ever since, it’s been really hard to enjoy the game. I still love Overwatch, but losing everything I earned and worked so hard for in OW1 makes it incredibly demotivating to even open the game. I’ve tried everything: submitting tickets, posting on the forums, and even asking for help on the Discord server, but no luck. It’s been like this for years now, and this is honestly my final cry for help. If anyone reading this has any idea what might have happened or knows how I can recover my progress, I would be forever grateful. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",

      "content_preview": "As the title says, i think hanzo is a really strong dps character overall, he has high damage output and because his damage is in big bursts instances of damage, so armour doesnt affect him as much as it does for most other dps characters. I also see a lot of people complaining about freja and soj being broken for having a form of high burst damage, then why is hanzo not more meta? hanzo literally has a primary fire that does as much damage as a full charge rail from soj. I would argue that mobility is not that much of an issue either, as he has wall climb to give him verticality to get to high ground off angles. his lunge is kind of like freja's dash which doesnt really give provide much defensive capabilities anyways. Again, why is he viewed as inferior? his sonic hack health pack perk also gives him more utility which is actually quite effective against characters who live off the health packs such as ball tracer, sombra etc. may some of you educate me as i think a good hanzo is just as good, if not better than the current meta of soj and freja at similar skill levels. The only main argument i understand of why he isnt good is because of his ult, where it can be inconsistent in finding value and is a hard ability to use in general.",

You'll be able to draft any Hero you'd like, even if the enemy team has already selected them. 1/4 We’re grateful to everyone who tried it out and shared feedback. As a team, one of our goals is to make the game that you want to play. This involves listening, responding, and taking those desires into account. Thank you for all the feedback! Keep it coming. We’re listening. 2/4 Additional rambling if you’re interested. The team is still invested in creating new and unique features for Overwatch. While we are listening we still love to surprise and delight. Sometimes that means releasing an amazing new experience for the game, like Stadium. 3/4 But it also introduces risk and means not everything is just right each time. That doesn’t mean we’ll stop trying to innovate, but that we’ll adapt and iterate as quick as we can when something doesn’t land the way we want. 4/4 So all the whining worked. Way to go, and I mean that sincerely. Blizzard does pay attention!  So enjoy playing your favorite heroes once again.",

The Bronze 1 player was clearly new, they were our other support and only managed 1k damage and 2k healing by the end of the match and were constantly getting stomped (we lost because of it). Not only do I feel bad for them and our team but I feel guilty for not being able to carry everyone else. I played Mercy and had 17k healing by the time we lost, the most in the match across both teams and I was flying around the map healing everyone the entire time.

      "content_preview": "I understand that both of these things are generally good, but I don't really understand how to do it on Dva witout her having a lot of good ranged damage. I can see it being useful to make dives easier, but that leads into another thing I tend to have trouble with, which are teams that are closely grouped together. My typical playstyle with Dva is to shoot at what I can in front of me, try to find a good target to dive onto, and either pick off members of their team afterwards or retreat back to my team to help them or get help myself. However, when a team is closely grouped together, if I dive (even if I think they're far enough to get a good pick on), it's basically just a death sentence because 3-4 of them will quickly focus on me and then I'm demeched and quickly killed off on baby. I've seen some people say in a general sense that against these types of teams high ground and angles are an easy way to get picks and kill them off, but I don't know what exactly I'd be able to do with that on Dva. Would seeing a team like that be a sign that I should swap to a different character or even switch to a different playstyle? If it's the ladder, what kind of playstyle would I even swap to? Btw I would appreciate some sort of help with both issues, which are how to take angles/high ground normally and how to deal with grouped up teams. I've watched some vod reviewers on Dva and I typically see them say to take high ground but I don't remember hearing them say what to do with it. I understand that taking high ground is generally good to take space from the enemy team, but with Dva having little ranged damage idk what she's supposed to do with it.",

      "content_preview": "Like the title states, i’m a Tracer one-trick that has peaked M3 and has been M5-M4 ever since. I’ve been playing on and off since S3 of OW1, I usually come back to the game for a few months out of the year. When I do play, it’s always for about a season, then the following seasons placements and that’s it. The reason for playing periodically isn’t because I don’t enjoy the game itself, but rather the discouragement after reaching a certain point in ranked where i’m no longer having fun. As a Tracer player, I like to think that i’m skilled enough to compete where i’m at and above. What holds me back from climbing is obviously my lack of game sense in a few areas, and the inability to flex and provide even half the value that I could on Tracer. In the lower ends of masters I really have no trouble, but when I reach a point of where opposing teams have a genuine understanding of the game and know how to counter a player like me, I find it difficult to provide any value in some games where both teams know Tracer isn’t the most valuable pick. These situations become more frequent in the higher elo games that I play and while it’s not every game, some can be straight up demoralizing. Eventually I find myself hesitant to play competitive because I don’t want to find myself being hard-countered and have my team discover I can’t play any other hero relatively well. At this point I usually go to quick play to improve on other heroes, but also feel conflicted because if I spent that time in comp I may genuinely improve and learn how to play around counters on Tracer. I’ve come here to ask for any advice on my situation, because I’m genuinely torn between just playing the game casually or taking the time to improve at the risk of costing games and feeling horrible about it.

      "content_preview": "I strongly recommend reading this from the Google doc HERE . It covers MANY omitted sections due to post size limits like 1v1 hero-specific matchups, which heroes to copy, playing with Mercy pocket, maps, practice advice, and more. It is also a nicer reading experience, especially on desktop browsers or the Google doc app. TLDR: I yap about Echo, a versatile DPS with excellent burst damage and mobility that has poke, dive, or assassin playstyles. Practice mechanics, learn good positioning/timing, and be mindful of your counters for success. Introduction Hello, my name is Zintel. I'm a Grandmaster Top 500 damage/support player who mostly plays Echo, Kiriko, and Ana on PC. Echo stood out to me because she doesn’t rely on raw aim but still demands strong mechanics and game sense to get value. She’s a flexible hero with a high skill ceiling, which makes her incredibly fun to play and master. This overly detailed guide is for people who like reading too much and are new to Echo or are looking to climb with her. Most of this is based on my own experience playing a ton of Echo, so feel free to provide feedback for improvements. The details are oriented towards PC players, but most advice could be applied to console platforms as well. This guide was written in Season 17. Hopefully you will find this useful or at least learn something new! Abilities Tri-Shot (Left Click) Echo's primary fire is tri-shot, which launches three projectiles in a triangular spread. Each projectile deals 17 damage, for a total of 51 damage (~151 DPS). These are fast-moving projectiles (75 m/s). Aim for headshots at close range where all three projectiles are more likely to land. At longer ranges, aim for center mass. The spread makes headshots unreliable since there's no projectile aligned with the center of your crosshair. For very slippery enemies with difficult-to-hit strafing patterns (Tracer, Sojourn, etc), you can optionally aim for the legs at close range. Most heroes’ legs will shift less than their head/torso during side-to-side strafing. Tri-shots can be fired by continuously holding down the primary attack key or by individually clicking every shot. Echo’s medium-fast weapon fire rate means that both modes are reasonable and up to preference. I personally click individual shots for improved accuracy and only hold the attack input when breaking barriers or spamming at a distance. Tri-shot is heavily affected by armor. Each projectile is reduced by 7 damage, dropping the total per tri-shot to 30 damage. You don’t want to be shooting a fortified Orisa by yourself. There is no damage falloff, so poke at enemies and barriers from a distance at the start of a teamfight to soften them up and farm ult charge. Sticky Bombs (Right Click) Sticky bombs are on a 6-second cooldown. Echo fires a burst of 6 bombs in a straight line. They stick to enemies, barriers, or map geometry. Each sticky deals 5 damage on impact (cannot headshot) and 25 explosion damage after 1 second, for a total of 180 damage. Stickies are medium-speed projectiles (50m/s). Stickies are slower than tri-shots, so you’ll need to lead your shots more. Stickies also have a large projectile size, which makes them easier to land on slippery heroes compared to tri-shots at close range. The tip to aim for legs also applies here, especially since stickies cannot headshot, and missed stickies are more likely to deal splash damage in this case. They have a short cooldown so use them often to build ultimate charge. They're great for applying poke damage pressure. Think of them like a Zenyatta volley with no charge up time. Stickies are Echo’s main burst tool. They take the same time to fire as one tri-shot but deal more than triple the damage. You can be more confident taking duels when you have stickies. Unlike many other explosives in the game, stickies don’t have explosive damage fall off. As long as the enemy is within a sticky’s 2m explosive radius, they will take the full 25 explosive damage. This means stickies stuck on ground can be deceptively lethal. You can sometimes use stickies as a soft area denial tool to delay an enemy push/retreat similar to a ticking Ashe dynamite. Once stuck with stickies, many heroes will use cooldowns that can mitigate stickies damage like ice block, fade, wraith, or even Cassidy roll. At lower ranks, players often use their defensive cooldowns too early so it’s easy to go in with stickies afterwards. As you climb, it gets harder to bait out these abilities. Often it's worth using stickies to trade for a longer or more important cooldown, like suzu or recall. Focusing Beam (E) Focusing beam is on an 8-second cooldown and lasts up to 2 seconds (can be canceled early). It has a medium range of 16 meters, which is longer than Zarya/Symmetra beams but shorter than Moira grasp. It deals a continuous 75 DPS to enemies above half health, and 175 DPS to enemies below half health (comparable to a high energy Zarya or Symmetra beam). Beam should only be used on enemies with less than half health. If the target is above half, it does too little damage and you're better off canceling the ability early and shooting tri-shots instead. Beam adds finishing consistency to Echo’s kit. It acts like a pseudo hitscan attack so you don’t have to deal with the inconsistency of landing the finishing tri-shots on low health targets. Beam is also quite wide (0.25m) so it is more forgiving than any other hitscan attack. This gives you a massive advantage in duels against projectile-only heroes and helps even the odds against hitscans at close to medium range. Like other beam weapons, it bypasses some mitigation abilities like D.Va matrix, Genji deflect, Sigma grasp, and Orisa spin. This is especially valuable since these heroes often use those abilities when they’re on low health which triggers the bonus beam damage. At lower ranks, you can catch these heroes off guard when they overextend, expecting to survive with their defensive cooldowns. Beam also deals 175 DPS to barriers that are below half health. However, tri-shots already do 151 DPS and are easy to land on barriers. Personally I think it’s better to save beam for securing kills where aim consistency matters. The exception is when both the barrier and enemy are low health so that a single beam use will kill the target after breaking the barrier. Armor health reduces beam damage by 30%, but this is largely irrelevant since no hero has armor once they’re below half health except in exceptional cases. Beam deals 200 DPS to targets below half health in 6v6 mode, so it is slightly more lethal there. Flight (Shift) Flight allows Echo to freely fly for 3 seconds on a 6-second cooldown. While in flight, Echo moves about 45% faster than her normal movement speed. This is Echo’s most important cooldown, and managing it well is a major source of skill expression. I recommend using hold-to-use flight at least on PC. Most top Echo players use this setting. It makes it easier to cancel flight early and perform movement techniques like flight dashes. While in flight, holding jump ascends and holding crouch descends. However, I almost never use crouch during flight since I have hold-to-use flight on the shift key. I think the benefits of hold-to-use flight outweigh the inability to easily descend during flight with crouch. As a side note, very new Echo players sometimes awkwardly aim upwards to ascend rather than just holding jump. Practice always keeping your aim on your targets while flying. At the start of flight, you get a burst of speed before quickly decelerating to your base flight speed after about half a second. This extra speed is extremely useful for diving targets and reactively dodging enemy abilities. A flight dash is done by activating flight and immediately canceling it. With hold-to-use flight enabled, you can simply tap your flight key. This gives Echo a dash-like ability similar to Genji or Venture. You can control the direction with movement input, like a Tracer blink. Holding jump before doing the dash adds significant vertical height, which combines nicely with gliding to dramatically increase your overall airtime. Flight's cooldown starts only after the duration ends or it’s canceled early. Learn to cancel flight early when you don’t need it anymore since it helps you get the cooldown back sooner. This could make the difference in not missing a dive opportunity or being able to escape from danger. Flight dash is useful since it starts the cooldown immediately. While on cooldown, flight can be buffered by holding the flight key so that it is immediately used when it becomes available. This is useful when you are gliding off a cliff waiting for your flight cooldown to avoid an environmental death for example. Flight is a powerful engagement ability. You're as fast as a sprinting Soldier and can still attack and use offensive abilities. Use it to dive isolated supports or chase down targets like Sojourn sliding away or Winston jumping out. Timing offensive flight usage is also important. The general guide is avoiding the situation where your flight duration ends at the beginning of a duel. You want to start close enough that you are actively flying while fighting. This helps you deal with heroes that have mobility options to escape otherwise. Flight is also a strong disengagement ability. When you have flight available you can take riskier forward positions. It’s tricky to articulate when to use flight to engage and when to save it when moving into position for a teamfight in case you need to disengage. In some aspects, it's similar to Reaper wraith where you don’t want to waste it getting into range if you need it to escape later. Whenever possible, land on high ground at the end of your flight. This gives you a better position and more options for your next flight usage. While in flight, your movement has significant inertial drag. You are not able to strafe as sharply as someone like Juno (even after her glide boost strafing nerf), so it’s easier for hitscan to hit you. While you’re not as vulnerable as Pharah, still try to avoid flying in the open against hitscan. Instead hug cover or fly further away outside of the enemy hitscan’s effective range. Glide (Passive) Glide is Echo’s passive ability that lets her descend slowly by holding jump. While gliding, Echo moves 50% faster horizontally than her normal movement speed. Echo’s glide passive is much stronger than all other flyers' (like Pharah, Juno, or Mercy) since she moves at roughly the same horizontal speed as during flight. Gliding is a key part of what makes flight dash so powerful. A jumping flight dash followed by gliding gives you around 5 seconds of airtime. By the time you touch the ground, your flight is basically back off cooldown. Gliding on rooftops slows down your descent slightly, which further extends your airtime. Glide is loud. Be aware that enemies can hear you clearly if you're gliding near them. This is particularly important to remember when trying to flank. Conversely, free falling is silent, so consider letting go of glide when dropping down to assassinate a backline support. However, free falling also means that your flight has less time to come off cooldown compared to gliding down onto your target so you may be at disadvantage during the duel. The right balance depends on the situation. Avoid gliding in the open against hitscan. You also want to avoid simply free falling to safety when you’re caught out in the open, since you’ll follow a predictable trajectory downwards. Instead, repeatedly tap jump to alternate between gliding and falling to make your descent more erratic. You can also combine this with facing down and backwards to partially obscure your head hitbox for best results, particularly against Widow. Duplicate (Q) Duplicate allows Echo to copy an enemy hero for up to 15 seconds. You start the transformation with the full health of the copied hero, up to a maximum of 350 HP. While duplicated, Echo builds charge towards the target’s ultimate much faster than normal. You revert back to Echo when the copy ends, either by running out of HP or the timer expiring. Upon reverting, your health returns to its pre copy amount with a minimum value of 112 (half of Echo’s max health). Role passives are copied but perks are not. Duplicate is a versatile ultimate. Use it for a variety of purposes: Strong enemy ultimate : copy a hero with the goal of building their ultimate and using it to win the fight. Strong enemy cooldowns : copy a hero for their strong abilities like Ana nade or occasionally Mercy rez. Since you start copy with the abilities available, you can get immediate guaranteed value from them without having to build ult. Second life : use copy like a glorified Winston ult. You essentially have three lives in this way since the enemy has to force your copy, kill you during copy, and then kill you again after you revert to Echo. This tankiness allows you to make riskier plays and control more space for your team. Cooldown refresh : use copy to have immediate access to the target’s abilities. In this case, you’ll use all your Echo abilities, and then copy an enemy for a fresh set of cooldowns to overwhelm them. It’s difficult for most squishies to survive flight + stickies + beam followed by nade + sleep. When you transform back, you’ll likely have your Echo abilities off cooldown again too. Invulnerability frame : use copy for the brief half-second of intangibility you get while transforming. When timed correctly, you’ll take no damage at all similar to being hit with Kiriko suzu. You can use this to completely negate a short instance of burst damage like D.Va self destruct or Tracer pulse bomb. This can also be used to dodge telegraphed abilities like Rein shatter, Roadhog hook, Ana sleep, or Sigma flux. Use copy often. It builds fast, so there’s no need to hold it for the perfect moment. Even without the ult copying aspect, copy is very strong for duels with its cooldown refresh, second life, and invulnerability frame. You’ll win most duels against any single non-tank hero even if they have their ult too (excluding self-sustaining support ults). A small advantage like this is often enough to win a teamfight. Echo becomes a significant threat during copy. You’ll likely draw the focus of the entire enemy team as they try to stop you from building your copy target’s ult. Even if you don’t survive the entire copy duration, this still gives your team valuable space/time. For example, imagine your Rein is backpedaling while holding his shield on low health. If you copy the enemy tank, you can demand enough enemy attention and absorb enough pressure to allow your supports to save your Rein. You cannot copy through enemy barriers, so be careful about Zarya bubbles or Rein shield. This is especially important to remember when using copy as a second life or for the invulnerability frame. Duplicating will cleanse all your debuffs when you transform into your clone and when you transform back into Echo. Unfortunately, you’ll also lose buffs like nano boost. When you get nano, continue fighting in Echo form and don’t use copy immediately to avoid completely wasting it. You can also communicate with your Ana to apply nano after you transform with copy. Some ultimate effects end immediately when the copy expires, while others linger for some time. I’ll cover these differences in the duplicate targets section. During copy, your Echo abilities are coming off cooldown in the background. If you survive long enough in copy form, your Echo abilities will be available once you revert back. If possible, try to use your abilities before using copy for maximum value. There’s a very brief casting delay during which you can be stunned or killed. Fortunately, you’ll never lose your ult charge if the initial copy cast fails, so don’t worry about potentially wasting your ult when using it as a second life. Sadly, you cannot copy another Echo. I would if I could. Perks NOTE: Minor perks are being replaced with Focused Beam and Partial Imaging in Season 18. Full Salvo major perk will also be buffed to not reduce stickies damage. I’ll provide some tentative opinions on these new changes. Friendly Imaging (Old Minor Perk) Friendly Imaging minor perk allows Echo to copy allies. I personally think this perk is situational, and I almost never take it. This obviously works better when you have teammates that are strong copy targets. However, there are so many good copy targets in the game, and the practical differences between them are fairly negligible. You’ll rarely be in a situation where all five enemy copy choices are poor enough to justify coordinating a specific copy target with a teammate using this perk. Also since I often use my copy as a second life while I am actively fighting an enemy, I typically don’t go searching around for a teammate to copy midfight. Enhanced Duplication (Old Minor Perk) Enhanced Duplication minor perk extends Echo’s copy duration by 3 seconds when you use your clone’s ultimate for the first time. This perk is quite useful, and I always take this. Often, you’ll find that you finish building the clone ult near the end of the 15 second copy duration. This alleviates the issue with some long-lasting ult effects or channeled ults that end immediately when copy expires (Ana nano, Lucio beat, Sojourn overclock, Soldier visor, etc.) and makes copying certain heroes for their ult more viable. Focused Beam (New Minor Perk) Focused Beam minor perk increases beam range by 4 meters (total range of 20 meters) and increases Echo’s movement speed by 10%. On paper, this seems like it would be fairly useful, and certainly much better than the old Friendly Imaging perk. The extra speed and range enhances your ability to chase kills on mobile targets. There is also some synergy with the High Beams flight reset major perk. The only minor concern is that Echo operates best at either close or far distances rather than the medium range that this perk covers. Nevertheless, this is a significant range buff, and it should give her a better matchup against hitscan DPS who generally have a large advantage over Echo at such distances. If nothing else, the very minor speed boost can help you leave spawn ever so slightly faster. Partial Imaging (New Minor Perk) Partial Imaging minor perk allows Echo to start with 50% of the clone ultimate when using copy. This sounds like a strong perk, and I can see myself taking this quite often. It is definitely a significant improvement over the previous Enhanced Duplication perk. Since you’ll be able to build ult faster, this still alleviates the issue with some long lasting ults that end immediately when copy expires (Ana nano, Lucio beat, Sojourn overclock, Soldier visor, etc.). This also makes it much more reasonable to use duplicate for copying an impactful ult rather than just for strong abilities or survival. I imagine some slow-building, but fight winning ultimates (e.g., support ults) will be more viable. Full Salvo Full Salvo major perk allows Echo to shoot 9 stickies that deal 15% less damage individually. The reduced damage only applies to the explosive part of the stickies. Therefore each bomb does 5 impact damage + 21.25 explosive damage for a total of ~236 damage (+56 damage compared to 180 total without the perk). This translates to +31% damage overall (+23% damage against armor). In Season 18, this perk simply allows Echo to shoot 9 stickies without any damage reduction for +50% damage overall. This is a strong perk, and I almost always take this. With the upcoming buff, this will be an even clearer choice. Your stickies now deal damage comparable to a fully charged Zenyatta volley, and the additional burst damage dramatically improves your odds in duels especially when your enemy is receiving healing. For comparison, imagine how much more deadly Soldier would be in a fight with helix rockets dealing +31% more damage (~160 damage vs normal 120), which is an ability with a similar cooldown. Some people find the reduced individual sticky damage off-putting, but I assure you the additional stickies more than makes up for it in nearly every realistic situation. The extra total damage also helps you build ult faster. A small detail is that the stickies now take 50% longer to shoot since the fire rate is unchanged. This may affect your combo timings, but it is quite minor once you get accustomed to it. High Beams High Beams major perk grants Echo a flight reset whenever you get an elimination with focusing beam. The cooldown reset actually triggers whenever you get elimination credit for any enemy (i.e., dealt any damage to them within ~5 seconds of their death) that you have also hit with beam at some point in the last ~8 seconds. For example, you’ll get the reset in the following scenario: you graze someone with beam, you hit them with a tri-shot 3 seconds later, then your teammate deals the final blow an additional 5 seconds later. If you are actively using flight when the elimination happens, you have flight available again immediately once it ends. I think this is a solid perk, however I rarely take this over Full Salvo. The reset window is pretty generous, but sometimes you secure a kill with beam before using flight which makes the perk pointless. I’ve watched several VODs where the Echo player only gets real value out of the reset just once or twice in an entire game, especially when they are already on the losing side where less eliminations are happening. This perk would be much better if it grants a temporary free use of flight instead, akin to Freja’s Ready to Hunt major perk. Nevertheless, it does allow Echo to proactively commit flight to assassinate a target before quickly disengaging. This involves trying a new playstyle which can be tricky to get full value out of compared to Full Salvo which always provides consistent upside. If you play Genji and are comfortable with dash resets, you may get better results with this perk. Note that there is a helpful audio cue when the reset happens. Who to Copy? See the Google doc for specific hero details! There are certain qualities that make for a strong copy target. In Season 4, the ult charge build rate during duplicate was nerfed in exchange for a much lower cost for duplicate itself. This makes it reasonable to use duplicate for purposes other than copying a strong ultimate. In order of most to least important, the general factors I consider when deciding on an optimal copy target are: High kill potential Personal hero preference Survival or self-sustaining abilities Fast-building ult Impactful ult With the upcoming Partial Imaging minor perk, it becomes much easier to build the clone ult. Tentatively, I believe the new order when using this perk is: High kill potential Impactful ult Personal hero preference Survival or self sustaining abilities Fast-building ult Most heroes are fairly straightforward copy targets. Prioritize securing kills by aggressively using offensive abilities and be mindful with defensive cooldowns to prolong your copy. Though not always necessary, surviving long enough to use your clone’s ult is a nice bonus. Every hero is an acceptable copy target if you just need a second life to avoid losing a teamfight. General Playstyles Some playstyle sections in the Google doc were omitted here. Poke Echo The first playstyle to cover is poke Echo. This revolves around taking long range fights and whittling down enemies at a distance. Echo does decently in this setting thanks to her stickies and lack of damage falloff. Your goal is to draw out enemy resources, build ult charge for the impending fight, and punish positional mistakes. Given these objectives, the Full Salvo perk with extra stickies suits this playstyle better than High Beams flight resets. Use stickies liberally while in the poke phase. Ideally apply pressure from an off-angle, which refers to shooting at enemies from a different position than the core of our team. It is much harder to shield off, take cover from, counter attack, and just mentally juggle damage coming in from multiple directions. This increases the value of your damage since it now has a higher chance of forcing your opponents to use defensive cooldowns or even securing a pick. A simple tactic when fighting on linear map segments that lack good flank routes is to fly very high upwards above your own team and shoot down at the enemy diagonally. You can also glide on rooftops to extend your airtime. While not perfect, this creates a makeshift soft off-angle that is better than stacking with the rest of your team. You can shoot over some barriers, and you force enemies to split their attention/resources between you and your allies on the ground (e.g., Ashe cannot dynamite both you and your team as you all push through a chokepoint). Make sure to still play near cover while doing this (e.g., hug the side of a building). Contrary to some beliefs in mid ranks, there are absolutely situations when the best play is to focus the tank. Do not misconstrue this as advice to mindlessly shoot the tank though. The majority of the time, you can get more value poking the backline or contesting enemy DPS since armor heavily reduces your damage against many tanks. That said, it is partially your job to ensure that the enemy tanks’ positioning or cooldown usage mistakes don’t go unpunished (e.g., Zarya that is overextended without bubbles or Orisa without fortify that you can kill through javelin spin using beam). Poke the enemy tank to prevent them from taking space freely and apply the DPS role passive healing debuff. At the end of the day, follow what your team is doing. Try to not be the only one shooting a safe tank or the only one not helping focus down a mispositioned one. Dive Echo My favorite playstyle is dive Echo. This involves capitalizing on strong mobility and verticality to control high ground and punish mispositioned enemies. The goal is to surgically overwhelm a weak target often as part of a coordinated, close-range attack with your team. Both the Full Salvo and High Beams perks are complimentary to diving, but I still prefer the increased lethality that the extra stickies offer over flight resets that are only granted after your target is already eliminated. Mastering flight usage is essential for successful dives. In a close range duel, Echo is harder to hit when free flying compared to air gliding or walking. You want to maximize the amount of time you spend actively flying during a dive. Therefore, try starting your flight as close to your dive target as reasonably possible. This means using flank routes and cover to first approach the enemy without using flight. Keep in mind that flight gives you around 30 meters of active travel distance over the full three second duration, so plan accordingly. Once you are within the proper engagement distance, dive your target and burst them down with your stickies and beam. In cases when the enemy has defensive cooldowns (e.g, immortality field, suzu, defensive ults), committing to a full dive could result in your own death after you burn through your abilities. Instead, first do a soft dive where you don’t commit as deeply with your flight to ensure that you can glide back to safety once you’ve forced out enemy cooldowns with stickies/beam. Since your own abilities have short cooldowns, you’ll have a second chance to commit to a full dive before they fully regain their composure. Another key idea is to time your engagements so that the individual outputs of you and your teammates combine constructively. Think of your opponents as having a predefined bandwidth to accommodate incoming pressure (i.e., defensive cooldowns). A proper dive creates a pressure spike that overwhelms weak points in the enemy defenses. Timing is the difference between steamrolling and feeding. Have you ever been in a scenario where your team loses a fight even though you were distracting 2-3 players on the backline? It was likely due to poor timing causing your distractions to be ineffective and easily handled. Ideally, your tank sets the pace for dives. Watch your tank closely and follow their lead when they commit to going in (e.g., Winston jumps in, Hammond piledrives, Doomfist slams). Use the space they create to put out more valuable pressure. Assassin Echo The final playstyle is assassin Echo. This involves exploiting the element of surprise to secure picks or force out resources with your burst damage. The goal is to swing a teamfight by eliminating a key target without dying. While there are similar elements to dive Echo, this assassin playstyle is better characterized by crafty positioning and solo plays. While this approach works in all ranks, its effectiveness tapers off as your opponents become more attentive. Both the Full Salvo and High Beams major perks work well in this context for improved burst damage and safer disengagement, respectively. Echo’s mobility allows you to take long flank routes or fly over rooftops that lets you approach the backline indirectly without being seen (e.g. wrapping around the cliff slide or over the roofs of Colosseo). A less reliable alternative is to simply fly extremely high when turning a corner to stay outside of their peripheral vision. Even in high ranks, people often fail to notice someone flying above them. While Echo doesn’t have footsteps, she still has an audible mechanical whirr that only goes away when crouch walking. Also be aware that gliding is very loud, so consider free falling onto your target once you are close enough to maintain the element of surprise. The trade off is that this leaves you less time for the next flight to come off cooldown. Your success hinges on the massive advantage you get from ambushing an unaware enemy with a full set of stickies. Most squishies will die quickly if caught off guard without strong defensive abilities. In cases when they do have abilities to survive, it is still often worthwhile to ambush them to force out those abilities/ults to set up for the next fight. You can also apply the principles of proper timing here to circumvent this issue. Instead of focusing the same target as your tank like in dive, you simply attempt the solo assassination at the same time your tank disrupts the frontline. Your enemies won’t have enough defensive abilities to protect everyone. Lastly, always have an escape plan in mind. You cannot expect supports to bail you out when you are deep in the backline on a solo assasination mission. A successful kill doesn’t mean much for your team if you also die in the process unless your team has advantageous spawns. Usually, this means either having flight to dash to safety or having copy for a second life. Seek out healthpacks to sustain yourself. Like all DPS heroes, your health starts regenerating after 6 seconds of not taking damage. You also have shield health that begins regenerating after just 3 seconds, which significantly improves your downtime. Hitscan Counters Inevitably, you will face hitscan DPS at some point in your Echo journey. While there are many DPS heroes that have instantaneous bullet registration, there are five that substantially influence Echo’s playstyle in a similar way: Ashe, Cassidy, Sojourn, Soldier, and Widow. Their common theme is highly consistent hitscan lethality at medium range. Other DPS heroes usually lack one or more of these qualities which make them comparatively less threatening to you (e.g., Freja/Hanzo lack the consistency to suppress flyers due to their projectile travel time, Bastion lacks damage in recon form, and Reaper/Sombra/Tracer lack range). When going against the main hitscan heroes, there are three simple principles: stay in your optimal range, avoid their optimal range, and mind their cooldowns. First, let’s first illustrate Echo’s optimal range. Your lethality tapers off as you move further from your target due to the travel time of your tri-shots and stickies. Your kill potential also drops off sharply once your target is outside of beam range at 16 meters. While you maintain effectiveness at long ranges better than most heroes, you are still deadlier the closer you are to your target. You can see how far you are away from an enemy by pinging them. Your optimal range is only half of the story. Like Echo, hitscan heroes’ lethality also tapers off at longer distances, though due to damage falloff rather than projectile travel time. Each hitscan has different distances for their falloff, but they generally fall down to dealing 30% of their base damage (Sojourn railgun and Widow fall down to 50%). Unlike Echo however, hitscans don’t become noticeably more deadly at point-blank range, barring any abilities. This is because their damage stays consistent inside of their falloff range, and it isn’t significantly easier to kill a target at 5m vs 15m when your bullets hit instantly. In fact, hitscans like Ashe and Widow (and Soldier to a lesser extent) have a harder time landing shots at very close range against mobile targets. Lastly, the availability of cooldowns affects matchups as well. Luckily, a weakness of these hitscan heroes is that they lack strong defensive abilities to properly handle Echo’s burst damage compared to something like Reaper wraith or Mei ice block. You still have to consider mobility options like Ashe coach gun or Sojourn slide, but these are generally easier to work around. Hitscans are also much less deadly when their abilities are on cooldown like Cassidy flashbang and Soldier helix rockets. Conversely, Sojourn with a charged railgun is virtually uncontestable for Echo. Pay attention to your enemies’ abilities when timing your engagements. In general, either poke at hitscans from outside of their effective range or dive them at very close ranges with stickies and beam. Most maps have enough flank routes for you to stay out of line of sight when traversing the middle zone. Note that while playing near cover will not prevent you from being one-shotted, it will keep you from being two-shotted. When preparing to dive, save your flight until you are close enough to jump the target and be actively flying during the duel (i.e., don’t waste flight moving closer while already in cover if it’s not necessary). Attacking with your tank in a coordinated dive yields the best results since they will draw focus away from you. The main takeaway is that every hitscan hero has some exploitable ranges where Echo can be favored in the duel (or at least not significantly disadvantaged). Use your mobility to take fights at these distances. Often, an opponent that blindly switches to hitscan just to counter Echo will perform poorly and make more exploitable mistakes due to their inexperience with these heroes (e.g. their Cassidy might not correctly mitigate your stickies damage with combat roll). While main hitscan DPS are your biggest counters, the matchup is not hopelessly one-sided. Assorted Tips and Advice Some tips sections in the Google doc were omitted here. Execution Combo Using any of Echo’s abilities immediately after shooting a tri-shot will animation cancel the tri-shot without any delay to the ability. Therefore, you should always shoot a tri-shot before using stickies or beam with very few exceptions (animation cancelling with copy is less important). This free tri-shot essentially turns your stickies into a 180 + 51 = 231 burst damage ability (236 + 51 = 287 with Full Salvo perk). You can’t always aim for both projectiles while animation cancelling since stickies travel slower than tri-shots. Therefore, you should just aim for the stickies’ projectile speed since that does more damage. Any tri-shots that happen to land would just be a nice bonus. The standard execution sequence at close range is tri-shot > stickies > tri-shot > beam. Since stickies have a delayed explosion, you’ll have a half-second to decide if you should follow through with the beam depending on how many stickies connect in the first part of the combo. Combine this with flight to make yourself harder to hit and to chase down mobile enemies for the follow-up beam. If you whiff most of the stickies, do not follow up with beam since the target won’t be low enough to trigger the bonus damage. Similarly, if you land almost every sticky on a squishy that isn’t actively receiving support, consider if you even need to pop beam to secure the kill. There is a sweet middle ground where you’ll want to preemptively commit beam so that the beam hits around the same time the stickies explode, which will vaporize most squishies. If you’re unsure however, it’s better to “waste” beam than to miss out on an elimination. Do not prematurely commit beam if you are fighting someone that may have self invulnerability abilities to react to your stickies like Kiriko suzu. Flight Dash Flight dash is a key movement tech for Echo that involves activating and immediately canceling flight. This gives Echo a quick burst of speed, much like a Tracer blink or Genji dash. It starts the cooldown for flight right away, allowing you to cycle it more efficiently if you don’t need the full 3 seconds of flight. Flight dash direction depends on your input. If you're not pressing any movement keys, you’ll dash toward your crosshair. But if you're holding a direction, you’ll dash in that direction instead, which feels similar to how Tracer’s blink works. By holding the jump key right before the dash, you can significantly increase your vertical distance. This jumping flight dash can also be done while gliding since you’re constantly holding the jump key already. The jumping flight dash is great for reaching high ground or quickly escaping low ground pressure. However, it isn’t always ideal. The extra height can cause you to overshoot your target or leave you exposed to hitscan fire. Instead, you can look upwards at an angle and flight dash without jumping to get less verticality. Use cover or keep outside hitscan effective range when opting for any vertical dashes since they briefly lock you into a relatively predictable path when compared to free flight. Flight dash also has a defensive use. Since you move so fast at the start, you’re hard to hit during the initial burst, making it a great tool to dodge telegraphed abilities like Roadhog hook or Orisa spear. That said, don’t mindlessly use flight dash. Wasting the flight ability can leave you stranded when you need the full free-flying flight duration to win a duel or chase an elimination.

      "content_preview": "If you look at the math on the primal rage perk that all of us Winston players have been pretty much auto locking since perks released...it's actually extremely weak compared to most other tank minors. In a real game it's only giving you around 15 to 30% more damage and area on the primal jump landings since you basically never go for huge hang time during primal. Your entire minor perk ends up equating to you dealing roughly 10 to 20 extra damage every 2 seconds from your leaps. Compare to Zarya minor for example that makes grav deal 40% of enemies full max HP over 3 seconds. It's pretty laughable. We get like ~10 extra DPS during ults. With the latest buff to now make Winston deal double damage vs barriers and deployed objects...I'm almost always taking this perk now. So many things become 10x easier with it, many of which were extremely frustrating previously for Winston players. Torb turrets die from 2 fully charged right clicks or 1.5sec of zapping. Illari pylons die from 1 right click and a little extra. If you dive Baptiste, his lamp evaporates in 1 second from your primary fire. Lifeweaver platforms die in 2 seconds (less if you also hit them from jump pack). Zarya bubbles are gone in a little over 1 second. I'd have to test this part for sure, but I think his chain lightning major perk also ends up dealing double damage if you right click a deployed structure and it chains onto a player. The Winston mirror becomes hilariously lopsided if the other Winston is still taking the primal rage perk, because your primary fire now deals the same DPS to his bubble as if a Dva was shooting it full time. Ditto for playing into Rein, Sigma, Orisa (w perk), Zarya. Yes you will charge the Zarya, from my exp a charged Zarya whose bubbles instantly evaporate when she tries to make plays is less dangerous than a low energy Zarya that is able to push hard with bubbles. Ramattra matchup is basically no different since people rarely ever try to shield break him. Your team will almost never be capable of nuking a 1000hp shield in under 4 seconds even if you're helping a lot. I usually just swap Mauga anyway vs Ram. Wrecking Ball minefields can be cleared by just walking through them full speed holding primary fire (0.4s to kill a mine) Brigitte shield deleted in under 2 seconds. Even during rally you're soloing her entire 700hp barrier in 5 seconds. Mei walls die in under 2 seconds. And then you're also doing a lot to help teams break cage fight (tell your team to shoot the cages), tree of life, Sym TP, etc. So yeah I've mostly swapped entirely now to this perk unless the enemy team is truly not looking like they're ever going to run any characters that build anything or use any shields...even then I still take it sometimes in case they make swaps.",

However the stat where there was a massive gap was my damage/10 min. They had around 11K/10 min and this season I've struggled to keep mine higher than 7K. I started playing some matches consciously focusing on uptime but it feels like unless I'm just behind the team spamming down main it's impossible to get numbers that high. When I'm flanking things either die or I'm eventually forced to rotate, but both lead to me having time with no shooting. So my question is, where is their extra damage coming from? What do top soldiers do differently that allows them to get consistently big damage?",

Description: This game I really felt like I did all I could, I felt like I played cover really well, positioned myself really well, did a good job keeping people alive, and when time called to be aggressive, I was aggressive. I am really just looking for any indication or tips on what exactly I could have done better to turn this game from a loss to a win, or atleast turn other similar games from losses to wins. I have gotten vod reviewed in the past quite a few times, and I also tend to keep up with educational content on OW, so I am pretty knowledgeable about the game, and I would say my mechanics are good. But I just cant place this loss, and similar losses I have experienced, on any specific thing. I really believe that there is some hidden knowledge barrier that is keeping me from top 500 that I have yet to unlock, my peak was masters 5. I would appreciate any help 🤍🫶",

      "content_preview": "New Trailer Mode Site Hey, y'all. It's Mabu. For the most of you who are unfamiliar, I'm a workshop creator. Some of you may have heard of my Hero Playground Mode EATXTT which makes the rounds on socials every now and then. Well, I'm back with a big update to my other main mode: APE76 Smart Skirmish. This post will serve as a reference and go into full detail of what the mode offers including all the new features from this update, but if you just want to get an idea of the mode, I recommend watching the trailer listed at the top. Overview Smart Skirmish is meant to be a one-stop shop for most things you want to practice. This mode originally started as just a low-cooldown skirmish mode for me to roll around in. Since then, I have been adding features whenever there is something new that I want to practice. APE76 is a free form practice mode built to help you train everything from aim to rollouts to set-nades. If you've ever wanted a place to \"run drills\" this mode provides you with a variety of tools to help you practice whatever you want. Each player is provided a dummy bot that they can place anywhere using interact (with a similar mechanic as Reaper's or Symm's TPs). Pressing your ping or any other communication will open a menu that provides you with additional functionality including damage and speed multipliers, a variety of standard and hero specific strafe animations, and hero specific tools and functions like a Winston Juggle counter, a Genji blade trainer, and Illari Pylon testing. Most importantly, this mode features a rollout mode for practicing complicated movements without having to manually reset your position every time and a grenade tool for testing trajectories. Controls Interact - Use interact to spawn dummy at chosen location. Ping/Any communication - Opens menu. Communicating while in menu will replace the menu in the direction the user is facing. Dev Comment: Careful not to spawn the menu into a wall! Primary fire - Next menu option Secondary fire - Last menu option Hold Crouch - Enables rollout or nade mode (depending on hero) if not active. If a tool is active, disables tool. In the case of the rollout tool, holding crouch additionally provides the option to set a new start point. Triple Tap Crouch - Resets user to rollout start NOTE: Bap, Ball, and Dva use Reload instead of crouch for these gestures. Features: Dummy Hold interact (F, square, x) to choose a dummy position. Release to place. Damaging dummy will increment a damage counter above the dummy's head. Dummy respawns after being eliminated Incorrect dummy placement will disable the auto respawn and will require you to replace the dummy as shown in the top left HUD. Dummy hero and strafe patterns can be chosen through the menu. Menu Communicating anything (Hello, Ping, Voiceline) will open a wheel menu. Primary fire will scroll to the next option. Secondary will move to the previous. Being in menu will lock you in place. Top - Mode Tools Enables tools for targeted practice. Turning on a tool will enable additional controls outlined in the HUD. Tool modes can also be activated by holding crouch. Which tool is enabled by holding crouch is based on which was deemed more useful for each hero. Ball, D.Va, and Bap use reload for these gestures. 0 - Off [∅ Icon] 1 - Rollout tool [Translocator Icon] When activated a start point will be set for the user. When the user eliminates the dummy, dies, or triple crouches, they will be reset to this start point. Hold crouch and then press either primary fire to select a new start point or secondary fire to leave rollout mode. Relevant heroes can turn on rollout mode by holding crouch. 2 - [NEW, BETA] Projectile tool [Anti-nade Icon] When active, camera will follow available projectiles to their landing spot. When active, tap crouch to change to an overhead view of dummy. Ability Options Ana Nade Ashe Dynamite Baptiste Lamp (same projectile as his heal nades) Bastion nade Illari Pylon Junkrat Primary Kiriko Suzu Mei Blizzard Queen Knife Ram Vortex Sigma Rock Torbjorn Molten Core Widow Venom Mine Zarya Grav (same projectile as her secondary) Dev Comment: There are a couple of limitations to this tool. In order to build this, I had to manually calculate the position of each ability using some projectile physics. This requires the additional calculation of variables not provided by blizzard including projectile gravity, speed, and a trajectory offset vector for each hero. The point being, not every projectile camera is perfect. There is also a workshop limitation right now that causes your camera to stop if your projectile passes through the skybox. I hope to find work arounds to both of these problems in the future. Top Right - Buffs Applies corresponding buff to your hero. 0 - 1x damage [1x] 1 - Nano Boost [Nano Icon] 2 - Blue Beam multiplier [Caduceus Staff Icon] 3 - Amplification Matrix multiplier [Amp Matrix Icon] 4 - [NEW] Speedboost [Crossfade Icon] 5 - [NEW] 0x damage [0x] NOTE: Speed boost is disabled when user is on Lucio. Right - Strafe Animations [NEW] No movement [\"No\" Icon] - Dummy will not move, even when displaced. [NEW] Linear [Linear Arrows]- Dummy will strafe side to side at random. Radial [Ring Icon] - Dummy will strafe randomly within a small range of its starting point. Standing [Stop Hand Icon] - Dummy will return to starting point if displaced Specialty/Jump [Various/Winston Leap Icon]- Hero specific movements. If selected hero doesn't have a specified movement, they will default to jumping back and forth. Ashe Coach gun - Coach guns directly upward Bap Exo Boots - Exo Boots directly upward [NEW] Cassidy roll - Rolls from side to side Hanzo Lunge - Lunges side to side [NEW] Hazard wall - Places wall down next to him Illari Outburst - Bursts directly upward [NEW] Mei iceblock - Enters and iceblock and emerges after its full duration Pharah jets - Hovers over chosen position Reaper TP - Teleports in place Reinhardt 1v1 - Only when user is mirroring Reinhardt. Dummy will swing, charge, block, and shatter to mimic a Reinhardt 1v1 [NEW] Sigma Gravitic Flux - Sigma will fly around in the air at random and target the user. If you're looking for other ult-cancelling practice, try EATXTT! [NEW] Tracer Blinks - Basic Tracer AI [NEW] Venture Burrow - Venture burrows and then emerges with a full charge. Hammond Piledriver - Ball teleports into midair and then performs a piledriver. Bottom Right - Return to Spawn [Recycle Icon] Teleports you to spawn point and closes the menu. Bottom - Timer/Show HUD [NEW] Timer - Host Only Toggling through option will reset mode timer. Default timer is 5 min before rotating to the next random map. 0 - 2 minutes [2 min] 1 - 5 minutes [5 min] 2 - Infinite [∞] Show HUD botton will toggle HUD information off Left side - Hero Select [Hero Icons] Chosen hero will dictate what specialty strafes are available. Top - Tank heroes Middle - DPS heroes Bottom - Support heroes Center - Close Menu [X icon] Closes menu and reenables movement and ability usage. You can \"replace\" the menu while its open by communicating again when looking in a different direction. Note, there is a cooldown built into the game for some communication commands so this won't allow you to rapidly open and reopen the menu. Hero Specific Tools Wrecking Ball Speed HUD - Top Center - Shows current move speed. Color will change to orange when user is moving fast enough for fireball. [NEW] UI Tools - Replaces \"Return to Spawn\" option in bottom right of menu. Dev comment: Its not like you were going to swap off ball anyway. 0 - Double Boop [2x] - Creates a 6 meter ring denoting the spacing required to reset the boop condition. (For the unaware, an enemy cannot be booped again until 6m of separation is created or LoS is broken). Ring is red when target is incapable of being booped and green when target is boopable again. 1 - Fireball distance [Grapple icon] - Creates a 7 meter ring to denote the approximate spacing needed to get a fireball on flatground. Ring turns orange while Hammond has fireball. 2 - Piledriver AOE [PD Icon] - Create sphere with 8 meter radius to denote the AOE of piledriver 3 - None [Trashcan Icon] - No UI Dev comment: Yes I play Ball, so he gets a lot of special treatment Winston [NEW] Juggle Counter - Top Center - Shows current and best juggle streak. Plays a sound when target lands on the ground. Counter shows in Green while target is airborne, Red when initially dropped, and white while on the ground. Primal duration is set to 5s, but resets with every knockback. *Dev Comment: I recommend using the \"0x\" damage multiplier so you can juggle the dummy infinitely without dealing damage. Swapping off Winston may reset the \"best\" counter. Reinhardt 1v1 AI (Listed above) This AI will activate when the user and dummy are both Reinhardt and the specialty strafe mode is active [Shatter Icon]. While active, enemy rein will react to your actions and will swing, shield, charge, and shatter. Illari [New] Pylon Testing - Illari will be damaged when at full health to allow pylon to heal her. This allows the user to test a pylon placement for LoS and range. Doomfist Empowered Punch - Activating block will cause dummy bot to target and shoot the user in order to provide empowered punch. NOTE: Some dummy heroes aren't very good at charging your block. Zarya Bubble Charge - Activating self bubble will grant Zarya 40 charge. Lucio Speed HUD - Top Center - Shows current move speed. [New] Now lists your top speed achieved. Genji [New] Blade practice - Dummy will respawn in different positions while blading. Green and red orb will spawn to signal next position dummy will spawn at. Hero will randomize from small pool. When blading against an Ana or Cassidy, dummy will use their CC ability. Dev comment: Their aim is ass. Blade duration doubled. General [New] Perks enabled Generation rate maxed out. Shoot dummy to charge perk. [New] Lobby Chat enabled As always, if you find any bugs, please let me know (the more descriptive, the better). I am the only tester before things go live, and I'm definitely not perfect. I dumped a lot of effort into this, but by the end I was slowly frying my brain so I guarantee I missed some things. Suggestions for more options are always welcome, too. I have been streaming on and off recently at twitch.tv/maybemabu. Feel free to drop by when I'm on if you have questions or if you just want to say hi. Just know if I'm mid game I'm not going to be able to answer anything too in depth. If you like the mode, support as small as a like on this post, the trailer, or copying the link from the workshop.codes/ page (just click on the code) is greatly appreciated. One last request, consider making your lobby public so others can join!",

I feel a bit hardstuck on high gold - low plat as support and would appreciate a bit of a look to see what things I could  improve on to climb more efficiently (although admittedly I don't play comp as much I should) One thing I feel I struggle with is efficient uptime as support (especially baptiste, im practicing weaving more effectively atm) as I'm balancing between damage and healing. probably stemming from poor positioning whether pre, or mid-fight not giving me optimal chance to contribute as much I should. I picked 3 loses: Player - Morbzone, Platform - PC GR17YQ - Suravasa, Ana loss - felt sluggish YWFJRJ - Oasis, Ana and Bap - struggle to deal effectively with ball dives along with a pharah + mercy duel PP6EH2 - Eichenwalde, Brig - Couldn't figure out how to play attack effectively here. generally any advice or review of my general gameplay, to see what im missing as a whole would be greatly appreciated ! Also, i know that in order to climb a three hero pool is not ideal, so im considering on dropping one support at some point.",

      "content_preview": "Armor Damage Mechanics General Rules Armor reduces each incoming hit by 7 damage . If this reduction exceeds 50% of the original damage , the reduction is capped at 50%. Beam damage (e.g., Moira drain, Mei freeze ray, Zarya beam) is reduced by 30% . In cases where total damage reduction already exceeds 50% before armor is applied, armor will have no additional effect. Example: A 10-damage hit is reduced to 5 (50%), not 3 (-7), since the 7-point reduction would exceed 50% of the original damage. Thus, hits under 14 damage are reduced by half. Today, I was testing the effect of Aerial Distresser 's Damage-over-time (DoT) interactions with the item Codebreaker . It appears that Codebreaker from last post stays factual after testing. https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/1kv2kha/ Notably, I previously only assume it works with weapon power, but it actually applies to ability and item effect as well, therefore, I check some ability and found DoT act vary widely. DoT effects that can be reduced by armor is reduced by 50% by general rule 2, but many specific effects ignore armor completely. Most tests were done in Stadium mode using workshop code 7X3PY . Since I basically only play Stadium no, main mode & perks, like Mauga burn, Echo beam, and Torbjörn lava remain untested by me. Damage That Ignores Armor Core Abilities Appears that \"Burning\" damage ignores armor Winston's primary and secondary fire (change introduced in Season 8, 2023, https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/live/2023/12/ ) Ana's primary fire DoT (75 damage over 0.6s). Junker Queen's Axe, Blade, bleed effects. Sombra's Virus DoT (direct impact reduced -7 normally). Widowmaker's Venom Mine DoT. Moira's damage orb (her leech and ultimate are reduced -30% as beam normally). Mei's ultimate. Zarya's ultimate damage ticks. Stadium-Specific All Ashe's burning effects (Incendiary Blast, Calamity, Molten Munitions, Incendiary Rounds). Direct explosions are reduced, but all burning DoTs ignore armor. Incendiary Rounds - despite not saying as a burning damage, ignores armor. Junker Queen's Stadium Power: Royal Bullet (50 DoT) Zenyatta's Stadium power Discord Fever (50 DoT) Brigitte's Stadium item Dragon’s Incinerator (5% HP burning effect). Ana's Stadium power Venomous (75 DoT). Mei's Blizzard Stadium item and Blizzard-triggered power. Junkrat's Stadium power Bango! (burning effect on direct hit). Junkrat's Stadium item Lithium Alloy (trap DoT). Reinhardt's Stadium power Magma Strike (lava). Reinhardt's Stadium power Feeling The Burn (burning). Notably calculated from pre-mitigated damage : (100-7) + 0.3×100 instead of (100-7) + 0.3×(100-7). Orisa's Stadium power Scorched Earth . (20% Max HP DoT) Damage Reduced by Armor (Unexpected Cases) Core Abilities Reaper's ultimate (37 per tick → reduced to 30, totaling 450 instead of 555, ~23% reduction). Freja’s ultimate: direct hit -7, explosion -7, spinning DoT reduced by 50% (200 → 148.5 total, 25.75% reduction). Stadium-Specific Juno's Stadium power Stinger DoT is reduced 50%. Despite description of 10 DoT, actual is ~14.96 damage (0.88×17). Junker Queen's Stadium power Reckoner’s Roar (unlike her other bleed effects). Stadium general item Aerial Distresser (25% bonus DoT). Soldier 76's Stadium power Back Off . Due to tick rounding differences, 200 damage is reduced to 96 after armor. Genji's Stadium power Laceration (35% DoT of dash). Zarya’s Stadium power Volskaya Vortex (80 damage over 2s) reduced by 30%, likely flagged as a beam. Winston's Stadium power Tesla Field (40 DPS inside bubble) reduced by 50%. Only his primary and secondary actually ignore armor, not electric damage. Stadium item Three-Tap Tummy Gun (9% DoT reduced to ~4.5%). D.Va with Three-Tap Tummy Gun : bugged in Mech form, deals only 1% per second for 3s (total 3%) and cannot stack. Baby D.Va with Busan Buster can trigger correctly. Conclusions The baseline is simple, but many abilities override it. Burning effects are the most consistent exception. Practical baseline: Non-beam, non-exception per-hit damage: effective = max(D - 7, 0.5D) Beams: effective = 0.7D, unless specifically flagged to ignore armor. DoT that does not ignore armor is usually halved because each tick is small, so the 50% cap applies. Flagged as burn reliably bypasses armor in my testing Inconsistency: Poison, Electric, and Bleed are inconsistent. Some sources ignore armor entirely, others are halved. This strongly suggests different internal flags per source, not one unified DoT rule. Ultimates: Some ignore armor entirely (eg Blizzard, Graviton tick damage), others are reduced per the baseline (eg Reaper, Freja, Moira). Pre-mitigated bonus calculations exist (Reinhardt Lava and 3-hit burn) Stadium mode magnifies inconsistencies. Text descriptions are not reliable predictors, unless is strongly signal it is a burning effect.",

I know teleporter is strong with team coordination, but its not like it's gotten any changes recently .. so I'm assuming it was changes to other heroes which made her fit in, right? (except I dont know what those changes are). Is her brawl playable viable at the moment? (which would explain why mei and reaper aren't being used)",
