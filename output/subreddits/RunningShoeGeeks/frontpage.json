      "content_preview": "I needed a pair of solid long distance shoes for my first marathon as soon as possible. My Asics Superblast 2s feel flat after two hours and my Puma Deviate NITRO Elite 3s need more cushioning especially when my form starts to break down. I usually stay away from these super shoes because I don’t feel like I’m worthy yet but after trying on my friend’s pair it was love at first try. I knew that I had to grab them for myself or I will regret it and thankfully I was correct. About me User profile: M, 180cm, 78kg Shoe size: 29.0cm, EU45 1/3, US11 Average weekly mileage: 80-90km Running style: neutral; fore and mid-foot striker Run used: easy long run, 18 km @ 5:52-6:24/km Terrain ran: dry road (concrete, asphalt, cobblestone) and light trails Uppers of a used pair of Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 after 18km Outsole of a used pair of Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 after 18km Thoughts I bought these second-hand for €115 and the seller mentioned that the pair has been used once. I took the leap of faith because it came in the size and colorway I wanted plus the pictures from the listing looked acceptable to me. They arrived almost new with a few minor scratches but the liveliness of the technology were there. I usually either test new shoes by using them for an errand that will need an hour of walking or a recovery run with a maximum of ten kilometers but for AP3s their first impression gave me confidence that I chose to bring them out for an 18 kilometer long run with a target range of 10% to 20% less than my current marathon pace. Size and fit I already have a reference of how I want them to fit because I tried pairs of Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4 in sizes 28.5cm / EU44.5 / US10.5 (my preferred) and 29.0cm / EU45 1/3 / US11 before. I found that the first fit normally but I liked the extra toe box space in the latter despite the extra length. Since these will be marathon racing shoes I decided that a wider forefoot space will be more important because I can just do a runner’s knot to prevent heel slippage. The AP3s at size 29.0cm were perfect. They felt spacious in the forefoot though has an allowance on the heels. The latter didn’t bother me because it wasn’t too noticeable during the run. Upper I have listened to and read a lot of reviews about the AP3s and their polarizing upper materials and I made sure to check if I will also face the same issues. The upper material is a thin breathable mesh that is similar to the DNE3s and I didn’t have any problems with it. The tongue is not sewed in and is nothing special. I don’t know if its because the shoes were already used; if I am familiar with the similar uppers of the DNE3 that never gave me discomfort; or it could be a combination of the two. I only had to loosen up the laces to fill the shape of my feet with socks on and that’s it. As for the heels, I didn’t have to do a runner’s knot. Yes I can feel the empty space behind my heels but the sensation was gone as I went further into my long run. It never bothered me after three kilometers or so. I also put on blister pads on my heels in case the top of the heel rubs on my achilles but it never happened unless I tip my toes which is extreme. My only doubt is how will the uppers hold up in terms of waterproofing in case of a rain because during the end of my run I accidentally stepped on a puddle. I felt some splashes of water quickly seep in through the material, into my socks and my skin. It’s not a big issue but others may find this an important note for their preferences. Overall I didn’t have to change the laces, skip any lace holes or even cut open the spot that covers the pinky toe to be comfortable with the uppers. There were no lace bites, sore pinky toes and heel bruises. The material never irritated me at any point of my feet which was fortunate for a first long run. Midsole The midsole is the most important to me and it is the part the sold the shoes to me instantly. I am very picky with long distance shoes because I want them to have the comfort and spaciousness of the SB2s and the lightness, responsiveness and springiness of the DNE3s which sounds like something impossible. Luckily I can confidently say that I found the AP3s to fulfill my requirements. I know that these are all big claims for a first run review but as I’ve said it blew my expectations away. The forefoot has some foam and I like the transition from the significant amount of foam on the middle. It is obvious that forefoot (and even mid-foot) runners can go faster with that height difference. I had to control myself from utilizing this a lot during my run because I had a target pace range to maintain but it was just perfect to the way I naturally run. I love the thick bouncy foam you will immediately feel on the balls of your feet. I don’t know if the rods had a contribution because this is my first time but if they were then I love the combination of the two together. For some people it might bother them a bit because it felt like the midsole was forcing me to arch my feet but it goes away after a kilometer or two followed by comfort. I only had the DNE3’s PWR Plate and NITRO foam as my first-ever super shoe technology for reference but the AP3’s blew me away. The DNE3s have a relatively thin and almost flat outsole foam and the almost rocker design of the AP3s encouraged a generous form to put yourself forward which I liked. This and combined with the midsole’s propulsion is a great recipe for an almost effortless long run. I didn’t know there could be something thicker and bouncier than the Pumas! During the entire run I had to do little effort to go faster up to my target paces. I changed my cadence a lot as I went further into my long run and it was just a fun time increasing my steps while keeping the pace and experience what the shoes can offer. I was able to cruise during my run and they even had a sensation of disappearing on my feet once I really focused. It is versatile in letting me hit different spots on my feet as a forefoot and mid-foot striker and I love the consistent feedback depending on how hard I stepped. Right now I have never taken them to my marathon pace of 5:20/km or faster but I know these will be bouncy beasts. Lastly I did not experience any discomfort on my ankles, posterior tibial tendon and shins during and after. I can confidently say they’re as comfortable as the SB2s in terms of support and protection after a long run. My legs felt fresh and I was sad that I can’t do more after because I had a training plan to follow diligently. Outsole I am familiar with the Continental rubber used in a lot of modern Adidas shoes and their reliability. Though not comparable with Pumas as the best in the market, I didn’t have any trouble going through the same routes as my good old Deviate NITRO 3s. It was after a rainy night so the roads and trails were a bit wet. There were no problems in both dry and wet surfaces though I intentionally avoided puddles of any kind due to the upper material’s thinness but I never slipped once even on the light trails in my route. After my run the rubber material is reliable on both dry and wet roads though I will not use these during winter. A full coverage of Continental rubber with textured grips could be considered but not with the thin layer in the AP3s right now. My only problem was the instability of landing when I reached cobblestone roads and paths because I either had to plant my entire foot on the ground or to strategically make sure I step on a flat piece of rock to not risk of rolling my ankles or something worse. I never had these problems at easy paces with my SB2s and NITRO shoes. Regardless I did get the hang of it after a few more loops but I suspect it will be an issue when I find myself in a similar area, my feet are already too tired and my form is nearly breaking down. Durability Unfortunately I don’t have the exact distance these were used by the seller but I know that it had the same bounciness as the new AP4s I tried. During the entire run the responsiveness was consistent and there were no moments that they felt dead. Though I will be extra critical of how the outsole holds up because of how thin the rubber materials are for the coming months. These are my first of its kind and I will revisit this after 200 or even 320 km (common distance limit from online reviews) if they last that long. Overall I can say that I have finally found my favourite long distance running shoes in terms of both comfort, consistency and speed support. The uppers were a non-issue, the midsole foam’s thickness and responsiveness is everything I wanted for a dream shoe and the outsole is respectable with the Continental rubber. I believe that choosing a shoe size of one full centimeter over my regular fit was the right decision as well to accommodate my preference for a roomy toe box. I will only use these for long runs of at least 16km and marathon races and I hope to spend more time with them after. Next steps I plan to do more reviews at points 200km and 320km because those are critical distances for me especially the latter. If they are still comfortable at 320km then I will push them to the limit of how far they can stay that way.",

      "content_preview": "I just did my first run with the SuperComp Trainer V3, replacing a V1. I’m a size 12.5US and my running shoes are almost always 13US. 184cm 78kg runner. I run every other day, have been wearing New Balance shoes since 1080 v1 and I oscillate between the 1080/880 and Rebel lines. I keep a SuperComp for longer runs but I have a love/hate relationship with the V1 mainly due to weight and fit. I like the V1 for the cushion that is not as squishy as it looks due to stack height. Probably because of the carbon plate. However it still feels a bit like running on cloud where you won’t feel the pavement. I didn’t like the weight as well, and you really feel it when you get to the end of a long run. The fit is so so, I wish they used more padding on the edges where it meets the ankle. There was a bit that was biting into my ankle and I had to snip it off - improved it somewhat but there’s a piece of structured plastic that was still uncomfortable. For long runs I still prefer the SuperComp Trainer V1 to my other shoes: Rebelv4 for daily short runs, and sometimes my older 1080v11 or SuperComp Pacer for faster runs. Now the V3 fixed the fit. Instead of structured plastic for the last lacing eyelet, we now get proper padding all around. Great improvement. Weight feels a bit lighter as well, I didn’t weight mine, but the specs seems to show some savings in weight. It could be coming from less rubber on the outsole. The V3 outsole is similar to what you get on the Rebel V4. Which means sufficient and possible rather durable for what it looks. Now the feel of the foam, it felt a bit firmer than the V1. But in a good way. For forefoot and midfoot strikers, it feels very much like the Rebel V4, in that you can feel the pavement (probably the carbon plate at work), but at the same time the thickness of the foam makes it feel like you’re not slamming into the pavement. And if you want to heel strike on the shoe, it feels like a heavily cushioned shoe. For me, usually start off mid foot fast runs and when I’m almost at the end of the run, fatigue causes me to slow down and strike closer to the heel, so this shoe feels great. Compared to the V1, I liked the slightly firmer feel and the ability to transition from mid to heel when I feel like it. I didn’t feel the weight of the V3 during my run, but then again I’ve not gone long distance on it yet. Great thing about it now (2025 August) is that sometimes Joe’s NB Outlet has it for approx $110. Sorry, my habit is to buy my running shoes when they’re on sale because I replace them often.",
