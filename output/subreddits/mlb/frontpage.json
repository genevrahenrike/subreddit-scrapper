With the Giants leading 7-0 in the fifth, San Francisco wasn't about to remove Verlander, even as his pitch count climbed. He finally finished the top of that inning by striking outGunnar HendersonandRyan Mountcastle-- and that allowed him to qualify for his third victory of the year.After that, my thoughts are:First, he's gassed.Second, 10Ks in five innings? The Orioles must suck.Third thought: Winning two in a row will probably \"prove\" to Verlander he's not gassed and he'll try to land with a team again next year.",

After the umpires inspected a discolored area on the barrel of the bat and conferred with replay officials in New York, they confiscated it. The bat was then authenticated and turned over to a league official at Daikin Park, presumably for further inspection by Major League Baseball.Video at the link.Like a .208 hitter is really getting help. Sounds as much or more like pre-playoffs gamesmanship as anything, if the Yankees and Astros should meet, especially since Trammell had been with the Yankees last year.",

Miller acknowledged surgery seemed like a realistic option and spoke pragmatically about his baseball future.\"I'm definitely probably going to miss next year,\" Miller said. \"Be ready for 2027, see how my arm feels, see where I'm at in my life and go from there.\"As the story notes, he's 35 and already been TJed once. I'll give him a kudo for being realistic about how things will stand in 2027; it's not likely that a 37-year-old reliever who hadn't been a closer or semi-closer until this year, with two TJs, will draw too much interest. (His contract expires this year.)",

Why is he sandwiched between Ohtani and Smith/Freeman? I feel like if I were to use the criteria for hitting a guy 2nd it would be:High OBPSpeedPowerRBIBetts has none of these qualities anymore. I get it. He's a future Hall of Famer but isn't it time to bat him lower in the lineup? I mean they have multiple righty batters that have better OPS numbers than him. Smith. Teo. Even Pages.He hasn't had a single month where he OPS'd enough to justify hitting him 2nd.Is it time to bat him later in the lineup? It's September not May.",
