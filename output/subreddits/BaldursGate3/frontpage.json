        "content": "Unacceptable behaviors include name-calling, taunting, baiting, flaming, etc. The intent is for everyone to act as civil adults. Everyone's perspective is unique. You don’t have to agree with them, but you also don’t have to argue or harass them about it. All submissions must be related to Baldur's Gate 3. Comments should be relevant to the topic of the thread. Content that is NSFW or contains spoilers must be tagged/hidden appropriately. Additionally, titles should be free of profanity, spoilers, and other NSFW language. Repeated offenses could result in a ban from the sub. All fanart, screenshots, memes, and joke posts must have proper flair. Spamming is strictly prohibited. Any re-posts, low-effort posts, or posts that qualify as spam may be removed. Repeat offenders may be banned. Examples of low effort posts would be posting excessive screenshots and low effort memes Self-Promo Rules: Please follow Reddit's guidelines for self-promo content \"For every 1 time you post self-promotional content, 9 other posts (submissions or comments) should not contain self-promotional content.\" No Tav screenshots, Build/Multi posts, or LFG posts outside of their megathreads. Megathread Schedule: Tuesday - Tav Tuesdays (post your Tav screenshots here) Wednesday - Looking for Group Thursday - Build/Multiclass Help Friday - Monday: Post-Launch Feedback Talking about ways to pirate the game is not allowed. Also, sharing pirated material can result in a subreddit being banned or forced to shut down. As such doing either of these things will result in a ban from the subreddit. If you need to contact the moderators about an issue or permission to do a giveaway, please use modmail to get our attention rather than creating a post. It's likely if you do that, it'll be missed. Discussion and posts exclusively about 3rd party wikis will be removed. This DOES NOT mean that BG3 resources from other websites (guides, builds, etc.) can’t be shared here and discussed. This also DOES NOT affect anything concerning the Community Wiki. No AI generated content or discussion allowed All posts should be in English. Posts linking to non-English content are okay if they're subtitled or otherwise accessible to English speakers at mod discretion. (Non-English comments are allowed!) We don't allow posts or comments talking about purchasing steam accounts, or asking for people to purchase the game for you. Doing this will result in an immediate ban. This includes homophobic, racist, misogynistic, or any other mods that contain bigoted content or change the game in a bigoted way. This includes posts denouncing such mods, and posts linking to sites to download them. There is zero tolerance for breaking this rule. Cosplay posts must be submitted on Sundays."

Have “the talk” with your healthcare providerWhether you decide to speak to them in person or through telemedicine services, they’ll help you determine if you can benefit from PrEP and discuss the different PrEP options available, some of which can be about 99% effective in reducing the chances of getting HIV through sex when taken as prescribed.2. Get tested on the regularYou’ll need to get tested for HIV before starting PrEP, and retested for HIV regularly—as often as every 2 months, depending on the type of PrEP you and your healthcare provider choose.3. All about that routineYou are your #1 advocate for your sexual health. And one of the best ways to help reduce your chances of getting HIV is by taking PrEP exactly as prescribed. Make sure to stay informed, get tested, and have open conversations with your healthcare provider.For some PrEP medicines and HIV testing, telehealth visits may be an option for easier access to care, which can potentially be more cost-efficient and convenient.Looking for a healthcare provider who has experience prescribing PrEP?

      "content_preview": "From what I read about the critical immunity, the effect simply force a reroll if the enemy rolls a nat20 against you, untill they roll something other than nat20, which basically mean they can not roll a 20 to hit you.So think of it this way: If the enemy needs to roll 11~20 to hit you, thats 50% chance to hit; with critical immunity and nothing else, they needs to roll 11~19 instead, thats 45% chance. Same thing apply to other situations, 16~20 becomes 16~19 (25% to 20%), 18~20 becomes 18~19 (15% to 10%).So it's essentially +1 AC right? Plus geting rid of the critical damage modifier and the always hit effect. Am I understand it right?",

She’s then treated like any other character, not worthy of wielding the Spear of Night against Aylin, or even making a choice.  Worst of all,she blames Durgefor it afterward and leaves.  As if she would’ve managed the trials on her own.Solution seems to be to kill her while she’s telling her “bosom companion” (again, being the only one between Lae’zel and Minthara who hasn’t signaled her home) off, but might there be a third person out there who was able to get her to achieve her Dark Justiciar dreams, because I think she has to be persuaded to stab Aylin if her approval’s too high.And maybe I’m forgetting something and mixing up Shar’s abuse of her niece and Balthazar’s, but isn’t she immortal, anyway, all these DJ’s who went into making Yurgir’s furniture each had their turn running her through, what’s the big deal?
