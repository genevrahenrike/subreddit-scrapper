Megathread Schedule: Tuesday - Tav Tuesdays (post your Tav screenshots here) Wednesday - Looking for Group Thursday - Build/Multiclass Help Friday - Monday: Post-Launch Feedback Talking about ways to pirate the game is not allowed.

      "content_preview": "falseWhy did they make human a mechanically pointless option?New player but I've played DnD for decades, I'm like 20 hours in, clearly Larian has a different vision for humans than WotC with DnD. AFAICT there is no gameplay reason to pick a human? Literally every other race is better except for maybe gnomes. Other races get resistances, proficiencies, cantrips, or unique abilities like the halfings/githyanki/half-orcs which seem genuinely very useful - I mean that halfling ability is unbelievably good, if you math it out it ends up bumping the average die roll from 10.5 -> ~11 on the most important rolls (attacks, saves, skill checks). Most of the races or subraces get a free proficiency, so humans don't have any extra skills (I guess they get to pick the skill they want? It's something). The weapon and armor proficiencies don't matter, if you're using a halberd or glaive you're probably some sort of fighter and you were proficient from your class, a wizard or sorceror might use the light armor but has no need for those weapons. The only real potential draw is the carry capacity boost, but, an hour in I realized even that's 100% irrelevant because I can freely send everything back to a camp chest directly, doesn't even need to touch my inv before it's routed to the camp, and then I can load up a big stronk fighter with my drek when I go to a merchant, it's literally 100% irrelevant.Why did Larian do this? If nothing else there should be an achievement like Simply Human for handicapping yourself with a useless decision and making it to the end of the game. I like the decision to not do attribute bonuses for race, and I could understand not wanting humans to have the starting feat in 5E because that's strong and why most parties ends up with some kind of martial human, but, they really are just pointless in BG3, why not give humansTWOskills to choose? Or a limited selection of feats from the ones nobody ever takes, Dungeon Delver, Actor, Resilient, Performer, Athlete, etc.",

      "content_preview": "falseJust bought the game, my intro has been a dumpster fireI will stay away from this sub to avoid spoilers. But holy shit have my first couple of hours been insane and I can't wait to play more.I've never played DND or a quite similar game to this before. I've put in maybe 4hrs, 1 of which was just creating my character, I am overwhelmed.Theres been so much bloodshed I didn't intend. I really wanted my first play to be morally neutral/good.My party was just Shadowheart and Astarion. We made it to emerald groves and I got involved in the civil matter between druids and Tieflings... Seeing Kagha almost kill a child made me hate her instantly. And then Zevlor suggested we kill her and her followers wont know what to do... WRONG, I killed her, and when I left the cave she was in, there was bloodshed everywhere.. no druids left and few Tieflings. On top of that, I did this before the main mission of finding the assistant healer, and Nettie is no where to be found, idk if she died or ran away, probably got killed..Next up was trying to make it to the goblin camp, Its just me and my party now due to the massacre.On the way, I needed to heal so we setup camp. Cutscene came up, Astarion the vampire trying to suck my blood, fuck that. My only two options were do nothing or melee him. I must not have read it well enough. Dice roll, critical 20, stake right through Astarions heart, dead. I'm crushed, I was hoping to just punch some sense into him.Just me and Shadowheart now.I am chaotic evil, I must live with these choices and continue onward.Great intro to the game. I am loving itUpdate : I played more tonight and found the two other companions, the party is growing.On a more grim note, I went back to emerald Grove and found the corpses of Nettie and Wyll, confirmed killed in action, RIP.Also, maybe due to these events , I went back to try and fight the owlbear with a stronger party and the Goblins got to it already. I walked in to a whole other bloodshed... The cub wasn't there either now. Not sure.",

      "content_preview": "falseChoices you make in every playthrough no matter whatI'm very close to done my second playthrough and I'm looking back at the choices I made throughout the game and a surprising number of them are the same ones I made in my first playthrough. I'm talking big story relevant choices not just minor dialog choices. I took Gortash's offer, skipped the Iron Throne dungeon, I didn't ascend Astarion, I let Shadowheart's parents die, I killed Lorroakan, I convinced the squatters to leave, I never let the attack on the grove happen, told the Emperor to piss off, and I went to the underdark before the creche again. Looking at all those choices I'd probably still make most of those choices again because they seem like the right ones to make either from a gameplay/practicality standpoint or a RP standpoint.This got me curious what are some choices other people make the same way every time they play through the game even after saying they'll try something different",

I'm only in my first playthrough and have been playing a tiefling. I've felt like past act 1, it's not really been very relevant at all.Curious if it's the same for most races, and what races are most engaging to play with in terms of how they affect the world. I've heard that as a drow they let you in the goblin camp easily. Any other stuff like that for other races?",
