      "content_preview": "Hi guys! I badly need vault space. I’ve realised that I have a bunch of PvP rolls that I’ve been holding on to simply because I don’t really know what actually makes a weapon good in PvP, so they’re just sitting their “in case” they are good. So figured I might as well throw the list at some better PvP players than myself to see what they think is worth keeping (if anything). Bear in mind that I main hunter and heavily favour using pulses, autos, shotguns and LMGs. You can assume that all the weapons below that can be adept, are. Any help is appreciated. Rose (Slideshot / Explosive) Lethal Abundance (Dynamic / Onslaught) Riiswalker (Slideshot / Opening Shot) Aisha’s Care (Keep Away / Headseeker) Someday (Threat Detector / Opening Shot) Multimach (Dynamic / Iron Reach) Deadlock (Lone / Closing) Boondoggle (Hip-Fire / Offhand) Judgment (Keep Away / Precision) Relentless (Lone / Headseeker) Igneous Hammer (Fragile / Precision) The Riposte (Zen / Dynamic) Claws of The Wolf (Headseeker / Kill Clip) Shayura’s Wrath (Dyanmic / Target Lock) Compass Rose (Threat Detector / Opening Shot) The Summoner (Zen / Tap) Scavenger’s Fate (Lone / Closing) Gridskipper (Zen / Headseeker) Sojourner’s Tale (Quickdraw / Opening Shot) Exalted Truth (Slideshot / Precision) No Survivors (Rangefinder / Target Lock) A Sudden Death (Threat Detector / Closing) Prosecutor (Zen / Target Lock) Cruel Mercy (Dragonfly / Headseeker) Tomorrow’s Answer (Tracking / Cluster) Watchful Eye (Dynamic / Target Lock) I have other weapons that I currently rotate between in PvP, so if this whole list is trash, I would still have a decent couple of builds. Thanks!",

If thats true, is there any use case for this thing? It feels like there could be with how grenade heavy warlocks are. I've got a solid Assassin/Syntho roll that i use for Lightning Surge but I'd like one for using with Hellion or something and I haven't gotten many good rolls with SoIL yet.",

      "content_preview": "Reposting this here because I wasn't supposed to post this on crucible guidebook! Hey all, Luna's is one of my crucible mains, so I took the opportunity to go for a god roll this weekend, and while I didn't get what I was rolling for (Eye of the Storm/Opening Shot), I got two rolls that were close , and I'd love some advice on which you think would perform better in 3s. For 6s, I have my old standby roll of extended/light mag/heal clip/mag howl/range mw, which while not \"god\" roll is pretty damn good imho. For 3s, I think I have two good options: Option 1: Hammer Forged/Ricochet/Eye of the Storm/Precision instrument/reload mw Option 2: Hammer Forged/Ricochet/Slideshot/Opening Shot/handling mw My thoughts are this: there is a lot of love for the SS/OS combo, and no doubt you can pull of some silly range on that first shot. Plus, I think OS is just straight up better than PI given its secondary benefits on accuracy. BUT, I really wonder how often I'm procing SS in a way that matters. I'm not someone who is super aggressive, sliding in to my encounters - rather, I'm sliding to the next encounter, and I wonder how often the buff has dissipated by the time I get that first shot off. Probably a lot. On the other hand, I can work on that, OS is great, and when I do get both proc'd I can make some silly shots. Regarding option 1, this is where my heart is pulling me, but I wonder if its wrong. Eye of the storm is no doubt great. I'm on controller (another reason I debate the utility of SS), and it makes me feel rock solid in my duels. No question its a top tier perk. But over the last couple days I've learned that PI is just kind of...meh. Adds a tiny bit of range, maybe more importantly adds some consistency against overshield, frost shield, woven mail....but how often do those situations come up? Regarding barrels and mags, I don't quite understand the systems well enough to judge if the combos I have may be invalidating one of the perks (i.e. if my base range is either so good/bad that the benefit from something like PI is meaningless/more meaningful) but that's definitely something to consider. In short, given my playstyle and that I'm on controller I feel like option 1 may be better for me? But, I'm very torn, as I think option 2 may just be better overall and I should just slide more? Would love your opinions!",

      "content_preview": "Hi folks, Time and time again I come across the 700/700 vault situation and the first thing I do is clean dupe weapons. Usually, I am going to light.gg, and typing in the weapon, looking at the popular trait combos, and deleting the ones that either aren’t on the list or doesn’t synergies well with any builds I main. Am I doing myself a disservice by doing this? And I leaving good rolls on the table by chance? Just curious..",

      "content_preview": "I know this is a great roll - what could be better about it? With Dex mods, ready & stow speed is the same. So there's no need for extra handling (especially if being used with Ophidian or Speedloader). Velocity is already maxed out. Stability is kinda useless for this weapon type. Reload Speed isn't necessary due to Envi + BnS. I have been out of the loop for a long time with Breach Loaded GL's and wasn't sure if Blast Radius was actually bad to have - let alone if there are any special rules for Double Fire Frames. Any insight would be greatly appreciated :) https://preview.redd.it/wilderflight-v0-1nze69drad9f1.png",
