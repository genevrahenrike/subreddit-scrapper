He's normally not the asshole like his Chihuahua sister so I'm not sure what possessed him yesterday. My dogs are well trained and able to regularly be off leash while outside whenever we do yard work or let our kids play outside. So yesterday the big doof decided to take a massive shit on the left side of the yard before I started cutting the grass. I figured: It's no big deal and I'd just start across the driveway on the right side first and deal with it later. When I only had a few feet of uncut grass left, he came barreling over full speed, stopped dead center in the uncut grass never breaking eye contact and proceeded to once again continue that massive shit on this other side! I began cussing him out and again without breaking eye contact he gave me the goofiest dog smile and literally sauntered back to playing with the kids. So yeah not just an old fart but an asshole too.",

      "content_preview": "I (26f) married my husband (35m) 3 years ago. He was previously married with two boys, and I have a daughter who I raised on my own until I met him. He has since adopted her. She loves him to death and having a father-figure has been a very positive influence on her. We sold our house because my husband is deploying soon, and I decided to move out of state while he is gone to be closer to my family and get the support I need. We got an apartment and a school for my daughter to go to, and then we went back to our home state to spend a little more time with my husband before he leaves. However, because we sold our house, we didn't have anywhere to stay for the time being. My husband's ex-wife's mother (we'll call her Tracey) offered to have us stay with her a couple weeks. That seems nice of her right? Except for our whole relationship, I had often brought it up to my husband that Tracey had double standards when it comes to the boys vs. my daughter, and I didn't like being there for that very reason. Keep in mind this woman calls my daughter her granddaughter, and she let's her call her her grandmother. My daughter is expected to pick up after herself while the boys can make a mess and tell Tracey to \"screw off\" if she asks them to clean up; she just laughs and picks up their mess. My daughter is expected to share with the boys, but when my daughter wants a turn with something its \"he had it first, play with something else\". My daughter isn't allowed to sit on a specific couch in the living room because that's one of the boy's couches. My daughter also very regularly comes to me when we are at Tracey's house, and asks why she has rules and the boys don't. It breaks my heart. Well, a few days ago, I finally hit my breaking point. We were all sitting on the back porch, me, my husband, and Tracey, while the kids swam in the pool. I was sitting on the stairs to the porch, and I kept getting a pungent smell of what I thought was pee. I asked my husband if he smelled it, and he said he did. Then Tracey spoke up. She went on to say that the giant patch of dirt where the grass never grows, right next to the stairs of the porch, is where all of the boys pee. They stand on the stairs and piss right where everyone walks everyday. Where I have walked barefoot not knowing at all that I was walking in saturated piss dirt. Then she said she laid down a bed of rocks around the corner of the stairs for them to pee on, but that they never use it they just continue to pee on the massive dirt patch. Then she laughed. I saw red. Because not too long ago (last summer) when the kids were swimming, my daughter ran out of the pool and walked way into the backyard to pee really fast so she could get back in the pool. Well, that was a major no no to Tracey. She told my daughter to use the toilet, that's what it's for, and I didn't necessarily disagree with her. But the double standard is clearly there, right? Seriously please tell me if im the asshole. I told my husband this is just another example of why I don't want my daughter in that house. The hypocrisy and the delusion is way too much for me to handle, so I left him there. My daughter and I are now staying at my longtime girlfriends house 4 hours away, and my husband refuses to believe that the reason I left isn't all in my head. He would rather stay at his EX WIFES MOTHERS HOUSE then spend whatever time he has left here with his current wife. AITA????? Update: (also possible TW!!) It's been a week so here's an update and a little more context for you. I love my step-sons like they are my own. When my daughter was 8mos old I miscarried my son at 17 weeks. His name was going to be the same name as one of my stepson's. The other boy is hilarious and a very good drawer, which is something I loved to do when I was around his age, so we bond over that a lot. Do they have their moments like my daughter does? Absolutely. But they are the children of the man I love, and I treat every child who walks through my door the same. I just don't know why Tracey can't do the same for my daughter. Especially when shes his LEGAL daughter, the boys' LEGAL sister. Step parents are expected to love and treat everyone the same, why dont we expect that for the entire family? Please let me know what you think. As for my husband, I put up some boundaries for when he gets back. I know he won't be back for a while, so until then, we'll be going to counseling together and on our own. There is clearly a disconnect between us when it comes to this situation and we need to do better. He says he agrees. Maybe in a year and a half ill update again? There's just so much up in the air right now, that it's anyone's guess what will end up happening. All I can say is I'm committed to my husband, and I feel it's my job to help him become the best man and father he can be, like it's his job to do the same for me.",

      "content_preview": "TRIGGER WARNING: different kinds of abuse It’s long and a doozy. I (28F) am getting married in March. My mom (56F) and father (59M) got divorced when I was twelve. And I was so happy about it. I was wanting them to get divorced since I was 5 according to my mom. My father was emotionally abusive to her among other things. My earliest memory was when I was 4 and he would put porn on the TV. One time I came in the living room and my parents were arguing. More like my mom just yelling and my father was laughing. There were women lined up on beach chairs fully naked and she was telling him to take it off. My sister who was two at the time was playing on the floor in front of it. My father refused and laughed. When my mom saw me come in she told me to grab my sister and take us to the next room. My father told me “No! Stay! Tell me which one looks like your mom”. I did look at them and ponder and was confused. I had never seen anyone naked other my mom at that point. So that’s pretty much how our house ran. I would get in trouble for finding his porn and seeing it, and even telling my mom. He would record VHS tapes and leave files on the computer of photos and bookmark websites on chrome. I’m not against porn at all. Do you. But this was unnecessary, causing issues, and not healthy for a child. Around the first grade the porn started to look weird. Not ladies with sunglasses but ones who were smaller and looked scared. It was getting creepy and freaky. I would just trash anything I found to avoid arguments but I would tell my mom when I found weird ones. He wasn’t nice honestly. He was gone most of the time. He worked multiple jobs as security. When he was home he made my mom wait on him hand and foot. He never attended my sports games, went to church with us (he was religious would quote the Bible about how women should be obedient and his parents were the reverends there too), skipped holidays with the family (we would spend them with his parents who only lived two doors down from us). Pretty much absent most of the time. My sister told me once her earliest memory of him was when she freaked out when he walked in the door because she didn’t know who he was. He would demean my mother’s appearance and tell her how she was a terrible mom. My sister and I both got straight As, many extracurriculars, never got in trouble at school, and were loved by pretty much any adult that met us both. He would tell us how we were terrible kids because at some point we stopped listening to him and got into arguments with him too. I was around 10 at this point. He told us stuff like the Bible said we were meant to be obedient, don’t wear that dress you are just trying to be a slut, and my sister who was 8 that she needed to start having kids before men won’t want her because she’s not pretty anymore. He once told us we should be grateful he is such a great dad because we don’t know the kids of things other fathers do to their daughters. Always found that one creepy. Flash forward to me being twelve . My mom finally divorced him. I told my cousins everything but the guys think I was irrational for hating him. To them, my father is just a bad father but not worthy of hating since the worst thing was porn. In college I later volunteer at DV shelters for women and kids and they explain household dynamics. I understood emotional abuse. My father would take things from my mom to make her life difficult, her car keys and even her pillows. He was nuts. I ended up talking to my mom about what I had learned and we talked about EVERYTHING. That’s when she told me. Apparently my father was a pervert and would take photos and videos  of women himself. As far as she knew he would go to relatively public areas, like college dorm neighborhoods, beaches, and nude communities and record women. Those extra jobs he was always at was at dance clubs and strip clubs. He came home once beat up because he put a drunk girl in his van because he saving her. She was clearly too drunk to protect herself. Well her friends found them and beat the shit out of him. The police chased him multiple times. Once he climbed up a tree to hide and they couldn’t find him. I remembered some this because the few times he would take me and my sister anywhere I would see him recording women and would just leave with my sister. It would take sometime before he noticed if at all. My father would come home at night and tell my mom what he did. She said once he realized she would just sit there he would just confess all of it and laugh. She hated it. He did eventually get arrested for being a peeping tom and my grandparents had to see the Judge, advocate for him, and get him out. So I know that they know his tendencies. My mom divorced him and things were looking bright. My mom reported my father but they said they wouldn’t do anything without evidence and he had already taken all his stuff. I hardly saw him so I thought that chapter of my life was over. Not even close. He couldn’t afford to live on his own. Of course he blames my mom since he owed her child support, but he wasn’t paying for anything really when he moved out. The landlord was always knocking on our door and I’m pretty sure my grandma would chip in for whatever my mom couldn’t cover. He Was living out of his car and then eventually moved in with my grandparents. Now I saw him all the time. He would get into arguments there too with women, my cousins around my age and even cuss out his aunt. No one liked him except my grandma. Of course. Moms and their sons. My grandpa was the only who tried to discipline him and understood why I didn’t like him. He’s passed now it’s just my father and grandma and her family. He remarried (I wasn’t told or invited) a stripper and she has schizophrenia now. I’ve seen it myself. She lives downstairs and the situation is weird. The doors are locked, cameras are installed, and she is supposed to stay downstairs. Apparently she keeps running away. I’ve found notes around the house she left for herself stating she hates my father and he tells her the same things he told my mom. I thought it was a note from my mom at first. Eventually the wife ran away and disappeared for almost a year. She was eventually found and brought back to the house. According to my grandma her family doesn’t want her and is happy my father is at least housing and feeding her. I think it’s probably an abusive situation. They all think I’m the problem and a bad daughter for not liking him. I didn’t invite him to my college graduation. He never came to any school events so I don’t see why I would invite him now. (As a kid he told me not to expect to see him) well he came anyways and we avoided him. He flew for the first time to do this. He never saw me in person and he was LIVID. So was grandma. Honestly I know that she doesn’t like me anymore even though she won’t say it. To her she doesn’t see why we had a falling out. I know she’s lying because she knows how is he better than anyone but I think she thinks it shouldn’t matter. Kid and woman obedience and all. My uncles are in the same boat and wish I would get over it. My sister knows and continues to have a relationship with him. I told her how those decisions are making it harder for me. She doesn’t blame me but I know she deep down she just wants a dad and he’s showing up now. Plus he gives her money. She makes 5x more than him which is hilarious. My mom is trying to move on now and tells me to invite him to things just so that we don’t get blamed for being rude. His family blames me of course for my actions. I haven’t told them my experiences, it would just hurt for them to deny it, or worse, say it doesn’t matter. I talked to my father about everything expect the peeping and he denies it all. I invited him last year to visit me to see if anything about him had improved and honestly he’s the same just toned down. Still sexist and argumentative. I think I tried enough. He was rude overall and would insult me about my weight, yelling across the street in downtown, confess! I know you’re pregnant! Stop lying. Yeah no thanks. I don’t care for him. But whenever I didn’t invite him to my graduation, none of his side of the family showed up. Not my uncles or grandma. They attended all my cousins and my sisters. Just not mine. I really want them at my wedding but I’m afraid they wouldn’t come if I didn’t invite him. So I did. I told him if he can be mature, then he could come. And he immediately said he was walking me down the aisle. I said no and laughed. Obviously. I was surprised he asked but he always felt entitled to my life so it’s not so surprising. He popped off about how I was embarrassing him. Sent me long messages about it but at least he didn’t call me a bitch like he used to. He said he wouldn’t come if he couldn’t walk me down the aisle. I told my grandma everything and she took his side. “It would make him so happy and he is the father. The father is supposed to walk you down the aisle. He isn’t dead!” She asked if he could walk me with my mom and I said no. I asked her if she would attend my wedding even if he didn’t and she said yes. My father texted me asking if my mom allowed him to replace her in walking me down the aisle could he do it. That was just his typical manipulation tactic and it’s honestly impressive. He could pressure my mom into it or blame her if she didn’t let him. I said absolutely not and it has nothing to do with her. Well he called me back and said it’s ridiculous I should expect him to set aside his embarrassment and pretend like nothing is happening between us. I didn’t tell him anything he just rants and talks to himself btw. He said he would come and I said if he makes another fit the invitation is rescinded. He’s also offering me 10K for the wedding. I never take his money because he believes he’s entitled to things. I still want to uninvited him tbh and not take his money. I don’t want him there. But it just makes it easier for everyone I guess. Should I let him walk me down the aisle to avoid drama at my wedding? Should I continue to make the effort for his side of the family? Not sure what to do. I love them all deeply, they raised me, but they aren’t putting in any effort and don’t seem to care about me as much.",

I just let the videos play on auto play and the amount of times I have to stop and at least check the comments or turn it off is getting too much. Some of their takes are so judgemental and sound like they're coming from a place of privilege or ignorance or both. Especially for someone like Sam who is clearly talking out of a different end of himself. Sometimes he has really good things to say but I can't take him seriously. I don't like to lump Christians together because I know wonderful ones who actually follow what that religion is about but I feel like it has to do with it. They come off progressive and open minded but then their bubble shows and it's uncomfortable. The only person who seems to questions these things or even himself is Brandon but it seems for the most part he can be too passive and soft. I like the vibes for the most part but even the guests they bring on can be so incredibly judgemental in such an empathetic way that it gives me whiplash. I know it would be difficult but I wish they would let their own episodes play in the background. It's interesting to see how they can be vs. the audience they attract. I hope they get better.",

      "content_preview": "My 29m boyfriend (of 6yrs) wants me (31f) to start paying half of all maintenance costs to a boat he bought at the beginning of our relationship. We use the boat pretty consistently throughout the season, and the current agreement has always been I buy any drinks/food/snacks, and he buys the gas when we go out. 75% of the time our friends are also coming out with us and giving him either $$/beer to contribute to gas. For context, it’s a 19ft boat, so the cost to fill up the tank each time is relatively low. He’s paid off the boat (has been for a while now), so normal maintenance/cost is minimal year to year. This year though, he’s having to fix a couple of things, which has ended in him spending about $800 in total for repairs. He’d originally told me $300 for the total cost, so I’d agreed to contribute $150. He did not realize the full cost of the special tools he’d had to buy in addition to the kit though, as well as the tire on the boat trailer blew, so that $800 cost includes 2 new tires as well. He also mentioned one wheel needs a new bearing, which makes me think he expects me to help with that too. I would be pulling money out of my savings, which are already tight, to cover the new $400 cost of repairs. I also don’t know that I fully agree with being on the hook for repairs to a boat I didn’t buy, and have nothing to gain from when he eventually sells it. In terms of our financial situation, we both make around the same amount, with him making a nut hair more than I do, and split our shared living expenses 50/50. Our expenses are about the same too, although his only match mine because of his toys (boat, snowmobile, truck, etc), whereas mine used to be higher than his (before purchased toys) because of my student loans. I’m inclined to give him the $150 to appease him this time around (but not contribute to future repairs), and as a comprise, start covering the full cost of gas in future seasons. I do absolutely love our time on the boat, but honestly don’t even know if I should really be paying all of the gas either? This feels like something that was his choice, but he now wants me to contribute half because of unexpected costly repairs. Edit: Thank you all for your input, this is definitely the clarity I needed to make sure I was approaching this in a reasonable way. I plan on talking to him about this tonight and will circle back with an update tomorrow.",

      "content_preview": "Buckle up, this is a long one! Updates to come soon… Please forgive the disorganization, it’s been years of this mess😅 So, let’s go back to 2020… my husband was deployed from 11/2019–10/2020. He (who we’ll call Ethan) and “Vanessa” had “Lila” in 01/2019. So Ethan was not able to get much bonding time with his daughter before deployment. Vanessa decided that she couldn’t “just be somebody’s wife forever” and wanted a divorce, they split 03/2020. He sent her about $450 on the 1st and 15th of every month to cover food and whatever other needs. He would even send extra if needed. She even went as far as to blow thousands on his military travel card (he got in trouble with his chain of command for this) that he had to pay back 4–5k within a short timeframe. Ethan and I met/started talking at the very end of June 2020. Because he was still deployed and not able to get the divorce finalized, Vanessa calls me his mistress to this day lol. I saw him every month during the deployment after we met. Vanessa never once brought the baby down to see her father even after he offered to pay. (She was a stay-at-home mom and insisted on working even though she made less than daycare costs.) Anyhow, during the deployment she stopped answering questions about the baby, she wouldn’t answer calls, and constantly gave excuses as to why she was busy and it never happened. When they first separated, he asked her about what the plan was for parenting time/custody. Her response: “custody will be with me” … “your little play thing will never be around my kid and neither will you💯” … “idk how you’re possibly going to provide diapers or anything when I’m not going to be around you to get them. So you will pay me for your child, or I will get you fucked up. I’m asking for money for your child. That you claim you care so much about” … “I hope you rest in shit knowing you’re keeping your child away from things she needs” … “deadbeat.” He asked “and that’s not keeping my kid from me?” She said “I’m damn sure going to do it now” … “if you were a real father you’d know her shoe size” (while he was deployed, mind you). Come to find out, she was dating a married soldier and had him staying in Ethan’s house on base. 👀 When Ethan got back from his deployment, she picked him up LATE ASF, knowing what time he got back. And dropped him off at the house, which she left trashed and hoarded. Dirty dishes, full cat boxes, a room so trashed you couldn’t see the floor—each room had its own level of disaster. She ended up living in that married soldier’s house while his PREGNANT WIFE was at his house on base and he was deployed as well. Ethan messaged her within the timeframe she set to let her know that he would be picking up Lila at the MP station on base at the set time she chose for pick-up/drop-off. His words were: “I will be meeting you at the mp station to pick up Lila @1800 Friday.” She said: “uh no you won’t Ethan. We’re not even in the state. Have a good day. And if you’d like to see Lila, you don’t demand anything of me. Have some respect. Good day.” She then blocked him, and he had no response from his messages about his daughter from March 2021–June 2021. He asked her to meet him at the park by base to talk. After his mother had a brief conversation with Vanessa and she shared that she would be leaving the state, Vanessa agreed since his mother helped set things up. She finally told him she was moving—but not where. We just knew it was out of state. (We were in Kentucky/Tennessee at the time.) He then served her a motion to enforce parenting time and if she continued to keep the child away he requested that full custody be awarded to the father. Ethan had been holding off on this as he hoped she would stop the nonsense and let him be a father, but was pushed into action when his mother told him Vanessa was leaving the state. She saw full custody and snapped—started yelling at him and telling him to “get away from my daughter” … “leave us alone” … “you’re dangerous.” She even called the police to say he was harassing her and was trying to escort the child to the car (because the park had a 6-lane highway surrounding it, it’s the median of Ft Campbell Blvd). She stuttered when trying to say “I fear for my safety” and completely stopped the act to say “huh?” when the operator asked her something. Ethan ended up leaving to keep the peace, especially because he literally had the sheriff there right before all that to serve her the paperwork. After that day, she has kept the child from him since. The court hearing was scheduled. Vanessa had recently lost a family member and had come into a bit of money from that, and she had gotten a lawyer that was one of the best—and many lawyers we talked to wouldn’t fight them. They filed a bunch of motions and the court date ended up not even addressing the initial motion. Multiple court dates later, we had the time wrong by like 30 min, unfortunately 30 min late. And EVERYTHING Vanessa said got put in black and white as if it were facts. Calling Ethan a danger, she fled to northern Illinois (8 hrs from where we were at) because of fear of him, he slashed her tires, the child is autistic and the court doubts his ability to care for the child, and that no less than supervised visitation between Ethan and the child, Lila, with a supervisor and place of the mother’s choosing. Ethan ended up being an RBT (registered behavioral technician) to combat the autism claim, which the mother denied every time it was brought up, saying the court made that assumption. Even to this day, there’s no confirmation of a diagnosis or lack thereof. Her lawyer is now also saying the child may be on the spectrum. We couldn’t afford a lawyer. Ethan just got out of the military and they wouldn’t change his child support order from while he was in. His income is significantly lower. He petitioned to the child support office countless times and never got a response. We set up supervised visitation in Vanessa’s city for every other weekend after we moved north (2.5 hrs from Vanessa and Lila) and that slowed down as Vanessa started making false accusations, so Ethan cut contact completely in fear of what she may do. She had filed an emergency order of protection ex parte (without needing the other party to grant) and was saying he followed her at work, that he was saying “predatory” things to his child (even though every conversation he had with the child was supervised), she tried to say he threatened her with a gun while he was deployed and she had the gun in her possession at the time, amongst other false accusations and claims from the relationship. Ethan has no record of violence or substance abuse in any way, shape, or form. Nothing in the military or civilian life. Luckily the judge saw through it and denied it. But it coincided that the supervisor at the visitation place told Ethan that his case was the ONLY case they had without an order of protection, and that in Illinois they can’t enforce supervised visits without a risk of danger to the child or an order of protection, and that it was odd and we should look into it. We assume they told Vanessa the same, so she thought “I might lose control” and made shit up to file that. Also, we had just told Lila that she was going to be a big sister since I was pregnant. It’s now August 2025. We got a lawyer at the end of June after selling one of our vehicles (the one she accused him of following her in) and filed for a change in child support, allowing parenting time without restrictions, and a couple other small things. Ethan now gets to have 3 calls with Lila a week, and we just had an in-person supervised visit with her for three hours with myself, my husband (Ethan), our son, Lila, the supervisor, and Ethan’s family stopped by to see us all too. The supervisor said that Vanessa was trying to say Lila was going to be scared, she wasn’t going to recognize her dad, etc. The supervisor said okay, “Lila do you know what your daddy looks like?” She said “yes!” He said “okay, when you see him point to him.” She said “he’s right there!” He said “okay, run to him.” And she ran right to Ethan and gave him a big hug and jumped into his arms in the middle of a crowded park. The visit went great. The last 10 min, Ethan and Lila were running around in the park and apparently Vanessa pulled up and parked a few minutes early. She said to the supervisor that she had sat and watched them play and that she doesn’t want to continue the supervised visits. And that she was “touched” or “so moved seeing them play together.” A COMPLETE 180 from any other conversation we’ve had with her in the past 4–5 YEARS. So, what do y’all think? Did she finally grow up and change? Is it just for the child since she finally saw them interact for the first time since Lila was barely walking and saw that she was actually happy with her father despite her feelings towards him and saying he’s not a good dad? Is she trying to set him up for more accusations in court? We have court next Wednesday 09/03/2025, so I will have an update on what the court decides for custody and child support. ⸻ Conversation from when they separated and decided they were getting divorced while he was still deployed: V- “I’m moving to where I need to go, I’m doing what I need to for my child. You do you. That’s it. We have nothing to discuss. Goodbye. I’m going to jag tomorrow.” E- “I need to know where my daughter will be, we need to discuss custody, etc. and ok, just let me know.” V- “where she will be does not concern you. Custody will be to me. Goodbye.” Around Thanksgiving 2020, we literally had a phone conversation between the three of us adults, talked about her and I meeting since I would be around the child amongst other things to us moving forward with life. That lasted until about February or March when Ethan told her that they weren’t friends, they were co-parents. She got butt hurt and accused him of using/manipulating her to get close to his child. And stopped letting us see Lila. This was even before she was served with paperwork. We saw Lila once after that because Vanessa had gone back to her hometown to take care of things from her family member dying and couldn’t make it back to pick up Lila from Ethan’s mom. So we picked her up, Vanessa met us at the MP station the next day, that was the last time Lila was in our home. Also, in between Vanessa fleeing the TN/KY area to N IL, Ethan kept asking for them to figure this out before court so they could just move on. She kept saying “take me to court since that’s how you wanted to handle this.” She even tried to enforce supervised visits before the court ordered it. Through all of this, Ethan kept trying to ask questions about Lila and how she was doing. Vanessa always made it like he was trying to say she’s a bad mom (always about her of course). She would just say “she’s fine,” wouldn’t send pictures of Lila, sometimes wouldn’t respond at all, especially when she blocked Ethan. She I guess had these expectations of what it was supposed to look like with Ethan as a dad, when she didn’t have her dad growing up, neither did Ethan. He tried explaining that he was a first-time dad and didn’t know all the questions to ask or what to do and they needed to work together. She was relentless. Other important notes: Ethan is a disabled veteran. We tried mediation through the courts but that was unsuccessful. Those meetings were 8/14 and 8/21. The first one, Vanessa was saying no less than supervised visits for at least a year and that she needed to see consistency. (Side note: he did over a year of supervised visits at the place he went every other weekend before the accusations started.) The next meeting, she said at least a couple more months since they told her a year wasn’t realistic. Then two days later after the supervised visit in person she flips the script???? Mind you, her boyfriend is the one that’s present for these 3 calls a week. She hasn’t been present for any other than one. She works as a nurse in a hospital in a big city, and she’s in evening classes for school. So she trusts a man she’s known all of 5–6 years at the MOST, more than the man she made the child with. She also once made the comment “only stupid mothers let their child get raped.” Another note: all that talk she had about how she feared him etc??? Well, we knew where she lived for months before we told her we knew. She had been filing claims to Ethan’s health insurance under her address, but his name on the paperwork. (Fraud???) So when we got married in July 2021, I found those claims and we just kept note of it since we couldn’t afford a lawyer yet. We didn’t tell her we knew until it was about Christmas time. She acted all scared, but all we’ve done is send presents for Lila on holidays/birthdays. We theorize she is so “scared” because she knows what she’s doing is wrong. She’s even accused him of doing all the things she’s literally done as far as deceptive behavior, wanting to keeping the child away, you name it. Alsoooo!!! We only found out about the court date in June that started this revolution of us getting a lawyer because we were on the county website looking for something and I decided to look up my husband and saw he had a court date for the following Monday (we found it on Saturday). After that court date was what triggered us to hire the lawyer and get things in motion.",

      "content_preview": "I’m 13, and my mum often tells me I’m either really intelligent or just idiotic. She compares me to everyone around me, saying they’re “better” than me or “worse” than me. When I mess up something small, she goes on long rants about how I’m stupid, idiotic, lazy, and that she was wrong to ever think I was smart. Same reaction to if I call my friend infront of her for a minute, and tell her what my friends wanna be. My friends are the best people in my life... She keeps saying I can't succeed because of them and I need friends that wanna be doctors (all my friends wanna go in the medical field) and when I try to tell her what they wanna do she denies their goals and says \"their all gonna be bakers and trash collectors\". My friends are the ones always convincing me to do my work though... If she sees me playing a game (which I only do maybe once a month), she gets super mad and starts yelling. She'll start yelling about how I only wanna talk to boys (I'm scared of boys) and telling my dad about how they can't waste money on a stupid b1tch like me, etc etc. the exact same thing has happened many times. The thing is, I do get good grades most of the time even when I study for just 10 minutes or so, but I also really struggle with deadlines, burnout, and just getting things done. I’ve tried to explain that to her, but she uses it against me, saying it proves I’m stupid. It makes me feel really small and like no matter what I do, it’s never enough. I went to the doctor with her and I go to the doctor alot for many issues, he noticed and said it all stems from the mental state. He prescribed a visit to the pediatrician and something to do with developmental issues, as well as my counsellor. But when we got home my mum kept saying things like \"You really think you have mental health issues? Your sister already has autism don't give us more to deal with. Were gonna be known as a family of psychopaths.\" I always try to hold in my tears because she gets mad when I cry, but I'm really sensitive so it's hard. I just go in my room afterwards and cry a lot. And I'm going to my friends house in a bit to work on a project, can someone tell me how to not be sad the entire time I'm there?? I’m so sad, because her words switch around so much. sometimes she says I’m intelligent, other times she says I’m the biggest idiot. I don’t know what to believe about myself anymore.",

      "content_preview": "I'm 18f and so is my crush. So, there's this girl I like. Let's call her Honey, because she's so sweet. We work together, and I caught feelings for her. I don't even know when, I just remember suddenly realizing that I like her. The only people who know I'm bisexual are my two coworkers, Lola and Tyler. Lola and I were already friends before we worked together, and Tyler and I clicked the moment we met and literally tell each other everything. Neither of them know I like Honey. No one knows. I think I'd rather die than tell anyone because it's so pathetic to have a crush on a girl who has a boyfriend. She also says that she's straight, so that makes me feel even more stupid. (I sort of doubt that she's straight, but I'll explain why later.) I try my best to keep my distance from Honey for my own sanity, but she wants to be my friend so badly for some reason. She always tells me that she feels like we'd be really good friends and texts me outside of work. She also always complains if I don't text her back immediately, and gets upset when I don't make eye contact with her when we're talking. So today we were catching up since we hadn't seen each other in a while. She told me that she broke up with her boyfriend. I already knew this since she posted something about being single on her story, but I wanted to seem cool, so I pretended like I didn't. But then she told me that they got back together. My heart literally sank to the pits of hell when she said that. When I asked her why, she said that she was scared, and then he basically forced her back into a relationship with him. She said that he's really violent and yells at her and treats her like shit. When I asked her why she's with him, she said that she's scared to break up with him and that she doesn't have feelings for him anymore. I was mostly quiet because I was upset, and she thought that I didn't care, but I honestly care so much. Honey is genuinely heaven on earth, she is the sweetest person in the entire world, and I'd give her everything, and it's killing me that she's with someone who treats her like she's nothing. I want to be there for her, but I don't know what to do. I just get so weird when I'm around her. I want her to leave him, but I know it's more complicated than that. I'm mostly scared that he'll hurt her if he hasn't already, and I wish we were closer so I could offer more help, but I don't want to overstep. I'd do more, but there's this weird tension between us every time we talk, and I don't want her to think I'm doing this because I like her and want her to myself. I truly do just want her to be safe and away from him. Has anyone been in this sort of situation? If so, is there anything I can do or say to support her without crossing boundaries? Also, for anyone who wants to know why I don't think she's straight. (BTW, this is just for me to rant since I have no one I can tell in real life.) She is really touchy with me, and whenever we talk, she brings her face really close to mine. Whenever we're talking and I make eye contact with her, she starts to smile and her cheeks turn pink. I called her by a nickname once, and she smiled so hard so I never did it again. One day, she made a joke that I was following her around like a dog, and when I said that I wasn't, she was like, \"Yeah, like you'd never do that.\" In a flirtatious way. She also once told me that she'd do whatever I wanted and often says things like that randomly, as if she wants them to be taken out of context. She also really likes it when I tease her for some reason. I had something in my hand and held it up since she was trying to snatch it from me, and she got all up in my space and was pressed up against me, idk it was weird. But idk maybe I'm delusional. I think she at least knows I have a soft spot for her. She just never acts like that with anyone else, so I'm not sure what to think. I try to shut her down whenever she gets like that, just cause she's so cute and I don't wanna get my hopes up, but idk. That's it. Help.",

      "content_preview": "I (F, 49) got married 2 years ago for the first time after many years of difficult relationships. My mom died when I was a teen, my dad and I were strained, and my mom’s family, two aunts, uncles, and cousins stepped in. I was especially close to my cousin Cara, who’s been like a big sister. Another older cousin, Bonnie, is part of the same group but has always been more difficult. She fights with people, takes things personally, and often causes drama. When I got engaged, I wanted Cara as MOH, but to avoid drama I made all four of my female cousins bridesmaids: Cara, Bonnie, and two younger ones on my dad’s side (Tara & Joy), who were struggling financially. I asked for low-key, affordable events. I had a separate winery day with friends and so for my family bachelorette I told my bridesmaids I just wanted a dinner. Cara is a generous event planner who understood my younger cousins were in very different financial situations than her and Bonnie. Bonnie kept insisting everything be split evenly, complained constantly to me about Cara not sharing receipts, and tried to control things. To make Bonnie feel “special” , I invited her to my dress fittings and made that her thing.  (and asked her not to tell Cara to avoid hurt feelings). The shower was beautiful and I sent long thank-you notes to each bridesmaid. But the “simple” family bachelorette became a spa day + dinner + overnight + brunch. At the dinner people made lovely speeches. I was overwhelmed and a bit emotional. First, at finally finding my person after so long and also being in a room with so many important women in my life and missing my mom. I decided I’d compose myself and do a thank you speech at the brunch in the morning. I was assigned to stay in the bridal suite with Bonnie and her mom, yet I slept on the pull-out couch. I didn’t complain. They were paying, I was grateful. The next morning, while packing cupcakes Cara had made, Bonnie burst out of the bathroom accusing me of being an ungrateful bridezilla and announcing to Cara that she’d been coming to dress fittings with me behind her back. I told her she was a “twisted bitch” and left in tears. Brunch was canceled. Cara and I spent the day together compared notes and realized Bonnie had been feeding me lies for months (all the while Bonnie is texting Cara pics from all my dress fittings!!). I blocked Bonnie from my phone/socials and my husband and I sent a joint email she could only attend the wedding “in peace” or she’d be removed. My husband has two children and it was our first concern that the day be calm for them. I briefly unblocked her at another cousin’s request and she immediately said I owed her an apology for blocking her!! I only kept her in the wedding for my aunt’s sake, but even looking at the photos now gives me a knot in my stomach. The year after, both Cara and I lost our dads. Then Bonnie had an altercation with my brother at a family party (too long of a story but you get the picture here with Bonnie) getting in his face until I alerted her boyfriend who dragged her away. She screamed lies about “caring for our dying father” (she visited him once purely because she was visiting Cara’s dad and they were in the same facility). I called her a twisted bitch again. That was it for me. Now Bonnie demands I apologize for “name calling” over the years, but every instance was a direct reaction to her behavior. My aunt (her mom), who once complained to me about Bonnie’s abuse, now backs her victim narrative and has said awful things to me. My brother, SIL, and I have cut ties completely. Others in the family do the bare minimum with her but tell me privately they agree. I know I’m protecting my peace, but my Italian-Catholic guilt creeps in. So, AITA for saying my apology era is over? PS - pls don’t judge me about being an “older bride” and doing all the traditional stuff. (Also we are Italian and we just don’t do “small” events!) Remember this is my FIRST marriage. I met my current husband at 41 after a few relationships where I put up with a lot of mistreatment. I have been through hell and back and went to a million weddings, was in weddings and spent a ton of money on everyone else for years. My husband and I paid for our entire wedding and there is zero reason why age should be the reason you don’t have what all the rest of everyone had because I didn’t meet my husband when I was 25.",

      "content_preview": "There’s a woman on my street, we can call her “Vicky.” We’re not friends, but friendly enough to wave if we see each other. She will occasionally receive my mail (address numbers are only off by 1 number), although there have been packages that have just come up \"missing\" that the post office will say have been delivered but she claims she never got. Over the last few months though, I’ve noticed a few things that are honestly starting to get a little weird. It started with my laptop bag. I have this unique bag that was originally a larger designer bag I thrifted, but I am an artist so I've modified it and now have some custom artwork on it. A couple weeks after we saw each other outside when I had it, Vicky showed up with an eerily similar one. I figured it was a coincidence, especially because I know it's the only thing I have ever designed like that. Then it was my dog. My husband and I have a small dog breeding thing happening. Not to sell, just because we wanted more of our dog who's the bestest boy who ever lived. Turns out he's a hell of a dog husband and dog dad too. 💜 He/they are a designer breed, not something I'd ever actually heard of before we found him. After we got to researching when we decided to get him a couple of wives, I realized they're \"known\" enough to have their own category on websites. A few months later, Vicky got the exact same breed. I even overheard her telling someone she “got the idea from someone in the neighborhood.” That by itself isn't weird; we love our dogs. I tell everyone about them. Then she joined my gym. I hardly go and I know for a fact I've never told her anything about me and a gym. Then she started following me on Apple Music and her history became pretty much identical to mine. The weirdest part? She’s started changing how she dresses, even her hair. She straight up went from long black hair to short platinum blonde like me. My friend visited recently and we were outside at one point when Vicky was leaving, and she waved and smiled at me like normal. After she pulled off, my friend looked at me weird and said \"Why does she remind me of… you?” This isn’t a scary movie. She’s never been threatening. She’s always sweet and kind and says things like “I love your (literally anything. Dog, shirt, bag, etc)!” But it’s crossing from flattery into uncanny valley. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to confront anyone about anything, but it’s genuinely starting to creep me TF out. Is there anything I should do? I'm not really worried she's gonna try to unalive me and wear my skin or anything, but I've seen enough movies to know... What if she does?",

      "content_preview": "Am I seriously overreacting for wanting to distance myself from my so-called best friend because she didn’t bother to say happy birthday on my actual birthday? I’m a Female in my late 30s and I’ve had this \"best friend\" for over a decade. Her birthday comes around and I’m always planning something thoughtful. Every. Single. Year. Especially since she’s estranged from her family. I’ve gone out of my way to make sure she feels loved and remembered. So this August, it was my turn. My birthday came and went and guess what I got from her on the actual day? Crickets. No text. No call. Just silence. Two days later I finally get a message. And the cherry on top? Her boyfriend texted me before she did. The same boyfriend she's had for about a year now, which conveniently lines up with when she started fading out of our friendship. Yes, I got a gift at the beginning of the month. But you know what it felt like? Like her boyfriend dragged her to get it early just to check it off the list. Zero thought. Zero heart. Just something to say she did it. And maybe I could’ve brushed it off if it weren’t part of a bigger pattern. Earlier this year I was going through one of the roughest periods of my life. She barely checked in. Barely asked how I was doing. But then when her job started stressing her out? Suddenly I exist again because now she needs advice. Convenient! I feel like I’m just on standby in her life. A support system when it’s convenient. A placeholder until she needs something. So now that I’ve finally had enough and decided to put some distance between us to protect my peace, people are telling me I’m overreacting. Really? Because I expected my best friend of 10 years to remember my birthday and maybe send a text? That’s too much now? So yeah. Am I really overreacting or is it fair to be done playing the background character in someone else's story?",

      "content_preview": "I'm going to preface this saying TW: child death: I(31f) am the only person on my mother's side that has a relationship with my brother(39m). He has always been a bit volatile, having anger issues and adhd since a child and finding out he was also bipolar when he was in the navy. My brother blames my mother for multiple things that our father and stepmother has twisted into their favor when we were younger, and when my brother had his first child and was being a complete a-hole about the thing, my mother supported his baby mother by even being on her side during court trials (yes, multiple, at least once a year my brother would take his bm to court over ridiculous things, all being charade by his current wife.). Between the manipulation of our father and stepmother (they tried the same tactics on me and it never worked, I could see thru the bs and have reviewed the receipts and also have several memories of them never being there for me except when it was convenient to them), his mental issues, and his crazy controlling wife, he had cut all ties with our mother's side but me. I've always claimed Switzerland, thinking if I stayed neutral than I can continue to see my nephews and nieces while keeping a relationship with my only sibling (I have half/step siblings from my father's side, but due to lack of communication and effort on their side even with my own continued attempts, I've given up on those relationships and dont see them as true siblings). There's been times my brother had tried to use our relationship to better his stance in court with his eldest, but I always put my foot down and saying no, and it got so bad one year that my brother thought me having my truck break down preventing me from visiting him on christmas was a slight to him and that I was just not wanting to see him due to being on his bm/my mom's side (he offered to come get me, but I lived with my mom at the time and since she didnt want him to have her address, I refused out of respect for her. I offered to meet him down the street elsewhere and even his bm offered to drive me to him and back, and he declined all other options). So, my brother can be a little psychotic. He sees things in a warped view and his wife likes to warp that view even more (very toxic). Now, my only son died in December. He was my only child, I was told I couldn't have children before him so he was truly a miracle to me. My pregnancy with him had me in the hospital 6 times due to being high risked (type 2 diabetic), and he was a little early (37 weeks). I had even recorded a video for if something happened during the pregnancy/birth where there was a situation where they had to pick me or the baby to survive, that my child would be picked first. Everything I did after he was born was always to be his benefit, I always made sure my work schedule correlate with his doc appts and his dad's work schedule, I didnt go out very often ans was constantly home with him bc watching him was more entertainment and fulfilling than any night out. I was full one of those \"best thing ever happened to me\" type of person bc my son was. He was always happy, healthy, and well taken care of. His dad and I separated when he was 2 yo but we were co-parenting really well, didn't involve the courts, had a set custody schedule that worked well, and we would always be excited and not talk down about each other around him. He was a child, we didnt ever want him to feel the negativity of our relationship and we still care about each other but our relationship just was done. My son didnt have any health issues except for a benign cis on the side of his brain and a speech delay that we had him in school for. The day of the accident... I was house sitting for my brother's bm, we've became close over the past 17 years and she's truly been like a sister to me. I'm closer to her family and sons as I was always invited over meanwhile my brother almost never had me over, bm also had a closer connection to my son due to this so that's her nephew. I was house sitting for a couple weeks while her and her husband went on vacation, I was there primarily to watch the dogs ans make sure my nephews didnt get into any trouble. I work remotely so this situation was fine for me, ans my son was off from school due to it being winter break, and my nephews were finishing school before break. During the first weekend I only had one of my nephews and my son (the other nephew was at his bio mom's place), so we were relaxing for a late morning. My son (3.5 yo at this time) was a very energetic child, and he loved running around the back yard with the dogs. The back yard is small, there was a pool but it had a 6ft mesh fence, the type that is impossible to get through and very child safe - they actually got this bc of my son and another friends son being so young and we were always over, so the fence was purposely bought for child-proof safety reasons. My nephew and I were in and out of the house, playing games but stopping and checking on my son who was running in and out of the house and backyard. There's also cameras around the house and all gates were locked. However, my son was quite literally too smart for his own good. He saw a pile of things against the wall next to the pool fence and climbed over it, and unfortunately drowned. It was a near-impossible scenario, the police have cleared it as an accident, and I know people will come for me in the comments, but it was something I never thought would happen. I'm still haunted by that day, having to do cpr on my child's cold wet body while begging the universe for him to survive. My son still had a faint heartbeat when the paramedics arrived, but passed a few days later in the hospital. The first day in the hospital, I had my mom and step dad, my son's father and his parents while we stayed in the monitoring room. My mom had mentioned if I had reached out to my brother - afterall, this is his nephew, he'd want to know. I honestly haven't been wanting to call him but I was really in need of familial support and thought that he should know as well as prep to talk to my niece/nephews if the worst was to happened, and I knew there'd be drama if he saw something online instead of directly from me. I called him and told him what happened, and immediately got a tangent of how much an idiot I am and why did I allow my son around the pool and he couldn't believe how I allowed this to happen. I was completely stunned, but I knew bother of our emotions was high and I was just hurt because of the situation, so I accepted his words and asked him if he and the kids/wife would be able to come to the hospital or if they'd want to visit in case this is the last time they could. He first declined because he felt numb from all of the recent death on our family (his wifes grandmother had passed earlier in the year and our father passed the October before this, and my brother has been helping our half siblings deal with the house/assets left behind-which I signed a document previously relinquishing all rights to just a week after his passing bc I had no rights to anything in my siblings eyes. I had even asked them if they'd be okay if I got memorial tattoo for him and my step mother previously, bc even though they weren't very active in my life, they still were an important part to it, which my brother thought was a ridiculous idea since I wasnt \"really part of the family\"). I talked to him a bit longer and he agreed that he would come down by himself, but that our mother better not be there. He arrived and gave me a hug and held my son's hand for a bit but left fairly soon after that, saying the tension of being near our mom was too much. The next day when we were told to say our goodbyes, I invited him over again, and he showed and supported us as we had to take my son off life support (he wasnt having any brain activity and he had coded several times up to this point, and watching the team do compressions on my son will always haunt me). He stayed until the end with other family that was there and was overall the additional support I needed. When it came to my son's funeral, I had asked my brother if him and his family would be coming. He said the kids wont be there bc they didnt really knew my son and he didnt want to traumatize them more by making them show up, but him and his wife would be part of the procession (we're a biker family and we were planning a biker procession). I told him I understood and left it at that the day of the funeral only my brother showed up on his bike, saying that his wife didnt want to come. I've been mentally and emotionally exhausted since everything happened and I just didn't really care anymore and I didnt say anything. My brother stayed thru the funeral and followed us to the reception but left immediately bc he didnt \"feel welcomed\" even though most people didnt even know who he was, even my son's dad's mom was trying to make sure my brother had food and drink among other family/friends just being friendly and consoling. I understand that it was probably hard on him too but the lack of support from him and his wife/family has been making me more and more angry over the past 8 months. My brother hasn't reached out to me much, just like before we never really talked unless I instigated the conversation. I had breakfast with him and wife/kids a few weeks later but otherwise I haven't heard from them, and I know if I call and ask to come over I can, but it's only a one way effort relationship between us. He doesn't check in, and only talks to me if I reach out first. I dont feel very close to my brother, and honestly just the idea of calling him is exhausting, but there's been resentment growing since the way he spoke to me the day of the accident. I've been told im too nice, I give ppl multiple chances normally bc I try to believe the best in everyone, but I'm wondering if its time I cut ties with my brother. Ill lose contact with my niece and nephews due to this unfortunately, but I cant get past his words and actions from the day and I've been closely looking over our past several years interactions and I'm realizing almost every one involves him trying to use me in one way or another.

      "content_preview": "Now I want to put this in full context. I 34F have a daughter with 34M. She is 14 years old and she is in my care 24/7. She was born with a blood disorder that resulted in her having a splenectomy at age 9, which requires her to take penicillin every 12 hours. It’s always been me and my daughter, with her father coming in and out, being picture papi, posing as if he helps me with anything when in reality, he makes promises and breaks them daily. I could write an entire book on the nonsense this man has done since we had our daughter but I want to focus on this damn trip he’s sprung on me. My daughter has been in and out of the hospital since she was a baby. I lost jobs and opportunities because when she gets sick or has flare up I am the only one that is ever there consistently. I can count on one hand the number of times he has taken her to a doctors appointment. There have been many times in the past 10 years where he said he was going to do something for her birthday or holiday and ALWAYS had an excuse the day of, as to why he can’t. Leaving my daughter crying from disappointment and then I have to try and do something last minute to try and make up for it. Then I get the attitude from my daughter like I was the one who let her down. It’s a very annoying cycle, but I don’t want to limit her interaction with her father even tho he is a complete ass. Now again he sends my daughter a text saying he is taking her to DR, this man hasn’t taken my daughter the Dr. (doctor) but wants to take her to DR He hasn’t done any planning or arrangements for this trip and I am suppose to be ok with this. My daughter is excited for this trip but I feel like he has an agenda behind it and it’s not to spend actual time with his child. He does things for show and I don’t trust it but i don’t want my daughter to feel like I’m blocking her time with her dad because I don’t trust him to take care of her. He’s never taken her for any significant time here in the USA but he wants to take my daughter to DR for 5 days? Am I the asshole",

      "content_preview": "Sorry, this will be a bit long as I would like to provide all relevant information to make an informed decision. I (37F) and my husband (37M) have two children (3 years and 7 months). We have been together for 5 years. A bit of geography background: We are living in my husband's city. His immediate family lives a 45 minute drive from us. My family lives 15 hour drive from us. When my husband and I get into arguments, he would throw the fact that \"you never let my family visit!\" in my face. However when we are not arguing he would voice how disappointed he was with his family for not seeing our children. I used to think I wasn't the asshole in this situation but being told so many times, it makes me second guess myself. I am the primary parent to our children. I stay home with them, care for them, take care of the household, ect. My husband works and unfortunately has that old school \"women take care of the kids and house while men work\" mentality. I never used to mind his family visiting, and I still don't mind having his family over. However, throughout the years and being burned on multiple occasions by his family, it is to that point where I don't look forward to their visits. My husband's immediate family rarely come over in the first place. It is a bit of a drive for them and unrealistic to expect them to visit everyday. However, my husband's mother is in town everyday and his siblings are in town quiet often as well. His mother is in town to get groceries, driving her friends around, goes to the casino, comes in town for \"a drive\", partying, ect. The only time his mother comes over is when my husband tells her to come visit her other grandchildren. This usually occurs once every 2-3 months. My husband's mother loves to play the victim. She tells everyone that we don't allow them over. She is the type to Facebook \"I miss my grandchildren\" or \"grandma loves you so much\", but puts more effort into impressing her friends or getting drunk than getting to know my children. My husband's siblings prefer to party than visit us. My eldest is 3 years old and I can count on one hand the amount of times they came to visit. My husbands nephew (15), who he is close to, has been aggressive and jealous to my eldest. To the point where I do not allow him anywhere near my eldest without me watching. He is under my husband's mother's care and is very spoiled and highly favored by the rest of the family. There are two big reasons why I am not a fan of his family. I know I sound like an asshole, but please hear me out. First reason, when they try to come over they are either sick, within that contagious intubation period, or coming from a crowded event. The people that live in this city have a strong belief against vaccines and safe protocols to protect others. We have high cases of cough/cold and covid year around. We also even have meseals and whopping cough cases. So that being said, I am very cautious and screen who interacts with my children. I know I seem like a crazy germaphobic mom, but I do this because I am the only person that cares for my children when they are sick. I'm up all night watching them sleep, monitoring temperatures, providing medication, holding them when they wake up with a coughing fit, cleaning up their puke from their coughing fit, taking them to the doctors, ect. My husband does help on occasions, but he is usually in the other room sleeping as he works in the mornings. One occasion, when my eldest was only 8 months old (only child at this time), my husband's mother came over after spending the night visiting other people, not showering, and not changing clothes. She claims she had no cough and cold symptoms. She kissed my baby on the head before leaving. I later had my baby sitting in my lap and also kissed my baby on her head. The next day I started developing symptoms. I later tested positive for covid. My husband's mother also developing symptoms but refused to test. My husband came home from working out of town to care for our daughter as I didn't want to risk her contracting covid. It was horrible being sick. My head felt like it was going to explode with all the pressure and congestion. The only thing worse than that pain was not being able to hold my baby. My husband later lost his job due to being out for too long. I was pissed because his mother was the only contact we had, so it was obviously from her. There were other instances where she would ask to come over but yet post a status where she was \"up all night with a fever\" or she would want my husband to watch his nephew for a bit while she goes to the casino. She would fail to mention that he started antibiotics for a chest infection. Or his siblings would ask to come over while they are hungover or still intoxicated/high. There is nothing more heartbreaking to me, as a parent, to see my little baby burning up with a fever, so congested that breathing out of her nose is an issue, and that crying from coughing so much is draining on her. The second reason, is that my husband and his mother expects us to drive out and visit them. As previously stated they live 45 minutes away. My reasoning is that it is hard for my 7 month old to be in a carseat for that long. He typically only lasts 15 minutes and then starts fussing away to the point where he will scream at the top of his lungs until he's out of the carseat. I do my best to distract him: Snacks, peek-a-boo, and toys. I mean, he's 7 months old and just wants to crawl and explore. Even planning the trip on a naptime does not help as he will fight his nap or take a short nap. So it is very tiring to go out of our way to visit his family. I personally feel like forcing our 7 month old on a 45 minute drive to visit people that put zero effort into visiting us when they are in town everyday is a waste of my time and my children's time. I completely understand that cough and colds help the immune system and are apart of growing up. I also understand that my children getting to know their family is important. However, I am a strong believer in \"you get the same energy you give\". Why should I put so much effort into someone and put my children's health at risk for people that have proven to me, time and time again, that they don't care? They have shown that they prioritize drugs, alcohol, casino, friends, partners, and technology over watching my children grow up. It honestly gets me so upset that we live in my husband's hometown because if we lived in my hometown, my family would be over everyday. No force necessary. They would love to watch my children grow up and I would recieve more support. I probably wouldn't have post partum depression had we lived in my hometown. So Reddit, AITA for not going out of my way to have my in-laws apart of my children's life? Edit to add: Sorry. I should have been a bit more clear as I am seeing a few of the same suggestions to let the husband take the kids to his mom's without me. Husband's mother is the caretaker for the husband's nephew. The nephew that I have witnessed purposely hurt my eldest and play too rough with my eldest. So that nephew is living with husband's mother. As much as I would love to have a bit of a break and have husband take the kids to visit his mom, it's not safe for me to allow. I made it clear to my husband that his nephew is not to be allowed near my children without me there watching. I made it clear that his nephew has lost my trust and I will never trust him alone with my children. My husband is more forgiving. He thinks having the \"I talked to him and told him to be nice or else\" discussion is sufficient enough. He has had that conversation with him more than once. Call it mother's instinct, I just don't trust and will never trust that kid. As for allowing my husband's mother to take my kids/overnight stays. Definitely out of the question. His mother abuses pills. My husband will call her at 10pm and she would be slurring her words. She also is known to drink. One time, before my kids were born, she knocked on my door at 3am to drop of my husband's nephew because she wanted to continue drinking. My husband and I were living together. Husband's mother drove 45 minutes while intoxicated and with husband's nephew to drop him off. There are many more unsafe situations. Husband's mother doesn't do this everyday and husband's nephew is not always aggressive, but one is enough for me not to trust my children in his family's care without me.",

      "content_preview": "AITA for avoiding my BIL? Am I the asshole for not wanting be around my brother in law and his new wife because they had an affair? My husband's brother (Jay) cheated on his ex wife ( Hannah) of 20 years with Kate, the woman he just married a few months ago. Jay and Kate had an affair from at least 2018 until Hannah and I found out (July 2021) A mutual friend told us that they had seen Jay at the store with a woman who was not Hannah at a time Jay was supposed to be out of state on a work trip. After Hannah and I found lots of other evidence  Hannah confronted Jay and Jay took off to my inlaws place, staying there for a month before Hannah filed for divorce (Sept 2021) By October Jay was out and about with Kate and brining her to family get togethers. Knowing everything Jay has done to Hannah and their kids, I can't stand him. Hannah was a huge part of the family for years and all of a sudden my inlaws and extended family act like she never existed because Jay strayed from his marriage. Fast forward to this year Jay and Kate got married.  My husband and I got into an argument because our children and I didn't want to go support Jay and Kate on their wedding day. We have been there for Hannah and the kids, seen what Jay has put them through, and honestly can't stand Jay or Kate. Kate was married at the time of the affair as well. She kicked her disabled veteran husband out so Jay could move in, then divorced him. Now next month my husband's niece (sisters child)  is getting married and everyone is invited. Jay and Kate will be there and we were supposed to be seated with them. I reached out and asked that we not be seated with them to avoid any issues and not ruin the day. Our children don't like Jay for their own reasons anyway so I felt this was a fair alternative and the bride agreed. My MIL thinks I'm being ridiculous and I need to get over it. She knows we know about the affair, how I helped Hannah and the kids after the separation, and that my kids are not fond of Jay. My husband says he understands our feelings but still wants to sit near his brother and Kate. I'm not mad at Jay for Hannah, I'm mad that he destroyed his kids without remorse and expects everyone to be happy for him and Kate. I'm mad that my MIL wants us to fall in line and \"save face\" I know I wouldn't be able to fake it or play nice, so this was my solution.  Am I in the wrong?",

      "content_preview": "Sorry for the long post. So my husband 42m and I 41f (married for 8 years) went to a music festival over the weekend with a group of friends. It started at 2pm and went on until 11pm. We were all having a great time, until around 8pm when we all left the silent disco tent and was heading back to the VIP area as a I had told my husband I needed the toilet. As far as I was aware everyone was going to the vip area aswel. Upon exiting the toilet I found myself alone and no one around. I stayed in the vip area for a while believing that they would be coming soon, as they may have got sidetracked (it’s a large festival with lots going on and we didn’t have signal on our phones to call/txt) after around 20mins I left to go and find them and then after looking for another 20mins I finally found them in the shisha tent all sat around laughing and joking and then was laughing that I had taken so long to get there. NO ONE TOLD ME THAY WERE GOING THERE. I felt sooo upset, not from the friends but from my husband as he hadn’t even given me a second thought so I just walked back out. I went and danced in the mosh pit for a while to cool off as I was fuming and didn’t want to loose my head or cry I front of anyone. We left and went home at 10pm and my husband kept saying how sorry he was and he didn’t think, but he was drunk and it didn’t feel sincere. The next day we sat and I told him exactly how I felt being left on my own and broke down crying, he said he never ment to make me feel like that but was drunk and just didn’t think he’d been gone for so long before I found them. I feel soo hurt about the whole situation and can’t shift the sadness I feel as tho I was just forgotten about and just keep wondering how long it would have taken for him to realise I wasn’t there and if he would have actually come looking for me. I can’t even bring my self to cuddle him in bed like we usually do to fall asleep. AIOR?",

      "content_preview": "Im a stylist at a commission-based salon. When I started as an assistant I didn’t work Sundays either, though I worked 4 10 hour days assisting, plus bartending to make ends meet — basically 7 days a week — and eventually burned out. I told my salon owner I couldn’t work Wednesdays anymore, she agreed but wasn’t thrilled, and told me I needed therapy because I clearly can’t handle stress. Now I’m on the floor as a stylist. We talked about Sundays in the future, but I can’t afford to take them right now. My salon paychecks are $100–$400, while my Sunday bar shift pays more than that in one day. She was aggressive in the conversation, and I agreed to revisit later. A few months later, she calls on my day off and tells me I will start Sundays, and asked “do you think it’s fair everyone works Sundays and you don’t?” I explained my finances, and she dismissed them, saying things like “don’t you have a roommate?” and “your girlfriend should pay some bills.” She said I don’t understand the hair business and am more committed to bartending. I cried during the call. She eventually said we’d revisit in January. For context: • Only 2 of 6 stylists work Sundays. • One stylist, Emily, also doesn't work Sundays and only works 2 days a week. • Because I'm new and commission-based (after back bar we only make 30% of our services, and according to hairstylist subreddits that’s really low and not normal) I'd lose about $800/month if I worked Sundays. I feel like my finances and well-being should matter, but my owner insists nobody can build a book working thurs-sat and demands I work Sundays to “build my book\". AITA for refusing Sundays?",

      "content_preview": "Am I the asshole for asking my wife for a divorce? This is extremely long so I am sorry in advance. I, 28F and my wife, 26F, have been married for about 2.5 years, together for 4. For some background, we have technically been separated for a year which I’ll explain. Flashback to about a 14-15 months ago, there had been some turmoil in our relationship with disagreements and we got into a stagnant place. I was in the middle of therapy for PTSD from the military where I was SA’d and that led me to pull back sexually from our relationship because between taking about the situation again and going through different medications, I almost felt like I wasn’t even in my own body half the time, it was an extremely hard time for me mentally. With that, I also had some anger issues that were coming up associated with it, and I did my absolute best to keep things internalized rather than lashing out (which isn’t healthy either way, I fully understand now after months of therapy the negative impact that had on my mental health and our relationship as a whole.) Another huge stressor was one of our dogs (we had 3) that was reactive, resource guarded, submissive peed, and had attacked one of our other dogs twice. The only person he was generally good for was her, but anyone else he would completely pee his whole bladder everywhere if they even tried to leash him to take him out, including myself, so he wore belly bands 24/7, and if she forgot to put one on him before going to work, she always was the one to take him out to avoid him peeing everywhere. One day she didn’t do that and didn’t take him out before work so I had to and that’s where the big issue started. I didn’t even make it down the stairs and he peed all in his kennel, lifted his leg and peed on the carpet (again), and soaked himself and I won’t lie, I lost it. I freaked out on him which he didn’t deserve because it wasn’t his fault, I was just so over the situation after 2 years of begging her for behavioral training, medication, or even rehoming him to a single family home with no dogs so he could be less stressed and anxious all the time just to get told no all the time because those things “wouldn’t help” and we just needed to remove toys from their playing because that was why he was aggressive (side note: she worked in veterinary medicine, not sure if I mentioned that already) Between the dog situation and our relationship issues, I felt like I had to beg her for effort and attention during this time because I felt like I wasn’t getting the support I needed as I begged her to take me on dates, cook dinner here and there, help around the house, which I felt like I was doing all of that while also working full time and going to school. It always ended up in a fight where I just gave up. She did work too, she work in emergency med and worked three 12’s, so I get that she was tired but she also had more days at home and even just 1 day helping would have made a huge difference for me. Fast forward a couple months, about a year ago, she packed up and moved across the country after telling me on a Tuesday that she was leaving Thursday, and basically ghosted me, with the reasons constantly changing as to why. She said she wasn’t happy where we lived and wanted to move back home to be closer to family, even though we had been making a plan to move closer to her family with the goal being the end of 2025 so I could finish school and we could get our finances in order. She said that wasn’t soon enough. When I asked for a divorce about 2 months after she had been gone, she said she didn’t want a divorce and wanted to work on things, and she then changed the reason she left again, which was to be there with her grandmother with dementia and that she didn’t want to miss time with her (which I fully understand that because I’ve been in a similar situation). Her reasons changed again a few more times after that. She packed up while I was at work, left and took all the dogs (including the one we got together even though I begged her to leave him because he was my dog too), the first month she was there she never talked to me, stopped sharing her location, and never even reached out. Since I was mid therapy, I can’t lie, this situation sent me in to a spiral to the point where family and friends were extremely concerned I would k*ll myself (I have a history of mental health issues related to that), they got me a dog to help out with my mental health who genuinely has been a life saver for me. We have spoken on the phone 3 times, no FaceTimes, and have not seen each other in person at all. I had made plans to try to see her for the holidays last year and she wanted that but she said she need to ask her families permission (which was interesting to me, considering she had always complained about never getting along with her family. You guys can look up “AITA for ruining my sisters engagement’ for a small snippet of that) The last year we have barely made any progress, barely talked, we’ve argued more than we’ve gotten along, I’ve sent divorce papers twice (where we live we can self file as long as there are no assets to separate) and both times she either “doesn’t get them” or she gets them and send them back and they “get lost in the mail”. I’m ready to move on with life because at this point I don’t think therapy is enough to fix this, but I also feel like an ass if I don’t try. So am I the asshole if I decide to go through the courts this time to have her legally served rather than self filing? Edit: I want to say thank you to everyone’s comments and feed back! I think I just felt like the asshole because I’ve always felt that if possible, you should try to work on things before divorce, even though things happened the way they did. I come from a family where my parents were married 25 years before my dad passed and a long marriage is something I’d always hoped for. Thank you all for your advice and kind of bringing me back to reality, I appreciate it a lot",

      "content_preview": "My friend (F, 22)  and I (F, 22) had been friends since we were roughly 15 years old. We were close, but not extremely close. She has been dating this guy on and off for the past few years. They are extremely toxic. For example, he complains about things he purchased for her, calls her every name in the book, and threatens to cheat when she brings up things that bother her in their relationship or when they get into an argument. We hang out occasionally because I've realized she's a very transactional person. She realistically only texts or calls when she needs things like a job reference, help with a job application, navigating school loan applications, or applying for college grants or taxes, etc. Over time, I have really reduced the amount that I hang out with her because of it. I had nothing against her and adored her as a friend until I learned how she can be while living as a roommate with my best friend (F, 22). She slams doors, sends pictures of slightly messy areas of their living space, and overall is very particular about simple everyday messes. Again, I looked past all of this to be friends. Recently, my brother passed, and I was extremely in need of support from friends. We were so close; as adults, we were only a year and a half apart in age. We did everything together, and losing him felt like losing a piece of myself. I really relied on her being at my brother’s funeral for support. My best friend and her were supposed to drive in the same vehicle. I got a call from the other friend for directions in the middle of my brother's service. I was in no place to be giving directions, so I told her the name of the church and knew she had my best friend's location. My best friend got to the funeral alone. I asked her why she was alone and she asked to talk about it after the service so she could be there for me and I could grieve my brother. After the service, I learned our mutual friend had been talking about going on a trip. My best friend had asked who she was going with—a harmless question, right? No, she gave her a dirty look and said it was with her EX. Whom we all knew about why the most recent break up had happened. My best friend said, \"Oh,\" with a concerned tone and facial expression. In that moment, she got defensive and told my best friend, \"Yeah, so what?\" She got confrontational and started becoming insistent about talking about it with my best friend. My best friend told her it was not the time or place and that she was also hurting today and that they were getting ready to go say goodbye to a really good person. Our mutual friend told her, \"it was the time, and that she needed to shut the fuck up.\" Keep in mind my best friend had known my brother for as long as she knew me; they weren’t close, but you could tell it bothered her that he had passed. She tried to set a boundary, and she completely disregarded it. Fast forward a week later, she texts me asking to hang out. I explained to her how my friend told me what happened and that it was not okay. I said she needed to rethink her actions prior to talking to me because there was no excuse for her behavior. I told her I needed her there as a friend, and she completely skipped out. She chose not to take ownership of her actions and left it at that. She is also extremely stubborn and unable to see when she is in the wrong. The next day, she posted the word \"WOW\" in all caps on her Instagram. Knowing her, I knew this was an immediate attempt to take it to social media and that she did not take anything from what I said the previous day. It had been a month of no contact between her and I, as well as my best friend who lives with her. My best friend feels extremely uncomfortable being at home because she constantly gives her dirty looks when they are in the common areas of their home. She is also slamming doors and cabinets and aggressively walking around the house. It’s like she’s living with a bratty child. She doesn’t feel comfortable leaving her room and only does when she is not home. Furthermore, this friend had made a post on her Instagram about \"fuck fake bitches,\" which a mutual friend had told us about. I got upset and sent her a long text expressing how her behavior affected me and how she is showing she has no care for those around her. She took nothing from this and told me, \"I already said sorry; what else do you want from me?\" The moment I heard that, I knew it was not in my best interest to try and express my concerns and feelings and to cut her off. She has since been blocked on everything, A  friend of hers tried to organize a meet up so everyone could talk and she refused and said \"Im not ready to talk to them about it\". I know it may sound terrible but for her to say she wasn't ready to talk was more than enough reason for me to cut her off. My first thought was how I was not ready and I had just lost my brother but I am stepping up, being the bigger person and was willing to try to work something out. So, am I the asshole for cutting her off?",

He is now worried that I find him disgusting. I don't I tried to explain that it was a gag reflux but he just kept on asking why I would do that. I cleaned him off with a towel and he just kept saying how he isn't in to that and I had to keep repeating it wasn't on purpose, it was a gag reflex, and had nothing to do with him. I also started to cry because I was so embarrassed and now he thinks I have a pattern of crying during sex. I tried to explain that the first time I cried was because we were drunk and he asked if I was comfortable since I was drunk. I have a past of SA while while drunk and I just cried because I was never asked for consent before. This time was because I felt so bad and disgusted with myself. I am just unsure how to repair this he was so disgusted with me.",

      "content_preview": "1st Post I (28M) know I only got two comment my first post but at this point I think I'M doing it to just vent. As one of them said, my cousin reassured me that after reading the papers my mother showed him, Elsa (24F) only filed but never showed any evidence not even fake ones or at least the text I sent. She was being cited to present everything she had on me at the end of this month citing that the police were taking both claimes (SAd on 2013 and harrasment) as different cases. I was on my way home trying to think how to tell my... I don't know what we are anymore... Anna (28F) was sitting on the sofa looking at her phone and asked if I needed to tell her anything because my mother had just called her since I wasn't responding to her calls. My mind went black and I just started crying asking for forgiveness, her face didn't show any emotion and just got her laptop out. She started searching about Elsa and with a few clicks Anna found out how Elsa was in a happy long time relationship with a guy, working for the social media department of a national health program in our country. Her mother had died the year I asked to clear the air which could explain her text since her mother hated our relationship and knowing her, she loves to be perfect and us together was the only thing she dissapointed her mom on. Anna wanted to call her BF since his number was on LinkedIn but I stopped her because just as Elsa didn't have any proof of what she claims neither do we have a thing so it's more of a \"She said He said\" and I don't think he will believe strangers over her. Till now there is no emotion in her face and I hated myself for it. The day of the first post we have just went out to a date and she was showing me very excited about how a friend invited us to watch his student's final exam, he teaches acting and was trying to blend projected images, play with shadows and little to no items. It was amazing and I'm not exactly into that. I want to see her smile again but she's having some health issues so maybe I'm overthinking it and she needs another apointment with a doctor rather than me being a mess all over her. I'm starting therapy next friday, that's the only thing that got her to smile for a few seconds. I have a bad history with psychiatrists. When I was 12yo, one of my two sisters got with a guy that seemed off to me and would make weird comments about everything in general so I wasn't really interested in spending time with them. She was frustrated because we used to be very close and had not other wonderfull idea but to push my parents to make me meet with the guy's cousin who was a psychiatrist and told me to start medication as I looked like a troubled teen and was concerned over how I was not okay because there was no real reason over why I dislke the man and my parents, who loved him at the time, started to force to take some pills till the point of being overdosed because there were no real changes for them. No, my sister didn't ended the relationship and they're no so happily married till now. So me going to therapy is a big step of seeking help. I will update if anything big happens or if Elsa tries something thought I don't understand why she's out to get me if she's supposed to be so happy and sucessfull.",

      "content_preview": "Hello, everyone! TL;DR: My cousin/best friend admitted she wouldn’t care if I was depressed, which made me notice our friendship was shitty. I pulled back and don’t want her close anymore. Warning: does contain mention of suicide and depression. I (27F) have a “best friend” (26F). She’s also my cousin, and honestly, she was the first real friend I ever had when I was 18. We used to laugh, visit each other’s houses, and bonded over anime and gaming. We live in different cities, which is meeh who cares? 🤷🏻‍♀️ As we grew up, life got harder. I always made sure she knew I was her 100% ally and that I was there to listen and help. At one point, I went through depression and even suicidal episodes. I managed to overcome it with the help of some close friends, but not her. I hinted many times that I needed support, but she never picked up on it. I told myself maybe she just wasn’t attentive, or maybe she thought I was “strong enough” to handle it alone. I let it go. Over time, I noticed she stopped wanting to sleep over, but still expected me to pay extra just to visit her in her city for a sleep over. Recently, I had another depressive episode that I went through alone. Later, I told her how I felt. That I was hurt and disappointed she wasn’t there. Her responses shocked me: “I won’t push myself for you.” “You’re too emotional.” “Even if you called me and said you’re depressed and suicidal, I won’t care to answer if I don’t want to.” already pushed myself enough for you, I won’t do it again.” I was stunned. I don’t even remember a single time she was there for me when I was broken, so when exactly did she “push herself”? She had no answer. Sure, she occasionally listened to my rants or gossip, but that’s about it, and even then, I made sure it is only when the time was convenient for her. Then she said something that floored me: “I recently lost my (best friend!!!) of 3 years who I loved so much. I treated her the same way you’re treating me. I cared for her, gave her everything but she treated me like I treat you, and I couldn’t handle it. It was painful. So you should learn to loosen up.” So… she knows what it feels like to be treated the way she’s treating me, admits she hated it, and yet still feels fine doing it to me? It also reminded me of smaller red flags I brushed off before: Once she cut my finger and refused to apologize, then ignored me for months until I “calmed down.” Whenever we hang out, she’s glued to her phone unless I tell her to put it away. She never shares much about her life. When I suggested for her to watch animes, she resisted, but when another friend suggested it, she jump right in (think Phil and Claire from Modern Family). Eventually, I told her: “I’ll loosen up and just treat you like a normal friend. But don’t regret it later” And I did. Recently, she invited me to her city. I asked her to pick me up since she drives. She refused and told me to pay $120 in transport fees just to see her for one day. I said no. Later, when I was only 25 minutes away from her house, I asked her again. She refused again, saying she “doesn’t want to take highways.” That’s when it really clicked: she won’t compromise at all. I said, “Maybe next time.” which really is \"maybe never!!\" Since then, I’ve pulled back. I don’t reply quickly (or at all unless it’s important), I don’t send her memes, I don’t put in extra effort. She’s just a normal friend now. Some of my friends are pissed at her, my mom HATES HER! Others think I’m being too harsh and that maybe we’ll be best friends again if I learned my lesson. But honestly? I don’t want that anymore. It almost feels like Anthony and Ian from Smosh, except unlike them, she was never the kind of friend worth fighting to keep. And honestly, I feel like crap and immature admitting it, but at this point I just hate talking to her. So AITAH? Edit: for anyone wondering why she won't come to my home anymore, I asked her about it, she doesn't have any reason to provide. It just suits her this way, and I know nothing bothered or upset her because she will tell me about it. My speculation, is that according to her, her sisters think I am lesbian and might pull her to my side (we don't live in a LGBTQ friendly cities), which I am not, I am straigh. Their reasons is they saw us once come out of a room together (we were literally just walking) and maybe being stuck 24/7 in a closed room playing video games and eating noodles increased their sus level! At that time being teenager I tried to defend myself by showing interest in \"celebraty bois\" still not convinced. Now I think about it, they are dumb as hell.",

      "content_preview": "I (32f) am married and I’ve known my husband (31m) since high school. We’ve been married for 6 years, and have two kids aged 5 and 3 with a third on the way. My mother has always been a narcissist, but it took me years to really take notice of it. Things started hitting a fever pitch after I got engaged. First she made it a big deal he proposed on a mountain with only his brother present for pictures (because my husband knew I would hate it being a giant Deal). Then it was about my bridal shower and bachelorette party, mostly because my husband’s family is comparatively huge and already planned 4 other weddings at that point (I only have one sibling and he has his brother and four sisters, to say nothing of aunts and uncles). It got to the point she tried to plan an entirely separately bridal shower for my her side of the family until my SILs talked her down and let her take over planning theirs because they saw how bad it was stressing me out. She took a grand stand at the guest list. I did not want a huge wedding, especially since my parents had offered to foot 95% of the bill and I really didn’t feel right making them spend any more than absolutely necessary. I only wanted close friends and family, which unfortunately excluded a lot of her family (and my dad’s) because I just wasn’t close with them. She threw a huge fit and got into a screaming match with me on the phone while I was at my in-laws, going on about how I prefer my in-laws and never let her be a part of anything (when I had gone out of my way to include her in literally everything after the bridal shower stuff) and if this is how I was going to be she was just going to give me the money since that’s all I cared about them for and her and my dad and their family wouldn’t come to the wedding. Needless to say it messed with my mental big time. I ended up caving to her demands, had a massive wedding she essentially planned, and hated every second of it. Fast forward to having our first kid, and it’s more of the same. Her getting mad she wasn’t included in planning the baby shower (she was) and going over the top about buying us any and every thing we could possibly need, and offering to buy diapers, wipes and formula for as long as the baby needed them. We steadfastly refused her offer to buy the diapers/etc because we both remembered the wedding and how she acted and were wary of what strings might be attached. Needless to say she didn’t listen and would always show up with boxes of diapers, wipes, formula, clothes, no matter how much we insisted we had plenty. It was constantly little stuff like this, and it just kept piling up. I’d tell her not to feed my baby sugar at 6/7 months old and she’d deliberately let the baby lick her ice cream. I’d respectfully request the kids not have any soda/pop and she’d let them slug down an entire can of Mountain Dew. I’d firmly say they can’t have any treats or presents if they were misbehaving and she’d wave a new toy or candy in their face then go, “Oh, well, mom said you can’t have it, but if it were up to me I’d let you.” My parents would go get fast food and ask if I wanted anything for the kids and bring back McDonalds or Taco Bell even if I said “No, but thank you for asking,” or “Thank you for offering but I’m already making dinner!” It’s got to the point where my kids will demand things like toys or treats/candy just doing things they knows they’re expected to do no matter what like eat dinner and clean their room or flush the toilet. I’ve told them No, and explained WHY stuff like that doesn’t mean they automatically gets a reward. Now they say, “Well if you won’t buy it, gramma will! I’ll go ask her!” It’s making them entitled, and every other thing out of their mouth is becoming, “Well gramma lets me.” I put my foot down about visiting their home because they have cats, and one of them has taken to peeing all over. My mom claims she can’t clean because of a disease she has that makes her too weak and my dad works full-time past retirement age doing manual labor so he can’t keep up with the mess. My mom and brother, who still lives at home, both smoke weed as well. I don’t care that they do, but they do it in the house and my kids have come home smelling like a smoke shop, so I kindly asked they smoke elsewhere if they want us to come visit and they haven’t - every time I walk in the front door it’s like getting slapped in the face with it. She also has a medical condition that’s made her prone to episodes of unconsciousness, so I kindly explained she couldn’t drive the kids anymore - not because I didn’t necessarily trust her but that my kids’ safety was just too important to leave to chance. Now she dangles that in front of them - “Well I’d let you ride with me but it’s not up to me, you have to take that up with your mom.” It’s like she’s dragging my kids into the conflict and they’re way too young to understand how manipulative she’s being. If my dad ends up driving her and the kids, they’ll return with her behind the wheel and she’ll act like she can’t fathom why I’m so upset. My husband fully supports me and has tried talking to my dad about it, but he either is completely ignorant or deliberately taking my mom’s side behind closed doors, so it hasn’t really done anything. We’ve tried talking to her together, I’ve tried approaching it with her separately, writing a letter, including my dad - it hasn’t mattered. My dad will say one thing to our face, but turn around the next thing he’ll have her back. I kind of get it in supporting your spouse, but the fact he’s being two-faced about it doesn’t sit well with either of us. All of the stuff I listed above is just a very, very small sampling of her behavior and this would easily turn into a Tolkien-length novel if I were to list all of the things she’s said/done to manipulate me and especially my children. It’s apparent from experience though that she does absolutely everything for the sole purpose of making herself look good and special - not a single moment can pass by where she doesn’t praise herself for how selfless she is in all the things she “does” for us (no matter how desperately we ask her to stop). Finally I sat her down with a list of offenses and tried calmly to explain how I was feeling, why I felt her behaviors were crossing lines and boundaries, and that going forward I expected those boundaries to be respected or else she’d lose access to my children. She absolutely blew a gasket and began screaming and crying, going on about how she was going to die and she was allowed to have a say in my kids’ lives because I was her daughter and she didn’t need to ask for my permission to do stuff for them. I ended up leaving before I could lose my temper. My husband, again, backs me up 100%, but did say I may have approached her the wrong way (I am notoriously bad at controlling my tone and he knows this) and suggested I try talking to her again with a mediator present to make sure I’m getting my point across in a way she can understand (he knows she’s a narcissist and likely flat-out refuses to acknowledge any universe she might be the problem in unless someone from the outside confirms it). Honestly I have 0 interest in repairing the relationship, and the only reason I would is for my dad, who heavily relies on my husband for help with any number of things he can’t do alone because of my dad’s age. But it’s been an absolute shitstorm since and my dad and brother are trying to guilt me about how I made her feel and that how dare I treat my own mother this way and put her down like that. AITA?",

      "content_preview": "So after mulling it over for a few hours, I decided not to go through with the adoption. She had sent “documents” of the cat’s health but unfortunately it was faked. I called the number she provided for the veterinary clinic she “took” him to and they stated that they had no cat with that name in their records. I verified the location and they still stated that they didn’t have any records of the cat. (The only protection applied to vet records in my state is they can’t share the owners information, but can share the animals if adoption is pending?) My coworker also said that this woman had a history of having multiple animals at a time and then “getting rid of” the sick ones. (Apparently she did this with another cat who had feline HIV and a dog who had heart issues). I told her that I was no longer comfortable with the adoption but hoped for the best.",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been married for 15 years, and most of that time I’ve tried—really tried—to be part of my husband’s family. Spoiler: it’s been exhausting. His parents are divorced and narcissistic; his siblings were raised to compete for love. There’s never warmth, only comparison, manipulation, and endless drama. My husband has been no-contact with his father, but the more painful relationship has been with his mother. She always positions herself as a victim. Every visit becomes about her pain, her sacrifices, her disappointments. She complains endlessly, even when her kids are showing up. When we visit, there’s never a simple welcome—no fresh sheets, no food stocked, no basic thoughtfulness. I tried to keep the peace. I sent gifts. I showed up. I wanted to belong. On our most recent visit to my MIL’s tiny town in south eastern Michigan she desperately wanted us to join her and her friends for “a quick drink” that turned into 3.5hrs of us sitting at the bar and watching a middle age “rock band” performance. We were at a bar when she introduced me to one of her friends. She started bragging about her sons and their wives—positioning their successes as proof of her own greatness as a mother. Then, speaking about me, she said, “I knew this Indian girl was perfect for my son.” She told a made-up story about something I supposedly said: “A man who treats his girl like a princess was raised by a queen.” (I had posted that as a quote on social media, but I never said it to her.) And then—casually, effortlessly—she imitated me using an exaggerated, offensive Indian accent. I was stunned. Hurt. Embarrassed. Disgusted. And suddenly, every little microaggression over the last 15 years came rushing back. The comments from her about “where I learnt to speak English so well,” or “you don’t look Indian?” The way she constantly reduces me to my ethnicity while painting herself as so inclusive. I realized I wasn’t her daughter-in-law was a token. Her diversity prop. A talking point. It wasn’t just the accent. It was the fact that she did it without thinking, effortlessly and probably not for the first time. It was how natural it sounded how certain she was that this performance was completely normal. I was baffled and speechless. My husband apologized to me profusely. That moment is when the mask fell. I saw it clearly: she doesn’t see me as a full person. Just a character in her drama. She has always centered herself in every story. My kindness, my culture, my presence—it’s all filtered through her own need to feel adored. I was heartbroken. And angry. The kind of anger I didn’t even know I had in me. What hurts most is that I was the one pushing for this relationship in the first place. There’s a family event that my husband and I both want to attend in a few weeks. But it’s become emotionally complicated. We normally stay at his mother’s or sister’s but we don’t want to anymore. We want to slowly go low contact and start off by staying at a hotel, which is the only option that offers peace but will invite guilt trips and passive-aggressive comments like “Why don’t you want to be with us?” or “Don’t you want to see the kids?” The truth is: no. Not really. Not under these conditions. Not when the cost of showing up is our own peace of mind and self worth. We’ve also considered me skipping the event altogether and letting my husband go alone. But I hate that their dysfunction would rob me of celebrating something joyful with people I care about. AITA for wanting to go low contact with my MIL? I just want to avoid her and not experience what I have ever again.",

      "content_preview": "I (23F) broke up with my boyfriend a few weeks ago, and I’ve been looking into adopting a cat. A coworker of mine, who I consider a friend, said that she had a friend who is looking to get rid of one of her animals. A one year three month old black and white tuxedo cat. She claimed that the owner isn’t the best when it comes to animals, and that it could be considered an abusive situation. So I immediately messaged the woman last week and we’ve been talking ever since. I asked if she could provide proof of health for the cat medical records such as test results for feline HIV feline diabetes, etc. She provided proof that he was neutered and that he had his rabies vaccine, but provided no other information.. Well, we have a scheduled meeting for tomorrow for me to get the cat from her and I asked her today if she would be willing to meet at a veterinarian clinic. She got defensive and asked why I would want to meet at a veterinary clinic. I told her my reasoning was because I scheduled an appointment to get him a full panel exam done so that I have my own paperwork and results for him. She left me on read and after asking my coworker about her she said that “that woman doesn’t have a vet for her animals.” Which makes me believe that everything she sent over was faked. Something isn’t sitting right in my soul about this. I don’t want to leave an animal in a potentially bad situation but the owner has been very dodgy from the beginning. Would I be the AH if I told her I couldn’t adopt this cat anymore?",

      "content_preview": "Long time lurker who was too afraid to post until now. I (M40) got into a red hot relationship with my ex (F30). Sex 4 times a day, showed respect, let me mess up without punishment, etc. At 4 months she told me she was pregnant so I told her I'm not going anywhere. Moved her in spent $10k getting my house ready for the new baby. Long story, short...... within a month she treated me....poorly and moved out right after our son was born. Fast forward a couple years and we were coparenting great. 50/50 with no real issues. We both were dating and living our lives. She attempted to bring our family back together, but it seemed like she was just looking for someone.... not me so I declined. Later that week I was thinking with the wrong head and reached out. There was a time when it took her 8 hrs to text me back.... I had a pic of her topless in 2 minutes. Needless to say we started hooking up again.... but she made it clear it was just sex. No problem 😊. It lasted about a month until she tried to pull some of her old tricks. At this point I can see her tricks from a mile away so I backed off and we just went back to coparenting. One month later she tells me she's getting serious with a guy and introduced our son to him. No problem there. I ask what his name was and she told me \"It's none of my business. When the relationship more serious she'll let me know\". I didn't want to overreact and my son was in my arms so I said ok and left. I was boiling inside, but this is just another power play. I quickly realized that they were so serious that he moved in. I was dropping my son off and asked her again who lives with my son. That's none of my business...... words were said. I went home in a rage and called my dad. He told me straight- go back to her house and knock..... so I did. I made sure they knew it was me by play knocking with my son and talking to him through the door. Awhile passes and my ex opens the door and I caught a glimpse of someone going in the kitchen. I walk in and say I have to meet him. She acts completely normal and calls him in..... the guy hugged me he was so nervous!🤣. Not gonna lie, but I was too. I didn't know what I was walking into. He seemed like a nice guy. His daughter was standing next to him saying \"we live here now\". I shook her hand and introduced myself. He was talking so fast and oversharing. Before I left I apologized to my ex and she said she understood...... for the moment. 2 hours later she texted me saying I was being very disrespectful for just coming over. Me- that wouldn't of happened if you communicated. When I left you said you understood. Her- Yeah I do understand, but that doesnt mean it was right. I told you multiple times you could meet him. You showing up at MY house unannounced was completely disrespectful. And youre wrong. Who im talking to and living with is no business of yours. Me- Ok.... have a good night. So...... am I overreacting for just going to my ex's house because she moved a guy in? Edit/ update- 1- we have a parenting agreement..... but this situation wasn't put in it. 2- The mother of my son can be a little much, but at the end of the day she is a good woman. I didn't think something like this would ever happen with us. My sons teachers always say we're the ideal coparenting team..... things change🤷🏾‍♂️ 3- we will be going over the parenting agreement again to fill some holes. Update- I called and apologized for just coming over. She accepted my apology, but she still believes she's in the right. 3 years of therapy has taught me to leave that topic right where its at. I know who lives with my son now..... all that matters. When she picked up my son today I told her I'd like to apologize to him as well...... I was pretty turnt up and I don't hide it well so I'd like to mend that fence. Shes going to put on a BBQ. We're good.",

      "content_preview": "Me and bestie have been struggling to keep our friendship for the last 5 years of being long distance.I am always initiating. I invited her to my city and she came once or twice on her own. The last time she came it was over my birthday. She came with her bf to go to ann event and stopped by. That was nice but still hurt bc this was his idea (he doesn’t know my birthday). After that I saw her on NYE, a vacation I planned and paid for.That was fine for me, yet money has always been a strain in our relationship.A few months pass -I invite her up and she says maybe- last minute says no. she was taking weeks to respond. Or more.I kept reaching out and asked if things was ok and if she was still interested in our friendship.She laughed it off.She said she’d come up the next month. I didn’t expect her to follow thru, and didn’t.The next month I wanted to go to the Pride event in her town. I brought my new gf an had texted her days before setting the plan for the weekend.The night before I texted her to sure up our plans. Her response “lol I’m in a different city.My bfs doing something here so I came to visit my friend here”. I said what happened to our plans? She said she thought I just wanted to run into her and if I wanted to see her I should have made real plans. wild bc I did make the plan and have been trying to make plans with her for months. I was left on read. I found out thru socials that she was moving across the country with her bf. I responded with a thumbs up. She questions it and I said you still are ignoring me but good luck. She said she was sorry for never responding but didn’t know what to say -like no answer she gives me is good enough. But I wasn’t looking for any specific answers, just dialogue. I told her I didn’t think it’s crazy to give one passive message after all this and it feels like I’m the only one who values our friendship. She responded 3 days later (the night before her birthday) with “girl that’s wild ur being dramatic..I’m trying to remain respectful but that’s blowing me..”an goes on to say how she’s working multiple jobs an taking care of her family an hasn’t felt support from me. An that we have 2 choices “either not be friends or she works on her communication”. I never wanted to end our friendship. I needed a moment to respond the next day. It was a busy day for me outside at events I had planned. I didn’t feel like I could text her hbd when this big message was looming over my head. By the time I got home that day it was late and I was exhausted. I knew if I responded I would say something I didn’t mean out of hurt. I ended up not responding or texting her hbd. I woke up to a text at 7am saying “no hbd is crazy. I see”. I ended up responded that morning to the previous long message and explain why I waited. I expressed my feelings and said I didn’t think it was crazy for me to be hurt. I apologized for not wishing her a hbd but I still hope it was great. This was a month ago an I’ve yet to hear from her",

      "content_preview": "So my husband and I have been together for 4 years and married for 3 and we have 1 child (2M). We have lived a LOT of life in the amount of time we have been together. We moved very fast. We have had lots of ups and downs but have recently gotten to the point where we both agree that maybe we need some space. We lack communication, physical connection, feel lonely and tend to feel as if we aren’t on the same page. During hard times we both get physically sick due to the stress we cause and we know that is not healthy. We both have things that we need to fix within ourselves in order to make anything work. If there has been anyone that has been in a similar situation please, I ask for advice. What was separation like? Did you guys get back together? How did it all work for you? Pros and cons? We just have a child, no assets. At the core of everything we know that we both still deeply love each other. Edit: we will be getting a divorce. He doesn’t want to do counseling, I do but we can’t get on the same page. Maybe it’s for the best.",

      "content_preview": "My husband 38 (m) works out of town 2 weeks at a time. He's at a fly in camp. There are 100s of ppl that work there. He's been working there for the last 10 years. Last year I found out that he has been texting with a female co worker. The conversation seemed harmless. There were msging eachother everyday if not every other day. He would send her photos of what he was working on at home, stuff around the house or yard. Or if we went camping and so on. None of their conversations mentioned me or our son. She was the one to always msg him 1st and initiate conversations. She is a single 34 (f). At first I didn't think anything of it. But as time went on, he was talking more to her then he would with me. He was say goodnight to her and never to me, just walk up the stairs and go to bed. It was like he was distancing and shutting himself off from me. I am the one who initiates everything in our relationship. I make all the plans. He doesn't hang out with any of his friends. He's very much a loner and rather do things by himself. Anything we do, we do with my friends. Even I have to make the plans to hang out with his friends. Over the last year I've talked to him about him being distant and not making any effort in our relationship. I've asked him multiple time if there was any wrong. Or anything he would like to talk about. Or if I done something. He responds with 1 word answers or saying no, nothings wrong. I've been avoiding asking him if he even wants to be with me or want me around. I'm afraid of what his answer may be. I love this man whole heartedly. I'm not close with my family. The family we've made together is all I have. I have close friends who are a great support. I've been to embarrassed to tell them how my husband has been acting lately. Once I found out about my husband and this female coworker talking often, I asked my husband if I should be worried about him at work. And that I didn't like that he was talking more to this women then he was to me. And that I felt like he was giving her more of his attention that he was to me. He claims that there \"just friends\". I expressed that I felt that his friendship with her is making me uncomfortable and I don't think it's appropriate. I asked him to stop talking to her and to remove her from his Facebook. He did delete her. But after that his demeanor changed. He's changed his password on his phone and went from leaving it charging in the kitchen at night to now sleeping with his phone. He's gotten more quiet and feeling like he's hiding something. Back track to December at my husbands work christmas party, they have 2 for each crew to be able to go to. This women could attend either, since she works Monday to Thursday and has every weekend off. But so happen she decided to attend this date of the christmas party. It's hard not to feel like she choose this date because my husband was going to be at this one. As the night went on, they weren't talking to each other and seem to keep on the opposite sides of the room until she approach him and started a conversation. To say I was hurt and literally seeing red. I approach them and pushed her away from my husband and told him that I made it clear I didn't want him talking to her. He threw up his hands and said to me he doesn't know what I was talking about. And that she was just telling him a joke. I know after the fact I reacted negatively and shouldn't have done what I did. I apologized but damage was done. Now it's been months of him not talking to me or very limited. When he goes to work I hardly hear from him or he doesn't check in. We have a 7 year old son. I would at least expect him to want to know how hes doing or how our day was. And when I mention that I never hear from him, he says that he doesn't hear from me either. He works 14 hour days. Is underground. He always would msg me when he got to his room. I told him that I wait to hear from him, I don't know when he gets back to his room, its always been that way. He doesn't flirt with me anymore, he doesn't say he loves me 1st unless I say it. And it feels like he's just saying it out of habit or to keep me quiet. When he's home he doesn't cook unless it's for himself. I cook the family meals. I'm currently pregnant which was a totally surprise as we were not trying. He hasn't attended any of my ultrasounds or asked how the baby is. He seem just so unattached and checked out. I feel like we're just roommates at this point, raising children. I have no means to support myself and my children. I've started doing things on my own with my son when my husband is home because he rather not come with us. He doesn't attend his baseball or soccer games unless my son ask him to come, and sometimes he'll make an excuse and tell my son he's busy doing whatever in the yard. He didn't come to any of our son swimming lessons until the very last day. My heart breaks for my son. He wants his dad around and to watch him. I grew up with my own parents never attending my games. I feel like im living my childhood all over again. I've made excuses to our friends about why he isn't around. I feel like my marriage is over. Am I just being hopeful that he'll come back around? Am I wasting my time? My husband has always said he hates cheaters because he has been cheated on before. I can't help to feel like he was cheating and having an emotional relationship with this other women. I feel like I've lost my partner, my husband. I feel alone and Just going through the motions of daily life. I've done therapy it's been helpful. My husband has not and sees nothing wrong. I don't feel loved anymore. My son and now this baby is what's keeping me going right now. I've thought of just driving my car into a rock cut and just ending it. If I were to die tomorrow my husband wouldn't blink an eye or care. That's how it feels anyways. I try not to feel sorry for myself. And wonder if I've put us here. Maybe I should have just left it alone and not care about him talking to another women. But here I am. And I hate where we are in our relationship. If you can even call it that. Any words of advice or wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for sticking along with me. Edit also to add. I did msg his coworker once in Aug 2024. Because my husband was ignoring the issue. I said to her that I shouldn't be worried about my husband at work and she should have more respect for me as his wife. And to essentially back off. And then in June of this year I had a police officer come to my house and warn me that she put a No Contact order against me. Saying I have been msg her multiple time, when I only sent her one msg on Facebook and she blocked me. I wouldn't have any other way to contact her. The police said they seen the screen shots of the msgs. I told him that yes I did Contact her once but I don't know what other msgs she's referring to. I've received msg from her that have been degrading. She unblocks me and will block me again. I have not msg her back obviously due to the no contact order. I'm afraid to contact the police to ask if she is allowed to still contact me even with the order in place. I've screenshotted everything she's sent me. I don't want the police to think I'm causing drama with this women. I'm at a loss. I want to thank everyone for the comments so far and will be taking steps to move on and protect my children. Update: i want to thank everyone for their comments and msgs. It's alot to take in. I contacted the police about her msging me. I was never given any papers about the no contact for it was just a warning. And not something signed by a judge. I was advised to bring in the screenshots of her msgs and to have her warned. If it continues she can be charged with criminal harassment. I will be taking financial steps to secure money for myself and my children. I've switched all beneficiaries to my children. I will be contacting a lawyer and making steps to finding a place for us to live. I'll post another update when possible.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everybody, long and slightly rambling post ahead. TLDR is at the bottom if it's too much reading. So my bf (26) and I (25) have been together for nearly 3 years now. He has a severe panic disorder. When he has an episode, everything makes him anxious. The wind could blow and he will freak out. If I say anything whatsoever, he spirals into a panic attack. It could be a sentence as generic as \"this pasta tastes good\" and he still panics. I cannot stress enough just how easily he panics at the slightest thing when he's having an episode. The solution sounds simple, just don't say or do anything right? Here's the thing, he panics anyways. When he's having an episode, nothing helps and everything I do (or don't do) makes it worse. His panic attacks consist of constant apologizing, being unable to breathe, the works. He can't be comforted by anything either, or at least anything we've tried. I know he can't help it but trying to manage everything and deal with him when he's like this makes me want to disappear. Its absolutely exhausting. He's the perfect boyfriend when he's not having an episode but I never know when he'll have one so there aren't any warning signs. Everything will be fine and suddenly the entire day is ruined and I have to deal with this mess. The worst part is they get triggered by the most seemingly minor things. He's a little too tired? Panic. He's hungry? Panic. I know how hard for him it must be being so scared and I feel guilty that I feel so resentful of him when he gets like that. We are in couples therapy and individual therapy to try and work things out and the frequency of his episodes has decreased but when they happen they're just as severe. I feel like more of a mom than a girlfriend sometimes and I hate every single second of it. I don't want to break up, we're planning on spending our lives together, but I feel so much pressure, sadness, and anger. I'm sorry for the long post. TLDR: My boyfriend has a severe panic disorder and I feel guilty for resenting him for it.",

      "content_preview": "I don't need you all to tell me I'm trash, I know but I need to vent because I eff up big time. Not my main acount because Anna knows it I (28M) started a relationship with Anna (28F) the mother of my daughters at the age of 16 and had a our first daughter at 17. She was pretty emotional unstable and I was a doormat that wanted to protect her and made all of her dreams true even if I got hurt. Our time together was a dangerous rollercoaster in which her mother would verbally abuse me and Anna would change her mind on being together or not based on her mother's mood. We went on and off, tried to date other people but ended up getting back together at 18 and had our second daughter at 19. Anna was not acting like herself during these years, she was not the girl I fell in love with but I still stayed because nobody was helping her with her mental health. Her mother would act as if it was just a phase and her father loves to avoid everything that will make him fight with his wife. Two years later, Anna cheated on me with an ex and it hurt a lot because we were living at the time with her parents with all the verbal abuse from her mother. We moved out of my parent's home because we were looking for a rental near a good school. I never said or told anyone about the cheating, I broke up with her but my parents told me to not bother coming back home without my whole family. Anna tried to tell my mother how I was taking the girls with me since she was clearly not in her right mind but mom wouldn't listen and said that since we weren't together, they could stop paying my tuition. They only did it to shut Anna's mother up about me being a deadbeat (I had a job while studying and payed for our stuff but okay). Anna and I made a deal about pretending to be a couple so we could finish our careers. First week was hell and I ended up unblocking and texting Elsa (26F) my ex best friend and ex about wanting to get our friendship back. We used to talk about everything even after our breakup but she hated Anna and I blocked her after a fight they both had. Elsa texted me back \"I should have never opened my door to you. If you keep harrasing me I will call the cops\". I blocked her again because I could only handle one crazy ex at the time. For a little bit of context about Elsa: We broke up because after sleeping together she would call everyday at any hour during night my phone, my house, my parents. It didn't matter if I was asleep, I needed to respond and send her a picture to confirm that I was where I told her. Family reunion? My parents needed to be in the photo. With friends? Only males or I needed to leave and had to call her as soon as I got home. Elsa would text my female friends to tell them about how I was womanizer and to please text her in case I was doing something suspicious. After four months together, I ended it and at first she went crazy about it and then back to be \"normal\" so when she texted me that, I just blocked her again. I know, I should be single and my daughters deserve better parents. Last year my father died and I had episodes where I was waiting for him for breakfast, where I was still with Elsa, where I was barely starting university and some where I would scream at Anna (when our girls were at school) about how she ruined my life. She was my rock, she helped me heal and somehow she went from crazy Anna to the Anna I was once in love with but I was already broken and full of resentment so I went to therapy. Anna doesn't remember most of the time together, good or bad, her trauma with the birth of our oldest, how she would try to hurt herself, our babie's milestones, videos she made for them. During this period, I noticed that I had send Elsa a text \"Hope you had a great day, I wish we could talk again to clear the air.\" I think I did it in one of my episodes, I don't know, I just ignored it since she was blocked again. We moved into a nice apartment and were finally free from each other's family drama but I eff up everything we have been building together ever since living alone with our little family. Our girls hated living with their grandparents because of her mother so living together just us gave them the peace we were looking for. Unlike our romantic soap opera, we can actually co parent pretty good and both girls are sweet little fighters. Oldest has won some local karate tournaments while our youngest is in a choir because she loves singing and wants to be better at it. We put them in therapy but got told that they're fine and we shouldn't asume that since we're not okay, they're not okay. So good grades, good jobs, family outings, dates with my girls, Anna got her degree... It's not about pretending anymore, we are a more stable and happy family. I told Anna about starting as friends again and see where this all goes. Thing is... Elsa sued me. My mother just called crying a few hours ago about some papers for me and how Elsa acussing me for harrasment and SAd her when we were together years ago saying that only her mother knew about it. I didn't do that, I swear and I even remember both parents calling my mother in the middle of my sister's wedding reception about me having to marry her daughter since we slept together. My whole family remembers it because both of them were yelling loud enough to hear them. That and she's saying that I'm using international numbers to send her threats via voicemail and texts. I'm calling my cousin who is a lawyer to see what can I do and I will talk with Anna after that.",

      "content_preview": "For a little bit of context: Throughout my whole life, I rarely saw my mom unless it was a holiday or a birthday — but she always showed up for her nephews. My dad left when I was three and was in and out of my life. I basically felt like I had no parents. On top of that, my mom told me she wanted to abort me because she never wanted kids, but my dad told her to keep me because he did want me. I (21F) live with my mom (43F) and my grandma (63F). My aunt also lived with us until she moved out before we moved into our current house. Growing up, I felt neglected by my mom. She was always working and rarely around, so her sister and mom basically raised me. I always felt like she prioritized her nephews over me. They were always put first, and I never spoke up. Yeah, she would sometimes show up for my first day of school, but it was mainly my aunt and grandma doing everything — helping with homework, getting me ready, feeding me, doing my hair, picking me up when I got hurt — all the things you'd expect a mom to do. People thought she was a great mom because of what I had, but in reality, I was being spoiled by others to make up for the fact that I wasn’t receiving real love or affection. Everyone in my family kept calling it “tough love,” but to me, it never felt like love at all. By middle school, I was being bullied. I stayed kind and friendly even while being picked on. Every time I told my mom, she’d say “just ignore it” and then ask what I was doing to make people treat me that way — not realizing that kids my age were just rude as hell and often encouraged by their parents. She made me feel like it was my fault I was being bullied. It got so bad I wanted to end my life. Only then did she start to act like a caring mother. My dad showed up for two weeks... then disappeared again. In high school, the bullying stopped, but I still didn’t see my mom much — until we started working together. That only made things worse. I made friends, and she’d claim them as her “daughters” and treat them better than me. I was constantly being compared to them. I also started barber school while in high school, and there weren’t really any other girls — just me and the teacher. I became friends with some of the boys there. One of them gave me rides since we went to the same high school. She immediately assumed I was sleeping with him. Honestly, every time someone gave me a ride, she assumed we were sleeping together. After I graduated high school, the arguments with her got worse. I started going out more and eventually just moved out because I was over it. Once she started being toxic and draining, I had enough. After I left, we got closer for a bit. She’d call every day and ask me to come home, but I wasn’t ready. I was 18 and just wanted peace. I moved back in after 3 months. Things kind of improved, but we still argued, and she still made me feel like I was the problem. When we moved to a new place and I got a better job, she started expecting more money from me. I was paying my phone bill and her cable bill, but she made smart remarks about how I made the most money in the house and should be contributing more instead of going out or buying myself things. She would put me down for having money and finally starting to feel like myself again. Anytime I asked for a ride to work, she’d catch an attitude. Even now, we still have the same issue. I’m not making as much at my new job, but she expects me to contribute more because she quit her job (again) to go back to school. I’m proud of her, don’t get me wrong, but this is the second time she’s quit and then expected me to cover everything. She makes me feel like I should give her my whole check just because she made that choice. She also keeps telling me I should be financially dependent on the person I’m currently talking to — like she’s trying to throw me off on someone else. She says she’s “done enough” for me. The thing is, she’s the only reason this person and I even started talking. From the moment she met him, she assumed he was my boyfriend — even though we were just friends. She kept pushing it and even accused us of sleeping together before we ever even crossed that line. That wasn’t cool. We had just started expressing feelings for each other a month before she said that. It felt like a violation. I feel like, as a mom, she crosses the line way too often — especially given how strained our relationship is. So... AITA for wanting to move out again because I feel like I’m in a toxic environment?",

      "content_preview": "I, a 28F is currently going back to school to get away from my family. In May 2024 i had to help my aunt and uncle move out of their place because they got evicted for being hoarders (like should have been on tv hoarders) and had to spend two months cleaning it out. Then move in with my mother and I. But my mother didnt help because she didnt want to deal with it and went to a different state for six months while I had to deal with packing everyday and them having to move into the house. It has was super stressful and still is!! I had to quit my job as well to help. Next thing you know its July, still stressed waiting for a break for me to breath. But other members of the family want to do stuff of going on vacation with i have my dogs. To me it's not really a vacation because apparently Im the one that has to plan it. And on the vacation, no one is helping with look out for the dogs since it wasn't fenced in so i decided to leave because i wasn't getting help. They think I got too emotional for it. Then a week in august later my mother calls me (who is in a different state still) wants me to drive out to that state with the dogs for three weeks. Now it's september and my dad has to move to different state and he needs my help to pack up his house and drive the two cars with him and in doing so, one my siblings needs my help with her apartment. With helping my whole family, none of them were like \"thank you for helping\" and what not. No paid me, no one helped with flights. I had to pay that all by myself, a few thousand dollars might i add. And we are still in 2024. It's now halloween and my mother is finally back and she wants my siblings to come for thanksgiving and have one of the siblings dogs come as well. AND i did not want that dog for the holidays because it isn't nice to one of my dogs. And my mom is like my house my rules. And I still havent had a chance to breathe and relax because everyone is asking for me. So l decided to apply to school (and got in) to get away from my family (i didnt tell them i apply and got in). Since christmas was three weeks later, my mother also wanted the siblings back for Christmas as well. And this is also while my aunt and uncle are still living in the house too. Not only do i STILL feel the stress, the draining, no anything from my family. When it came to me packing (which isn't too much) no one helped me. I moved into my apartment of january of 2025 and I have to basically myself. I would say a week into my moving out that my mother started to realized that I was complaining about since May about my aunt and uncle and wanted to get away from them too. I am paying for the apartment and school all by myself and not asking for money because I know it will be thrown in my face. No one has visited me except my mother, only to get away from my aunt and uncle who i have been complaining about for a solid year now. It took until about sometime in april for me to get a weekend of breathing, relaxing and not having to do anything else, which felt awesome. But that was my only weekend. It's now August 2025, I took summer classes. When I do visit, there is always something now. My mother talks bad about me to my siblings and how I am hard to deal with or that I am crazy or that im so crazy i need help. The thing is none of had to do what i had to do for the last almost 18 months. You know what also, I did get a therapist to help because my family thinks my crazy.",

      "content_preview": "Hello, I first wanted to say that I love this podcast! I draw while listening to you guys, it’s always fun! So me and my boyfriend (both 20), have been dating for 5 months. We met on Hinge, and he’s great. We live in the same city so it works! I am a college student and he works. Unfortunately, I still live with my family and they are very protective over me (especially my dad), so I can’t see my bf every time he doesn’t have work. But, we make plans to see eachother once or twice a month. I know it’s hard not seeing a person you like on a daily basis, so I love my boyfriend for understanding why I can’t go out all of the time. Anyways, here is the problem. He clocks in around 3-4 PM and gets home around 10-11 PM. During that time, we barely talk, which is fine! I spam him reels and tiktoks, which he doesn’t mind. And whenever he’s on his breaks we talk a little. I would stay up until 3 AM just to talk to him almost everyday, and this would fuck me up so bad. I am diagnosed with migraines, and if I look at a screen too much or don’t get enough sleep, it triggers them. I didn’t mind the migraines as long as I talked to him. But then I noticed that he would lag or ignore me because he would be on the game with his friends everytime he got home. I felt awful. I felt awful that I was losing sleep for him and messing up my health FOR HIM, just for him to ignore me. I talked to him about it and he was very apologetic about the whole thing. We made an agreement that on Tuesdays and Saturdays, we would stay up together and talk to eachother without lagging or ignoring eachother or play games together. Keep in mind this was 3 DAYS ago. I would remind him about our deal on Monday. Yesterday was Tuesday, and he completely forgot about our agreement. I kept getting ignored , and I saw that he was playing with his friends. I was furious. How could someone forget about an agreement they made 3 days ago??? I remember everything about him to the smallest details. I know what he likes, and doesn’t like. I know EVERYTHING. And he cant remember this one important thing? I told him that I was upset at him and the reason, and wished not to speak to him for a while. He told me that he misread my message about the agreement and thought I said Thursday instead of Tuesday. I showed him a screenshot of my message that clearly says Tuesday. He has been blowing up my phone but I haven’t responded back to him, I just need a little time for myself. AITA?",

      "content_preview": "TW: sexual assault, incest, violence Hey guys, I know we don't know each other, but here is a bit of backstory to help with understanding the story a bit. I, 26 NB, was offered a position to teach music and be a conductor in ABQ, NM after living in TX for my entire life. My husband, 24 M, was also offered a position for him to cook since he has chef training, so we moved here about 5 days ago now to start our new life and eventually family here in ABQ. We were given the option to tour the property in person and declined opting for a virtual tour since we were roughly 21 hours away from the town by car. We fell in love right away with the apartment and decided to settle on it and plan our move. We were so excited, talking for weeks about how amazing this change in our life was going to be. We packed up from Kingsville TX, headed toward his parents place in Temple TX (6-7 hours from the coast), and then after consolidation and more repacking we made it to ABQ after a long overnight drive with a U-Haul truck and my little Ford Escape. Once we made it to the area we went to the realty office where we met tons of really nice staff and signed our initial lease agreement. We paid our rent and deposit, left with the keys, and made it to the apartment itself about 8 minutes from the office. We held our breath, opened the gate, then the door, and were met with a musty smell, no ac, and a lot of tlc ahead of us. TBH this is something I wanted so that we could clean and make it unique and fresh for us. We called the office, set up an AC appointment for the following Monday, it was Friday then, and we started to unload with a deadline of the next day at 5:30 p.m. to drop off the truck. Here's the layout of the apartments for future reference: D                          |                          D  D's apt C                                                     C B    C's mom                                B   Our apt A                                                     A    3 kid lady 421                                               417 While we were taking our time we were met by a few of the neighbors. Let's call the elderly woman D, 76 F, and the younger gal C, 22 F. D was overly friendly talking left and right about how she had lived in these apartments for 5 years and her family. She also confided in us that she was a widow and we felt bad for her and tried to change the topic to help with the tension and bring some sunshine back in. After a bit of talking back and forth about various things a young girl approached us, C, and introduced herself saying she was 22 finishing her GED and that she was a boss bitch. TBH, C reminds me a lot of Pony Head from SVTFOE with how she talks and seeks validation. We continued to unpack and talk and things felt normal until they both started trauma dumping heavy things REALLY fast. I understand feeling trust towards a stranger, but these were things like miscarriages, assaults they have done or others have done, casual familial incest, and conspiracies in the area. My husband and I kept looking back and forth at each other after every new tale they spun in disbelief and anxiety past a certain point. We had just met not even 12 hours ago and I'm being told so much tea. Here's one C told me that I can't forget: \"Yeah, so, the reason I'm living with D now is bc my mom is in B across from you was fucking my older brother so loud that A's kids next to you could hear it in the common area. A's lady got involved too and had a kid with my brother and is involved with my mother too. They tried to fuck me and keep me in the group with our 8 siblings but I felt gross and left for D's house. They're also forcing me to finish my GED and I hate it and feel like it's useless and that I could just get a job and smoke weed like everyone else.\" Your jaw on the floor is exactly where mine was too. D would double down everything C would say and eventually when I was left alone in the truck while the other 3 were unloading I met the brother and mother in question who both shook my hand and gave me a warm welcome. I was courteous and obliged them, engaging in small talk until the others came back. C's phone rang after that, she replied, and then loudly announced it was her annoying ass mom that wanted her to come over to her truck and get a gift she got while out. She groaned until we all said she should go talk to her and once she left D began to complain about C heavily with her character, work ethic, and her relationship with her family. This was understandably about red flag 3  or 4 now. It felt like they hated and loved each other at the same time and I felt like a middle man quickly. They would jibber jabber things for the rest of the time they helped us, but were weirdly eerily quiet when we went out to eat. I would try and start up a conversation only to be met by blank stares, silence on their part, or my husband just talking to me instead. It felt weird to us both and when we finally were on our own again we debriefed HEAVILY everything that was said to us. I told him I felt weird with their stories like I didn't know everything and how quickly they were to tell me this stuff after meeting. He agreed and we tried to make distance the rest of the day. The next day we had knocking at our door and window and were met with teary eyes from D who admitted she was camping our door to try and talk to us about something. The showed me an eviction notice with not much written on it besides that she was indeed becoming evicted and she started to boil over in tears. Words kept flowing out about how horrible this place was and how everybody hated her and wanted her gone, very manic psychosis talk atp, and how she was conspired against by pretty much the entire neighborhood in a gruesome way that made my husband and I both squeeze our held hands tighter. She described in detail how people came onto her property from across the block, held her down, stripped her, and assaulted her in front of her disabled son who lives in her apartment with her. She was yelling, getting closer to our faces through the entire story, almost looking for something, maybe a reaction? I don't know but we consoled her and told her we understood her stress and that we didn't know much about this state's law yet but would check into it. I reiterated that I wasn't a lawyer, just a professor of music, and that she should talk to a lawyer. We all hugged it out and split from the parking area to do what we needed to, which at the time was grab dinner. We talked in the car about everything and how it felt and how we shouldn't try to be more involved due to this being a red tape situation. We just met these people, and it's already overwhelming and confusing to say the least after the shock value wears off. Questions kept coming up, like how had no police been involved or others aware of this behavior in the area? How has the realty company not been involved except with this eviction on D now? Why would they immediately put trust in us? It didn't add up and so we agreed to try and be less involved for a bit. Yesterday she was caught camping outside our apartment in her car again waiting to talk to me about writing an email to the realty company. I had a weird feeling she would be so I sent my husband to the car instead to grab the things we need and she spoke to him happily like everything was alright. She asked when we could make the email and sit and talk about things and he advised her to try and talk to a lawyer and gave her my number after explaining I was otp with the school. When he came back in and explained everything I felt more anxious than anything. The door camping waiting for me is similar to what my mom would do growing up to control my time and reactions. My mother was a narcissist and I can talk about that behavior all day but this isn't a story about her thankfully, it's about us here. I just feel confused, alarmed, a bit overwhelmed and don't know how to react or respond to these things they have been telling me lately. I start work this upcoming Saturday and next Monday at the school and need to have time to adjust to that as well as just living here but have been kind of bulldozed with this. It feels like they both have the expectations that we can fix everything and save them but we cannot and need time to get used to our new lives far from anybody we know. So, please, AITAH? - I will update if anything else happens, which I anticipate atp.",

      "content_preview": "My (23F) family is in a situation that I’m looking for advice in navigating without breaking anonymity. Alcohol has always been a big part of our lives, and both of our parents spend most of their free time drinking. I’d consider them both to be functioning alcoholics, until recently... Despite this, my mother (57F) has always been amazing in raising us and has such a big heart. She should make an even better grandmother. My sister (26F), who I’ll call Sarah, gave birth to her first baby 4 months ago. She was only in labor for 2 hours (crazy, I know), and delivered a beautiful and healthy baby girl. About an hour after Sarah gave birth, my parents announced that they were leaving the hospital and going to a bar to celebrate. When Sarah came home from the hospital with her baby, our mom had already been drinking. She fell asleep while holding her 1 day old granddaughter, and likely doesn’t even remember it. Sarah had a talk with her about her drinking, especially considering our mom would’ve been babysitting, and has warned her that if she finds out that she has had anything to drink while watching the baby she won’t be trusted to babysit. Fast forward to last weekend… We were all on our annual camping trip. It’s a huge tradition with all of our extended family as well as other families, because it started as a company outing  a generation or two ago. Just like every year, we set up a net in the grass by the lake and spent all day playing volleyball next to picnic tables full of snacks and drinks. The whole group, all of the different families, hang out next to the court until it’s time to part for dinner. After dinner, there were enough people that still wanted to play volleyball. We went back down to the court, but the group was much smaller this time around. Outside of the 10 players, there were only 3-4 people at the picnic tables. One of them being Sarah, because she had to watch the baby. That is until Mary (~45F) insisted that Sarah get in the game in her place, and that her baby would be fine with them on the sidelines. When Mary stepped out of the game, so did our mom. She was too drunk to play volleyball, and someone else took her place. Her own words: “I shouldn’t play… I’m hammered!” She stumbled off the court and joined Mary and the baby, as well as a few others, at the picnic tables. We finish the volleyball game, and quickly realize that our mom and the baby (in her stroller) are nowhere in sight. Sarah and I ask where they are, and Mary says, “She said she was taking her for a walk… I didn’t think it was a good idea.” After hearing they walked by the boat launch (~100 yards/300 ft away) I took off sprinting. I get to the boat launch and still my mom and niece are nowhere in sight. I screamed her name, and heard her respond from the parking lot. I ran up the ramp to meet her, and the baby is wailing. My mom kept saying, “I was taking her for a walk, I thought she’d fall asleep”, but then also said she was taking her back to the campsite, which is a far walk on roads without sidewalks and it was already dusk. I lectured her hard, saying that she knew she was too drunk to play volleyball which clearly means she is way too drunk to be alone with the baby. She couldn’t even walk straight. Sarah took the baby and I helped my mom into the car with my dad to go back to our campsites. For the rest of the night, my mom acted as if nothing had happened. We had our big group campfire, and she clearly hadn’t slowed down drinking at all. During the fire, she was sprawled out in a dress with nothing underneath and I had to tell her she was flashing the entire group. This makes Sarah and I very concerned about her judgement when it comes to the baby. I’m also pissed at Mary for insisting it was okay for Sarah to leave the baby, and saying she thought it was a bad idea what my mom was doing, yet did nothing to keep our piss drunk mother from walking off with her. This has been an ongoing struggle, and we’ve watched our fun-loving mother who is full of light turn more angry and bitter. There have been times in the recent years that she has even tried to pit my sister and I against each other, when she has always been the peacemaker. Sarah feels that since she had her baby, it’s only gotten worse. Our more cold and mathematical father has been so joyous to be a grandpa and does so well with her. It’s really sad to not see the same from our mom, when our mom has been our support system throughout our entire childhoods. She’s happy and excited about being a grandma when she’s sober, but that isn’t often. We don’t know how to proceed… Sarah has already had the talks about drinking with her and the threats of not being trusted with the baby. This incident was big, but I don’t know if she grasps that or how much she even remembers of it. Even before her becoming a grandmother, I had had some difficult talks with her about finding healthier hobbies and wanting her to live as long as she can. I can’t find a good place to insert this, but it’s an important detail that I forgot to add: My mom has picked up smoking cigarettes in the last few months as well, which was a habit she had in college but not for as long as Sarah and I have been alive… she threw her pack of cigarettes into the baby’s stroller as Sarah was setting the baby inside and nearly hit her with it earlier in the day. Editing to add: she has never been left alone with the baby and after this incident, definitely won’t be. That genuinely isn’t the advice we need. Baby’s safety is both Sarah’s and my top priority. I thought her pastor might be a good person to reach out to, but Sarah pointed out that there may be consequences to that that set her back even farther. I feel she needs an intervention but I just don’t know how to go about it. She has a lot of people who care about her. So here I am, anonymously asking for advice from strangers… Please tell me: what would you do in our shoes?",
