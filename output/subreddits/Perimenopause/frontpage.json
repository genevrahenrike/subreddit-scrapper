And suddenly I understood the \"character\" of witches. They're just women going through it, trying to find ways to suffer less. And they are \"mean\" because they're not putting up with your shit anymore. And they're \"ugly\" because men wrote them that way because obviously they're unfuckable now too.

      "content_preview": "It's right before my period is supposed to start and have been depressed and today feel incredibly moody. I'm so irritated by the people I work with all the time, but especially the week before my period. I've never felt like I fit in anywhere (I think I'm probably neurodivergent), and it feels so excruciating when we get together for meetings and we are expected to share things about ourselves. I'm early 40s, don't have a partner or family (never wanted kids, don't really want or feel the need for a partner either. I've done plenty of therapy and soul searching, I just feel like I never learned how to be a person, my family (or origin) is broken and dysfunctional. I'm also mixed race (white/asian) which has always made me feel like I don't fit in and I stand out to other people as 'other'. I always had social anxiety but with peri now I think it adds another layer of well, something. I work mostly with middle aged women. I don't understand how they have the energy to do anything and I don't relate to their lives at all. And I don't feel comfortable really sharing anything personal (have had some weird/ toxic experiences with a couple of people I work with), but we're expected to be at least a little bit social, and even have meetings now where we are expected to talk only about non-work related things, which I think is f*cking ridiculous, it's like forced socializing lol Part of the problem is that it's a toxic work environment and feels very phony to me and I've never been one to be able to mask for a long time. I guess I'm looking to see if anyone can relate/validate this and maybe any tips. I really want to get a new job but I think I might run into similar issues whereever I go.",

My friend recommended the perimenopause subreddit so I joined and I do already feel better already reading people's posts about beached whales and itchy crotches. I feel so disgusting. I'm so hot all the time. I'm never not hot unless I'm standing in a cold shower and it takes like 15 minutes of cold water to reach not hot levels. I live in New Orleans. It's so hot outside, I'm hot and sweating through the sheets when I sleep, I'm having hot flashes. I can't eat hot food or I get a hot flash. My stupid dog wants to go on little walks three times a day for her mental health and she would rather walk in the full sun than in the shade. (I love my dog so much, I'm just really hot right now.) I went to specialist hormone doctor on Monday and she was so thin with perfect hair and perfect makeup and giant diamond rings and so so so much botox. I'm sure she's a very nice lady but I'm bitterly envious of that ability to care about anything, much less how you look. My perfect hair and make up days feel like ancient history. She prescribed me progesterone, 100 mg a day and so I took it for three days and on the fourth day I was like \"I think that I need to break up with my boyfriend, (lovely man), take my dog to the animal shelter, (perfect angel dog), and move to the woods into a cabin and potentially unalive myself or at the very least never speak to another human being ever again. I'm going to call the doctor tomorrow to see if that is a normal mood swing on progesterone, but if anybody has any thoughts on that I'd love to hear them. My body hurts so much. My finger joints hurt, my back hurts so much, I just feel achy all over. My boyfriend wants to have sex with me because he \"loves me\" and is 'attracted to me\". and I'm like ... I'm disgusting. my eyelids are sweating. how could you possibly want to have sex with me. please don't ever mention sex to me ever again. seriously don't. I haven't masturbated in like three years. (and like...... WHAT? me in my twenties would have been blown away by that) my hair is falling out. I found a weird hair growing out of my neck. I just turned 45 and I rented an Airbnb with a pool and the pool was so cool and I stayed in it for three days and it was the happiest I've been in so long. Am I alone in this sex drive thing? The idea of sex actually disgusts me these days and that is a 100% reversal from my previous self. Anyway, I realize this is a stream of consciousness and I probably sound mildly insane. Please don't worry, I'm in therapy. I'm just deeply uncomfortable in my body both literally and spiritually.",

Note - my OB said it was because I am a smoker. While I appreciate her concern, I have read extensively about Estrogen and smokers can take it, but preferably transdermally as opposed to orally. And yes, I am quitting smoking anyhow but I felt dismissed by my OB, however that is whole other story. I just finished my first visit and after the PA reviewed my health history and Peri symptoms she is sending a script for the Estrodial patch to my pharmacy. (Yes, I was honest and told her I am a smoker). It really was that easy. They take insurance but not my insurance. First visit is $250 which I can probably use my HSA debit card to pay but they haven't given me a bill yet, so I'm not sure. Next visit is in a month to check in, and that should be in the $100-$150 range. I did see on their site that they can send you an itemized 'super bill' that can be submitted to your insurance for possible reimbursement or partial reimbursement. I didn't feel rushed through the appointment. I felt listened to, taken seriously, and heard. I'm glad I made the appointment!",

I started using half a pump of Oestrogel 3 weeks ago. An incredibly low dose all things considered, but I had a really bad reaction to the estrogen patches, so I was advised to start low and slow then work my way up gradually. Started cyclical 200mg progesterone tablets a week ago and responded well to them, aside from sore boobs and stomach gurgling that I'd been warned about. Started to feel pretty good after the first few days of progesterone, and this is where I think I messed up. Today I tried a full pump of Oestrogel and 4 hours later I started to feel exactly like I did when I was on the patch. Got really hot, dizzy, anxious, nauseous, racing heart and thought I was going to pass out. Less than ideal considering in the office 😭 Have I messed this up? Is this because I upped the estrogen, the progesterone is taking effect or just bad luck? Will the estrogen wear off quickly? I feel awful. I know it's only one day, but I'm so terrified of feeling like this again and especially freaking out about going into the office again tomorrow. What do I do now? Really want this to settle because I am a panicky messnand can't stop crying.",

I also have more time off and work from home. I’m also primary parent and solo carrier of the mental load. I’m frickin sick of it. My son goes back to school on Tuesday. Three weeks ago I did the bulk of the school shopping. There were 3 items left needed from Walmart. I don’t shop there, but my husband goes several times a week to get beer or other things for himself. I crossed everything off the list and asked him to please get the three items left on the list, which I indicated with arrows. Then I took my son on a road trip to visit my brother and his kids. It was basically 4 days in the car and 5 days with my brother. I came home and husband had not bought the supplies. I had one day at home and left for a work trip (leave Tuesday at noon, catch red eye home Wednesday night). I asked him again to get the supplies, and reminded my son they needed to get them. I get home today and no school supplies. So of course I just buy them myself, in a rage. Husband comes home from work and starts messing with his aquariums and doing other puttering, leaving me to figure out dinner, like every other night of our life. I’m just so over this. Why are men like this? Why does my husband act this way?! He cuts the lawn and does his own laundry, and occasionally will deep clean the kitchen. But everything else is on me. I pay all the bills, do all the shopping, manage everything for my son, do the day to day cleaning, while working a demanding full time job that pays all the bills. I’m exhausted and enraged. Not looking for “divorce him” advice. Just looking for solidarity and a vent so I can hopefully feel less pissed off about this life I’ve chosen. EDIT: I had told him that I was feeling really angry about small things but didn’t want to fight. Then I went and picked up the additional supplies and vented to my mom. When I got home he asked if I was mad about the supplies. He said he was still planning on getting them and there were 4 days left until school started. He just “didn’t have time to get them this week” because he was taking care of our son (I.e. ordered a pizza Tuesday and reheated the leftovers Wednesday). He did apologize but seemed really confused as to why I would be mad. I started to explain the whole 3 weeks thing and having to keep track of whether he did it. But he just said “sorry” and that was that.",

      "content_preview": "Oh, perimenopause … the ultimate betrayal of my own body. Being a woman — the glue that holds everyone and every fucking thing together — yet still finding a way to smile at the end of the day and make sure those I love are happy… it’s exhausting. It’s thankless. And honestly? Some days, it feels like I’m just screaming into the void . The hot flashes that feel like I’m stranded in a desert with no water. The rage that comes out of nowhere , not even aimed at anyone, just simmering under the surface because my hormones are on some kind of chaotic roller coaster. The migraines, the cramps, the low-back pain that feels like contractions all over again. Ughhhh It’s hell. It’s lonely. And unless you’ve been here ...unless you’ve ridden this ride yourself ,  you don’t truly get it. So… anyone else want to scream into the void with me?",

      "content_preview": "I’m 42 and I just don’t feel like myself anymore. My period ended a couple of days ago, but now I’m bleeding again with cramps and back pain. Up until now, my cycles have been more on the irregular side (sometimes late, sometimes off), but this is the first time I’ve actually had spotting straight after a period. In the last 6–8 months I’ve noticed a real shift: low libido, brain fog (I’ll go to town in the morning and later almost forget I went), no motivation, and constant self-doubt. I get upset so easily now, overthink everything, catastrophize, and worry constantly. I try to block it out by scrolling on my phone, but that just makes me feel worse. I wake in the night and can’t get back to sleep. Arguments with my partner escalate quickly — I can almost “see myself” from the outside, knowing I should calm down, but I can’t. I feel rage inside me, say things I regret, then apologize. I hate feeling so triggered all the time. For context: I’ve been on Qlaira for 5 years and it’s the only contraceptive that agrees with me. I had a recent doctor’s appointment and everything looked fine — blood pressure is good, I don’t smoke, I’ve cut alcohol way down, and I know cutting sugar helps with mental clarity (managed it for 4 months, trying to get back to it). On top of it all, I’m training for a marathon in 6 months while also trying to push my business forward. It’s not just stress from those things — I’ve been juggling them for a couple of years, but these symptoms have really become noticeable only in the last several months. So now I’m wondering: is this perimenopause? Has anyone else had this mix of irregular cycles, rage, brain fog, worry, insomnia, and just not feeling like themselves? Thanks for reading — and sending love to anyone else navigating this rollercoaster too.",

About two weeks of putting it on, I would wake up every morning with “strobe lights” in my vision for about 15-30 seconds. Following that, in about an hour I would come down with a nasty migraine. The next day after this first happened I went to my ophthalmologist to make sure I didn’t have anything wrong with my eyes…and I didn’t.  It’s considered a medical emergency so I wasted no time.  The following day, I went to my PCP.  She did a neurological test on me to make sure I didn’t have any stroke symptoms. Also came out in the clear. I decided to take off the patch after discussing this with my dr. It took a week for the strobing vision and headaches to stop.  I finally woke up today feeling normal. This isn’t scare anyone, and I guess I can’t def say this was the patch, but it seems pretty suspect.  I don’t know where my HRT journey goes from here, but  I’m bummed would be an understatement.",

So the car turns into medical office building and I impulsively decide to follow her. She gets out of the car and I say I'm sorry to bother you, but does the HRT on your license plate stand for what I think it does? And she says \"yes - heart.\" Then I see she has a car sticker that says Heart Cait and I don't know if that's her business or what. I said, wow this is embarrassing. I thought it stood for a hormone replacement therapy and I was excited to talk to you about it. She just smiled and told me to check out her website for Heart Cait, but then as she's walking away she recommends two doctors for hormone replacement therapy 🤣🤣",

I've had one cycle that was only 14 days, and one that was 38 (22-24 days would be my new normal). This makes it really complicated to take the progesterone correctly - I am supposed to start it 10 days after D1 of my period...what if my period starts in the middle of the progesterone cycle? Do I stop taking it and start counting over? What if my period doesn't come when it's supposed to after stopping the progesterone? Both of these have happened.  Do I just take it on a strict schedule and don't pay attention to when my cycle comes or doesn't? I'm having a hard time getting straight answers from my doctor's office and wonder if anyone else has had this experience and how you handled the cyclical progesterone?",

I just thought it was menopause in your 40s-50s. Who do I see for this? A gynecologist? TIA!!! Original post in the other subreddit: I’m 38 years old. I’ve always been a little cranky when I’m PMS-ing. But the last few months or so I feel like it’s been unbearable. I’m irritable, I want to cry every second even from no provocation. I’ve literally sat here the last few days wishing my husband and daughter would go away for a few days so I can have some peace and quiet. I know I’m no joy to be around. I’ve found myself yelling at them and getting agitated more. I love them and of course I couldn’t be without them. So why do I feel that way? Even something as small as a typo makes me want to hurl my phone at the wall. I want to SCREAM. Idk if this is PMS or my mental health. I also have Graves’ disease which messes with my mental state often. But I’m on medication so it is supposed to help. And it only seems to get this bad when I’m about to start. I don’t like myself like this. I feel like an angry, miserable person when it’s that time of the month. Is this normal or does it sound like I need mental help? 😭🤦🏻‍♀️",

My husband has no idea of what’s going on although I still have a huge sex drive like I’ve always had. I’m going to the endocrinologist on Thursday to discuss this. Can anyone offer any suggestions or what they did to manage this? Plain and simple- it’s disruptive to my life (although it seems to actually be my life now).. these hot flashes happen at least 5 times per day and at night, disrupt my sleep so I’m medicating to get rest. I need to continue losing weight. My efforts got me off of insulin and I felt great until my body decided to do this…. Thanks for any advice or suggestions.",

My peri symptoms ramped up over the past few months and initially I was freaking out about the hot flushes because they seemed almost constant and really intense and came out of nowhere. I started taking hrt and the oestrogel almost immediately fixed the hot flushes - which is great. However, I now have stomach/constipation issues and I'm really battling not to convince myself it's something other than hormonal. I'm constantly feeling the need to burp after eating and drinking, sometimes feeling like I can't catch my breath properly until I get rid of the wind. I'll be out somewhere and start panicking I'm going to have a heart attack or something. Also often have the lump in throat feeling often. Bowel movements have changed and now less regular, including waking in night to go to the loo. I feel like something is in my lower abdomen and it's probably just poop! Started the progesterone tonight and read the warnings (which I know are based on outdated research), but still.. How will I know if my heart is ok to take these meds?? My dad had a blood clot but the Dr didn't seem concerned about that. I'm going to make a Dr's appt to get the stomach issues checked but I  think my Dr already thinks I'm a crazy hypochondriac. I'm basically just driving myself mad every day thinking worst case scenario. Anyone else?? I know no one can help me with this, I just want to feel less alone!",

I started out telling her about all the things that have improved: lighter and more regular periods, sleep, no longer getting up to pee at night, night sweats gone, rage gone, heart palpitations are much rarer, fewer migraines, and I no longer get electric shock sensations. These were all issues I brought up in my initial consultation. The only issue I had mentioned that didn’t improve was libido. It’s not fully gone but it’s all a bit meh. I then told her about new things that have crept up over the summer - some weight gain, lack of motivation/drive/confidence, general feeling of unrest/anxiety, brain fog, clumsiness and joint pain. She said that this is a sign that I’m not tolerating HRT and that it’s quite likely that I’m actually not in or far enough along in peri to benefit from HRT, and told me stop taking it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? How soon do I become an insomniac rage monster again? Do I quit cold turkey (her suggestions)? Do I taper off a bit more gently? Or do I say fuck this and look for a new GYN because she’s wrong? All perspectives welcome!

The brain fog and lack of motivation associated with perimenopause is causing me to struggle and feel like I can’t do this job anymore.

      "content_preview": "Just need to vent out this horrible feeling because I know you ladies KNOW and I will feel better for crying here. I strongly suspect that I need some HRT to help with my mood. I have been suffering all this year and have tried everything, meds, inpatient psych, outpatient group day program for 7 weeks, individual therapy, exercise, diet, everything. I cry every day! Every day I wake up with the wobbles (that adrenalin,e cortisol panicky nervey feeling that stays all day and makes muscles feel like they are shaking internally even though they aren't) and my depression is always there. I need to find a provider who will discuss HRT for me. I am 44, I have talked to my OBGYN 2 times, and both times she doesn't feel I need HRT help. Because I still have my period and I am 44. Even though she says I am in perimenopause. So I am emailing my PCP to find out if she manages/prescribes for perimenopausal women and I'll look at the Wiki to see what wording I should use so I don't get bounced back to my mental health med provider. I look on the menopause society's website to find a provider near to me and why do most of them have their own membership thing??? I just want to see a doctor or APRN or NP - WHOEVER - who puts their hand up and says that they will help women who need help. I don't want to sign up for a membership because I can't afford that. I just need a provider and a discussion about HRT and if it is a fit for me. I am in Connecticut. I am scared to try Midi. I don't know why. I read a bunch of reviews of it not working out for people. I just can't stand it. I do not know WHAT ELSE to do and I don't feel like taking Klonopin twice a day every day when I know myself and I know this is different. To quote Roy Kent \"FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!\". I have checked with my endocrinologist that my thyroid is not causing any of this because this year has been SO BAD but she ran various blood tests and is satisfied my thyroid is not causing this.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone 47 here and just started the HRT journey. i understand the baseline numbers are not something to go by but my testosterone was >3 and I guess progesterone was low. I will start by saying I’ve always suffered from pretty debilitating anxiety Since i was very young and am very sensitive to most meds. Symptoms: *Nighttime hot flashes here and there for over a year. ( not consistent) irritability way more extreme before cycle anxiety worsening Energy fading way faster weeks where my diet is great and I work out at the gym and look awesome and the following week I plummet and my muscle mass drops and I have no energy. feeling dizzy and disoriented like everything around me is spinning or moving really fast. Vision changes. Ear Ringing a few bouts of feeling so burned out i collapsed into tears Prescribed: 100 mg oral progesterone at night Testosterone- 2mg Troche twice a day ( I did not do pellets or shots just in case the dose was too intense. Also did not do cream due to the fact that I have a five-year-old and we want to avoid any contact with his skin.) First day on the testosterone, two hours later felt like my heart was rapidly beating out of my chest and a lot of panic set. First night of progesterone, weird little heart amps ups and strange thoughts before falling asleep. The next morning I went into a store and had a weird overwhelming panic attack that only lasted a couple of minutes. Then went home took the testosterone but cut the dose down to 1 mg the rest of the day I felt pretty good. I felt a lot more calm and just enjoyed the day a little more. Day two not so many weird feelings at night with a progesterone, but still woke up twice in the night and feel a little anxious this morning. Sorry for the long story. I just got a little nervous having an anxious background and you guys seem so helpful and knowledgeable. I’d appreciate any feedback. I’m just wondering if all this eases out with time.",

For those of you on HRT—was it prescribed by your primary care physician? Or some other type of provider? My primary care physician will prescribe birth control pills, but says she will not do any other type of HRT for peri—only for post menopause, which for me could be 6-8 years away. My naturopath is great, and will prescribe testosterone and natural remedies, but not bioidentical HRT. After 18 months on various types of birth control pills, I’m fed up and ready to try something else but not sure where to turn.",

I understand everyone’s going to tell me to get on HRT but I’m not a candidate. My doctor is very PRO HRT but agrees with this after I’ve received several opinions by medical professionals who specialize in menopause and peri. That aside…. My period ended last Friday evening. So 8-9 days ago. I’ve been fine all week with the exception of two migraines (normal during and after my period for a few days) but today? I’m nauseous. With my migraines? Nauseous. It’s not an “I’m gonna throw up” nausea, but more of an unsettled stomach type of feeling. I’m just curious if this occurs with anyone else. This is the first time I’ve experienced nausea so late after my period has ended. Normally I feel it for 3-5 days after my period has ended but again, it’s now day 8-9 after it has ended. Allergic to zofran. Not looking for medical advice. Just asking if I’m alone in this. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "Sorry this is long. 😭 I’ve been on HRT since March with an .075 estradiol patch + taking Slynd 🤮. Estrogen helped a lot. But the past 3 months I feel like all my symptoms are coming back (except maybe hot flashes?) and I'm back to where I was before with extreme overwhelm. Motivation is there. I WANT to do things but it's like the cognitive part of my brain is offline. Tl;dr: Mini-pill (Slynd) feels like being stuck in permanent luteal phase (spotting, rage, brain fog). Estrogen helped a lot but ADHD meds don’t work most of the time or are realllly delayed. It was fine for 1 month but now I have constant spotting. Sometimes 3+ weeks/month with extreme morning rage. Most of the time my head isn't clear until 12pm and I wake up at like 6am. By 9pm I do get a bit of clarity - is that the previous dose of Slynd wearing off?? Adderall XR only lasts about 5 hours and IR boosters don’t help at all so I'm in a rebound all day. My motivation is there ( I know what I want/need to do) but it’s like my brain isn't firing. My executive function is non-existent and I have to use my 5 hours a day of clarity at work. Loosing it because I'm behind of legit every single thing in my life. Anyone switch from Slynd to micronized progesterone like Prometrium and have better luck? Anyone stop HRT because of progesterone and get some relief? Background 3rd Mirena IUD triggered constant PMDD-like state. Pretty much the same as now. Def did better during ovulation pre-3rd mirena. Can suppressing ovulation actually make things worse? Pre-2024: Vyvanse was great for about 4 years. This year Switched from Vyvanse to Adderall XR (Vyvanse gave me a weird fog for the first 4 hours of the day) Hydration, sleep, protein, breakfast vs no breakfast no major impact Magnesium at night makes the next day worse (delayed alertness, sluggish) I did a DUTCH test in 2023 that did show weird cortisol levels - low in the morning and high at night. Thyroid normal, vitamin D normal but low, Ferritin on low end of normal",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone 💛 I’m 52, and still technically “healthy” — regular periods, good diet, no major medical issues. But mentally, emotionally, and physically… I feel like I’m quietly falling apart. I’m so tired. Not “didn’t sleep well” tired — I mean soul-deep, can’t-move, don’t-recognise-myself tired. I used to do yoga (for over 30 years!), CrossFit, swimming, Zumba… now I can’t even bring myself to do a few cat-cows. I used to be active, social, full of life. Now I find myself crying over nothing, forgetting what I was saying mid-sentence, obsessing about random things (like my neck skin?!), and just wanting to hide away from everyone. I’m still walking daily, sleeping 6-7 hours at night, eating well, taking all the supplements — magnesium, omega-3, Rhodiola, vitamin D, CoQ10, progesterone (prescribed)… the list goes on. But still — I feel like I’m running on fumes. My doctor says I’m “not ready” for HRT because I still get regular periods. So I’m stuck in this weird hormonal purgatory. I have seen at least three different gynaecologists and two GPs. I have a loving partner, great kids, a solid job… everything to be thankful for. But none of it cuts through this fog. This subreddit has been my lifeline. Thank you for sharing your journeys — it reminds me I’m not crazy or alone. If you’ve been here too — what helped you start feeling like you again? BTW I live in France. Sending hugs 💛",

      "content_preview": "The mods in askwomenover50 said to ask here...I'm not sure why because I'm only 31 so I don't think this applies to me...but they removed my post so I figured I'd go ahead and try here. Hormone imbalance? Something else? 31F I don't really know where to start exactly, or what words to use, but I'll do my best to make this make sense. Basically, I feel like I am two different people, and that I have no control over when I feel like one or the other. My whole personality shifts drastically, and it literally happens overnight without warning. I'd say it happens about every 2 months or so, sometimes sooner, sometimes longer, but on average I think about every 2 months I feel this happen. There is usually time mixed in there too where I'm just \"neutral\" and don't feel much of anything, good or bad. So there are times when I feel: Very happy, energetic and motivated. I have a bright outlook on life and each day in general. I'm interested in my hobbies, I wake up feeling rested. My libido is very high during these times, to the point even that all I can think about is sex. I want to feel, be and act sexy, and I want to have sex. I'm very sweet and affectionate as well, feeling very cuddly and touchy, and emotionally I feel soft and vulnerable and kind. This will last anywhere from about 4 days to almost 2 weeks. Then one day I'll wake up, and it will all be gone. I don't feel anything. I don't care about my hobbies or projects or personal goals. I don't want to be touched. In fact being touched feels uncomfortable and puts me on edge. I feel very irritable and defensive. I don't feel soft and sweet anymore, instead I feel tough and emotionally cold. The sex drive completely disappears, and no matter how much I try to entice it back, I'm just put off by sex at that point I don't feel sexy anymore and don't care to. I don't have a lot of energy and it's so hard to motivate myself to do anything...even things I normally love doing. I hate that second way of feeling. I've tried for years to get out of this cycle but I can't...I don't control it. It just happens to me and all the willpower in the world doesn't bring the \"old me\" back until it just happens on its own. Like, if you asked me the same set of questions in both \"mindsets\", it would look like two completely different people answered them. That's how much my personality and thinking change. I did a lot of research and it seems to me like I have a hormone imbalance of some kind, so I have been trying to track my cycle, but it's so irregular I can't make sense of it. It didn't used to be irregular, but then I was on birth control for about 10 years, and quit taking it about 6 months ago (because it was making all this worse). So maybe my cycle is off because of that? But I've been having the personality shift problem for several years now. When I feel one way, I can't imagine ever feeling differently. I know, cognitively, that there are times when I feel the \"other way\", but it's like I'm remembering someone else's memories...I don't relate to those thoughts or feelings at all...I can't make myself feel them. So when I feel super happy and horny and sweet, I can't identify with feeling irritable and closed off. I know that I do feel that way sometimes, but in that moment, I would swear that I'll never feel that way again. Then one day, I wake up, and there it is. And I just lay there and cry because I don't want to feel awful again. Please someone help me...I can't go through this anymore and I have no one to talk to. Please someone help me. This is so exhausting and awful and it's hurting me and my marriage. I hope someone reads this and can help.",

      "content_preview": "So…I have no idea what I’m doing. I just know that my gyno is very HRT supportive and she noted after talking a peepsy at my hormones that I seemed to have low progesterone and high androgen in relation to estrogen. She’s going by symptoms, though. I have a Mirena IUD, so it could be affecting my androgen being so high. I have decided to get it removed and maybe stop hormonal BC or maybe go on a generation 4 progestin BC, like Slynd…I don’t know what I should actually do in this regard. My husband had a vasectomy 2 years ago. I have no history of PCOS or endometriosis. Before the Mirena (I’m on my third one), periods were very manageable. My symptoms of PMS were getting acne, craving sweets, and some light cramping/feeling bloated. It wasn’t anything extreme. My periods lasted about 5 to 7 days, flow was never outrageous…I basically had very normal periods. I would perhaps be a bit irritable when Aunt Flo finally arrived, but it wasn’t “I must confine myself to quarters for a week” or anything like that. It’s been many years since I’ve have a period, so I don’t know what they are like now. That is the other reason I want my Mirena removed - changes with my period can tell me things about what both my sex and thyroid hormones are doing. I am aware of “The Mirena Crash”, but I’m on progesterone support now and anticipate less severe issues with that happening. Anyway, last month my gyno gave me 200mg progesterone pills that I take in the evening and seem to be tolerating well. They’ve helped me with sleep and relaxation & I don’t feel dizzy or dragged down/low mood in the morning. She also gave me .05mg Dotti brand estradiol patches 2 weeks ago and after perseverating about whether I should try them, I decided “screw it” and put my first patch on an hour ago. If my androgen is high, progesterone can only do so much. I need estrogen to balance. I’ve had all these really weird symptoms for months since my thyroid swung hypo in April (I have Graves Disease), and even though I am now euthyroid (normal thyroid hormone levels), symptoms persist. Brain fog, tinnitus, stiff joints in my neck (ruled out arthritis with a rheumatologist & orthopedic doc says my x-rays don’t show anything serious), a glottal/stuck food feeling in the front of my neck (my thyroid is not swollen), weird issues with digestion (gastroenterologist ruled out h.pylori, Celiac’s, and IBS), acne all over my body, oily/thinning hair that doesn’t grow very fast, my body odor is absolutely rank, resting HR is too high (cardiologist said my heart rhythm looks good, though), weird head pressure type headaches (neuro opthamologist said I don’t have papilledema), and the sun has become my enemy (because it’s hot where I live). I figure the hypothyroid state unveiled a sex hormone imbalance and my body was like “lol, here’s everything all at once, welcome to perimenopause, SUCKER”. I’m 42. My mother and all three of her sisters were all done with periods at age 52. I remember my mom having wicked hot flashes in her late 40s. When I was a teenager, my family lived somewhere that had a lot of snow in winter and she’d have a hot flash while we were riding in the car with her and she’d roll down the windows. We’d be freezing and ask her to roll them back up and she’d scream “I’m hot!”. It was a funny memory…but maybe not so much anymore. So, now that my thyroid hormones are stabilized, I’m throwing HRT at my body to see if that is what might be the thing that helps me. Since I tolerated progesterone pretty well so far, and don’t have a history of intolerance to progestin birth control, I’m giving estrogen a chance to balance out androgen. I warned my husband that I have no idea what to expect . He’s on this roller coaster with me and he’s very supportive. He’s older than I am by 4 years and andropause punched him in the cojones when hit his 40s. I’ve watched a bunch of videos Mary Claire Haver, MD put out and listened to a podcast where she talked about balancing sex hormones in perimenopause/menopause and how vital they are. Her explanation of their roles in various bodily systems was an eye opener. I think her statement “I’ll be buried with an estrogen patch on my hip” is the reason I finally sought out help from my gyno. I love doctors with a sense of humor. Positive stories about your experience with HRT would be appreciated, along with some tips if it seems like the E patch/P pill doesn’t seem to be working for me. Sorry about how long this post is.",
