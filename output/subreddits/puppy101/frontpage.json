      "content_preview": "I have a six-month old puppy that has always slept in her crate for most of the night but i let her sleep in my bed for the last few hours (from 5.30/6am). She has a bed and two blankets but she always squashes them down and sleeps on top of them or pushes the blankets to the side and just sleeps on her bed — she never burrows under the blankets in the crate. I’ve noticed recently she’s become more insistent about leaving her crate — she’ll whine sometimes from 3.30 or 4am until I let her into my bed at 5.30. When I do let her into my bed, she tunnels under the covers and sleeps by my feet. It is pretty cold here at night but when — ages ago — I expressed worry about this to the breeder she said the puppy would be fine. But is the insistence and tunneling a sign the puppy actually is cold? Or just a puppy wanting to be with me? I do want to keep her sleeping in her crate for most of the night (as I’m scared she’ll hurt herself if she tries to jump off my bed to get to the bathroom or something in the night, plus a general desire to maintain crate training until she’s a bit older) but I hate the idea that she might be whining and rattling the bars because she’s freezing! If she was cold in the crate would she find a way to burrow under her blankets?",

      "content_preview": "First of all, I don't want to hear from people who say they fight every battle, shaming everyone who isn't perfect. Just go away. Let's be honest. We are humans and we have other things going on in our lives aside from raising a puppy. Sure, it would be great if we could devote 100% of our time and energy purely to our dog. But, that's not reality. What battles have you said \"fuck it\" to? I'll start. I have given up on stopping my puppy from chewing wood/ sticks in our yard. I know it isn't ideal. I know it's best for her to only chew on dog toys... but, holy shit. She chews on everything in sight and I can't fight every battle or I will lose my mind even more than I already have. She has a million toys and chewies, lots of stimulation... but she is a dog and likes chomping wood. Let's normalize being human and not being able to follow every bit of advice on the internet. Obviously we want our pups to be happy, healthy, safe, well adjusted dogs. We wouldn't be here if we didn't care. But having a puppy is hard and we need to give ourselves and each other some grace. Remember, people and dogs have been cohabitating for thousands of years and have survived and thrived without all of the current wisdom. So, maybe it's okay to pick our battles for the sake  of our sanity.",

Every trainer makes it seem like you can somehow do everything right and avoid all the annoying parts of having a puppy (potty accidents, chewing, biting, barking) It’s just not possible. I’m home all day (WFH) and supervise her always and we still have random accidents. She’s been going in her crate/pen since day one and still at 12 weeks will sometimes whine and bark to get out. They develop new fears every day (wet grass is now her worst enemy even though she was exposed to it her whole first week with me). I don’t know, I just want anyone getting a puppy to know how truly unique this journey will be for each puppy and not to beat yourself up comparing to trainers on YouTube or even just other people on this subreddit.",

Either to a specific toy he wants to play with or a spot he want me to sit. As adorable and clever as this is, my immediate thought was \"am I rewarding negative behaviour?\". Would this make him think that he's incharge or make him start biting when he wants something, or is it harmless?",

      "content_preview": "He’s my first ever dog. I did so much research before getting him. I knew exactly what socialization was and how to do it in theory. But no amount of research could have prepared me for how difficult owning a puppy would be. And even with all the knowledge I had about training, I had no idea how to do it in practice with 0 experience. I got him at 13 weeks old, and I was immediately overwhelmed with everything I felt I needed to get to. I can’t really explain my thought process, I don’t think there was much of one, I was just paralyzed. I focused on handling, crate training, and the command “settle” and decided once I was “finished” with those then I’d get to other things. Well, I didn’t realize that it takes months to master some skills, which I feel stupid about now. I also didn’t understand that most of socializing is best done when the opportunity presents itself, I was only doing it in structured sessions. Once I realized I wasn’t mastering any of them anytime soon, I sort of panicked and started rushing, pushing way too fast and setting our progress back. I eventually left those behind and started rushing to get to everything else before the socialization period ended. Before he got all his vaccinations we started by just sitting in the front yard, but he’d bark at every dog that went by. He was also skittish of loud noises and objects. The whole time I felt like there was a clock ticking down to the end of his socialization window so I continued to rush into things. For some, it actually worked and he grew accustomed to them, but I should’ve seen it coming that it wouldn’t go like that for everything. Now he’s 7 months old and I have to do double the work to fix everything I messed up on. I feel so embarrassed because most reactive dogs are rescues with difficult pasts, but I got mine from a good breeder from a young age, it was me that messed up. If you read all of this, thank you. I just needed to get this off my chest.",

I figured because I’ve raised a puppy before and work from home this would be the same process, but I’m absolutely breaking down right now and not sure if I should stick it out or give him back to the breeder and focus on my mental health. He’s a whippet and will theoretically calm down over time, but my girlfriend is gone for the week for a work trip and I’m just so sad and not eating.

      "content_preview": "I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else. My 6-month-old cocker spaniel x poodle pup has been struggling with being alone since the moment we got him. So, I was convinced he had separation anxiety. Crate training was a nightmare, nights were unbearable, and by 4.5 months we had completely given up on the crate. I tried desensitization and gradually leaving him for longer periods in his playpen, but I never got beyond a couple of minutes, even when he was distracted with a treat. I mostly WFH, but with my partner leaving for a 4-month trip, I was really panicking: I couldn’t leave the house for a short work meeting, or even go the supermarket without hiring a sitter. That’s when I decided to call in a trainer. The trainer observed him and immediately said she didn’t think it was separation anxiety, but rather that my pup simply couldn’t cope without constant attention. She introduced us to tether training: attaching him to the couch and using a “place” command for him to lie down on his mat. At first, every time he got up I had to correct him. Slowly, he started to settle and now he spends several hours a day calmly lying there (during his usual nap times anyway). The difference has been huge. I can finally work at my desk in another room or get things done around the house without him panicking. At first he’d still whine lightly when I was out of sight, but now even that only lasts a minute before he calms down. Today, we even practiced leaving the house for a bit, not perfect yet, but for the first time I feel like there’s light at the end of this puppy-blues tunnel. On top of that, his overall behavior has improved: he has had no more accidents in the house, is way less bitey and has a better response to “no”. I think the clearer routine and better rest are making a huge difference. So if you’re struggling with a pup who melts down the second you’re out of sight, tether training might be worth a try, it’s been a game-changer for us!",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I thought I would make a little post here for those you are struggling with puppies. I have a 13 month old intact male eurasier. The constant biting was making me cry from the pain at 4 month old, he needed constant supervision, wanted to eat everything and even managed to pull my bag from the kitchen table and eat my wallet. He would constantly steal everything as soon as a door was open. Then, by 7-8 months, adolescence started to kick in and walks became the biggest issue. The pulling was crazy, eating everything from the ground, pushing the limits with other dogs, constantly jumping and biting and not listening ANYTHING. I had the best food rewards, he would obey a second, get the food and then go straight to whatever he was doing. It was so hard, the constant doubt, I didn't know why he was making no progress. Also, he is an anxious pup so very afraid of cars, buses, trams and other people, which is a big challenge especially at the vet. It was like a second job, its my first dog so I was always looking up for advice on the web. So much advice, sometimes contradictions, things like \"if you are not doing this, you dog will end up reactive\" ect.. So much pressure. Now, he is 13 month old, and one of the best behaved dogs in the neighborood. He is soo calm, sleepy, nice to every other dog. He still gets afraid of people who want to reach for him but he doesn't care otherwise. The tramway is still an issue but he doesn't care about the cars ans buses anymore, he now understand how to walk nicely with the long line and even a shorter leash, he just goes back right to me when he reaches the end. The training you are doing now is working, you just don't see it now. It can take more or less time but your puppy will not stay a menace to society if you keep working with him. I was not even consistent, I made a lot of mistakes, it is fine. I only used positive training, I never raised my voice at him. The worst I did was putting him in his room with his bed to settle down and so I could breath. I am absolutely in love with my dog now, he is my best friend. Give it some time, I swear it is so worth it. Puppy tax : https://bashify.io/i/mRp24w",

I’ve mostly made it past the puppy blues… her chewing on literally everything has simmered down a lot however some times I get so frustrated. She was laying on my bed chewing on a toy while I was on my phone, every now and then she’d get up come over to me and check in then go back to her toy so wasn’t paying very much attention. I tried to get up from bed and noticed my glasses were gone. She must have grabbed my glasses when she came for one of her check ins. Glasses I just got three weeks ago destroyed. I’m so upset, I yelled( I know i shouldn’t have) and crated her immediately and then sobbed because they’re expensive and Im literally blind without them. I’m sure I could have handled it better but I’m just so frustrated and defeated. She’s typically a very good dog but every now and then she does something so bad I just get so depressed about it. Almost like when will she be a normal dog and I don’t have to watch her like a hawk every moment of the day.",

Anyway we have a local cemetery where I take him for a sniff around, it’s all overgrown and haunted looking and no one is ever there so I let him off the lead. Well a homeless guy had set up camp and was airing his stuff out so had it all spread  all over the ground & I didn’t know he was there - before  I could stop him my pup walks right up, gives him a big hello (guy was a dog person so gave him a pat etc) & then ofc, right in front of him my dog cocks his leg right on his sleeping bag. I’m absolutely mortified and drag my dog away while apologising profusely. I’m not sure if my dog actually managed to pee as I grabbed him quickly but still the intent was there! Guy was just like thanks for that, that’s ok & didn’t kick off but still - if your dog pees on someone’s stuff what do you even do?? Should I offer money or what? Edit: thanks all! Sadly shops were closed but I’ve ordered him a new, extra warm sleeping bag to arrive tomorrow. Will drop off with vouchers for the nearby supermarket. I feel terrible he has to use the sleeping bag tonight but I couldn’t get my hands on anything tonight. Hopefully he has somewhere else to sleep tonight anyway as there is a huge storm hitting!",

We've been working up to longer stretches in the crate for our 14 week old puppy, aiming for four 15-20 minute crate breaks a day with a frozen Kong. Sometimes we only get one in. The last few times she's fallen asleep shortly after I put her in, even if she just woke up from a nap 30 minutes prior and is awake. Is that alright? Or should I be trying to change the time of it? I just wanna make sure I'm doing the best I can for her. She's been doing great, minimal whining and I basically just sit on the porch with the window open so I can hear her. I may need to walk by the window once if she starts digging at her bed, but otherwise we've made so much progress from \"can't leave her sight for 5 seconds\" to this now.",

We considered building a fence, but that is thousands of dollars that we would have to pay for something we don't even want.  I tried a product called \"dog mace\" which is a granule you put on the ground that smells  bad to them so they don't want to be somewhere, but as soon as it rains the pellets wash away.

We still struggled with 1 accident (ish) a day at around 11 weeks and this past week it’s been none. Except, out of nowhere, she’s started sprinting around the backyard, doing absolutely nothing except going to one singular puddle of rainwater with wet mulch, pulling the mulch out, and trying to chew it. She does this repeatedly until I eventually take her inside so she doesn’t choke. Then, as soon as we go inside, she pees in the kitchen. Every. Single. Time. She isn’t leash trained yet, so I’m hesitant to take her out on the leash. I also can’t put a playpen in the yard, as it isn’t my own and the homeowner has denied. Any suggestions? I know she is getting distracted in the yard, forgetting to go, and then remembering once inside. She also does not struggle with this issue right after a nap.",

      "content_preview": "My girl is almost one and it made me think about all the things I’ve learned and what I’d do differently to when I get our second dog. Her name is Bambi and she is a female Chihuahua. BIGGEST REGRET My biggest regret is not sticking to a routine when it comes to food. It left me with a very fussy, stubborn dog so if I could give anyone advice.. do NOT be tempted to give your dog lots of “yummy” food. I know the feeling of wanting your pup to enjoy the finer things in life, including food but I promise, you may regret it. Kibble is not the worst thing in the world, like many brands and influencer want to push. Many many dogs live to be well over 15 on a kibble only diet. I was cooking my dog her meals but like I said, she ended up being super fussy and not eating because she was hoping for something better or different. What I did right.. I have the most clingiest of clingy dogs. She sleeps on my chest, she’s always on my knee or sat between my legs. She’s very very very much a lapdog. I am at home 24/7 with her so you’d think, when I leave the house, she’s a mess. NOPE. Probably the best thing I did in order to avoid severe separation anxiety was the method I used the minute I brought her home. AVOIDING SEPARATION ANXIETY On day one, I walked outside the front door for mere seconds and came back in. Every day I would do this and make it just a little longer each time. After a week or so I could nip to the shop and take around 15 minutes. She would sometimes cry for a few seconds behind the door but she doesn’t even do that anymore. She’s absolutely brilliant. I can leave her for two hours without a problem and could probably go longer but I never do. I sometimes will leave her with the hoodie I was wearing on my bed. I put the TV on for her and she just chills till I come home. This method worked so well because she knew whenever I left, I always came back. They don’t have the best concept of time. If the first time you leave your pup alone is for long enough for them to get distressed then you’ve all ready created the space and room for separation anxiety. I really really do recommend using the method I did. DEALING WITH BITING How I stopped her from constantly biting me and others was a mixture of positive reinforcement and ignoring her. she bites I take my hand away and said no biting I then would offer her my hand and if she licked me instead of biting I would tell her good girl etc but if she bites again I’d say “no biting” and stand up, stop playing and ignore her. This worked really well for me. I just had to deal with a lot of licking lol. Socialise your dog from early as possible. I have a Chihuahua who absolutely adores people and other dogs, she’s not anxious around new people and dogs and is eager to say hi to everyone. I could see how, if I didn’t socialise her, she could have become a very anxious dog around new people and other dogs so I really do see that early socialisation as vital. If you have a friendly dog in the family, let your pup socialise with them  and the older dog will help your puppy know what’s acceptable behaviour etc as the older dog will “teach” them. Obviously, under the guidance of you. The last piece of advice I’ll give is.. never raise your voice at the dog and don’t tell the pup off regularly. I could count on one hand the amount of times I have told Bambi she was “bad”, it’s not something I ever really do and I instead figure out how I could use positive reinforcement in the situation instead. Why I think this is so important is because when Bambi does do something she shouldn’t and she knows better, she HATES being told she’s a bad girl because she’s not used to it and in turn, she always aims to please. No doubt when I get my second dog, they’ll be completely different and I’ll have new regrets and find new methods of training etc.",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys. I have a 19 week old GSD puppy from tomorrow (2nd sept as in he turns 19 weeks old tomorrow) and the past two times I’ve taken him out for a walk in the evening like we have for many weeks now. Same time it’s part of his evening wind down routine. When a dog barks especially a deep bark from a big dog he’s turned and ran away. He’s not gotten far because of the lead but this is suddenly onset. He’s gotten the all clear from the vet for no health problems. I am just wondering if this is possibly the second fear stage. He’s been socialised in many scenarios from a young age. And he’s always been cautious of dogs but the past few weeks that cautiousness has evolved into curiosity. But the last two evening walks just nope nada. I managed to move him away from the dog barking which he couldn’t see and finally got him to focus on me. We did a little touch hand then treat but I’m worried and just wondering what I can do. I don’t want to force him into a scenario he’s not comfortable with. I keep the walk as similar as possible. So same route. Or same route just backwards. Or similar route but takes us back onto the main route. And it’s been like that for the last 5 weeks. Any advice would be massively appreciated. Thank you in advance",

      "content_preview": "Please don’t judge, I would love some nice advice!! I recently got a puppy with my boyfriend and i’ve been staying at his house consistently for some weeks. I have had another puppy who’s grown up some now back at my own house and the potty training went well with him, but this puppy here is having a harder time. The main issue I believe is the fact that we work night shifts and his family initially wanted to help care for the puppy but a few weeks has gone by and nobody wants to help as much anymore. I understand this is not anyone else’s responsibility. The family doesn’t really care for him being around and exploring the house and there’s often scraps on the floor so we are afraid of the puppy eating something off the floor so most hours of the day he is stuck in the bedroom. We have tried training with pads and sometimes it would work, but he would just pee on them, tear them up, then pee everywhere else too. He will only go under the bed to poop all the way in the furthest spots or will just eat the poop. We can take him outside after he eats/drinks or even every hour when we can and he still won’t grasp the concept of potty training. I feel like i’ve tried all that I know and sometimes he is driving me so crazy. I don’t know what to do and it’s a bit frustrating. I know he’s only a baby and deserves patience, but sometimes I wonder if he’s just young & learning or if I’m doing something wrong. We don’t plan on rehoming him and are planning on moving out early next year so I know our current situation isn’t ideal for raising a puppy, but i wonder if that’s the main issue or if it’s something we aren’t doing right. He gets lots of love and attention from us and is always by our sides and at our feet. He’s an easy learner otherwise with basic commands and is a sweet & active dog so we just want to come to a routine that will work out the best. Our next approach is going to be taking him out every 30 minutes and crating him while we’re asleep and talking with the family to see if there’s a routine we can work out whilst we are away at work. Please comment thoughts, help and advice if you have any!",

      "content_preview": "hi all! I adopted my 14-week puppy from a shelter three days ago. when we first got her, she was scared of everything, including people, new places, any unfamiliar sounds (especially cars and trucks). she's made a ton of progress in the past 72 hours but has been showing signs of territorialness yesterday and today. over the past two days, my partner has had two of her female friends (both not much taller than 5 ft) separately visit our apartment. I wasn't here yesterday, but apparently she was growling at the first friend. today, the second friend just visited, and our puppy was growling and didn't really warm up to her (even though I gave the friend treats to give our puppy at the door, etc). yesterday the puppy met my mom in the park, and then we went to my apartment. she was perfectly friendly (though shy) and showed no signs of fear or territorialness once we went back to our apartment. one more concerning incident is that last night before we went to bed, the puppy was at the foot of an air mattress that I blew up so one of us could be close to her crate. I was lying on the air mattress with the dog, and my partner walked in and started barking/growling. for reference, the puppy has definitely bonded with me the most and probably sees me as her \"person\"/protector. her personality is pretty different with me than it is with others. but she has also been very nice and sweet to my partner, so this was a concerning incident. any tips? am I exposing her to too much at once? she's a very fearful dog but coming out of her shell at an impressive rate. the one thing I refuse to have is an unfriendly dog—so I'm willing to do whatever it takes (pay for a professional trainer, etc.). I'm determined to nip any issues in the bud and prevent them before they fully manifest. is it possible for a trainer simply to train a dog to be more friendly? thanks!",

But I can’t for the life of me get why she occasionally goes and pees on the carpet. She has done it in the past when the bathroom door wasn’t open and she HAD to go. But we deep cleaned the carpet and had since used the carpet. Like a few days ago I had my back to her for literally 3 seconds and she started peeing. Then she did it again this morning while my gf was getting up. We’re at a lost since she’s never used puppy pads or has been taught a specific place to go in the house.",

He was playing with his sister and he was getting a little rough (he was a big boy he was King Corso German Shepherd mix) so I told him to stop. His sister laid down. He came over to see me. He went to lay down. He was laying for a couple minutes then he started to make this really strange sound. Almost like he was having a bad dream. Next thing we knew he was seizing and he was gone within 30 seconds. This is the worst experience and I never even heard of GVD until the vet told us that he was in bloat. I wish we would’ve known. He should still be here. He was only 10 months old and only got to spend eight months with us. It’s never gonna be enough time for my Moose. I hope someone else learns about bloat and is able to save their fur baby. 💔",

There’s absolutely no way I can redirect him, tunnel vision on the dog and no treat or toy is worth his attention (harness is not an option, our trainer told us he’s not good on it, he don’t understand leash tension and he can use his weight better to pull and it’s not safe.

I think what was making me so anxious and scared was comparing my puppy to other people’s. “Oh no I’m not doing this right according to random internet person.” The fact is we all have different dogs. Breeds, temperaments, etc. While it’s helpful to know that others go through the same stuff - your pup might have different days where they don’t do everything you want them to do or you didn’t train as well today or training isn’t going well and you have to just focus on the basics (feed, nap, potty). It’s perfectly okay to not be okay. And it’s not going to go perfect. At all. Accidents will happen. Crate won’t go okay one day and okay the other. You aren’t harming your dog by leaving them for awhile for your sanity. We can do this. I fully believe that. While we may all come from different backgrounds and have different dogs, at the end of the day look back like you would a human child and ask yourself - were they fed today? Did they pee/poop? Did they get their naps? Were they loved? Chances are. Even if you are doing just the minimum. You’re doing okay. And that’s okay too.",

I redirect constantly but it only ever hold for about 10 seconds until she immediately goes back to biting a hand again. I am looking for any kind of advice for what actually works.

      "content_preview": "I guess I'm just looking for reassurance here and maybe some tips and tricks if you have any. Our male golden retriever turned 1 a couple of weeks ago. He's always been a very excitable puppy, but on the whole, I'd say our experience was generally positive and we thought we were doing everything right (dog trainer, puppy classes every week, regular training sessions, mental and physical stimulation etc). However, it seems like a switch has gone in his head and he's just completely changed literally overnight. This all started on Saturday morning (2 days ago now) when we went to our regular puppy class. He usually takes about a minute or two to settle down and he's been doing better each time, but this time he seemed to totally regress. He would not stop barking for the whole hour, which is completely out of character for him. We were convinced that one of the females was in season because both males in the class were barking excessively at her, and we had never even heard the other one bark before after 10 months of attending classes with him. Now here's where we made a mistake. There was a \"puppy reunion\" at the breeder's house yesterday, where all the owners would come together to celebrate the dogs' birthday. We knew this would be extremely exciting for him, but we've gone to something like this before (when he was around 4/5 months old) and he was great (I appreciate they weren't sexually mature at that stage). Safe to say, this was a huge mistake and I can't help but feel ashamed, embarrased and overall pretty down about the whole thing. While all the other dogs were pretty well-behaved, ours was an absolute nightmare. We had to leash him because he would not leave the females alone (he wasn't mounting, just generally annoying them). Once leashed, he would NOT stop barking, which irritated a lot of people. Like I said, completely out of character for him, especially considering the amount of impulse control we've done with him. While other dogs were listening to their owners (even the other males), ours completely ignored us to the point where we might as well have not been there. I was so ashamed because when they were all puppies, ours was widely regarded as the \"genius\" puppy, where the other owners were questioning whether they were doing something wrong. Now it seems like we have the reputation of having the \"bad one\". All that training has gone out of the window. Since we got home, he has not stopped crying, barking, even howling, which, like I said, is completely out of character for him. Yes, I absolutely regret taking him to the meet-up, but it makes me question why other people with dogs of the same age from the same litter are able to take part in these kinds of activities, but we can't. The key things I'm looking for advice on is: Is this just normal teenage male behaviour? If so, how do I maintain my sanity whilst doing what's best for him? Will neutering help? How do you socialise your teenage dogs without overstimulating them? Do you have any tips on building engagement when your dog is seemingly less interested in you than ever? To make things more frustrating, he doesn't seem to care about treats any more, so it feels like we have no leverage when trying to train him (weird for a golden, I know!). He just finds other people, dogs, smells etc way more exciting than any treats. We have resorted to using fresh, high-value treats, but that does not work anywhere outside of the house... To note, I will be booking a vet appointment to ask about neutering and to check for any other physical causes. I will also be asking my dog trainer for more 1-to-1 sessions. Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hi, i got my puppy when she was about 3.5 months and now she’s 5 months today. I feel i’m seeing major progress with her socialization and i want to keep doing that. I live in an apartment complex so she had to get used to a lot of new things at once (lots of dogs everywhere even when i tried to avoid them, people all the time, loud trucks, landscaping, etc.) this was extremely difficult at first bc she was a very shy puppy when we brought her home. she had zero socialization when we got her besides her litter mates and the breeders family. so she was understandably overwhelmed by a lot. we still have issues of her being scared when other dogs bark and lunge at her (unfortunately this happens multiple times a week even though we stay far away from these certain dogs that do this). this is really her main fear that she has left that she has a hard time moving on from unless we can go inside fast. but sometimes that isn’t possible if we have to walk a short ways to get home and she is usually pulling and whining and super scared. how do i handle this and how can i desensitize her slowly. she does very well with other calm dogs, so dogs in general aren’t the problem. for example even today we passed an apartment that had two barking dogs in it. it wasn’t very loud but definitely audible. you couldn’t see them but this threw her completely off and she couldn’t focus to do anything but sit behind me or want to run in the opposite direction that we were going. i feel so bad for her bc it’s not her fault, i would be scared if people started screaming at me too randomly for just walking outside lol.",

I was deep in the trenches with a golden puppy who wouldn’t bite anything but my arms, was constantly jumping and scratching me, barking for attention… the list goes on. But I swear when she turned 5 months, something in her changed and she’s the most chill dog (for now 🤪). She now lays with me in bed, accepts affection without biting, knows proper play, and is 100% potty trained through the night. I couldn’t believe it but I remember thinking it would never end. Just know that it does!!!!",

      "content_preview": "Saoirse, my Xolo girl, is just now 10mo and possibly the most wonderful girl ever. She comes with me to work during the day- I’m a farrier, so she spends a lot of time looking out the windows of the truck while we drive between clients, and running around sightseeing on client’s properties while I work, or playing with their resident dogs. We do some trick training so that I can show her off to my clients, and she seems to enjoy that, but a lot of her “training” has been shaping behaviors in different environments during the day and teaching her to be a good citizen. A couple times a week, I get a chance to stop by a lake or a park and we’ll go for a long off-leash or longline adventure, playing in the water and throwing the Chuck-It ball around. I was worried that despite all of the fun she has during the day, and all of the socialization she gets, that she was missing something. That our bond was kind of lacking for how much time we spend together. So, I decided to introduce a hobby that we can both partake in! Obedience is fun, and I interlace that with trick training at home, but it gets boring for both of us after a little bit (unless we get both of her lazy Pyrenees brothers involved for as long as they’ll focus). I want to add some agility in the future but I’d like to start at home and I don’t have the money/space to do my own obstacle course right now, so that was out. She likes water but is not the best swimmer yet and is pretty generous with her definition of “bring it here”, so no dock diving and no discs, though she’s decent with her “get” and “bring” commands when we retrieve with dummies in our backyard at home. In my mind, that left nose work, and she LOVES IT! I dove in and grabbed a kit with 5 different scents in it, because I’m crazy. Broke out the sausage and just taught her to sniff it at first. That went pretty quickly, so I put the container in a tupperware lid and plopped it randomly on the floor of our kitchen with 10 other lids. Cued her to sniff, and when she found it I immediately laid on the praise (and the food). We’ve totally gone to town since then- I’ve hid that container in every feasible spot in my home, high and low, playing dirty by putting it behind fans or next to wax melts or a litter box, and she can find it every time. I get so excited when she finds it, huge rush of dopamine for me, and I swear when she gets discouraged with a new and difficult hide it’s her anticipation of my approval that keeps her going. Today she learned a new scent, and picked it up fast within one or two reps. I hid both containers in the same round, and she found both for me. Huge steps. It’s raining here and she’s been awake for maybe 3 hours today, but she’s asleep next to me as we speak after 30min of nosework. Just wanted to share with everyone- if you’re an exhausted teen parent looking for something to stimulate your dog and help your bond, this might be it!",

      "content_preview": "I am just dropping this note because I see so many people talking about “management” (i.e., removing things that might be an issue for your dog from their environment). I fully agree that management is super important—especially in the first few months of a new puppy. With that said, by like month three, I started getting tired of not having my dish towels, toilet paper and garbage cans in the normal places… So, once he was proficient in “leave it” (a prerequisite for this exercise, really) we started picking one “trigger” item (for lack of a better term) to reintroduce into his environment. We would watch our pup closely around that item for as long as needed. We’d do a “leave it” command and reward any time he tried to engage with it. After a week or so, it clicked that those were “permanent leave-its” as we call them and he started leaving them alone and/or just getting bored of them in general. Occasionally he’ll still engage if he is sleepy or wants attention, but much less than before. Just sharing as a friendly tip and reminder! TL;DR: Use management but don’t forget to reintroduce things to allow your puppy to learn to leave them alone and/or get bored of the items.",

When she was here last year, there were still so many rules in our home because we absolutely had a land shark on our hands. Don't leave out tissues, shoes, glasses, pens, food, etc it will get destroyed. Don't leave the door open, ignore her when she does this, praise her when she does that. And still, my mom found the puppy to be too much. She jumped, she chewed, she mouthed, she bit. And now, she is everything we wanted in a dog. She has truly settled. She doesn't need as much exercise to stay sane. My partner and I are the ones missing our long and frequent walks. She comes when called, she chills when it's time to chill. She is sweet and funny and goofy and the cutest best pup ever. There were times when I was posting here in the early days that I was literally hiding in my room crying.

No behavior issues and excels at training. The biggest issue is I cannot take my other dog out of the house without my puppy going crazy. If he’s in the crate he smacks at the crate door and is howling the entire time. Very clearly distressed. If I let him out of the crate he will run to the window and also keep crying out. I don’t really trust him to be loose in the house since he chews on everything that’s within reach. If I leave them both at home he often can stay in his crate for hours. He is able to function without the dog as I can take him for walks on his own or take him for training sessions. They also both get boarded with someone I trust who has several other dogs for them to play with 5 days a week. The times I just took my puppy there he was perfectly fine. The adult dog doesn’t really care if the puppy is around or not. They get along well but my main concern is if they ever get separated or when the older one passes. If this is just a phase I’m fine with that but is there anything I can do to help things along ? Even a very brief absence leads to significant distress.",

I want to simulate this as much as possible this week to prepare him, so will sit upstairs whilst he is in his pen and come down to walk/ play with him when he would be visited by the Walker normally. He does really well on his own at the moment, we have a camera to watch him when we have left him before and he just sleeps. My main question is what do people suggest if I look at the camera today and he has had an accident in his pen, should I hurry down and clean it up?

The cardiologist told us that she’s probably got 6 months to a year left, and that there’s basically zero chance she makes it more than a year and a half. Me and my wife are heart broken as we are already in love with the pup. She is so playful and full of life and the thought of watching that life fade over the next few months is pretty gut wrenching. Watching her play makes me so sad because I know that soon she’s not going to have the energy to play anymore, but I want to enjoy the time that i have left with her. Have any of you dealt with a puppy or dog that was terminally ill? How did you cope? Did you manage to still find joy in your remaining time? Edit: Thank you to everyone for sharing your kind comments, positive energy, and your own experiences with similar situations. It’s good to know that there are so many people out there wishing my pup the best ❤️",

She will bark in the crate if someone isn’t there, she loves me most but will be fine with most anyone, but if someone else is in there she is fine. Perfect at night, even when she can’t see me but during the day she either barks and bark or barks for 5-10 minutes then stops. I’ve been conditioning her with leaving then reentering, keeping her in the crate while I’m there so she doesn’t equate the crate to isolation, but I want to have her reliably not barking. She also doesn’t play much in the crate, mainly just settles down and sometimes chews a bone but not often. I can get her in the crate with little fuss and when it’s open she’ll hop on in, so she doesn’t fear the crate, simply being alone. I will sometimes play doggy relaxation music but that doesn’t always work and sometimes I feel like it makes it worse. I’m wondering if there is anything I can do as I live in a place with thin, thin walls and I feel like an ass to my neighbors when I leave. Any tips or tricks anyone has?",

He wakes up if the couch makes a tiny sound when you move or if I yawn a little loudly. But hes ok with running water thats loud AF. How should I desensitize him?",

      "content_preview": "We have a 17 week old puppy that we rescued at 12 weeks old. From weeks 12-16, before final vaccinations, we taught the puppy to potty on the balcony on a fresh patch we placed out there. Now that the dog is fully vaccinated and we can go outside, we are having an incredibly difficult time getting the dog to go the bathroom anywhere else. Currently, the puppy has been holding it for 9 hours and still will not go. I’m starting to worry he may get a UTI or worse if he doesn’t relieve himself. Is there any way to teach him to go outside besides just waiting it out? I’ve never potty trained in an apartment before and WOW it is so much harder. We don’t want him to use the balcony long term, this was purely because he couldn’t go outside yet. How do we break this habit?",

      "content_preview": "I’m researching crates for my dog and trying to decide between the DIGGS crates and the KindTail PAWD. I’ve seen a lot of praise for DIGGS, especially the Revol, but I’m wondering if people still end up putting a cover or blanket over them. If so, it makes me question whether the sleek look really matters in the end. Are dogs usually okay with such high visibility outside of the crate or will it probably need to be covered at night, etc? Background: I've had five rescues over my lifetime, adopted as adults and never crate trained, but I will be getting a puppy soon, and decided on crate training for the first time. Edit: I wanted to add that I'll be getting a mini dachshund :)",
