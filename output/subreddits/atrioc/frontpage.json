If you believe Atrioc completed all encounters in Hall of Gods (HoG) on radiant off stream when he spent his prior 4 stream sessions struggling on Pantheon of Hallownest (PoH), you have to be foolish. Atrioc streamed ~11 hours‚Äô worth of attempts (I counted 12 total attempts) in 4 days. On his second to last stream you can see that he had not completed radiant Soul Tyrant or radiant Dung Defender. On his final stream and he completed PoH he said the reason why he took longer to go live was because he was busy completing all the unfinished bosses on radiant off stream ‚Äúall day today‚Äù. This is nonsense. Anyone who believes this lie likely has not attempted the more difficult radiant encounters in HoG or completed PoH with no bindings. Anyone who has completed both knows the vast difference in skill that is required between the two. There is zero chance he completed whatever he had not finished in HoG before his stream with this current skill, and it is not coincidence that he chose not to complete hog on stream but claims to have done so legitimately. And to anyone who thinks this is just a way for me to flex that I completed HoG? You're right, SHAW. https://preview.redd.it/atrioc-is-lying-v0-6ygjg85aenmf1.png",

Like I just saw a guy get lambasted on the pokemon subreddit for their perspective on the Pokemon Company, just to find that the top comment is denying OP's personal opinions and even worse, that neither of the opinions the commenter included were even made by OP. Sharing anything on reddit has to be so demoralizing after realizing Atrioc is right and I think he needs to make more reddit recaps to spread the word",

Right now I am in Columbus, Ohio working on data centers for Facebook and Google, and would love to share what‚Äôs going on and to learn from what you know. Any information you need I will give, as this is my second Reddit post ever and don‚Äôt have time to make more, since I work 80 hours a week on those damn data centers.

You can't say you are vehemently against monopolies and then in the same breath ask completely unironically why CEOs shouldn't be allowed to have the choice to sell their businesses. I'm glad someone is bringing this perspective to the pod because there are tons of people online that think this way but damn that was a tough listen. Glizzy glizzy glizzy coffee cow spoontrioc.",

She is demanding an apology for your crimes against the the product management community. In her words, \"great product managers create a lot of value... they do all the thinking that the engineers and marketers, and salespeople leave at the door\". If you believe the gap between a good and bad product manager is small, then your \"good\" product manager is actually pretty average. Rant over (by her). You can now return to your regularly scheduled programming.",

In his words, \"tell that glizzy-fingered little bitch (sorry for cursing at you, his words) that if he can run this shitshow half as good as I do I'd nominate him to be my son.\" I think the last half was a jab at me, Jerome's pissed because incorporating building me a crib into the renovation plan so I don't have to live at his anymore has gotten him into a lot of trouble with the fat man. Rant over (by him [my dad {FTC Chairman Jerome Powell}]). You can now return to your regularly scheduled programming. Edit: Sorry guys, I misspoke. The current FTC chairman, Andrew N. Ferguson, is my other father. I do not know what Andrew thinks about Atrioc, we have not spoken since Easter brunch this year due to him continuing to pursue enforcement action against Meta for their selling of underage users' data. I have always maintained that if children cannot contribute to this economy in a meaningful way, trillion dollar companies should at least be able to sell their data to advertisers - Andrew knows this but continues to pick fights with me, and it's just another reason for Jerome to be angry at the both of us. All of this politics stuff is pretty confusing to me regardless, I mainly just watch Atrioc for his Paper Mario gameplay.",
