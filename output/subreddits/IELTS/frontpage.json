Overall, I felt like i did pretty well and was really fluent but the examiner seemed kind of annoyed and cold. He also stopped me before I Even completely answered multiple times by saying „hmm“ it something if you know what I mean. It felt really weird. Is that a bad sign? But I definitely didn‘t talk too much. And second of all, the rest is tomorrow, but i‘m extremely nervous for the Reading and Writing Part (I need an overall Band 7). If you have any las minute tips please let me know because for the last writing mock Test I got 6(if egnovotate is accurate)",

      "content_preview": "Greetings I have already taken the IELTS on paper in Greece back in January 2024. Now applying for phd positions I figured out (to my great dismay) that they require the IELTS date to be after June 2024. Now I am located in the Netherlands and I can see that the IELTS on paper doesn't provide a skill retake unlike the IELTS in Greece for some reason. Moreover there are obviously more dates for the IELTS on computer which is definitely great. I guess my question to you is which do you recommend? was IELTS on computer comfortable for you if you've taken it? I heard some stories about people getting screwed because after the test their results got invalidated due to cheating even though they claim they didn't cheat. Also I just moved and my house is a bit messy idk if that information is important but I heard that they inspect your space extensively (could anyone share their experience with that?). I also heard about some people having trouble with the speaking section because the examiner had a bad mic anyone had to deal with that? My original IELTS scores were Listening: 9, Reading: 9, Speaking: 8.5, Writing: 7. I’ve always had bad handwriting, and during the test I made several corrections, which slowed me down. The time pressure, in the Writing section, was real I didn't need extra time in any other section. Will the online format help with timing? I also tend to write about 10–13 words per line, so counting words on paper was easy any tips for managing word count effectively online would be appreciated. Thanks for your time fellas",

There were no problems during the exam, no one has stopped me ever and no technical errors occured (my girlfriend had sound cracks 5 minutes into her exam the day before so she asked for a refund). I was really waiting to get my results which came today…sort of. They withhold my results permanently as “Evidence was obtained that you attempted to breach rules relating to the security of the test room.”. My uni starts next week, deadline to hand in the results is 5th of September. :) I am lucky enough to do an in person test again in ANOTHER country, but I can’t imagine what those feel who do not have the financial background for this. I ran through this sub 2 days before the exam (found it too late), but if I had found it in time I wouldn’t have taken this piece of shit. They do not provide said evidence, they give 0 f about you but of course they offered me the chance to appeal for £250. What a joke. I suggest you not to take the online exam EVER and in fact, choose TOEFL, Cambridge or anything else which your uni accepts as this “highly praised” institution do not deserve any of your money.",

      "content_preview": "Prompt: Some people feel that the government should regulate the level of violence in films on television and at the cinema. Others feel that violent films should not be regulated. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Source: https://writing9.com/search/some-people-feel-that-the-government-should-regulate-the-level-of-violence-in-films-on-television-and-at-the-cinema-others-feel-that-violent-films-should-not-be-regulated-discuss-both-views-and-give-your-opinion-/0 Word count: 266 words Despite some opposition against placing restrictions on the level of violence in movies for fear of them losing core values, this essay agrees that such content should be monitored to protect young audiences from being negatively affected. Some people argue that for some movies, it is necessary to include graphic content to fully convey the author's message. For example, by including real footage of actual fights and casualties, historical films were able to teach audiences about the detrimental consequences wars leave on people's lives. As a result, audiences can learn important lessons on the essence of maintaining global peace and how to prevent further occurrences of these major conflicts. However, I believe that it is still possible for these films to deliver their message without the inclusion of gratuitous violence. On the other hand, some individuals call for restrictions on how much violence is allowed on televisions and films. This is to protect children from being exposed to an excessive amount of graphic content, leading to behavioral problems such as uncontrollable swearing or disobedience. In worst-case scenarios, this could escalate to young people committing crimes such as robbery or assault due to their emulation of the actions that they witnessed on violent films. By imposing certain regulations, we could prevent these cases from happening and affecting society. In conclusion, television shows and movies should have certain limitations on the intensity of aggressive materials being allowed. Although there will be some objections for fear of losing the meaning of certain films, I believe it is more vital to protect young children from becoming the next juvenile criminals.",

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/need-help-evaluating-my-task-2-response-v0-yjkpk1c4fhlf1.png Response : There have been a lot of discussions recently, whether the total working days within a week for employees should be reduced, and they should be allowed to have longer weekends. I strongly believe that the current system of working professionals is sufficient, where they have two days off on weekends. Most industries adopt a system where there is a holiday on Saturdays and Sundays. Although the professionals have to work for a larger number of days, the majority of them are comfortable with two holidays. Generally, people rest on Saturdays to unwind from the office stress from the week, by either sleeping in late or going out to eat. Additionally, on Sundays, they have leisurely activities with family, such as going to the cinema or the park, going shopping, or quality family bonding at home by playing board games. By the end of the weekend, almost everyone is refreshed and ready to get back to work. However, it is a human tendency to demand more comfortable environments. That’s the reason why there is a debate for longer weekends. There are several detrimental consequences of longer weekends. Firstly, fewer working days mean the backlog of tasks has to be compensated for with more working hours on regular days. This results in disruptions in the work-life balance. Furthermore, there would be higher mental pressure to achieve deadlines. This pressure degrades mental health, drastically reduces productivity, and subsequently leads to mental breakdowns of the workers. In conclusion, considering the adverse implications of longer weekends, it is advisable to have a ratio of working days compared to the weekly leaves. In case of emergency, there is always an option to demand paid leave as most of the companies have a certain number of days they provide to their employees, not cutting their salaries.",

I keep wondering is it worth tracking every single word I misspell? Feels like a huge time wasting, especially when Im not sure those words will not come up again. Any suggestions, y’all?
