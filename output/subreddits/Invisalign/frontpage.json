      "content_preview": "I‚Äôve been switching between three brushes for a while now: Sonicare ProtectiveClean (my long-term standby), Oral-B Pro 1000 (which I've used on and off for years), and more recently, Soocas NEOS II, which I picked up about three months ago. I brush twice daily for around 3 minutes, so I‚Äôve had enough time to notice the differences. Oral-B Pro 1000 The oscillating/rotating action feels very different, more like a ‚Äúscrubbing‚Äù motion. It seems to lift surface stains faster, so I‚Äôll sometimes use it if I‚Äôve been drinking lots of coffee or tea. Replacement heads are everywhere and they have a lot of variety (cross-action, whitening, sensitive, etc). Louder, a bit harsher if you press too hard, and the battery only lasts about a week for me. Best for people who want that extra ‚Äúdeep clean‚Äù feel and don‚Äôt mind charging more often. Soocas NEOS II Cleans really well along the gumline, and the slimmer brush head makes it easier for me to reach the very back molars than with Oral-B. Battery life is the real standout. I‚Äôm getting close to a full month on one charge. Super convenient for travel. Replacement heads aren‚Äôt sold everywhere (I order them online and shipping sometimes takes a while). Best for someone who wants strong cleaning power, lightweight design, and long battery life without charging constantly. Sonicare ProtectiveClean Feels reliable and gentle, especially on days when my gums are a little sore. The vibrations feel smoother compared to the Oral-B. Replacement heads are easy to find at drugstores, Target, Amazon, basically anywhere. Battery lasts me about 1‚Äì2 weeks before charging. The handle is slightly bulkier than the NEOS II. Best for people with sensitive gums or who want a brush that‚Äôs super easy to maintain. At this point, I rotate between them depending on my needs. The NEOS II has become my main daily brush because of the comfort and insane battery life. I keep the Sonicare around for sensitive days, and the Oral-B gets pulled out when I want that polished, scrubbed feeling.",

I'll wear the first 4 Aligners for 2 weeks, then I'll get my attachments and then I'm allowed to change them every week (40 Aligners in total). As I've put them in today, they fit like a glove - but I'm confused as I'm only feeling the tiniest \"discomfort\". Not even that really, I mean, I feel something is different, but there is no pain, no pressure, nothing like that. I definitely awaited some kind of painful pressure, from what I read on here, so I'm a bit confused. But maybe it'll start with the upcoming trays? What was your experience?",

I grind my teeth at night, dentist has already told me that I‚Äôll need composite bonding to close the gap caused by grinding on my back right side molars. I was skeptical at first, but now that I‚Äôve been on Invisalign I notice my back upper teeth with the carriere device (which aren‚Äôt covered by Invisalign trays) are tearing up my bottom tray. The plastic feels jagged and torn, as if I roughed them up on asphalt. Does anyone wear night guards with their Invisalign? I‚Äôm going to ask my dentist but thought I‚Äôd post in the sub too.",

I am so sick, i can‚Äôt even think about putting trays in my mouth right now. I called the office just begging for options and was told it‚Äôs not a big deal to do during pregnancy and my treatment will be very minimal ( slight problem with bite and too much spacing). The best they said they can do is push it to November 3rd (would be about second tri by then) but after that, my teeth could shift or change too much and I would have to restart the process. I already had a problem with clenching and grinding and botox ruined my bite and caused me to hold all of my tension in front teeth instead of back. This was my last ditch effort at trying to deal with it, as I‚Äôm grinding my teeth away. I have seen many stories about what a bad idea it was to have during pregnancy. Did anyone with clenching and grinding problems actually see this help? My doctor was so over reassuring, but I still feel like this is too much right now. I‚Äôm either out the money or I go for it. She did tell me if it got too much or too painful they could do something, but wasn‚Äôt clear on what that something is. I would hate to start and realize I just can‚Äôt do it. I have a high pain tolerance but had TMJ from clenching last pregnancy and i‚Äôm afraid this could make it worse. Thank you to anyone who read this whole thing.",

They‚Äôre simply not perfect. I enjoy their imperfections and I‚Äôm happy with them the way they are. While I wouldn‚Äôt be unhappy with my teeth being more straight and more evenly aligned, if there are any permanent marks on my teeth from the attachments, I will be extremely unhappy about it, even if my alignment is improved from its current state. I‚Äôm also not thrilled about the idea of wearing retainers in my mouth for four months. I‚Äôve never had braces before and have mild horror of fixtures in my mouth. Just trying to figure out if these are right for me, or if I should put my foot down and get my dentist back off about it. Any advice or insight is appreciated. Thank you!",

However I noticed that week 20 to 28 had space for the dots they put on your teeth (on my top two front teeth to be exact), but they never put dots on those teeth not even week 1. I can't seem to get through to my dentist at the minute, so is there something I'm missing?",

They didn‚Äôt feel this way last week. My bite was off on one side but she polished it and it felt better. Now it seems like the same pressure I had last week is on the other side and idk if she should polish that side too.

I have a missing front tooth and I have had a \"flipper\" for that (retainer-ish thing that holds a fake tooth in place), and I can eat with that in place. For invisalign, I know they can paint it so it looks like there is a tooth. But if I have yo take it out to eat, that means having a hole there the whole time. That would be a problem when eating in social settings where I'm talking, laughing, eating, etc. Has anybody here found a solution to this? Can they give me duplicates of each tray so I can eat with one in and swap it out for its less gross twin after? Is there a way to get a set of \"flippers\" that tracks the alignment?",
