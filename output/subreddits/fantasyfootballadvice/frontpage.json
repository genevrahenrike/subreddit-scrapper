When the first turn came, 12 RBs were gone and London and McBride seemed like solid values. When the second turn came, 20 RBs were gone and I reluctantly felt like I had to take advantage of the value at WR (Evans & Sutton). By the end of Round 6, 26 RBs were gone so I knew I needed to pick someone, and Tracy seemed like the best available (probably should've doubled up and this stage but I really wanted Pearsall so took him at the 7.01). My RB room consists of the following: -Tracy -Ekeler -Etienne -Blue -Sampson -Gordon -Marks How cooked am I? Do I just have to hope I can blow my FAAB on the first RB candidate available due to injury? What's the best RB value you think I could get for London? I've tried testing the trade waters with Evans and Sutton without much success.",

      "content_preview": "Sorry, I tried adding a link to get requests to alert you for when I release the 2026 version next year, but it appears to have removed the post. Thank you so much for the support! I've put a link in my Reddit bio for anyone who wants a heads-up on next year's guide. I'm fantasy analyst Jon Salve and I've had a few requests to write a 2025 version of draft strategy by position, so here's the breakdown by position with an overall summary at the end... QB For Quarterback in 2025, I'm trying to get the last of the top QBs, usually Jalen Hurts, but not at the expense of landing as many of the top 19 RBs available. Hurts can run and pass, which has allowed him to be one of three consistent top fantasy QBs, along with Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson. Hurts is going way after Allen and Jackson, though. I find myself not trying to break the ice on QB, but checking on Hurts with my pick after Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen are both taken if those 19 RBs are all gone. You should have a slight runway here because Jayden Daniels should be the third QB drafted. I like Jayden, and if someone goes Hurts, allowing Daniels to fall to you, then take him instead. You should try to get that high upside running/passing of QB, which only those four guys provide, but if they're all gone by the time you finish drafting your early RBs, you're fine waiting. If the game of chicken (waiting until both Lamar and Allen get drafted plus drafting your RBs) causes you to miss out on both Daniels and Hurts, then don't panic. There's no massive difference between every other QB and the next big tier of guys. I would pivot to value at WR, then keep checking in on Justin Fields. If Fields is there for you around Round 8-9, I would try to take him. In games that he has started historically, he has been a top 10 quarterback on average. He is one of those players whose rushing ability makes him a better fantasy player than a real-life quarterback in many ways, but he should be the starter for the Jets this season, and he has a very high ceiling. He could be a top 10 QB without using your earlier picks. Even if you miss out on Fields, there are still two quarterbacks going even later that I would trust. Don't panic if they don't work out, and be active on waivers where there are always good options at QB, especially early in the season. The two other late-round options for me are Drake Maye and JJ McCarthy. For Maye, his underrated ability to run and the Patriots' trying to build pieces around him could see him poised for a breakout fantasy season in Year 2. McCarthy was hand-picked by Kevin O'Connell with a top 10 pick. O'Connell turned Darnold, Mullens, Dobbs, and Cousins into productive fantasy QBs. Working with McCarthy, who has loaded offensive weapons around him and an improved offensive line, should play out well for fantasy this year. Overall, if you took an elite WR and the top RBs are all gone, I'm trying to ensure I get Jalen Hurts. However, if you miss out, it's time to wait at QB rather than be the guy taking the 5th-7th QB in your draft and accumulating talent elsewhere. RB At Runningback, there are a clear top 19 RBs, and I want as many of them as possible because the drop-off feels significant. I tend to draft 3 RBs in the first 4 rounds to secure as many of these as possible. I suggest prioritizing accumulating these RBs over early QB or early TE, but not over getting at least one elite receiver. The 19 RBs are: Bijan Robinson Jahmyr Gibbs Saquon Barkley Christian McCaffrey De'Von Achane Ashton Jeanty Derrick Henry Chase Brown Josh Jacobs Bucky Irving Jonathan Taylor Kyren Williams Alvin Kamara Breece Hall Kenneth Walker III Omarion Hampton James Cook Chuba Hubbard James Conner I would rank those 19 according to your preference, then draft based on your rankings. I'm looking to get an elite wide receiver in Round 1, but after that, I'm loading up at RB in the next 3 rounds if I can get 3 of the above guys in those rounds. Between injury and byes, I want depth at RB, and I love the middle rounds (5-10) for WR this year, so I'm okay going \"Hero WR\" where I take one elite one and then volume RB. Overall, I'm looking to roster 6-7 RBs because I find that Flex-Level WRs are easy enough to find with smart waiver moves, but there's only so many good/healthy RBs, so I want to be both deep and top-heavy there. Typically, you're looking at handcuff-level RBs later in the draft, but I like to grab 2-3 of them and one more mid-round RB to go with my 3 from rounds 2-4. So, basically, I'm hoping to take 3 Top-19 RBs in Rounds 2-4 after nabbing an elite WR in Round 1. Then, I'll get one more in Rounds 5-10 and come back in the later rounds to grab high-end handcuffs. Again, I want to roster 6-7 RBs this year so I'm safe for injuries (last year's RB health was an outlier) and bye weeks. WR I studied the success rates based on ADP for each position, and WRs with first-round ADPs hit at a crazy high rate. This is why I want to make sure I'm getting an elite WR in Round 1 before pivoting to RB. Now, you may ask, who is an elite WR? I have 8 elite WRs in total. 5 veterans are consistently WR1s in FPPG: Ja'Marr Chase Justin Jefferson CeeDee Lamb Amon-Ra St. Brown A.J. Brown 2 younger WRs finished as WR1s in FPPG in each of the past 2 years: Nico Collins Puka Nacua There is 1 WR that was a legit WR1 last season as a rookie: Malik Nabers You should rank those 8 WRs and take the highest-ranked one on your list with your first-round pick. I find this is a solid foundation, especially if you're waiting to grab your WR depth in the mid-rounds. None of these 8 are at the Age 30 age cliff for WRs, either, and they project to be key pieces in their respective offenses this season. I would pivot off of WR to grab as many of those top 19 RBs as possible in the next few rounds, but once those 19 RBs and the top 3 QBs and TEs are gone, I'm hitting WR hard. I am taking 3-4 WRs in Rounds 5-10. I like many guys in this range, but I don't want to give specific names, so you can trust your own research. However, I recommend looking at guys who have a chance to be the lead wide receiver in their own offenses in these rounds to ensure you capture some high ceiling guys. Towards the later rounds, I'm looking at possible high-end WRs who could be WR1s on their teams (Keon Coleman, Matthew Golden, Jauan Jennings, etc.). If any of these guys fall, I would sprinkle them in with high-end handcuff RBs to round out the end of your draft unless you're still waiting on a quarterback or TE late in those rounds. TE For Tight End, there are 9 guys I want. Well, there are 3 guys, then another 6, really. I would draft Kittle with your next pick after McBride and Bowers are selected, so you can get an elite TE but without reaching on one. However, with so many more valuable positions needing to be filled, where any of those three will end up going, I usually pass for one of the next six guys. I wouldn't rush and grab either of the next two, who look to be T.J. Hockenson and Sam Laporta, because there isn't a massive gap between them and Travis Kelce, Mark Andrews, Evan Engram, and David Njoku, who consistently have been top TEs in the past. I would wait until the first of six TE's have been drafted, including the top 3 guys, and with your next pick, take your highest ranked of the remaining three players. One strategy I have even tried is taking two of these guys altogether if possible and seeing which one pans out better, but by no means do you have to draft two of them if you don't care to roster two TEs. After these 9, it gets less historically consistent results-wise, though, and is more based on projection than actually past fantasy performance. I wouldn't want to be the guy chasing the TE on waivers that had the most TDs the previous week on waivers every week. If you did somehow just end up missing out on all nine guys, then I would pivot to whichever rookie Tight End you prefer, Tyler Warren or Colston Loveland, and take them with your next pick. Again, feel free to bring both, but it's unnecessary. I prefer to hedge my bet by taking both of them. So here's the summary... Round 1: Take one of the 8 big WRs Round 2-4: Take as many top 19 RBs as possible. If all 19 are gone by Round 4, check on a Top 3 QB or Top 3 TE and take one if they're still available. If all 19 RBs are gone and the Top 3 QBs and TEs are off the board, pivot back to WR to pair with your elite Round 1 WR Round 5-10: If you missed out on QB early, I'm looking at Justin Fields around Round 8 or 9, but not forcing it over good RB/WR value. If you missed out on TE early and 6 TEs are taken, grab one of the top 9 in this range. I like to grab one RB in these mid-rounds and load up on 3-4 WRs in this range. Round 11-15: If you still don't have a QB, select J.J. McCarthy or Drake Maye in this range. If you still don't have a TE, grab one or two of the first-round rookies in Loveland and/or Warren. I like grabbing one high-end WR to take a flier on and using the remaining picks on RB handcuffs to hoard on my bench.",

My league rewards points for distance of touchdowns and I think Love and Stroud are great deep ball throwers. But both have their issues. GB seems to be turning into a more running team and Stroud’s O line is rated as one of the worst in the league. Purdy, Penix, and Tua, are also available. What would you guys do? I do have Drake London so a Penix/Drake stack might not be too bad. We also kinda know what we are getting with Purdy and Tua. If Darnell Mooney is healthy, Penix could have a surprise year.",

In those 20 minutes the website continued to auto draft for everyone, after a few minutes a few people were able to rejoin and others were not. Meanwhile in our group chat everyone was wondering what was going on, we were asking if we would have to re-draft or if we were just going to start from the middle of the ninth round and the commissioner said nothing. I asked him if he could undo all of the picks until the middle of the 9th round and he said that was too much work. Then the league took a “vote” and decided since by round 9 “all of your starters are already drafted” we should just move on and let it ride as it is. The vote was 9 to 5. I brought up that I won the league last year by taking BJT in the 10th and Bucky in the 12th and that I didn’t want the auto drafted players, to which everyone said whoever doesn’t like it can leave. Am I crazy here? Shouldn’t this have continued from the 9th even if ONE player had an issue with this?",

Keenan is reunited with Herbert and might have more consistent production over the course of the season. This is also my first 12 man league and noticed there is a lot of talent sitting on benches, im concerned that there might be slim pickings on the waiver wire meaning this 1st waiver spot might not be as crucial to hang on to.

Any advice would be appreciated! My Team: Starters: · QB: B. Nix (Den) · WR: C. Lamb (Dal) · WR: T. Higgins (Cin) · WR: C. Sutton (Den) · RB: J. Gibbs (Det) · RB: B. Irving (TB) · TE: T. McBride (Ari) · FLEX: A. Ekeler (Was) · K: EMPTY · DEF: Green Bay Bench: · Jakobi Meyers (WR - LV) · Zach Charbonnet (RB - Sea) · Keenan Allen (WR - LAC) · Dak Prescott (QB - Dal) · Rashid Shaheed (WR - NO) · D. Sampson (RB - CLE) · Buffalo Bills (DEF) I'm leaning towards dropping Rashid Shaheed since he's my WR5/6 and is pretty boom-or-bust. The other option is dropping one of my two defenses (GB or BUF)… and I normally would NEVER carry 2 Def but with the Cowboys trade, Packers are too sweet to give up Who would you cut to make room for a kicker?",

WTF is the Boom Outlier: a player with an Elite/Great/ Good pass or run blocking OLine and Easy 1st 5 games SoS Five Tier OLine is a consensus ranking using four different website Oline rankings and analytics Three Strength of Schedule data points are provided : 1st five games SoS rank, Full Year SoS rank (week 1-14) , Playoffs (week 15-17) rank Click here to access the Cheat Sheet with Boom Outlier (DOWNLOAD A COPY - On the shared link, you can click in the top left corner to add temporary filtering if you want to sort by .5ppr or other data or to edit: open the cheat sheet, go to file, then download your own copy.) I don't put as much value in SoS after 5 games, this will show you who could have a very hot start then you can reevaluate, especially when key injuries occur to a players OLine. “The Dorey Rule” says to draft by considering the first six weeks for a hot start. (I went with 5 weeks) RB BOOM: ATL, SF, WAS QB AND/OR WR BOOM : ATL , GB, PHI , BAL, CHI QB/TE BOOM: ATL (are we really going to get back on the Kyle Pitts Hype train after all these years of pain.... per the data he will have a great opportunity to produce but he's ranked appropriately (HOU -desperation boom) (easy first five but bad OLine, might be a need for quick release / easy targets/dump passes to TEs) Examples of looking at the data: Zay Flowers as an example. Great QB, 3rd yr, Good Pass Blocking, overall great line, easy first 5 games for wide receivers, and an easier schedule compared to last year. The data shows he should perform better than last year. Also concerned for CeeDee Lamb, all the positives Zay Flowers has are negatives for CeeDee. Also look for players on the list like the LAR Wide Receivers, who could struggle in the beginning of the year and improve after the first 5 games. If you don't draft LAR WRs, possibly target them after week 5 if the Rams OL GOOD/GREAT can stay healthy. If the players mentioned fall into the Boom Outlier, then at their current rank/ADP, I would consider drafting that player over someone else within a few picks. If you have players you already are considering and see them pop up on the sheet in green as a BOOM outlier, this should only add to your targeting. If there is anything I should add, any feedback to make this better, please let me know. I'll collect feedback and make an update in a week or two - Good Luck everyone!

Guy in front of me had to auto draft his team and ended up with basically only WRs and terrible RB's. Now he is desperately in need of an RB and I was thinking about trading James Cook to him for A.J. Brown. Based on my current line up though would you say this is a good trade? I went RB heavy yet I feel if I give up James Cook it is questionable whether David Montgomery or Treveyon Henderson will be a solid RB 2 all year.

      "content_preview": "With Engram gone, a TE-friendly coach, and strong preseason flashes, Strange looks like one of the most undervalued tight ends in 2025 drafts. Currently being drafted as TE21, Strange comes with very little risk — but the opportunity and situation suggest his upside could be much higher. So far this preseason, Brenton Strange has basically only played about a half of football (maybe less). In that time he’s caught 3 passes, all for first downs, totaling 33 yards. If you stretch that out over a full game, you’re looking at ~6 catches for 66 yards. Give him a modest 6 TDs over the year, and suddenly you’ve got a season line of 102/1122/6 . For context, depending on your league scoring settings, that’s right in the neighborhood of: (TE1) Brock Bowers: 112/1194/5 (TE2) George Kittle: 78/1106/8 (TE3) Trey McBride: 111/1146/2 I’m not saying Strange is going to lead the league, but he’s currently going off the board as TE21 . That’s a TE2/3 draft slot — for a guy who has a very real chance of finishing top 5 . And the floor doesn’t look that bad either. If we look at his snap count and production in 2024: He turned his 575 snaps into 40/411/2. They played 1,165 total offensive plays. If he played 95% of snaps (he's now projected to be on the field pretty much every play) we're looking at what would project to have been 77/791/2 . For context, that's in the neighborhood of: (TE6) Mark Andrews: 55/673/11 (TE7) Sam LaPorta: 60/726/7 (TE8) Zach Ertz: 66/654/7 (TE9) Tucker Kraft: 50/707/7 (TE10) Pat Freiermuth: 65/653/7 Now in 2025, everything looks way better for him: New HC Liam Coen is not considered to be the most TE-friendly coach, but, he's shown he won't shy away from incorporating his TE into the gameplay if the situation fits. The Jaguars let Evan Engram walk without bringing in real competition. Trevor Lawrence has already shown he’ll pepper his TE with volume — Engram saw 143 targets in 2023 , which was top-5 at the position. Jacksonville has legit weapons on the outside that will draw coverage. Strange himself plays like a schoolyard bully with strong hands and toughness after the catch. It’s honestly hard to imagine him finishing outside the top 10. Even some of his teammates have said they see him as a top-5 TE this year. At TE21 pricing, Strange is one of the best values at the position right now. TL;DR: Strange already looks efficient, has zero competition for TE1, and Lawrence has shown he’ll target his TE heavily. TE21 ADP feels like a steal.",
