We were staying in Cowdenbeath, but also visited Dunfermline and, of course, went a couple of times to Edinburgh for the Fringe Festival. We fell in love with both Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath! The greenery, the peace and quiet, the people, the patios, the space between houses… and the weather! Our island is overcrowded (half a million people on just 35 km²), and in summer the temperature soars up to 40°C, making it almost impossible to breathe. We lack green spaces, there’s virtually no natural greenery, and the beaches—contrary to what the magazines show—are polluted and overcrowded. We just fell in love with Fife. Nowhere has ever felt so much like home. Thank you Fife for having us!",

I didnt actually notice a flash from the back but I am not too sure I even looked. Has anyone had a flash before going a few miles an hour over limit there and did anything happen? I have read somewhere that it just could have flashed for calibration or there was a speed change behind me but I'm not anxious about it Thanks",

      "content_preview": "I thought I’d make a post on this, just to gauge others’ thought on considering Fife as a place to live, or a potential location to move to. I’m originally from Glasgow, left in 2000 and spent a decade in Edinburgh. The city was very different then and quite backward in respect to the city I grew up in up in. Didn’t enjoy it at all. It’s the opposite now! I moved to Dunfermline in 2011. Spent a decade there. Work remotely. I found Dunfy, the people and the surrounding areas, full of the nicest, most independent (by that I mean culturally, not politically) folk I’ve ever met. Super friendly, welcoming and straight-talking people I’ve met. They reminded me so much of growing up in Glasgow. I moved back to Edinburgh for work after Covid, but after 3 years I decided to move back to Fife. The weather, the community-driven events in the glen, the fact that the high street is bustling now, after a few years of seeing it dwindle, is fantastic to see. The pace of life is laid back, people take time to talk to each other and the small things, like seeing a local shop survive and succeed have folk rooting for them. It’s an amazing place to live and I’ve worked and lived in a number of places around the globe as a kid. It’s a place I’d happily live out my days in. It’s not perfect, but as a friendly reminder from me, it’s got so much going for it. It’s a welcoming and friendly place. Just root for your locals and any enterprises they try and bring to the place. I’m excited about Dunfermline and all the areas I go to for bike trails, car trips, long weekends, seaside swimming and forest walks.  As someone who grew up in a city, I expected I’d live in that environment forever. I was completely wrong! Of all the places I’d recommend to live in Scotland, Fife still gets my vote. ❤️",

Do I need to press the bell to get off, or do the buses usually stop in every stop? Do I need to wave my hand at the bus for it to come and stop at my stop, or do they just come regardless? And lastly, are the buses reliable? I've heard one or two people say that the buses are frequently not on time, so I thought I'd confirm Many thanks in advance!",

Last few days mama bird is obviously got a bit hacked off at the situation and as has stepped up the level of aggression, gone for me a few times and had a proper go at my daughter last night. Called the spca first day and got an automated message saying to leave the bird in place and it will learn to fly by itself. After last night I called again and gave different answers to speak to human who informed me that they won’t come to get the bird and I can’t move it when mother is away either. Tried all the local bird places nearby but never get an answer. Google just gives me falconery places and hedgehog rescue. Anyone know of any shelters that maybe aren’t in the google hitlist?",
