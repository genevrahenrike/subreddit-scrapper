      "content_preview": "My bf and our friends walk in to a locally owned chain in our state and see the girl who ends up being our server on the phone, she doesn’t acknowledge us, doesn’t even look up at us We just awkwardly stand there a few minutes until another server seats us. A few minutes later the girl that was on the phone comes over to us with waters, doesn’t greet us and already seems annoyed at us, just asks us what we want for drinks and walks away. (just for some context it looks like we are one of five tables in the entire place, surprisingly dead for Labor Day) She drops off the two beers for the table and takes our food order and seems to roll her eyes when she walks away. No personality, talking in the most whisper voice and glazed over eyes…some time passes and she seemingly forgets my drink so my bf politely gets her attention as she walks by asking for my soda whenever she had a moment, just an “okay” and an eyeroll Long story short she forgot our appetizer, didn’t refill waters, my friend literally had to go over to the server station to get hot sauce and to go boxes because she forgot those too… I really try and give people the benefit of the doubt but as a server myself i couldn’t imagine ignoring guests when they come in, first impressions are so important in creating a welcoming environment Forgetting people’s drinks, food, condiments.. I can understandable if you’re slammed and have multiple tables  but when you have one other table it just seems lazy and ignorant. This was the first time that my bf and I left 15% because of how piss poor this girls attitude was and how unwelcoming she made the whole experience. The food was GREAT! But in my opinion, service and atmosphere MAKE a dining experience and that’s what I try and give my tables. Not sure if she was having a bad day or what but still… being a server is like a performance and putting on an act even when you don’t feel like it.",

They took a picture of me too but luckily my owner was able to get google to remove it. However the review stands and they have also posted on facebook and IG about it, they even tagged me before I blocked them. I accidentally dropped a dish and it spilled on their child. They accused me of being on drugs which was not true. The husband saw me hitting my vape when I was on my only break of the day 45 minutes earlier in the parking lot but it was not THC… My manager comped them on the bill but they were not really moved by that and pretty short with us after that they even asked for their keys back from the valet to get their car themselves. I don’t blame them for being upset about what happened even though it was an accident but the review is super mean and mentions me by name, says false things that I was high and that I am a menace, among with a lot more cutting words. They even called the GM the next day trying to get me fired luckily I have been here for long enough they had my back and I’m not being punished but still this is damaging.",

      "content_preview": "Had a guest inform me of their severe shellfish allergy. No worries, I got you. He ordered an app that has anchovies on top. I marked his tab with a shellfish allergy, guest receives dish and then refuses to eat it. According to him, anchovy is shellfish. Anchovy. He said he took a bite out of it before he realized I gave him shellfish. I tried to tell him it’s an anchovy, and he said he knows anchovy and that it’s shellfish. I was caught up in the moment and quite honestly flabbergasted. I apologized and asked if he was feeling ok or if I should call for help. I felt like I was being gaslit and began questioning everything I’ve ever known. I asked him if he has a seafood allergy, he said, “only shellfish.” I left and grabbed my phone to asked, “Hey Siri, is anchovy a shellfish?” I asked my manager, servers, BOH. No, anchovy is not shellfish. I tried to explain to the guy but how do you correct a guy who is trying to impress his dinner guests and is stuck on his beliefs? “My apologies sir, may I bring you another appetizer without the anchovy?” Him- “No, but please make sure nothing else comes out with shellfish.” “Yes sir, my apologies, sir. I’ll ensure the rest of your dining experience will be shellfish free.” Edit!! I don’t have any rewards so I can’t pin the comment who corrected me, but it’s true, anchovies do share a protein with shellfish which can cause a similar reaction. I hope everyone that reads this is aware of this and if any guest has a shellfish allergy and orders something with anchovies (i.e Caesar or marinara sauce) please inform them before placing their order 🙏",

I have a coworker who tries to pick and choose her tables. Literally she will look at people and be like \"Oh I'm not in the mood for that\" or \"I had people JUST LIKE THAT last night I'm not doing it again.\" She aims for tables that dress extra nice and wear expensive things. Meanwhile I'm the complete opposite. I take everything and everyone and I don't care. Last night we were insanely busy and she ended up rejecting at least 10 tables and I wish I could say that was an exaggeration. They all tipped really well, I didn't have any problems. Anyways, at the end of the night instead of going home when she gets paid, she stays and watches me get paid out. We don't have an office, so everything is done out in the open. Literally as my GM is handing me my money, this server is counting every dollar. Once the GM gives it all she just gets this whole attitude with me about how unfair it is and how there shouldn't be this much of a difference between server income. Like what? YOU didn't want the tables. For reference I made 3x more than she did last night. The only reason I know is because after the server left I asked the GM is there was really that much of a difference and she told me. I know today is going to be another repeat, except she's already pissed off about last night, so wish me luck.",

      "content_preview": "I work in a very small town. I happen to work at one of the best places around when it comes to surviving as a server. Friday night an umbrella of ours flew out of a table and flipped across the sidewalk. I reacted by running to grab it before it had the change to injure someone. Well I rolled my ankle and fractured my foot on the pavement. Fast forward to 72 hours later.. my foot is three times the size it should be. I go to urgent care where the doctor immediately put me off work for 2-3 weeks while wait to see a surgeon. Where I work.. you don’t call in sick. You get your shifts covered or you show up. I had a full on panic attack when I was told I had to stop working immediately. I was supposed to open today. I messaged my boss and all my coworkers explaining the situation and trying to find someone to open up today. The text from my boss was just “hope it’s not too serious. Did you find someone to come in?” I get that I’m leaving them short.. but damn. I’ve been a top employee for three years and by far one of the most reliable. I’ve gone above and beyond with taking on bigger rolls on top of my serving too. In this moment I don’t want to return to the workplace but there’s simply nowhere else that could even match what I make to equal out the cost of living. It’s hard to care so much about a place when you realize you’re just another grain of sand to step on.",

I tend to get annoyed at my colleagues who come in sick, but I also sympathize because I know many people cannot afford to take off with no pay. I’m guilty of working sick in the past.

In the doorway leading to the kitchen there is a big Rest In Peace frame with a picture of what I thought was a highschool aged kid. I didn't want to ask anyone about it because it seemed really tragic, and nobody at all in my now 4 days of training even acknowledged the photo. You guys today I find out it's just a cook who started working elsewhere and they miss him 😂 I'm thinking some poor kid lost his life, meanwhile it's just a young photo of him and he's actively dating a waitress who still works here. She and I were cracking up about it in the kitchen, I thought you all would appreciate a laugh 😅",

      "content_preview": "This is somewhat long but I’d appreciate some advice. I (22 F) am not a server but a host. I’ve been at my job for several months now. I’m essentially our full-time host. Most of my prior restaurant experience was BOH, so this is my first legit FOH job. Since starting I’ve been told I’m fantastic at my job by coworkers and management - which is great don’t get me wrong - but also lead me to take on a lot of responsibility and perfectionistic standards that are getting to me. A couple weeks in I was made lead host (as I was the only host at the time), trained several people (only few have actually made it), began food running, and now also do expo (which I love). Yet, I’ve grown to resent hosting. I’m constantly stressed, feel down, exhausted on my days off, and struggle to maintain my optimistic self at work (I always ensure to be positive with guests). I considered quitting about a week ago, but decided to only work once a week for the fall as I’m returning to uni. I hate that I’ve become negative recently. Last week was especially tough for me and I ended up breaking down outside of the restaurant. I’m still recovering from that emotionally. It feels that when we get new support staff it’s my responsibility to make sure they’re good; when they’re not, it’s hard for me to pick up the slack for all support responsibilities because at the end of the day that becomes my problem and an inconvenience for the servers - it stresses me tf out! I’ve been trying to feel like myself again. Withholding complaining, trying to stay positive for the entirety of my shift, taking a “smoke break” to re-centre myself during stressful nights, etc. I’m worried the industry has changed me for the worse and I’m too far gone to redeem myself. I used to be so optimistic and bubbly when I started the job. How do I let go and care less about it all? Care less about shouldering the labour for new staff that’s still learning the ropes, and let go of the pressure to always perform 100% to maintain my personal standards and those set for me? TL;DR: hosting has led me to feel negative at work. How do I let go of the pressure of being lead host and become optimistic again?",

The lady had a bunch of special requests too like a whole ass paragraph like sauce ots, eggs separate, no onions on this but extra on that etc... 2 minutes later the phone rings and I ignore it because we are now closed. After the 6 repetitive phone call I finally answer and it's the lady and she's pissed. I explain that she ordered but we're closed so we cancelled it. She starts cussing me out so I put the phone on speaker so my GM can hear. After her rant she says what am I supposed to feed my family for dinner now. I politely tell her I guess she'll just have to cook then and hang up the phone. My GM busted up laughing and put all the phones on silent after that.",

      "content_preview": "I recently started serving at a small family restaurant. I really like the job itself, but ever since a conversation a few weeks ago, I’ve been extremely uncomfortable. One day, a manager pulled me aside and said I should wear my hair up higher. At first, I thought he meant it looked messy — but then he kept going: telling me to dress sexier, wear more makeup (while gesturing to my lips and eyes), and start wearing skinny jeans. The cook overheard and added, “your beauty would be a waste if you didn’t.” A new manager in training awkwardly joked, “maybe you need HR,” but everyone else laughed it off. Since then, every single shift they comment on my appearance. They told me my uniform (a size small) is “too big” and that I should wear my old top because “it looks sexy.” If I get upset or tell them to stop, they mock me for “not being able to take a joke” and compare me to a former female coworker they called a bitch. It doesn’t stop at my managers and the cook — the boss himself has joined in. On one shift, he offered me money (waving it in my face)  if I put my hair up higher, saying more customers would come in if there was a “pretty girl” up front. Later, he pointed at my baggy jeans and asked if he should buy me skinny jeans or leggings. When I told him this is a family restaurant and people come to eat, not to see a “sexy” server, he and the cook just laughed. I’ve tried standing up for myself, ignoring them, and even telling them straight out that anywhere else this would be reported. Nothing changes. Every shift, I brace myself for what comment they’ll make about me next. I love serving, but this treatment is making me dread work. I’ve started applying to other jobs, but I’m anxious because I’m new to serving and worry I’ll get stuck here considering the job market. I don’t know if I should keep pushing back, report this formally, or just get out as soon as I can. Any advice?",

I was only scheduled 2 day this week because I told them I had school starting ( I wanted 3/4 shifts but they gave me less, but that will get fixed). Anyways I did work Saturday and I was not feeling the best Friday night so I released the shift, and sent out a message to all the other servers to pick it out. However one person picked it up but it got denied because the manager didn’t want anyone working doubles on the Weekends. The manager called and texted me I could take Saturday off because he knew I wasn’t feeling good. When I woke up Saturday morning, I felt fine and had took liquid IV prior so I told him I felt okay and came to work. I worked the shift and everything was fine. Also I saw the manager and told him I just got my period and the prior feeling sick must be from that. He then started talking about how he gets steaks for his wife when she’s about to start her period cycle. Now Sunday morning rolls around and I’m getting ready for work. Just as I’m about to be there, I throw up. This is 20 minutes before the shift and I feel horrible. I called the manager even though I was petrified omg. I felt so so horrible and told him everything. He had said okay and that’s how it ended. Later, I found that someone had the flu that I had been around. I immediately contact the rest of my friends and one is in urgent care vomiting, and the others are sick. That’s my story guys. I honestly hate calling out and this is the 2nd time since forever I have called out. Any advice guys? Do you guys think I might get fired for this? I work at the cheesecake factory and they are pretty strict. I don’t want them to think “oh she can’t even handle two shifts a week, let’s fire her”. In the summer, I’ve worked 2 serving jobs while taking accelerated summer classed and I’ve gone through so much harder stuff. School and working is something I know how to prioritize. Getting sick though was not on my bingo card… I even took vitamin C right before the first week of school started because I know how it is.",

      "content_preview": "I'm in Texas, for reference. I work in a food service setting as a bartender. After every shift, the servers are required to tip us out based on their alcohol sales. Both the servers and bartenders are, or course, also required to top out the bussers as well. This tip out is automatically calculated and can very, but is not automatically withdrawn. It is the server/bartender's job to write down how much they owe, so accounting can remove it from their payroll and ad it in where it belongs. My issue is with a server not tipping me, or anyone else out, and only rarely tipping out the bussers. This has been brought to my manager's attention, but as of now, he has done nothing. Where should I go from here? While I don't believe this legally counts as theft, his lack of acknowledgement leads me to believe this is also not some small offense.",

      "content_preview": "For some context, my restaurant is extremely overstaffed and has been for months. Everyone knows it including the owner but the GM refuses to fire anyone because she has no fucking spine. I've already had my hours cut by nearly half and the shifts I do work are staffed to the gills. It's been super stressful and it angers me that it literally doesn't have to be this way! Like yeah things are a little slower than before but if we were appropriately staffed, we'd still be making money! I think they're just waiting for people to quit, but before all this shit started this was a great job so everyone's waiting it out it seems. I only know of two other coworkers who are actively looking for jobs aside from myself. On to the main point. I got sent home an hour into my shift today because we were dead. I came in early to open the restaurant and after I was done, I was sent home. Didn't even close a table. I know this is just the way restaurants are sometimes and it has never bothered me before, because why stick around if I'm not making money? But lately I've been so stressed about finances that when my manager told me to go home I went to the bathroom and sobbed. I've never cried like that at work before. It was embarrassing. It also angered me that they didn't just tell me to stay home. Why have me come in, open the restaurant, and then send me home?? I felt so disrespected. Maybe some hope is that the reason I was sent home was because the owner was there and saw how dead it was and how staffed we were. He was the one who told my manager to cut me. He knows we're over staffed and I'm hoping he puts some real pressure on the GM to let some people go. He's usually here in the mornings and it's usually dead, but this was the first time he actually spoke up and made a manager cut someone. I've applied to dozens of jobs but haven't heard anything. I'm this close to rage quitting anyway. I have some savings. I have been holding onto them for dear life, but this whole situation is majorly impacting my mental health. I'm angry all the time. I could ride it out on my savings for a bit while I look for a new job full time. But another part of me doesn't want to give them the satisfaction, at least not until something better shows up. Thanks for reading. I just needed to vent.",
