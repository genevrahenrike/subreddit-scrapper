Today, I'm releasing the first part as a free, open-source CLI . The goal: A simple, fast SAST scanner that finds common, high-impact issues (hardcoded secrets, insecure configs from the manifest, weak crypto, etc.) and gives a clean output. It uses JADX underneath and has a YAML rule engine. It's designed for CI/CD: it generates standard SARIF files you can plug directly into GitHub/GitLab security tabs. I know it's not a replacement for the big commercial tools, but I'm trying to build something genuinely useful for the community. The code is on GitHub, and the package is on PyPI. The open-source CLI is my foundation ,I’m building more features for teams, but I wanted to start by giving something useful back to the community. I'd love your honest feedback. Let me know what you think <3 GitHub: https://github.com/TitanshieldTech/titanshield-cli PyPI: pip install titanshield-cli",

This is the equivalent to Apple refusing to adopt RCS for a long time. Google said it was an \"Open Standard\". The point I'm trying to make is that there is no more insentive for me to use Android if Google goes through with this. What's stopping them from blocking apps they don't like, or charging us devs $100 license fee similar to apple. I am so outraged and this is the most antitrust thing I've ever seen from Google. Anyways, what do you guys think of this policy? Are you outraged as much as i am over it?",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been working through the process of modularizing a monolithic Android demo app and decided to document the practical steps into a guide series.\n\nThis is Part 1, and it's completely free. It focuses on the initial, crucial steps that often get overlooked:\n\n*   Define Blueprint and high level planning\n*   Establishing a solid naming convention\n*   Configuring your Gradle files for a multi-module project\n*   Creating your first independent feature module\n\nMy goal was to create a truly actionable guide rather than just a theoretical overview. You can follow along with the code on GitHub [starter code: https://github.com/vsay01/PinterestStyleGridDemo/tree/main].\n\nI'd love to get this community's feedback:\n*   Does this approach make sense?\n*   What were your biggest challenges when you started modularizing?\n*   What topics would you like to see covered in future parts?\n\nHere's the link to the article: https://medium.com/@sayvortana.itc/breaking-the-monolith-a-practical-step-by-step-guide-to-modularizing-your-android-app-part-1-568b34e08d5f\n\nHope you find it useful!",

The project has to include some literature study and reflection, but I’d really like the main focus to be on Android development and implementation. I’m especially interested in areas where I can design and build something concrete, try out new approaches or paradigms, and then test and analyze the results. For example, something along the lines of server-driven UI, performance optimization techniques, or new ways of handling background processes. It could also be about creating frameworks or tools that support Android developers in their work. Have you come across or worked on thesis-level Android projects that were very implementation heavy? What kinds of topics do you think could be both practical to build and interesting enough for research today?",

Like you all know Google Play charges 15% if it is below $1 million in a particular calendar year. If it is more than that, it will charge 30%. But both Google Play and Apple by default charge 30% itself, even if it is below $1M until you opt for so called \"15% service fee tier\". Not sure why app stores do like this, but you need to manually go and opt-in to that. So don't forget to opt for this.",

No. Kotlin Multiplatform came along, and you need to use Ktor, then Koin and others, then AI, then updates. You need to use the latest tools to stay ahead. I'm not saying these libraries are bad, but before, things used to move at a reasonable pace. Then Google started adding a lot of new updates that made you focus on following them so your apps don't get deleted, instead of thinking about improving them. I really miss the old days.",

Our web team of 3 developers (2 of which are fresh out of college) had some free time so they decided to start building the same app we're rebuilding as a side project. They started that about 3 months ago. What was initially thought as  a side project turned out to be the one going to production. The reason given to us is the 'speed of development'. Keep in mind that all of our app's features are completed. While their app lack some features. The UI also doesn't match the planned design, with misaligned components everywhere. While you could consider the app as medium in terms of size and complexity, they are planning to add more features in the future. The decision just doesn't make any sense to me. We already have the app built with CMP, and they admitted that our app is superior to theirs in all aspects. I just feel frustrated for the waste of my time and efforts to deliver the best product and then being abandoned because our management's lack of standards.",
