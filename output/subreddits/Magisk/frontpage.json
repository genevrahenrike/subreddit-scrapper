      "content_preview": "While searching for a solution for this, I found some situations where people fixed this but they weren't just stuck on \"copying zip to temp directory\" - it was also followed by an error - like this: - Copying zip to temp directory ! unzip error Some of their fixes I read were: Making sure they didn't download the source code zip of the github file, but the actual release zip version. Checking if the zip has the files on the folder's root. If you open the zip and there's another single folder inside at the root, that you have to enter to get to the files, try moving the files to the root. To do this unzip the whole thing, open that folder inside with the files, select all the files and zip them. Now use that zip with the files directly at the root on Magisk instead. Now, the thing is the problem I was having was just this (no error message): - Copying zip to temp directory So, here's the solution I discovered: I thought that maybe it just might be taking too long to unzip or something? Maybe making it simpler to unzip would make it faster or stop it from freezing? What I did was --> I unzipped the whole thing, opened the folder with the files and, using 7-Zip, right-clicked \"Add to archive...\" (to customize the zipping) and, by playing with the settings, I changed the compression level from Ultra to Fastest . Pressed OK to zip, and used that on Magisk. https://preview.redd.it/stuck-on-copying-zip-to-temp-directory-when-installing-v0-dcwiij25lomf1.png It worked now and quickly installed the module!! I couldn't find this (possible) solution anywhere so I hope this helps other ppl! Edit: Someone in the comments said to use \"Store\" instead of \"Fastest\", which means 0 compression. So if not even  Fastest worked, try Store.",

Their links,  which only have the letter t and end in the \".me\" format (t -dot- me), cannot be used on reddit. I will leave out the banned part and replace it with BANNED. For example a work-around link will look like this: \"BANNED/test\" instead of \"t -dot- me/test\" This guide assumes your bootloader is already unlocked and you’re on a Generic Kernel Image (GKI)–compatible device. We’ll only touch boot.img (no LKM, no init_boot). If possible, start from stock (formatted). Prerequisites Unlocked bootloader Device supporting GKI Computer (my guide is written with windows in mind) 1. Identify Your Kernel Version On your phone, go to Settings → About phone → Kernel version (at least for me. might differ for you) Note the string, e.g.5.10.214-android13-4-XXXXXXXXXXXXX. Take a screenshot for good measures Unpack your Stock boot.img For simplicity, create a new folder and put your boot image into that folder as well as the magiskboot.exe file. Open a terminal and enter the following <drag the magiskboot.exe> unpack <drag your stock boot.img> Press enter. Look at the output for KERNEL_FMT (or similar) to see if it’s raw, gz, or lz4. We will need this info for the next step. For now just keep the terminal open Note: in the folder a new file called \"Kernel\" was created. 2. Grab  your correct Generic Kernel Builds Go and grab a copy of magiskboot.exe from HERE Visit TheWildJames’s GitHub releases page. Go HERE for OnePlus kernels and HERE for anything else. Click on the latest release Click Assets on the latest tag (e.g. v1.5.7-r8). note: Make sure the kernel you select starts with NEXT (for KernelSU Next which is what we will be using) Search (Ctrl + F) for your kernel number (e.g. 5.10.214). You’ll see files AnyKernel3-XXXXXXXXX.zip, AnyKernel3-iz4-XXXXXXX.zip and AnyKernel3-gz-XXXXXXX.zip (Note the gz, l4z and \"nothing\" which corresponds to \"raw\" fro  step 2. (Pixel phones will use lz4. Grab the AnyKernel3 .zip matching your KERNEL_FMT: raw → zip without gz/lz4 gz → AnyKernel3-gz-*.zip lz4 → AnyKernel3-iz4-*.zip We’ll use the AnyKernel3-*.zip matching your format (raw/gz/lz4). Make sure that if your kernel said \"5.10.214-android13-4-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\" that you use the \"android13 version regardless of your actual android version. I am running android 15 but my Kernel says android13 thus I am choosing Android13 If your exact version isn’t listed, you can: Request a build from James at the banned website or github Up/downgrade firmware (To get a kernel that might exist) Use a close match at your own risk: I have heard that if you have 5.10.214-android13-4-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX that you can choose any kernel as long as it starts with 5.10 and has android13 in it. For example: People with 5.10.214-android13-4-XXXX could use 5.10.208-android13-4-XXXX. I have not tested this. If it causes issues simply flash your stock boot image again to fix. 3. Prepare the Generic Kernel Navigate to the selected Kernel zip you just downloaded and open it. the will be a file called image (if were raw), image.lz4 (if you were lz4) or image.gz (if you were gz) Extract and copy image, image.gz , or image.lz4 the folder you created above Delete the existing kernel file (called \"kernel\"  and rename your new image to exactly: kernel (Not kernel.lz4 or kernel.gz. ONLY \"kernel\", meaning your file will have NO extensions. Repack with magiskboot: <drag the magiskboot.exe> repack <drag your stock boot.img> Press enter In your folder a new file was created called: new-boot.img. 4. Flash the Patched Boot Download/extract platform-tools from HERE and open a terminal in that folder by typing \"cmd\" into the address bar (without quotes) Boot your phone to bootloader (fastboot mode) and connect USB. Flash:fastboot flash boot <drag the new-boot.img file into the terminal> flash and reboot. (If you hit a bootloop, reflash your stock boot.img the same way) 5. Verify Root & Install Core Modules Open KernelSU Next on your phone → confirm root access. (download latest version from HERE if you do not have it yet. If successful KSU NEXT should say \"working GKI2\" In KSU Next, go to Modules and install these: ReZygisk Play Integrity Fix by KOWX712 Tricky Store + addon LsPosed IT (leaked build; BANNED/Rootthingschat/67835) or LsPosed by JingMatrix latest treatwheel from BANNED/zygote64_32 Has been integrated to reZygisk. No longer needed latest nohello from HERE Has been integrated to reZygisk. No longer needed latest hide my Applist (HMA) from HERE Install the latest susfs module from sidex15. Reboot. 6. Set Up HMA & KeyBox In LSPosed, enable HMA → reboot. Configure HMA to hide any apps not from the PlayStore (follow this guide if you don't know how to use it) Via the root file explorer of your choice, navigate to and Replace  the old keybox.xml with a valid keybox.xml: :data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml (if there wasn't such a file simply place your valid keybox.xml there. It's okay if there wasn't one to begin with as long as you put a valid one there) Where do I get a valid keybox? I won't be able to keep up with this but places to check TSupport: BANNED/AdvanceCitraIntegrityTrick/98 Integrity Wizard: BANNED/integrityWizard YuriKey mananger (ksu module) 7. Populate target.txt Option A: WebUI In KSU Next → Modules → Tricky Store → Web UI Select each app you want to hide root/bootloader from (all is safest). Save → reboot. Option B: Termux Script Install Termux from Play Store. Grant root in KSU Next. Open Termux, then:su -c \"cat /data/system/packages.list |  grep -v '@system' |  awk '{print $1}' > /data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt;  echo -e 'com.google.android.gsf\\ncom.google.android.gms\\ncom.android.vending' \\/data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt;\" Reboot. Keep target.txt up-to-date whenever you install or open new root-sensitive apps. make sure that the target.txt has these apps!!: Google Wallet com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel Google Play services com.google.android.gms Android System Key Verifier com.google.android.contactkeys com.google.android.gsf com.google.android.gsf Google Play Store com.android.vending 8. (Optional) Spoof Device ID If an app flags your unlocked bootloader once, you may need to spoof your device ID permanently (or format your phone). Use sidex15’s Device ID spoof module in KSU Next. 9.

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I’m running a Google Pixel 8 on Android 16 , fully rooted. I’ve been testing both Magisk Alpha and Kitsune Canary to get all my banking apps working, and I’m running into detection issues. Hoping for advice from others who have tackled this. Here’s my setup for both Magisk variants : Zygisk enabled Enforce DenyList disabled Added to DenyList: Play Services, Play Store, Google Wallet, Revolut, Salt, Homebank/ING Shamiko installed PIF (Play Integrity Fix) installed Tricky Store + Tricky Store Addon installed In KSU WebUI I’ve hidden all the necessary apps Magisk Manager app hidden under the name \"Settings\" Strong integrity check passes on both builds Google Wallet works fine on both builds Behavior I’m seeing: Magisk Alpha: Revolut works ✅ Salt & Homebank/ING fail ❌ (detect root) Kitsune Canary: Salt & Homebank/ING work ✅ Revolut fails ❌ So far it seems like Alpha is better for Play Integrity-heavy apps (like Revolut), while Canary is better at hiding deeper root traces for apps like Salt/Homebank. I’ve tried all the usual tricks: hiding Magisk, DenyList, Shamiko, PIF, Tricky Store, clearing app data, multiple reboots. Still, I can’t get all apps working on a single build. My questions: Has anyone managed to get Revolut + Salt + Homebank/ING all working simultaneously on a Pixel 8 ? Are there additional tweaks for Magisk Alpha that could hide the root from Salt/Homebank? Or should I just stick with Kitsune Canary and find a workaround for Revolut? Any advice, guides, or experiences would be super helpful! Thanks in advance!",

This week, I have really tried my best to bypass it. If every method just doesn't work or is too complicated, this is the guide for you. This will tell you how to Flash SUSFS into your kernel. Correctly configure your base modules. Understand how each module is needed. The guide will start... Now! Flash a patched init_boot from KernelSU Next (KSUN) into your phones partition using Fastboot, same way you would root using Magisk. Install Kernel Flasher , then download a compiled version of SUSFS from TheWildJames WildKernels Github corresponding to your Kernel Number, if you cannot find the exact number version just use the next closest thing. (Fair warning, that might be dangerous!) flash it into KSUN using Kernel Flasher. THATS IT! You did it, no crazy complicated steps or anything, you can now continue to the modules and stuff, this is more complicated. 4. Install these modules into KSUN ReZygisk (Zygisk for KSU) susfs4ksu LSPosed by JingMatrix (A maintained fork of LSPosed) TrickyStore Yurikey Manager 5. Reboot device, install TrickyAddon module, TrickyAddon will add a WebUI to use TrickyStore easier. Reboot again after installation. 6. Configure TrickyStore with EVERYTHING and set a Keybox. (Either custom or just random valid) 7. Install PlayIntegrityFix-NEXT . This must be done after TrickyStore because of it using the framework and keyboxes from Tricky. 8. Install HideMyApplist and DevOptsHide APKs into LSPosed and set it all to the MAX. You can find some tutorials online on how to correctly set it up. The one thing you should do differently is set Google Wallet to Whitelist Mode, not Blacklist mode. Trust me on this. 9. Configure Yurikey and run everything listed in the advanced menu at the bottom, you can also use it like TrickyStore to change and manage tokens but I wouldn't recommend it. This step will help negate pre-detections from wallet and other Gapps. Reboot for the last time. 10. Confirm everything using Native Detector , and make sure that you have close to no serious detections. Detections like \"LineageOS\" or \"Detected LSPosed/HideMyApplist\" are fine. Play Integrity barely matters anymore, it's mostly all about Root Hiding now. Congratulations, You did it! You have successfully escaped the endless hell of Play Integrity and Google Wallet detection and have granted yourself God's grail of root-hiding. Add your debit cards, use ChatGPT and your favorite banking apps, add your detected modules, and live a happier, less angry life. Also a bonus is that Play Store won't crash constantly in the background.",

Why not check the sub for similar questions before posting another question. There are different methods with which apps can detect root and will keep evolving with time. It is not necessary that having strong integrity will hide root. Consider Root and Integrity checks as 2 different things. Integrity checks are methods provided by google to check if device is running on custom software(or has a tempered software) while root detection methods apps use are mostly app specific. Please understand that root detection is a separate thing and has not much to do with integrity checks. If a method is working today, it might not work Tommorow because app developers will have something new to check root.",

I had an issue logging in on a game with Gmail account so I updated magisk (though it was the issue) nothing happened. After 2 days the game released an update and since then I was getting an error (could not detect location). I went to open magisk and saw that zygisk had some changes and I had to reboot the phone to apply them which I did and then it worked fine. What I noticed is that my phone restarts itself randomly, sometimes even after few minutes and I'm back to zygisk needing to reboot to apply changes. Is there any way to fix that? Mobile : Xiaomi mi8 Android version : 12 Magisk version : 29.0 (updated from 27.0) Modules used : systemless hosts, universal safetynet fix and zygisk-lsposed If anyone has any info on how to fix this, please let me know",

It just needs the following use magisk Alpha, not normal, otherwise it detects it hide Magisk app Enable Zygisk but DON'T enforce Deny List Add Google Play services, Google Play store and Revolut to Deny List. Install Shamiko, Play Integrity Fix Next by Ericignacio, Tricky Store and Tricky Add-on plus WebUI-X keep Shamiko as default Blacklist mode (the whitelist mode works, but reduces battery life considerably, not recommended), it will use the Magisk Deny List. IMPORTANT, this is key: open Tricky Addon via WebUI-X and add Revolut, Google Play Store, Google Services Framework, Google Play Services. For these three you need to \"Add system app\" and add: com.google.android.gms, com.google.android.gsf, com.android.vending. Long press on each one (including Revolut) and mark them with the GREEN checkmark. Get a valid keybox, if it doesn't work get one from that tryigit website, even if not Strong, and add it as custom. Save. open Play integrity fix in WebUI-X and press advanced, UNTICK all the SPOOF stuff. Get the pif.json. note the security patch date. Reopen Tricky Addon, Press Set Security patch and press advanced. Add the same date as the pif MANUALLY to Boot and Vendor. For System insert prop. Remember to Save. maybe it is needed, not sure. Install \"Key attestation 1.8.4\" by chiteroman and press on the section \"Root of Trust\". The boot hash will be copied in memory. Go back to tricky Addon via WebUI-X and paste It in the Set Verified Boot Hash option. save. If Revolut doesn't work in this way, you are doing something wrong and not following these instructions correctly. Note: this works also for many other banking apps, you don't need any Integrity Box module or any extra more complicated stuff. ENJOY.",
