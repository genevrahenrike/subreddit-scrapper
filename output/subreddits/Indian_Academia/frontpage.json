      "content_preview": "Before you answer, please take a minute to read: I might go forward with one of 2 options: BS-MS in biology OR English Hons (major) with Economics Hons (minor). I want you to tell me, which one's better in terms of opportunities available in INDIA? I would appreciate if your answer is more than just a yes or no. I, as a person, don't generally like going too much into technicalities/pure science. I like giving presentations, leading groups and projects, training people, but I don't like the corporate world. I like government jobs, but those in science are hard to land. I like the lab atmosphere, I'm still figuring out whether I pure science is something I would pursue for the rest of my life, but I've sometimes gotten myself into thinking I enjoy biology and thought that if I take the subject, what if I genuinely enjoy it? (I still have time to figure it all out, don't worry) So, if I do take biology: Will I survive it? What job opportunities (industrial/research/non-science) can I do that I can't otherwise? Is it worth it? especially in the next 5 years? What difference would it make if I choose english+economics instead? is it better? Because, based on all those threads I read, there are not a lot of job opportunities in pure science in India. myquals",

My initial plan was to just focus on bcom & then start preparing for CAT & NMAT when I reach Sem 4 but then my seniors told me MBA with no workex doesn't hold much value, also I scored 70% in my 10th + no ECC as of now so already IIM ABC have rejected me and with plain bcom degree I am not going to get a job in this saturated market.. I AM CONFUSED what should I pursue with BCom? I was planning CA/CS but with 80% attendance requirement they feel irrealistic to crack. I'm not really good with quants, so i don't think I can go for CFA my strong subjects during 11-12th were accountancy and business studies! Anyone please guide me?

I’ve failed more interviews than I can count before I learned how to handle them better. Recently I realized something: for IT interviews often feel harder than the actual job. Tons of DSA, system design, HR grilling, and then salary talks. From outside, it looked fascinating – and honestly, brutal. So, I decided to write a guide in Hindi . Not just about coding, but the whole journey: HR rounds without sounding fake, simulating interviews so you don’t freeze under pressure, qualifications without underselling yourself, and what to actually do in the first 90 days once you join. 👉 It’s up on Amazon.in (Kindle, free with Unlimited) → आईटी नौकरी इंटरव्यू में सफलता कैसे पाएँ: एक अर्जेंटीनी इंजीनियर की नज़र से भारतीय युवाओं के लिए मार्गदर्शन (Hindi Edition) Important note: this isn’t AI-generated. I actually hired a professional translator to make sure the Hindi is natural and not “machine-like.” It cost me time and money, but I wanted it to feel authentic for Indian readers. I wrote this as an outsider trying to share what worked for me, but I’d really like to hear how devs or young people starting here experience it. Cheers!",

I joined Woxsen University (BBA Financial Services Hons) about 3 weeks ago, but honestly, I am not feeling comfortable here. The environment is mentally draining for me, and I feel out of place. The system here is also very project/presentation-heavy, and since I have extreme stage fear, I can do presentations but only for a small group, not in a class with 105 students, it’s stressing me out a lot. I’m already skipping classes because of this. My qualifications are: IB Diploma Now I’m considering shifting. My options are: Continue at Woxsen (4-year BBA: Financial Services Hons, graduate in 2029). Shift to NMIMS Mumbai next year and restart 1st year BBA: Finance(3 years, so still 2029 grad). Another option could be Atlas, but I’m mainly comparing Woxsen vs NMIMS. Also, I am aiming for getting into Investment Banking and portfolio management sector, so any grads in these sectors from NMIMS, pls lmk if it is a good college. My concern is mainly about: Placements/ROI (I’m aiming for ISB or IIM Mumbai MBA later, but want a good undergrad brand value). Culture/vibe (is NMIMS more structured and less mentally draining than Woxsen?). Strictness (I’ve heard NMIMS is strict about attendance — is it manageable?). If anyone here is doing BBA at NMIMS Mumbai, can you please share your real experience ? Are placements actually worth it, and how’s the day-to-day life compared to a project-heavy system like Woxsen? Any advice from seniors or current students would really help me decide 🙏",

I figured I'd offer to help out here too! Whether it's a bestselling novel, an obscure self-help book, or a pricey academic textbook for your studies, I can likely track down a PDF or EPUB for you. Just comment the title and author below, or send me a DM if you're shy. I only ask for a few bucks for my time (usually like the price of a coffee) to keep this going. Happy reading!",

But recently i ve been thinking that maybe solely masters wont help much . So how about i complete my master from IGNOU only whilst preparing . In these 2 years my masters will be complete and thereafter i can pursure Phd . But i do not have much idea about how Phd degree work for career in india . Can anyone guide me And / or provide alternate solutions.",
