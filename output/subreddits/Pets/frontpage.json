      "content_preview": "Hi, I’m worried about my cat and she’s been gone for a full day. Usually when I call her, she comes back but i’ve tried yesterday and today with no success and i’m freaking out. She’s an outside cat, due to my mom being mildly allergic. Also yes, they come inside during the winter. She has 3 kittens, all still here at the house. I’m afraid she’s hurt, or lost. She may be in heat, so does that indicate she’s out looking for a mate? when will she return? I’m freaking out A LOT because this happened last time and i haven’t been able to get her fixed since. I love her so much and I don’t think I’d be able to handle her being gone. please reassure me my baby will come back home.",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been a vet tech for a decade and I have been a hospital administrator for 2 of those years. I have to say I am so sick of hearing the same accusations from people and I just want to air some of them out. Vets are not in it for the money- they pay the same amount of money for med school as human doctors do but make about 1/3 of their salary. And you need to learn multiple species. Vets do it solely for the love of animals. They get paid by the food companies- nope. Again that’s human medicine. They get kickbacks from drug companies. Our rep told us thank you by dropping off popsicles last month. We recommend the foods we recommend because the science backs them up. I could never work in this field because I couldn’t put down a pet- that is not the hardest part of this job. Seeing owners leave and you that animal is suffering is the hardest part. People declining all diagnostics and wanting to know why their pet is sick is hard. Euthanasia is a gift. Vet techs aren’t nurses- I ran anesthesia during a cystotomy today. Performed phlebotomy on over a dozen patients. I also did a dental cleaning. So I think that it’s pretty close babe. It’s so expensive why can’t they just help me if they say they love animals so much -yeah again have you looked at human medicine? Things cost money. We cannot do everything for free we would have to close the clinic. The machines we use are 10’s of thousands of dollars. We can’t pay for that in your appreciation. Most importantly be kind to your vet staff. Having a pet is a LUXURY. I don’t think you should have 30k in the bank sitting there just in case your dog needs a crazy surgery but if you can’t afford your dogs basic care don’t get a dog. Spay or neuter your pet, give them vaccines, treat their illness. But don’t blame me that you can’t afford the treatment because you let things get really bad. That’s on you not me. Believe me if you are kind and try to work with us we will help you find a solution if one is available. Let’s see how many people get mad about this.",

It was about $100/monthly total for both cats. Then of course, earlier this year they increased their monthly rate to $60/monthly. so I started paying $120/monthly this entire year. Guess what email I’ve received today from Trupanion. “Your monthly rate will be $81/monthly per cat starting this month” ?????????????? Are they fucking crazy lmfao. $80 monthly is the amount people with 6-7 year old pets are fucking paying. Not someone with a TWO year old cat. They’re honestly such a joke. They just increased $20 monthly within a span of 8 months….. and raised a total of $30 monthly within a span of 1.5 years. It hasnt even been two fucking years since I’ve had Trupanion and their monthly rate went from $50 to $81. Mind you, i havent even used the insurance yet.",

      "content_preview": "This shouldn't even be a hot take, but apparently it is in some circles. It has been on my mind for a while, but I decided to voice it after I saw a post on a different platform with unbelievable comments. The post was in a group for organizing living spaces and the poster \"Alice\" was looking for tips to maximize space and efficiency in her one-bedroom, pet friendly apartment. She had one cat. The cat was provided with food, water, a cat tower, cat toys, and a litter box. These items were visible in the pictures included with the post. As I scrolled through the comments, I was shocked at how many of them had nothing to do with design and organizing advice, but instead were attacking \"Alice\" for keeping a cat in a one-bedroom apartment. Multiple commenters said it was cruel, abusive, and unforgivable. They said the space was much too small for the cat to get minimum levels of exercise or enrichment. They said that \"Alice\" should either move into a bigger place or re-home the cat immediately. They said the cat would be better off in a shelter. One commenter wished she had the authority to seize the cat and give it to a rescue. IMO this is absolutely insane! A one-bedroom apartment is a very common living situation. In what world is it more humane for a cat to live in a 2'x2' stainless steel cage, or a single room with 12 other cats, in an environment that reeks of disinfectant and litter boxes, with pets yowling and dozens of strangers streaming through every day, and nearly zero one-on-one attention/enrichment? I have also seen people who believe that a high energy, escape artist, large breed dog with destructive impulses would be better off in a animal shelter or in a home, crated, with two or three on-leash-only walks everyday, instead of the escape-proofed 1800sq.ft. shaded area, and off-leash training/exercise that the owners were providing. I could go on and on about this ridiculous mindset that is also behind the insanely restrictive adoption requirements that many shelters and rescues have. However well-intentioned they may be, they are shutting out a lot of loving, responsible adopters based on an excessive and often arbitrary list of demands, even when the adoptive home is vastly better than the kennels, cages, and stress of the shelter/rescue environment. 99% of the time, a loving home that provides proper food, water, some toys/enrichment objects, and attention, is a much better, more humane option for a pet to live, compared to any shelter/rescue environment.",

I feel totally stuck between trying to be a good host/roommate to my partner’s best friend and protecting my pets’ home!! Is it possible to suddenly develop a cat allergy later in life?? Has anyone dealt with this?? Are there solutions that actually work in a shared house — like air purifiers, keeping cats out of certain rooms, allergy meds, etc?? I want to be empathetic, but I also need to stand firm — my cats aren’t going anywhere!! Any advice would mean so much right now!!",

Lately, I noticed she jumps on the bed, walks right up to my face, and literally pushes my phone out of my hand with her head. If I ignore her, she’ll sprawl across the screen until I give up. The funny part? The moment I put the phone down, she curls up on my chest, purrs like a tiny motor, and falls asleep in less than 2 minutes. Now it’s become our little bedtime rule no scrolling, just cuddles. Honestly, I think she’s training me instead of the other way around.  Anyone else’s pet have weird but sweet little routines like this?",

Just be straightforward with the potential adopters. It seems unnecessary since we still love her, but if she’s only two months, than she was taken from her mom WAY too early, which explains why she’s always nursing on us and we can’t successfully potty-train her.",

Named her Mochi and she does the most hilarious things. Like randomly jumping across couches in a hilarious manner. It's chaos but in the cutest way possible. I really want to start capturing some of those moments, mostly to share with my family and also with a close friend who’s been going through a rough patch lately. I feel like some silly Mochi clips could bring a little joy to her day. But here’s my problem: I absolutely suck at filming. The videos I try to record turn out super wobbly and just... weird. The angles are bad and the fun of the moment kind of gets lost in the shaky mess. I just dont know how are you guys getting such cool, clean footage of your pets?? My brother (he’s the guy with a drone for every trip) told me I should just get a gimbal with animal tracking. He mentioned Insta360 Flow 2 Pro and Hohem isteady v3, that can track movements so it can follow pet around the room. He said I could just park it in a corner, hit record and it’ll follow Mochi automatically. But before i do can you all please share your tips. Do you all use gimbals for pets or a tripod? Or anything else. Or are you just good at videography.",

      "content_preview": "Decided it was time to upgrade my dogs bed he’s literally had the same bed since he was 1 years old. He just turned 6. He sleeps on his bed but mostly he likes to sleep on my bed with me. I thought it was because he wanted to sleep with me. But now I think that’s not the case. I was doing some cleaning and my knees on the floor were hurting so I put his bed under my knees and I was like this thing is flat as a hotcake and didn’t have the money to get him a new bed at the time because I wanted a good one. His other bed in the living room is temperpedic lined with faux fur %100 polyester with a foot of cushioned support on the back half coming up so he can nuzzle into it nicely. I spent a pretty penny. Put it in the living room as his living room bed. In my room, I kept that bed for so long because he also had my bed but I realized it sucked now it flattened no wonder he wants to sleep in my bed. He ain’t a young buck anymore you know he needs some support. My mum got me a gift card for pet store on his birthday so I went to the petstore I went to two locations finding him the perfect bed in my budget and I found a nice big pillow like bed super soft and not temperpedic but It’s stuffed with like not just stuffing but the stuffing is clumped together so the stuffing has better Intervirty this shit is fluffy and soft as shit I tried laying in it in the pet store and even I didn’t feel the floor and he already has his designated bedroom pillows so I didn’t mind it was one with no support cushions. Well, people of the world, my dog has slept soundly in his own bed ALL night and has not moved a single muscle 7 straight hours. This is UNLIKE my dog. Usually he is up every couple hours and he will change his sleeping spot. He’ll go from my bed cuddling me , to the pillow bext to me, to the foot of my bed, to the floor, to his bed, and just like me I’m up every couple hours too and got to readjust but tonight I’ve been up I can’t sleep and he is like out like a light. And it was pissing rain today he didn’t go for any walk we were inside all day so it’s not like it’s just because he’s had an active day and he’s worn out. On top of that my bf slept over tonight too and usually my dog gets jealous and will cuddle me every more all night and sleep in between us 😢 lowkey I love when he sleeps with me and I spoon him or me nuzzles into my side when I’m sleeping on my side but now in going to regret getting this bed cuz he’s gonna prefer sleeping in his own bed. I know it’s important that he feels welcome to his home with me he’s welcome to the couch or my bed but I always think is importantto have something of his own he can relax in :) I guess they all gotta grow up sometime huh He’ll always be my baby I’m Happy hes so comfy and sleeping soundly through the night ❤️ Love you buddy",

      "content_preview": "Long story short, I lost my cat and best friend of 20 years 2 years ago. I live with my mom and she finally gave the ok for me to get another cat. I was hoping to get a kitten around 6 months old so they could get desensitized to grooming (nail clipping, teeth brushing, etc), but after asking the cat people, it seems my lifestyle no longer suits a cat. My mom and I work full time, with my days off being Thursday and Friday, and her's being the weekend. Monday through Wednesday we both work, just at different times, so there's around 6 hours when no one is home. Thurs to Sunday: Someone is home Monday to Wednesday: House is empty from 11 to 5 Other notes: This would be a solo pet. My mom won't say yes to two and I strongly prefer only having one pet. My cat and I were very close. I enjoy trainable animals. Cat obedience isn't a thing (yet), but I basically trained my cat for the dog sport, rally. If she lived a bit longer I would've entered her in the virtual competition. I really just miss coming home to something that's happy to see me. Nothing ever felt as good as the mutual love we had for each other. I just want something to come home to again. Thank you",

I panicked and spent almost an hour walking around the neighborhood calling his name. Just as I was about to completely lose hope, I heard laughter coming from down the street. I turned the corner and there was Max—sitting on my neighbor’s porch like he lived there, wagging his tail, and proudly eating the sandwich she had been making for herself. My neighbor was doubled over laughing and said, “Don’t worry, he’s been supervising me while I cleaned my kitchen.” Apparently, he just walked in like he owned the place, made himself at home, and acted like he’d moved in. When I called him, he didn’t even run over. He just looked at me like, “Oh hey, you’re here too? Want some of this sandwich?”",

Basically informing me that they’ll be increasing my monthly rate (again) this year but this time, by $20 monthly. This means they’ve raised my monthly rate not once, but twice this year. “All over Canada and the United States the cost of veterinary care has been increasing at unprecedented rates, with something even as small as an x-ray being over 40% more expensive on average over the last couple of years than the years prior. With such changes in the veterinary care market, we are forced to either increase our cost to ensure we can keep our promise of unlimited coverage, or to limit the great coverage that our members signed on for. We cannot compromise our coverage, so we must instead react appropriately to market changes. We track this information by looking at the average claims expirience for pets like your own.” You will probably receive an email of your increased rate and a bunch of PDFs of their policy and contract according to your renewal date. Or at least thats what they told me.",

      "content_preview": "Hey all I work at animal control. While we do have to keep it pretty down low on a lot of stories and behind the scenes I wish I could share. I think having a conversation about microchips is pretty important. Microchips are one of the most helpful tools to reuniting pets with owners. Only a very small portion of lost pets that end up at our AC and partnered shelters are chipped. And a lesser portion of those chips are actually registered. In most states the \"stray hold\" on a pet without a microchip is between 2 to 3 days. That's not that long. If you get into a car accident and your dog is in the car and you end up in the hospital, your pet will be brought to the local AC and stray hold will also apply. *If you break up with your partner and you take custody of the pet. Make sure you take their name off of the microchip. They can and will come and reclaim your pet. *If you buy a pet online make sure their current chip is transferred to you. If the old owners are the only ones on the chip they are responsible for reclaiming. Not you. And you will have to hope they won't try and take the pet back *If your pet is missing. Go into their microchip and report them as lost. If the pet gets scanned anywhere this will pop up when we research the chip and it will keep anyone else from being able to override your info. *Have a second contact on the chip. If you are unable to reclaim your pet. This will allow someone else to easily come in your place. We cannot turn them over to your mom, gf, cousins etc otherwise. *You can microchip your animals at 2 months. There's no excuse *You can also microchip your indoor pets. They also get lost *Make sure your chip is registered and activated with your information. *Be comfortable with accessing the chip online Thanks for coming to my ted talk! Keep your pets safe!",

But we haven't been able to see a vet in that time due to the pressures of moving house, nowadays she won't touch her dry food, doesn't touch the water as much, she does take drinks just not frequently, and she either eats her food spaced out or she eats half of it and doesn't eat the other half. I started giving her half of the usual amount to make sure she eats all of it but she eats half of that too She whines many times during the day. Can't get off her back without help anymore, I don't know if she sleeps. I often see and have to remove dried up tears or sleep remnants or something crusty from under her eyes. I hate that she's in this much pain, I hate that I can't do anything for her. But I also hate that I know this might result in her needing to be put down if the treatment for whatever condition she has becomes too expensive, I just lost another dog last year to bone cancer, so I don't know if I'm ready to say goodbye to this one either. She was my support animal as a child when I couldn't sleep. She's been there when I've been at my lowest, and I don't want to say goodbye, but I don't want to prolong her pain, I'll see about getting her to a vet tomorrow or this afternoon. But does anyone have a similar experience, do you think it's time I bite the bullet and give her peace, or am I being overworried?",

Then my cat (she’s usually aloof and proudly independent) slowly walked over, sat down on top of a warm hoodie I had just folded, looked straight at me, and started purring. Loudly. Then gently rested her paw on my leg. She never does that. It wasn’t a \"feed me\" moment, it felt like she just knew I needed a little something. Totally melted me. It made me wonder… do pets just know when we need them? What’s something your pet did recently that made your day-even in a tiny way? I’d love to hear your little stories.

      "content_preview": "In 2019, my roommate and I took in a cat their friend could no longer care for. We have lived together until today, my move in day in my new apartment. Despite claiming ownership (they claim they took the cat in) my roommate has not cared for this cat at all. I have solely taken care of the cat and one other cat (who I have owned for 10 years) including feeding 3x a day, changing water, changing litter, purchasing all food/litter, and brushing/other care like cleaning dishes (and general housework) for the past 2 years. I have also taken the cat to the vet 3 times since Winter 2023 because my roommate refused to do so beforehand. The cat/microchip is not registered in their name (the cat was pretty much dumped on our doorstep) and my name is on all 3 vet bills, with the 1st visit because the cat was limping for 4 days and roommate refused to take the cat in despite me asking them to, and two yearly checkups in Jan 2024 and 2025. I took the cat when I moved into my new place because I did not trust my roommate with the cat (long story, but they will frequently leave the home for 24+ hours without notice and are generally not taking care of the house. They also refused to euthanize their previous cat in 2024 after a diagnosis of malignant stomach growth/tumor). My roommate did not like this. They verbally abused me, threw my remaining things on the lawn, and threw dishware at me/my girlfriend. I'm not concerned with the property damage/physical harm as of yet, just with the possibility that the roommate tries to get police involved. Just to note, they did not try to stop me from taking the cat. Should I be concerned or is my proof of ownership sufficient against their lack of proof? Edit: removed pronouns Edit 2: I reviewed my vet bills and saw that the cat is not microchipped. I will be setting up an appointment in the morning (4am as I type this, I could not sleep).",

I would like recommendations for cat beds that are proven to be water proof for cats that pee the bed while homeowners are gone for 8+ hours a day for work. Not water resistant where by the time of discovery, it's soaked through, but actually waterproof. Or as close as we can get. I don't trust sellers because I've proven time and time again that descriptions aren't true. So what are you using or recommending? 🐈 Just some background. This is not my cat, my partner had her before we got together. Please be gentle, I'm mentally fragile given the stress of this through the years. Age: 13-17 Type: Unknown, former feral of 4 years (cared for on-site) Fixed: Yes, after 2 or more litters (2 known, otherwise unknown) While feral she would poo in the \"ashtray\" because the outdoor \"ashtray\" was cat litter. There was an incident where she was violently, or at least very loudly, run off for it because of an employee putting half-smoked cigarettes for later. Employee adopted at that point. Fast forward, she's been the Home Destroyer. It's Cat vs Litter Box vs Homeowner at this point. Couches? Not with her. Once she uses the box or pees on a pad, it's, I assume, considered tainted, and she will go outside of it at that point until it's cleaned and litter is replaced. (Maybe it's just me but a fresh litter box after one poo is wild to me.) Vet visits turned away the idea of infection, with focus on behavior. No litter change has helped, no box change has helped. Even the automated one was an automatic fail, with her being scared of it and not even attempting one poo but opting to poo next to it. Fast forward again, she's now Tripod Cat. Because a few months ago she broke her leg randomly. We thought maybe age, or climbing where she shouldn't but it turned out she had a tumor in her back leg and it snapped clean across. Leg removal happened and Tripod Cat came home as pampered as ever with more blankets, special food multiple times daily, and even more attention to her litter box situation being that 3 legs make it a bit harder for her to get into certain boxes. The behavior has persisted. I'm at a loss other than a new $5 bed weekly to be thrown away weekly because constant washing isn't fitting into our schedule and allowing her to have a bed all day and all night, but they can't go unwashed either. Surely in 2025 we've got some sort of waterproof bed?",

That fixed it for maybe 3 weeks...and it came back. Got another round of ear drops and a cleaning solution to use. That worked for another few weeks. Yet again, within a month of stopping he's back to scratching his ears, shaking his head, licking the paw he uses to scratch (a lot), and doing a little yelp sometimes. This 3rd round they did cytologies again and said no bacterial, fungal, or parasite infection. Gave us more of the wash but he is still miserable.

When I took him to the vet, a comprehensive blood and fecal test was done, with results saying he has pancreatitis and an elevated CBC count potentially due to stress, inflammation, infection, or other. The fecal test showed no parasites, and he is otherwise normal in everything else. We just finished the prescribed pro-pectalin for five days and he also takes a probiotic daily, but the stools haven’t gotten any better. Recently, I brought a new kitten home and did the slow introduction suggested by Jackson Galaxy. For the most part, my 3yo has accepted the kitten, playing with her (though testing boundaries) and grooming her. Every once in a while there is a bit of hissing, which I then separate them. I also still keep them separated when no one is home. The vet said that the pancreatitis could’ve been triggered by my 3yo snacking on the kitten’s dry food, which I’ve since then been keeping a close eye on the snacking habits and keep the kitten food out of reach when I’m not home or when I’m asleep. Other than the diarrhea, he is still acting normal—playing, sleeping, eating, and drinking. He’s not throwing up or showing any other symptoms of illness. He currently eats OpenFarms dry food and Wellness wet food. I’m not sure if changing diets will help him, and if so, any recommendations? And not sure what my next steps should be. I plan on seeing another vet but don’t want to have him go through another set of tests if I don’t have to and everything comes back normal again.",

He doesn’t have many more because he a boxer-Boston terrier mix. He’s brindle, which makes him look expensive. Is he chipped? No. I called my dad this morning and he said he was never chipped. I’m going to take him to the vet as soon as I can. Cameras? I didn’t move in that long ago so I don’t have Wi-Fi yet. I’m looking for providers but there’s not a lot in my area. After that I’ll get the cameras. Beefing up security? Today I went out to Home Depot and got a bunch of 2x4s to jam my windows. I do live on the ground floor. I have a deadbolt and a door jam. I’ve always had curtains for privacy and never opened them so he won’t be able to see inside. I have a few non-practical knives. I’m going to go out and buy more and a baseball bat, maybe some bells for my front door. Tracker? I went out today and bought him a super thick collar that I’m going to sew a tile into. On top of that I’m going to get him a pet gps. I also had a dog tag made that says “NEEDS SEIZURE MEDS” Just move! This is not an option right now. My housing program requires rent to be under $1650 or else they won’t cover the cost. This is pretty reasonable for where I live, but very few apartments in this budget allow dogs. Almost none allow large dogs. Don’t let him loose! Due to his abusive past, he’s aggressive around other dogs. He doesn’t go to the dog park and he’s never off leash. I walk him at family parks and avoid other dogs. He’s very happy with this arrangement. I no longer walk him in the yard. Only on at the park and the opposite side of the property if it’s dark. Why did I answer the door at 10pm? Guys I know it was a stupid idea. I learned my lesson. Pictures of my dog my dog",

Some of the stories aren't that bad, bad owners, bad encounters with certain dogs, that kind of thing didn't make me mad, but the comments that dogs are these mindless beastly parasites that leech off of you and are incapable of love genuinely piss me off. Dislike dogs, I couldn't care less, but these comments genuinely show how cruel a person can be towards an animal, it's so toxic. And apparently, others agree with me, I saw a post saying that they unsubscribed from the subreddit because of the comments made on dogs, and that's exactly why I clicked off and hopefully will never look at it again. But what do you guys think, is the subreddit actually as bad as I think it is, or is it actually not that bad?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I am writing this as a warning to all pet owners who use pet sitters. I have been at my wits’ end about a neighbor who keeps dogs in her backyard in inhumane conditions. There are puppies in the backyard, enclosed in a tiny playpen, regardless of the weather. The puppies are left alone all day long—I have never seen anyone attend to them—and they bark nonstop throughout the day. They walk around in their own waste (not that there is much space for them to walk, as they are confined to a very small area). I suspected the neighbors were backyard breeders because the dogs in their yard keep changing, and they have numerous crates in the backyard (which, unfortunately, wouldn’t have mattered, as backyard breeding is legal in DC). Over the past few months, I have been trying to report them for animal cruelty due to the inhumane conditions the dogs are kept in. I contacted Humane Rescue Alliance, Brandywine SPCA, and even the non-emergency police line. After numerous attempts, I finally received a call from an animal cruelty officer, who informed me that these people are not breeders but pet sitters. They had been reported before by other neighbors, but apparently nothing they are doing is technically illegal. I was told there is no law against leaving pets unattended in a backyard, nor against keeping them in a playpen. The only enforceable requirement is that they must be kept in a shaded area during hot weather. So, the officer said the only action she could take was to ensure the puppies are kept in a playpen with shade moving forward. I am in disbelief that this is not considered animal cruelty. I am quite sure the pet owners have no idea of the terrible conditions their puppies are being kept in. Since I seem to be at a dead end with authorities, I wanted to warn whoever sees this post. I would strongly urge people to use pet sitters they absolutely know they can trust, or use well-established daycares.",

      "content_preview": "A few years back, my parents moved in with me and my dogs. At the time, I was going though a heartbreak and would lick myself up in my room and my dogs will stay outside my bedroom. My parents began to take them into their room and they began to sleep with my parents. As time went by, they became attached to my parents. I have to admit that, once mom and stepdad started walking and feeding them, I wasn’t doing that as much. I understand that they became attached to my parents because they were more attentive that I was. Don’t get me wrong, I pay for most of the vet bills including emergency room visits. When it comes down to big medical expenses, my parents struggle to want to spend that much money. My eldest recently was diagnosed with seizures, cushin disease and heart murmur. The net bill was $2k. My other one was diagnosed with border line kidney disease and both are on prescribed special diet. That’s about $200 on prescribed food monthly which is becoming a bit of a struggle for me because I don’t make that much money but I can’t afford to not buy their food. When I moved out they stayed behind with my parents. More so because they weren’t as attached to me as before and honestly, they are well loved by my parents. I think they take care of them better that I ever could. I feel bad for only paying the vet bills including emergency and meds. I told myself that, that should be enough because maybe I’m not as present in their lives but I’m there financially. But I feel empty. I’m experiencing a lot of anticipation grief. A lot of people say that I should make the best of the time I have left with them. I was told that my eldest had up to two years max to live. We recently put my best friend’s dog to sleep and that increased my levels of anxiety and depression. So, spending time with my dogs has turned into grief and sorrow. Spending time with them feel so heavy and I leave my parents house feeling drained. Yesterday, I accidentally dropped my dog from my arms and took him to the emergency room just to make sure he’s ok. He’s doing ok and it’s on pain meds but I feel like a horrible person. I want to keep on helping with the vet bills - they need special food, meds and my youngest needs to get spayed and get a tumor removed which it’s going to be expensive. I have two jobs now and the plan is to save as much as I can to get her the surgery that she needs because she suffers of a lot of fake pregnancies. Anyways, I want to not come around as much anymore because mom and I have a bad relationship as it is and I feel like I can’t fully be present when I’m with them. I’m constantly saying goodbye and I can be mean sometimes. I don’t mean to be mean but my anxiety gets the best of me (I’m dealing with anxiety, depression and addiction). And I’m not sharing to excuse myself but more so to showcase that I’m a bad owner, a bad person and I feel like I shouldn’t be around my dogs because after dropping my dog and I can assure you it was by accident, I don’t think I deserve to be around them. I feel like I’m not a good presence in their life and they have all the love they need from my parents. I still want to be financially responsible for the big vet expenses, meds and food but, I do want to distance myself. Maybe come around once a month instead of three times a week. And on the there to say goodbye when the time comes. But I feel like shit. So I’m on here to vent and get some advice. Please help!",

      "content_preview": "Today was a day, okay... and I just need to scream this information into the Void. Tldr: I almost put my cat down today because of a misdiagnosis. If my normal vet hadn't been busy, this would have been a very different day. (Sorry not sorry for the novella) Two years ago, the vet that we have been going to for over a decade told us that our cat had a tumor on his tongue. These were usually fast growing and he probably had about two months to live. The most humane thing to do was to basically put him down right then and there. She doesn't actually do any tests. They just had this attitude where \"it's just not really worth the money and it's so obvious.\" We decided to at least treat the original reason why we were there.... And regroup later. It could just be some sort of lesion or inflamation. Unclear. For years, he had been suffering from these persistent lesions on his face. But give him an antibiotic and a steroid and he'd bounce right back. It usually got worse during spring and summer. They told us it was probably FIV? No tests. Then \"tumor\". Thing is... he was still eating and drinking and doing the cat things. Like disappear at the speed of light or scream when its time for his wet food. Or materialize outside. Because he's a black cat and does in fact possess the ability to teleport. About six months ago he started developing a growth on his foot. We were monitoring it \"until it started to really bother him\" their are words not mine... and by the time it started really bothering him they told us \"we would have to amputate the leg. And no point in doing any of that, because he's gonna die soon anyway, and there's no use its only extra pain and suffering.\" This summer, the mysterious wounds got really bad. I took him in the beginning of the summer and the vet basically guilted me into putting him down. I didn't do it right then. I wanted to at least do another round of antibiotics and steroids and see how things go. Because he always responds well them. Plus my mom was out of town and it was just bad timing. All the while he is still eating and drinking and doing the cat things. Today was the day I was going to take him to the vet. Today was rainbow bridge day. The wounds on his face are worse than ever. He actually got out last week and I think it made it worse. We were on borrowed time right? The vet made me feel so guilty the last time I was there. Like i've actually had nightmares revolving around this guilt of keeping him around. I knew if I went back to the vet they were going to convince me. And he is in pain... despite the fact that he is still doing the cat things. I called our normal vet to let them know that we thought it was time. They told me they were busy. The vet was in surgery for the rest of the day. They recommended another place we could go and I called them. This other vet staff were literally Angels. As as soon as she walked in, I said that \" i felt like I needed to explain the state of him.\" And explained the long history that you have very kindly just read. When they saw how lively he was... rubbing on everything and everyone despite (or maybe explaining some of the reason for?) the lesions all over his face. The vet tech asked while holding the syringes for compassionate euthanasia, \"if I would like a second opinion.\" Of course I said yes. The only reason I was there is because I'd been bullied into giving up hope. So... The vet ran some blood work and did a funny test where they literally smashed some glass up against his face.... so although we haven't done a biopsy atm, which is the only way to a hundred percent definitively say it.... as in literally found the cells that cause this.... He has... Eosinophilic Granuloma. Which I can definitely pronounce out loud. It literally explains everything to a T. The facial wounds. The lesion on his tongue that looked like a tumor (but has actually gotten smaller as of today apparently. Actually it's almost gone.... ). Even the growth on his foot. It's kind of an autoimmune disorder? but it's not FIV. Actually, he definitely doesn't have FIV, FIP or cancer.  It's just an extreme response to allergies. Which is literally what me and my mom have been saying for YEARS because it always gets worse during allergy season. NTM the fact that he responded so well to steroids because THAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR IT. I just need to say this to the void.... Fuck my old Vet. They wanted to put him down for the thing on his tongue that is almost gone now. We should have gone to a different vet sooner. Always get a second opinion. And if your vet makes you feel like shit, get a new one. Even if you have been going there since 2009. Today, I am going home with a treatment plan and really fitting diagnosis. Will he be on steroids for the rest of his life? Probably. There is a universe where I went home with an empty cat carrier. Instead I went home with a bottle of steroids and a smelly cat who really needs a bath who WILL claw my face off if I do it... and I couldn't be happier. For anyone wondering, his name is Scrapper. From the day he was born... as a black kitten born on a black blanket in a litter of all black kittens, you could always tell which one was. He didn't like being picked up and he would wiggle and cry. So we called him our little Scrapper. To this day, he still hates being picked up, but he's super loving. I didn't actually break down until I had a name to the diagnosis. It really sunk in how close I was to giving in. I'm personally not religious but I do kind of believe in things like karma. Whatever was looking out for us today... even if it's just luck, an empathetic vet tech and an absolute Queen of a Vet who came in and rescued us.... I am eternally grateful. Today was almost a very different day. Scrapper buddy, today is Not Rainbow Bridge Day.",

Finally took him to his vet and they sent me to a special animal hospital were I spent $7k on two blood transfusions and all that comes with it. Apparently he had an autoimmune disease and it was IMHA with complications and platelet loss. Something called “Evan’s” idk… anyway I made the decision to put him down so he wouldn’t suffer. I feel so guilty I don’t know what I did wrong. He was my everything and we are moving to Colorado and I promised him to sniff new trees and be able to run freely in the open space by my new apartment.. now I don’t have him and I’m still having to move. Alone. I lay here now holding his favorite lamb chop and his bed next to me and I just don’t know how to cope with this. I’m so devastated and the more people tell me it’s okay the more I feel it’s not. He saved my life when I got him at 3 months olds. Literally I just got out the mental hospital and he gave me a purpose to continue on. Something to love and will love me unconditionally.. I’m so heartbroken and now I don’t even want to start this new journey without my heart with me..",

      "content_preview": "Can I give my dog (specifically) the Spring Valley brand Triple Strength Glucosamine Chondroitin Dietary Supplement Tablets for Joint Health? Active ingredients (among others): Glucosamine Hydrochloride 1,500 mg (1.5 g) Chondroitin Sulfate Sodium 1,200 mg (1.2 g) I would, of course, cut up the tablets to make sure the amount of glucosamine is as follows: 250-500 mg for 5-20 pounds dogs 500 mg for 20-45 pounds dogs 1,000 mg for 45-90 pounds dogs 1,500 mg for dogs weighing more than 90 pounds Glucosamine is great for dogs’ joints, and I wanted to switch to the human pills (instead of those made for the dogs, because they’re almost 3x the cost). However, I saw some things online that said to consult a vet before giving your dog human glucosamine, because there can sometimes be ingredients in the human pills that are bad for dogs. That said, I wasn’t able to find any information on WHAT ingredients are bad. Could someone please chime in? Vets and vet techs (or those whose vet cleared this specific pill) would be very helpful - thank you!",

Seriously, she hasn't stopped rumbling since I brought her home. She's an absolute sweetheart and is already exploring her new kingdom. The only problem is... she needs a name! I've been thinking about some ideas, but nothing feels quite right yet. I'd love to hear your suggestions. Any name that fits a tiny, happy purring kitten is welcome! Thanks for your help!",
