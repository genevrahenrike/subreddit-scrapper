      "content_preview": "Ever since I've had my girl Kiwi she's had this behavior of \"squatting\" while peeing. Her daughter has also picked up this behavior and \"squats\" while peeing. We've had the girls for a year and a half. Sometimes they'll both pee in odd areas, like on top of the hay they pull out, the mat at the bottom of their cage, in their actual bathroom, or in the corners during playtime. We vacuum the cages once a day, wash their mat twice a week, and scrub down the bathroom pan and slab they pee on everyday. They are both eating, drinking, and playful balls of joy. Theirs no urine stains on them anywhere. No blood in their urine. No signs of discomfort. Their weights are healthy and consistent. The doctor has given them two yearly check-ups since we've had them and she didn't notice anything concerning. Stating they probably just learned the squatting behavior from a different chin and do it themselves now. It's just that sometimes I'll obverse that, Kiwi specifically, even after peeing she'll attempt to pee in small amounts again. I don't know if it's some kind of trained response like a certain place or feel triggers her to want to pee? Parsnip doesn't do this, but during playtime Kiwi will want to pee multiple times while running in and out of the cage even if she's just peed. It's only during playtime though. During the rest of the day she appears to only pee when necessary. It might be important to note that as soon as we put the mat into the cage after cleaning, if Kiwi notices, she'll tend to jump down and pee on it immediately. Same with Parsnip, but with the dust bath instead. Do I have a case of some wacky Chinchilla's? Or is this common among Chinchilla's? Should I be worried?",

      "content_preview": "Some background: I got my chins Willow and Muffin in March and April. I love love love them so much, but they also cause me so much anxiety because of how much I love them. They‚Äôre 8-9 months old. When we got them, they were upstairs in our spare guest room, but since June they‚Äôve been in the basement to avoid the heat. We use those black grid shelf builder things to make a play pen area for them when they‚Äôre down there so they can come out and play, which is something they‚Äôve become very very used to doing. They usually come out to play around 3 times a day because we basically just open the cage door and let them out. Right away when we got her, Willow is a lil rebel who is so crazy and was always trying to escape her play area (we kept a small area around the bed fenced off in the side room and she‚Äôd always try to jump it to get under the bed). It wasn‚Äôt so bad in the front room because she didn‚Äôt have much of a place to escape so we could pretty easily get her back. When we got to the basement it got a whole lot worse. The wall is about 2 1/5‚Äô tall, which was tall enough for a while but not anymore. She would get out in the whole basement and it usually took 5-10 minutes to get her back. She seemed to think of it as more of a game and would sometimes just come up to us or close to our hands and then run away, or play ‚Äúpeak-a-boo‚Äù where she‚Äôd pop her head out from behind something, and then watch us before ducking back away. It used to get so bad where she‚Äôd get out multiple days in a row. For a while she stopped that, but now it‚Äôs her sister muffins turn to start being bad. For ever, Muffin was the good chinni who‚Äôd watch patiently from inside the cage while we chased Willow around, and she‚Äôs always just be so sweet and silly. She‚Äôs still like that now, except she also decided to start playing Willows game and repeatedly hop the play pen walls. She didn‚Äôt seem afraid of us when we were chasing after her but she also did not have any intention of letting us catch her. She never really liked being picked up, so trying to catch her and keep her in our arms long enough to get back to the play pen is a mess. Thankfully Willow has mostly stopped trying to get out, but muffin is getting so frustrating. All she does when she‚Äôs out playing is try to jump the wall, to the point where we don‚Äôt like having her out anymore. The only problem is she tries jumping out of the cage every time we open the door. It‚Äôs just getting so frustrating and so hard, and it‚Äôs really really really waring me out. We hopefully move them back up the front room in 3 weeks, so I‚Äôm hesitant to spend money on solutions right now, but I also can‚Äôt do this for much longer because it‚Äôs getting exhausting. This is mostly just a rant because I honestly just need some support with this, but I also would love some advice. I love my girls to death but this is making playing with them and spending time with them exhausting and stressful. If you give advice, please keep it positive, and constructive criticism only that will actually be helpful. Thank you all so much!",

      "content_preview": "I have a five year old chinchilla. I have always only fed her Timothy hay and chinchilla pellets, along with a few pieces of oatmeal as a reward for going back inside her cage. However whenever I let her out she will eat anything she can get her teeth on. She loves to not only chew but also eat cardboard and houseplants. She will jump up on the table and eat any groceries that are left out, especially potatoes. If I am eating she will jump up on the table and try to grab my food and run away with it. She usually goes after bread but will sometimes even try to eat meat. I've had a glass of orange juice on the table before that she started drinking. Once she even got inside a bag of Takis. I thought she'd get spiced out and leave it alone but she grabbed a taki, ran under the couch and ate the whole thing. So I have to make sure that every time I let her out there is absolutely no food left in the open. Is this normal for chinchillas to be such voracious eaters or is she not getting some of her nutrients? And is there anything else besides Timothy hay and pellets that I can feed her?",
