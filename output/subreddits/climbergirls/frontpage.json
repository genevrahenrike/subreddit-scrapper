      "content_preview": "Hey yall, next month I will be celebrating the three year anniversary of when I started climbing (my climbaversery) and I want to do a little something to celebrate (mostly because I'm going through a breakup and am looking to cheer myself up). Mostly looking for themed challenges or games I could do in a gym (boulder, toprope, or lead) since I don't want to have to rely on good weather. So far the only idea I can think of is trying to climb every V3 in the gym, which I think should be possible for me but might not be the most fun since I typically project a higher grade so it might not be as much of a mental challenge even if it challenges the muscles by the end. Wondering if anyone has any ideas?",

I dont wanna loose them so i always think about how im gonna clean the route. So what options do I have? cleaning quickdraws adter finishing the route. But what if my partner wants to do it and I want to leave them the quickdraws on the route? what if they cant finish it and im too pumped to climb up after my ascent? If there is access to the anchor from the top then i can rappel down an gather quickdraws i can bail and leave some old carabiner and lower on it, but what if i want to try again from the ground and dont wanna clean the route immediately? i was thinking about getting a clipstick and climbing up with it to clear the route (attaching myself to a bolt, clip the quickdraw with a rope to the next one and repeat until i reach the anchor). is there something wrong with this idea? Maybe its a stupid question but i dont have more experienced partners and I feel that this thing makes me not wanna try hard routes when climbing outside. I also have less fun because of it.",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I was curious if this was something that other women experienced in climbing gyms: I‚Äôm a very introverted person so I have a tendency to climb during hours where the gym is practically empty. If it is busy, then I tend to climb in areas where there‚Äôs no one. Whenever I‚Äôm projecting something, I notice a man will appear out of thin air and start climbing the same problem. I climb v5/v6 so I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs a highly saturated grade with a lot of people in this range, but the man will almost consistently flash the climb, telling me this isn‚Äôt a max effort for them. At first, I didn‚Äôt really think much of it but this has happened soooo many times that it no longer feels like a coincidence. I‚Äôve asked other girls that I‚Äôve encountered at the climbing gym and asked them if they‚Äôve ever noticed this phenomenon and they all instantly know what I‚Äôm talking about. So, has this ever happened to you?",

Dipped my toes into trad climbing a little bit as well and it seems super fun! One thing I noticed is that my good old beginner Decathlon harness doesn‚Äôt quite cut it for me. It‚Äôs really awkward to reach my gear , it‚Äôs all kind of too high/ too far back and it just does not feel right. I have a couple more outdoor trips planned for this year so I was thinking to get a new harnesses, with outdoor climbing in mind. What do I need to look out for in a climbing harness other than comfortable fit and loops I can reach easily? What models would you recommend for an average build European female (sorry I don‚Äôt think I have the vocabulary to describe this properly, my waist/hip / thigh proportions are typical for a Central European build).  I live in the UK so I‚Äôm ideally looking for something I can easily order here , and ideally try in an actual shop",

I started bouldering indoors a few weeks ago (v1/v0) and after I finished today I realized I definitely tweaked my back. I did take a fall from about 4 feet up, but i landed properly and rolled, so It's just kind of baffling that that kind of impact could lead to this. It does sort of make me think I should try ropes, I just really hate the idea of being more than 10/15 feet off the ground, even with a rope. Anyway, if anyone has any tips on how to avoid back strain while bouldering , I'd appreciate it :)",

But then an hour later, me and my friend had made our own step up dyno, and I struggled on that aswell.. and who spots me struggling from the other end of the gym? Dadadaaaa, you guessed it, the beta sprayer from before. He walks in a straight line through the gym to our made up dyno, like he's been summoned. Without looking at us or saying a word, he attempts to do it with the holds (I guess?) he thinks are the ones we also used(completely different holds, and a much easier variation), falls like 4 times in a row, and it looks so funny because he takes no breaks in between, he just throws himself up the wall in random holds. My friend who is talking to me while this happens about something else, is struggling soooo hard to keep a straight face, and I already chuckle a bit. The fifth time he does his version of the dyno, walks away without looking at us, back to the other end off the gym. Me and my friend can't stop laughing afterwards - it was such a ridiculous thing to do?? I wonder what went through his head, what do you people think? Anyways, It was freeing to be able to laugh at a beta sprayer. He probably heard us, and it felt good>:)",

There is also r/ClimbingPartners To break things down more: Please be careful meeting people from the internet. Climbing is inherently dangerous, meeting people on the internet can be inherently dangerous, both together can be inherently dangerous. This sub is not liable for whatever may happen, but so many subscribers have been making climbing partner posts that condensing them to one area sounded like the best solution. Go ahead and share the link to your Etsy or Red Bubble shop or whatever. Specifically we get a lot of sticker design posts and in lieu of having a bunch of self promo posts on the feed, they should go here. Finally- Physique posts! As we know, all shapes and sizes are welcome, valid, and appreciated in climbing, and especially in this sub!
