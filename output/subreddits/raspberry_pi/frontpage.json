I have tried scheduling it on startup both using systemd and crontab, running variations of \"sudo piactl connect\" and creating other files to verify that the script actually runs and don't know what else to try. According to the official documentation \"Some commands, such as connect, require that the graphical client is also running.\", however even when booting into the GUI the vpn doesn't connect automatically and the command has to be manually executed.TLDR: Is there a way for me to execute \"piactl connect\" without having to ssh into the Raspberry Pi every time it restarts?",

My main goal is to be able tosend and receive SMS messagesdirectly over the LTE network in Canada.I’ve read through the Clipper documentation, but I’m still a bit unsure about the best way to interface it with the RP2040. Some specific questions I have:What’s the recommended way to connect the breakout to the RP2040? UART over AT commands?Are there existing MicroPython or C/C++ libraries that make it easier to handle SMS and data over LTE with this breakout?Has anyone here successfully set up the Clipper LTE with a Pico or another RP2040-based board? Any gotchas with power requirements or SIM compatibility in North America?Bonus: if you’ve tested SMS on Canadian carriers (Rogers, Bell, Telus), did it work out of the box?Any advice, sample code, or wiring diagrams would be super appreciated!Thanks in advance.",

      "content_preview": "Hi All, I am trying to decide if it is the case to upgrade the OS on my Raspberry PI3 A+.Currently, I use my Pi only to run PiHole on my local LAN and I have installed BOINC to help scientific research with my spare CPU power. I am running Raspbian 10 LITE.Since several months, I have noticed that I am not getting any update with \"apt update\", so I looked up and noticed that the LTS has ended in July 2024.I don't have much running on my Pi but, as you may imagine, re-installing everything from scratch and setting up the system again is somehow annoying.So my question is the following: considered the above, am I missing some critical safety updates/very useful new features/anything that is really worth the update, or maybe I can just keep going as I am and postpone the update to a later time?I'm a sort of a noob so any advice could be useful. thanks",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyoneI’m working on a project with a Raspberry Pi 5 and I need some help getting my circuit to work correctly.ProjectThe Pi 5 controls the official Camera Module 3.The idea is that when a 5V NPN photoelectric sensor (model E18-D80NK) detects that an object has been released (e.g., after a cutting blade operation), the Raspberry Pi should automatically take a picture and save/send it to a server.Current wiringI’m using a 1-channel PC817 optocoupler module (with L/N on the input side, and VCC/OUT/GND on the output side) to isolate the sensor signal.•\tSensor side:\n\n•\tBrown → +5V from Pi\n\n•\tBlue → GND\n\n•\tBlack (NPN output) → N of the optocoupler\n\n•\tL of the optocoupler → +5V (tied with brown)\n\n•\tOptocoupler output side (VCC/OUT/GND):\n\n•\tVCC → 3.3V from Pi (pin 1)\n\n•\tGND → Pi GND (shared with sensor’s blue wire)\n\n•\tOUT → GPIO17 (pin 11)\n\n•\tI also added a 10 kΩ pull-up resistor between OUT and 3.3V.Problem•\tOn the input (L/N) side, the opto does change:\n\n•\tNo object: \\~0 V\n\n•\tObject present: \\~5 V\n\n•\tOn the output (OUT → GND), it always sits around 2.8 V, with or without object.\n\n•\tIf I disconnect OUT from the GPIO, OUT rises to 3.3 V as expected.\n\n•\tOnce I connect it back to GPIO17, it drops to \\~2.8 V fixed and never toggles.\n\n•\tIn Python, the GPIO input also never changes state.Question•\tAm I wiring this PC817 module correctly for a Raspberry Pi input?\n\n•\tIs a 10 kΩ pull-up from OUT to 3.3 V enough, or do I need a different configuration?\n\n•\tShould I be using a different type of optocoupler module (with proper TTL 3.3V output) instead of this one?Any help, wiring diagram, or tips would be greatly appreciated",

Unstable. Identical current difference and temps to Zero failure #2.I still have all my older Pis that work fantastically well so I'm kind of in shock at this. Issues don't carry over when using the same SD and image from a problematic pi in an identical board so I doubt it's the power supplies.Anyone else having this bad of luck with Raspberry products?!",

      "content_preview": "We know it can be frustrating when a post seems low-effort or like the answer is just a quick search away. But snapping back with “Google it” or sarcasm doesn’t improve anything. It just drives people away and clutters the thread with negativity.Not every post will be for you. Some will be underexplained, missing key info, or break the rules altogether. But instead of arguing, downvoting, or commenting just to vent…Use the report button.Seriously. It makes a difference. The mod team relies on those reports to find and address posts that don’t belong, especially when they’re hard to catch at a glance. So if you want to help keep quality high, that’s the way to do it.Want more thoughtful posts? Be thoughtful in how you respond.Just so there’s no confusion, here are the rules (mobile-friendly version):Be InspiringPosts showing a Raspberry Pi simply sitting in a case, unconnected, or powered on with no unique functionality are not allowed. Share your unique Pi applications, detailing the goals, challenges, and achievements of your endeavors. Let's keep our focus on the innovation and learning that comes from doing. Don't post an image or a screenshot and put a link or details in the comments, link directly or make a self post.Be InclusiveUse English as our common language. Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Approach each interaction with kindness and an open mind. Constructive feedback and encouragement are our tools for building a supportive community. Discouragement, negativity, and trolls have no place here. No NSFW posts, even if they are tagged as such.Be PreparedDo your own research before seeking help. Our community assists with refinement & troubleshooting, not to google it for you or develop your project. Create a detailed self post, this keeps info visible and editable. Include Pi model, components, code & errors (text format, not screenshots), objectives, and describe what's going wrong. No requests for links, tutorials, products, what looks nice, or what to use your Pi for. Let’s collaboratively enhance our understanding.Be CommunityEnhance our community by avoiding personal shopping queries, sales, giveaways, self-promotion, memes, and off-topic content. Our community is not a marketplace or a procurement service. Discussions on products and services should benefit the collective, not personal shopping. Product queries often lead to dissatisfaction over suitability, availability, or cost. Contributors only sharing their own content—without participating in broader community discussions—detract from a collective experience.",

Or should i have one pi each camera? Budget wise or just what will you choose to do in this scenario.Also what camera do you think will suit best here?

They all have ventilation and USB/HDMI holes. I'm powering my Pi through GPIO, it's headless, and wiring will go through M12 panel mount connectors. It also needs to be sealed (not necessarily waterproof since it's in a cabinet) but can't have any openings. I will underclock if necessary to keep the temp down but the load average is quite low to begin with.If anyone knows of plans for such a case, I would appreciate a link.(Also, I know *nothing* about 3D printing or CAD, and will learn someday, but I have briefly dabbled in \"just modify a case to remove the openings\" and have not gotten far).(Also part 2: if anyone is interested, I'm happy to share the configurations and node-red code to read data from a Tohatsu outboard, fuel tank sender, paddlewheel speed sensor and GPS. The boat has no \"traditional\"/analog instrument displays.)",

Let ther/raspberry_picommunity members search for answersfor you!†Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows?Ask your question in the comments on this page,operators are standing by!This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?A:Check out this great overviewQ: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?A:Sure, look right here!‡Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing/freezing, giving low voltage warnings, ethernet/wifi stops working, USB devices don't behave correctly, what do I do?A: 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use aUSB power meteror measure the 5V on the GPIO pins with a multimeter while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card123. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power, test with thestressandstressberrypackages. Higher wattage power supplies achieve their rating by increasing voltage, but the Raspberry Pi operates strictly at 5V. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Phone chargers, designed primarily for charging batteries, may not maintain a constant wattage and their voltage may fluctuate, which can affect the Pi’s stability.You can use a USB load testerto test your power supply and cable. Some power supplies require negotiation to provide more than 500mA, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.Q: I'm trying to setup a Pi Zero 2W and it is extremely slow and/or keeps crashing, is there a fix?A: Either you need toincrease the swap sizeor check question #3 above.Q: I'm having a hard time finding a place to purchase a Raspberry Pi for an affordable price. Where's thesecretplace to buy one without paying more thanMSRP?A:https://rpilocator.com/Q: I just did a fresh install with the latest Raspberry Pi OS and I keep getting errors when trying to ssh in, what could be wrong?A: There are only 4 things that could be the problem:The ssh daemon isn't runningYou're trying to ssh to the wrong hostYou're specifying the wrong usernameYou're typing in the wrong passwordQ: I'm trying to install packages with pip but I keep gettingerror: externally-managed-environmentA: This is not a problem unique to the Raspberry Pi. The best practice is to use aPython venv, however if you're sure you know what you're doingthere are two alternatives documented in this stack overflow answer:--break-system-packagessudo rma specific file as detailed in the stack overflow answerQ: The only way to troubleshoot my problem is using a multimeter but I don't have one. What can I do?A: Get a basic multimeter, they are not expensive.Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?A:Step by step guide for boot problemsQ: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.Q: What model of Raspberry Pi do I need so I can watch YouTube in a browser?A:No model of Raspberry Pi is capable of watching YouTube smoothly through a web browser, you need to use VLC.Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?A: Uh... What?Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things? Can a Raspberry Pi run Pi-hole and something else at the same time?A:YES. Pi-hole uses almost no resources. You can run Pi-hole at the same time on a Pi running Minecraft which is one of the biggest resource hogs. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as \"workload consolidation\" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.Q: Why is transferring things to or from disks/SSDs/LAN/internet so slow?A:If you have a Pi 4 or 5 with SSD, please check this post on the Pi forums.Otherwise it's a networking problem and/or disk & filesystem problem, please go tor/HomeNetworkingorr/LinuxQuestions.Q: The red and green LEDs are solid/off/blinking or the screen is just black or blank or saying no signal, what do I do?A:Start hereQ: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.Q: How can I run a script at boot/cron or why isn't the script I'm trying to run at boot/cron working?A: You must correctlyset thePATHand other environment variablesdirectlyin your script. Neither the boot system or cron sets up the environment. Making changes to environment variables in files in /etc will not help.Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?A:NoQ: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor & keyboard, what do I do?A: Plug in a monitor & keyboard.Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi/Bluetooth from workingA. UsingUSB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interferenceand thePi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions.Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?A.Make sure your cable is wired correctlyand you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 playerswill notwork, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi.Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?A: First, do youreallyneed a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, typevncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080and see what port it prints such as:1,:2, etc. Now connect your client to that.Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?A: A Raspberry Pi is a full computer running Linux and doesn't use special stripped down embedded microcontroller versions of standard Linux software. Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux. Also see question #1.Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it with an Arduino. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi Pico?A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Arduino, a Pico can be used with the Arduino IDE.Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi. Also check question #20 above.Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not.If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?There may be better places to ask your question, such as:r/AskElectronicsr/AskProgrammingr/HomeNetworkingr/LearnPythonr/LinuxQuestionsr/RetroPieThe Official Raspberry Pi ForumsAsking in a forum more specific to your question will likelyget better answers!†See the /r/raspberry_pi rules.Whiler/raspberry_pishould not be considered your personal search engine, some exceptions will be made in this help thread.‡ If the link doesn't work it's because you're using a broken buggy mobile client. Pleasecontact the developer of your mobile clientand let them know they should fix their bug. In the meantime use a web browser in desktop mode instead.",

      "content_preview": "So. I know there are bluetooth speakers out there that have stereo pairing and party mode, but I'm extremely dense, and I would like to stereo pair a pair of bluetooth speakers without that feature built-in.Also, an issue with existing stereo pairing /party systems is that it adds noticeable lag. No issue for music only, noticeably annoying when watching videos on.. laptops, for instance.Some have suggested splitting the analog audio signal into 2 cheap bluetooth transmitters, each paired to 1 device.But, I'm wondering if I could make this into a microcomputer project.So, this device should take the audio signal, split it into the left and right channels, and send each channel into individual bluetooth radios, which will be paired to 1 speaker individually.Questions:Any Pis that can fit multiple bluetooth radios? Based on my untrained eye, existing pis can only fit 1, if at all?I was looking at the analogue route (3.5mm aux in with codec zero & dac+?), but I'm wondering if there's a way to get audio from usb, so I can get both power & audio to the pi with 1 usb cable?How would you do it / how should I get started?Do you think using the Pi as the foundation is plausible? Or should I be looking elsewhere?",
