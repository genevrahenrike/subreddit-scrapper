      "content_preview": "Hi all, I've recently been configuring my Raspberry Pi 3B 1GB as a NAS server and have been trying to get it to connect to my Private Internet Access vpn on startup, however my script is unable to establish a connection. I have tried scheduling it on startup both using systemd and crontab, running variations of \"sudo piactl connect\" and creating other files to verify that the script actually runs and don't know what else to try. According to the official documentation \"Some commands, such as connect, require that the graphical client is also running.\", however even when booting into the GUI the vpn doesn't connect automatically and the command has to be manually executed.TLDR: Is there a way for me to execute \"piactl connect\" without having to ssh into the Raspberry Pi every time it restarts?",

My main goal is to be able tosend and receive SMS messagesdirectly over the LTE network in Canada.I’ve read through the Clipper documentation, but I’m still a bit unsure about the best way to interface it with the RP2040. Some specific questions I have:What’s the recommended way to connect the breakout to the RP2040? UART over AT commands?Are there existing MicroPython or C/C++ libraries that make it easier to handle SMS and data over LTE with this breakout?Has anyone here successfully set up the Clipper LTE with a Pico or another RP2040-based board? Any gotchas with power requirements or SIM compatibility in North America?Bonus: if you’ve tested SMS on Canadian carriers (Rogers, Bell, Telus), did it work out of the box?Any advice, sample code, or wiring diagrams would be super appreciated!Thanks in advance.",

      "content_preview": "So. I know there are bluetooth speakers out there that have stereo pairing and party mode, but I'm extremely dense, and I would like to stereo pair a pair of bluetooth speakers without that feature built-in.Also, an issue with existing stereo pairing /party systems is that it adds noticeable lag. No issue for music only, noticeably annoying when watching videos on.. laptops, for instance.Some have suggested splitting the analog audio signal into 2 cheap bluetooth transmitters, each paired to 1 device.But, I'm wondering if I could make this into a microcomputer project.So, this device should take the audio signal, split it into the left and right channels, and send each channel into individual bluetooth radios, which will be paired to 1 speaker individually.Questions:Any Pis that can fit multiple bluetooth radios? Based on my untrained eye, existing pis can only fit 1, if at all?I was looking at the analogue route (3.5mm aux in with codec zero & dac+?), but I'm wondering if there's a way to get audio from usb, so I can get both power & audio to the pi with 1 usb cable?How would you do it / how should I get started?Do you think using the Pi as the foundation is plausible? Or should I be looking elsewhere?",

At home I have my principal router that's configured on radio channel 13 (it's legal here), and a WiFi extender on Ch 2. Pi can connect with no issues to the extender and not on my principal WiFi. I've changed the localization options in raspi-config, but still cannot connect to the WiFI.The network is visible and the Pi can see it, but just cannot connect to it. Does someone have any idea on how to solve the problem?Thanks!I've installed Raspberry Pi OS 64bit installed with the RaspberryPi Imager",

The reason I say this is because I have a bunch of IOT servers and packages installed that I don’t want to reinstall and do all over again, just looking for a quick transfer.

      "content_preview": "Hey folks. I’ve been experimenting with Raspberry Pi Connect (using rpi-connect lite) and I ran into a snag. I know that if I take an SD card with Connect already configured and move it to another Pi, I normally have to sign in again and generate a new token because the identity is tied to the hardware. To get around that I tried copying over the state.json file, which contains the token and identity information.My goal is to be able to prepare a replacement SD card in advance and have it automatically connect when someone plugs it into a remote Pi, without needing anyone on site to sign in again. I set up a systemd service to copy state.json into ~/.config/con.raspberrypi.connect/state.json on first boot, but now I’m unsure whether this approach will reliably work or if I’ll run into device collisions or other issues. i tried it in our office but I keep getting \"Authentication failed\" and some checks failed.Honestly the reason why I need this to be a plug and play thing is because our device is in another island and it got corrupted reasons we are still investigating. But for now, we plan on shipping the sd card to our local contact and have him insert the SD Card. He doesn't know a thing about pi's. That pi has been running for a year with no problems.Any help/comment is appreciated. I might need to move from rpi-connect and we don't need rpi-connect really, we just want to configure it remotely if issues occur.",

For now, I'll also add it as part of my research/documentation. Each switch represents different buttons on the controller.

      "content_preview": "Hi. So this is for a friend who have a small place for a shop in Paris, France and I suggested him a Raspberry Pi official store. There are very few in the world. Like one in Cambridge I guess. As Raspberry Pi is becoming more popular in the world, we can do lots of cool stuff with it, in atleast one of my project we are using it, having an official store in our city would be really interesting.So anyone from the Raspberry Pi Official community, who can give me some advice, please don't hesitate to come into my DM.. Thanks",

I connected it via Wi-Fi, downloaded all the updates and so on, i2c-utils, etc. From the very beginning, I tried to connect the display directly by plugging it into the display header (I bought a male header at the store) and into the Raspberry Pi. I didn't use solder or any fasteners, I just held it in place and tried to enter the command sudo i2cdetect -y 1 (I also tried using 2 instead of 1, since there is a directory with the same name). However, it didn't work, and perhaps the problem was that it wasn't secured.Then I tried using a breadboard in various ways, inserting the header with a long pin, then a short pin, and inserting wires, but it didn't work.

      "content_preview": "Hi all,i'm using a raspberry pi zero to make an ambient media player. I have the videos preloaded, and using omxplayer (with omxwrapper to pick up gpio inputs when the video is playing) I have it set up to play videos with 2 gpio button inputs for next and previous video.Things worth noting:-due to the shape of the project (small TV) i can't use the aux input easily, so I'm using a 3.5mm AUX DAC adapter, connected to a USB hub. Im using a pam8302 for the ampBut for some reason, when I press either of the buttons, the input is being registered twice and it's skipping videos. it starts with episode 1, but 1 button input will send it straight to episode 3. I'm fairly new to electronics and coding, so I'm not 100% sure how to diagnose the problem and move forward from here. any help would be appreciated.

I've already tried plugging it in directly, but it doesn't seem to respond. I'm using an official Raspberry Pi 5 and the fan is connected to a dedicated connector for the fans. I'm not sure if it's a wiring problem, a software problem, or maybe the fan is just faulty. Any advice would be appreciated! How do you usually test a fan on a Raspberry Pi? Should I try to power it externally or is there a way to check it?",
