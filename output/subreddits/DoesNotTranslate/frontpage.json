Igual que usar todo el rato artículos y adjetivos en femenino para referirme a ellos. Yo había decidido traducirlo como \"tritón griego\" (manteniendo un poco de coherencia con un tritón convencional, a pesar de que el término \"tritón griego\" no existe como tal). Quería saber qué opináis vosotros. ¿Se entiende que me estoy refiriendo a un Siren varón? ¿Tenéis otras sugerencias? Mi amiga sugiere usar \"sireno\" o \"sireno griego\", pero \"sireno\" se refiere más al tritón convencional (merman), no al Siren, y además es incorrecto el uso de ese término.",

To say that you are eating rice from the same pot means you belong in the same organization, such as a sports team or a company. It used to refer to family or people you lived with, but this usage is a bit rare nowadays. Examples: Celebrity A and B will be eating rice from the same pot = They are now under the same management company. Footballer A cheered on Footballer B, who he used to eat rice from the same pot with = A used to be on the same football team as B and cheered on his old teammate. I have a feeling there may be similar words in other languages, actually - humans often bond over eating together after all!",

Now that freaks me out.  It feels like ADHD hyperfocus but triggered by stress instead of interest. Suddenly everything is sharp and I can see connections I couldn't before. Even if I don’t want to see them. I can't seem to find an English word to describe this specific type of anxiety. \"Rumination\" is too gloomy. “Overthinking\" sounds like I'm just spinning my wheels. If there's no word for it, I'm gonna call it \"deepstress\". I’m curious: Is this type of anxiety a relatable feeling? How often do you deepstress? Do you know an English word for this? Heck, does any language have a single word for this? That feeling when you're anxious but it's making you think better instead of worse? Please answer me, those of you who speak a second language other than English 🙏🏻",

It refers to a hypothetical grand coalition government involving all of these parties. It seems like 20 years ago, some political commentator came up with \"Schwarze Ampel\" to describe this potential constellation, and approximately an hour later people began using the shortened form of it. \"Schwampel\" is regarded as such a word that is inherently ugly, humorous, and goofy-looking, so it's amusing whenever some glasses and blazer wearing political analyst can't help but use it in an interview or something. I speculate a reason why it's regarded as so ugly is because it contains \"Wampe\", which is an unflattering term for \"a big belly\" like a beer-drinker might have (although the two 'e' are pronounced differently).",

      "content_preview": "This phrase is used to describe the feature of a text that makes you believe it's not written originally in Chinese but translated. For example, an overuse of nouns (Chinese tend to use verbs), long sentences with clauses(Chinese prefer shorter individual sentences), or unusual cultural metaphors and idioms (e.g. kick your ass) can typically produce this feeling. Note that this does not mean the text is so ungrammatical that it shouldn't be written by any native speaker, but so exotic that a native author won't formulate sentences in that way. Translation tones for different original languages are obviously different. An experienced Chinese reader is able to tell them apart. Conservatively, translation tones are criticized as a violation against the convention of the Chinese language and literature, but some people consider it as aesthetically valuable. Nowadays, when reading a foreign novel, a translation tone is even somehow  expected, like \"that's how people from that country should talk!\". If a Chinese author wants to bring an exotic vibe, he or she will intentionally write in this style (e.g. when telling a story that happens in another country). I didn't find a counterpart in English or other languages. Does this feeling occur when you read a foreign literature at all? What's the very term?",

It is mostly considered a children's prank, assuming something like one watermelon was taken. Basically think of Merry and Pippin stealing Farmer Maggot's crops in Lord of the Rings. However, If you steal foodstuffs with the purpose of selling them, it is referred to as stealing (도둑질) like any other act of stealing. The practice is likely dead in Korea at this point, since very few rural areas would have kids running around by themselves in this day and age. I remember reading about this in the 90s and it already felt like something from a bygone era, especially for a city kid. But the word lives on! +Edited to add the pronunciation",
