      "content_preview": "Trying to order my breast pump through insurance and struggling. I called my insurance company twice (Highmark BCBS) and was on hold for half an hour each time trying to get someone to help me. I was just told to go on my portal and look up medical devices…of course nothing was there and any info about pumps said to call. The other person said she’d send me paperwork and then never did even when I followed up. I’m on yummy mummy and know what I want, but how does this work. My doctor did not give me a script but I did just message her asking for one just now. Do I order on yummy mummy pay the bill for the pump and submit it to insurance? I’m on the website now as I type this and when I got to check out it says I need a script + the pump will be $122. Do I get reimbursed for the $122? I want the “pump upgrade spectra s1”. Or is the $122 the discounted price with the insurance?",

I have a bouncer I could put in the table but my kitchen is smaller so that’s not really my favorite option. I know the stokke and bugaboo giraffe are the most popular but wondering if anyone has had something they loved at a better price point? I’m leaning toward the bugaboo giraffe right now (i prefer the look) it’s just so expensive it’s hard for me to justify it. Hoping to find one second hand before baby comes. And on the flip side - has anyone had either of these or another and found it a waste of money? did you have a high newborn seat and found they didn’t use it or like it? All input welcome, thank you! edit: got it, I won’t put a bouncer on the table",

Went ahead and pre ordered the mini bag as we already have purchased a cooler bag for pumping stuff and bottles and the matching itzy ritzy stroller caddy. However when I was asked today by my husbands cousins wife about what diaper bag we purchased, she scoffed and said it’s clearly way too small for a newborn and all the stuff we need to carry around. I honestly figured that since we are using a separate bag for bottles and pumping supplies, plus the stroller caddy it would be fine. Now I feel it was an inadequate purchase. The large version is available for pre order but wouldn’t get here until quite awhile after the baby is born. Anyone have the mini version of this diaper bag and find it’s enough room? Or should this be a definite return?",

I have no idea what factors to consider now! So that leads me to some questions: Does the anti-rebound bar make much of a difference? Thoughts on a convertible car seat that grows with baby? (My hesitation here is our plan to have more than one and wanting to reuse items - plus I know car seats expire) Do you prefer a seat that fits into a stroller? (Is it true that this position is not ideal for baby? Should I just forget that “necessity”?) Did you go for a lightweight infant seat? If so, what did you pick? This is what I am currently leaning towards. Thanks!",

It’s their first grandchild and they live 15 mins away by car. We (the parents) are planning to buy an uppababy vista. We live in the burbs and I’ll be doing a ton of walking from my house. I’ll also get a crib and bassinet and all the things. For my parents, what would you recommend they purchase. Of course we may purchase on their behalf. Stroller- a more compact version that’s easier to lift? They live in a neighborhood that’s less walkable. Also, if we need to travel somewhere we could use it. Is it important they go with uppababy if we have an uppababy? Would love recs. For sleeping should they just get a crib or maybe a pack n play with an infant / raised insert? They are concerned about their backs. Idk how much I’ll be leaving the kid at their house overnight in the beginning but we will likely need a place to nap over there while I’m visiting. And I’m sure with time we’ll take advantage of them babysitting overnight when the baby is older. Do the gparents just stay at your house when you are gone? Car seat? Thought they could just get another base that works with the infant car seat we buy. Open to anything else that’s important to have at the grandparents house and tips for keeping costs low (I assume 2nd hand purchases)",

I was chatting to a friend about this who mentioned that her first child had a very hard time transitioning from a bassinet to a crib. With her second, she started with a mini crib in place of a bassinet and it made the transition much more simple. Has anyone had similar (or even differing) experiences?

Moms in my life who had their kids 10-12 years ago have highly recommended bedside “co-sleeper” type bassinets. I like the idea of baby being close and easy to see at any time. Unfortunately, from my initial searches, these seem to be less popular today with many of the current models having issues. I’m wondering if there is a unicorn product out there that might meet this criteria: Option for drop-down side (that otherwise locks) to have easy access from bed Sturdy and level, no concerns about tilting Large enough to room share for 6 months (granted I know baby size/growth is variable) Ones I currently have my eye on are Newton and Skip Hop. Also open to Maxi Cosi Iora if it’s not too difficult to maneuver baby in and out from bed, but assuming this would be a challenge without the drop-down.

Cons; seems like there are mixed reviews (people either love it or hate it), and more $$ compared to the Evenflo - Evenflo Revolve 180 + Shyft Intuiti; pros are that it has the 180 rotation, cheaper and soothing lights/music. Cons; the 360 model has an ongoing investigation for detaching from the base when not locked in properly (although I believe that was a few years ago and has since been resolved). Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "Hi r/Buyingforbaby , soon to be first time parent here. It’s come down to the battle of the Joolz for me and my partner. I’ve had a spreadsheet of strollers since before I got pregnant, and both the Joolz check our non-negotiable boxes. They offer a bassinet attachment. They are compatible with our chosen car seat. They have nicely ventilated seats for our Mid-Atlantic spring/summer maternity leave. The weights and widths are acceptable. The reviews say the suspension is good for pavement walking and can handle a few bumps (we’re not planning on off-roading). And we also have a $200 gift certificate for a Joolz retailer. A bit about our lifestyle: We live in a one bedroom townhouse style apartment, so we don’t need to carry it up and down stairs. We live in a suburban area, with walkable distance grocery stores and parks, but we also often drive for other errands, like the pharmacy. It has to be good for these walks and also easy to load into and out of the car (both hatchbacks) for our lifestyle. There is about a 12” (~30cm) height difference between me and my partner. I’m only 5’1” (~155cm) We have two dogs, so we walk outside every day, rain or shine I know a lot of people do not like that the Aer2 does not have a parent-facing option with the seat. Is this a big deal? It also doesn’t have an adjustable push bar. Again, is this a big deal? I just can’t get a sense of it as a first time parent. I’m concerned about straining my postpartum body, which makes me lean more toward the Aer2, which is nearly 7lbs (~3kg) lighter than the Hub2. But the Hub2 seems to keep baby higher from the ground, which feels somehow inexplicably safer to me? And it has a bigger bottom basket, which I like because we typically walk to the grocery store to do our shopping. TL;DR: First time parents want to know if the seat configurations and push bar height of the Aer2 negate the 7lb weight advantage it has over the Hub2.",

Our baby is a large sized 13 month old (90th in weight, 20th in height). She has been standing in her crib for months now, and just took her first steps today. When she stands in the crib, she steps on the sleep sack and kinda hunches over. She cannot sleep without the sleep sack. The two times we tried to put her down without one (due to them being in various stages of laundry) she big-cried until the one was dry. (She’s been sleep trained since 4 months and has had zero trouble otherwise since then). So here’s the thing: she’s going to need the next sized sleep sack soon (the 2-24 month ultimate ones still fits her fine for now, but it’s just a matter of time), and I’m definitely inclined to get another woolino. I just don’t know if it should be a foot-style one or another sack. Any thoughts?",

Based on research, I know that if we go with Nuna we want one that uses the RELX base rather than the PIPA base, but I don't totally get the different between the Pipa Aire RX and the Pipa RX?",

I was reading about the Uppababy Mesa and a lot of people mentioned issues with chin to chest positioning that caused breathing issues, and there’s even class action lawsuits over the design of the mesa max and V2 due to its ‘C’ shape. Does anyone know if this issue has been solved with the V3 release?",

I'm so frustrated as I have an upcoming trip. Does anyone know of any universal board that would work? Thank you",
