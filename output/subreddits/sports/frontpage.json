      "content_preview": "Borderlands 4 is here. And Kairos? It’s a prison world with no warden, just a dictator playing god.You’re not here to fix it. You’re here to f*** it upWelcome to KairosKairos is your new playground — if your idea of a playground is a war-torn hellscape full of ancient secrets, freaky wildlife, and factions that want you dead.Don't forget to stop and take it all in... Well, don't stop for too long. Something on Kairos will probably eat youAt the center of it all? The Timekeeper — a soft-spoken megalomaniac with a god complex and the surveillance tech to match. You’ll fight for survival, freedom, and a shot at something bigger.You’ll explore four distinct, seamlessly connected regions:The Fadefields: Rolling hills terrorized by the Idolator Sol, a conduit of the TImekeeperTerminus Range: An unforgiving frigid peaks occupied by the Augers and experiments of Vile LictorCarcadia Burn: Shattered wasteland ruled by the Ripper Queen, CallisThe Dominion: the Timekeeper's impenetrable fortress cityThere’s a lot to take in — and even more ready to take you down. So come prepared.PLAYABLE VAULT HUNTERSIn Borderlands 4, you’re a Vault Hunter: a badass mercenary wreaking havoc with devastating abilities and gunning for your freedom with wild weaponry as you hunt for alien Vaults. Nothing too serious.In Borderlands 4, you are the chaos. Pick from four new Vault Hunters — each with a unique playstyle, three unique Action Skills, and their own personality and backstory.Vex had a rough upbringing that was made more complicated by receiving her Siren powers. Her cynical and sarcastic demeanor comes from having to fend for herself and scrape for everything she's got. But underneath her salty exterior, Vex is an empath who knows better than anyone how much life can suck. Ever the pessimist, Vex still believes in helping others. And if helping others means dealing damage to oppressive jerks. Each of Vex's looks is a middle finger to the TimekeeperRafa was born and raised in microgravity, which severely altered his bone density and musculature, making it impossible for him to survive elsewhere. Desperate to explore, he signed up to Tediore's military force. In exchange for a tour of duty, his body was altered for a new kind of exo-suit. But when it became clear Tediore never intended to end his service, Rafa went AWOL. Now he's on the run and plans to enjoy whatever time he has left before his Tediore Deadframe ends him for good.Amon was raised in a Vault monster-worshipping cult—until the Vault was opened and the creature turned on everyone he loved. As the only survivor, he dedicates his life to finding and killing as many of these beasts as he can. Amon, a warrior-poet, is introspective and unflinching to his duty, but despite his hardened appearance, he has a warm attitude, often regaling comrades in arms with stories and advice earned throughout his travels.Harlowe is a former Maliwan combat scientist, driven by the need to understand how things work. While this initially made her an outcast amongst her Traunt relatives, Harlowe has used her intellect to bring new tech and gadgetry to the battlefield as a Vault Hunter. Harlowe's brilliance is apparent in everything she does, but so is her enthusiasm and love for life. Harlowe brings everything to the fight, including her sunny disposition. Always ready to give a beat down, her spirit can't be beat.As a Vault Hunter, you better be ready to embrace chaos and live in that grey space between death and oppression. Lucky for you, you’ll have allies and adversaries to push you along.Friends & the FascistYou won’t survive alone — but you won’t like all your company, either.The Timekeeper is the well-mannered and disturbingly calm tyrant who rules over the prison planet of Kairos. Obsessed with order, he uses cybernetic implants to watch over and control his citizens.Claptrap is back in Borderlands 4. No, we don't know why. He just keeps showing up. Help?Zane, a semi-retired hitman turned Vault Hunter, is equal parts cocky and charismatic. He treats every fight like a job and every job like a joke, but he'll always have your back when it counts.Defiant Calder is an Auger whose sense of justice far out-measures his stature. Both boisterous and resourceful, Calder laughs in the face of danger and is determined to see the end of Timekeeper's reign over his people.Break Free.Kairos is a prison. You’re the riot. Blow the locks off this place and show the Timekeeper what mayhem really looks like.Borderlands 4 is up for pre-order nowon PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam & Epic).Pre-OrderDeluxe Edition Pre-OrderSuper Deluxe Edition Pre-OrderGet Excited:Welcome to KairosWatch the TrailerWatch the Gameplay Deep Dive",
