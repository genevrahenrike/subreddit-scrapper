      "content_preview": "In this post, I'm trying to speculate on the nature of the gods in Campaign 4. The below post will include spoilers for Critical Role up until campaign 3 (including Exandria Unlimited ) and will also extensively discuss Brennan's work on d20, specifically Fantasy High , A Crown of Candy , and The Unsleeping City . It will also discuss what we know of campaign 4 from the announcement videos and Brennan's fire side chat. First: What do we know about these gods already? There are seven \"shapers\" who created this world who were slain by mortals in a terrible war. Brennan describes them in a roundabout way in his Fireside Chat, saying that in some ways they kept the world in stasis and part of the spark of the revolution was the human need for change (a need Brennan equates with air). He says there is no partisan division between them like on Exandria, meaning an evil god of death might be buddy buddy with the sun god. More speculatively, Brennan says this setting can be seen as an ode to orcs, their role as the victims of Sauron, and the heroism they could have had in rebelling against him. This is enlightening, because Sauron used his supernatural powers to dominate the orcs, directing them to whatever ends he pleased. This domination was not a total telepathic control, but controlled more through a deadening of the will of his victims and a controlled invocation of their fear and hatred. If Brennan is comparing a potential revolution against Sauron with the revolution against the Shapers of Araman, is it possible the Shapers influenced all the races of this world like Sauron did? Are they dominating their minds, controlling their emotions, and imposing auras of fear to whatever ends suit them best? Are they Shapers of the world, or the Shapers of the wills of those in the world? Second: What do we know about Brennan Lee Mulligan? We have a lot of data to run on how Brennan thinks about the gods of his D&D settings. Here are some opinions on this topic throughout his work that I've seen With the gods, \"as above, so below:\" All of Brenann's gods that I know of gain their power and their being through the belief of their worshippers, much like the characters in Neil Gaiman's American Gods . This is a huge point in all seasons of Brennan's most popular show, Fantasy High , where belief can create new gods, kill them, erase the memories of existing gods, turn them into entirely different creatures, or grant them the biases and politics of their worshippers. Sometimes this manifests from one cleric of great faith, or from a coordinated effort over thousands of years to formulate a doctrine. This line of thought returns in The Unsleeping City where Heaven and Hell are created in the dream realm by the collective dreams of the millions who believe in them and the ability to translate dreams to magical power is a major plot point. We also see this belief playout in a more minor way Exandria Unlimited: Divergence , which I only mention because Brennan says \"so above, so below\" explicitly in describing how the gods resemble their worshippers in that series' last cooldown. Gods Are Unreal: Speaking of The Unsleeping City , the whole thrust of that show is that the power of Heaven, Hell, fairies and the world of dreams is that they are not actual, but potential. That means they can be anything to anyone and take a different form to each person. The problem comes that if a powerful dream enters the real world, to become real, it must take one form. This forces the millions who shared the dream as something specific to them now are forced to conform their thoughts and dreams to this one, true form that comes into the world. The latter process turns out to be the villain's plan to control New York City. If this all sounds familiar, it's because it is also exactly what happens at the beginning of Downfall . The gods were amorphous beings that could take a thousand forms in the realm beyond the real, but once Tengar is destroyed and they enter Exandria, they painfully are forced into one form they are locked into forevermore. Gods Are Basically Warlock Patrons By Another Name: This is the major theme of A Crown of Candy . The big twist in the lore of the season is that the clerics of setting are basically the same as Warlocks and Wizards, and that the God and Devil of this setting are like giant balls of floating energy people can siphon power from. There is no divine agent granting miracles upon the worthy, you just got reach your hand into the unknown and pull out power hoping for the best. I kind of thought this was a one-off thing for the setting, but in Brennan's D&D Q&A video for Wired, he mentioned that he thought that Clerics and Warlocks were different only in aesthetics. Third: What happens when you combine all of these ideas? So let's combine all of this. Let's say the Shapers of Araman follow these three aspects of divinity Brennan has tapped into in earlier campaigns. They are beings connected to the unreal, but they are not supreme, no more moral than any Warlock patron, and shaped by human belief. Now, let's combine what we know and suspect about the gods of Araman from Brennan's words about the setting. Okay, the Shapers are beings who keep the world in stasis and are related to mortals the way Sauron is related to orcs. That is, they control the minds and emotions of mortals for their own purposes. If these are immoral creatures whose very being is determined by the minds of mortals, perhaps the reason they refuse to let change happen is because such a change in the minds of men would lead to one of their number changing into something else or perhaps flat-out ceasing to exist. Like the pantheon in Aeor, the Shapers may have violated the sovereignty of mortals in order to save their own. I suspect they may have overreached, directly dominating a large group of people to eliminate some idea or heresy that would have changed one of their number. This too tracks with Brennan's prior interests; the development of doctrines and heresy play a major role in both A Crown of Candy and the second season of Fantasy High . In terms of what type of god this heresy might have been, I would guess the god would be the closest in the pantheon to a dark lord or villainous god. Perhaps a god of darkness, death, lies, secrets, or something else traditionally associated with villains. Whatever idea the gods stamped down on may have had to do with taboos on dark magic, which would play into the rise of warlocks in the setting. TL;DR The gods of Araman subtly mind control people so they'll keep believing them, then everyone turned against the gods when they overtly used mind control to keep one of the gods from changing for the better.",

A)  After a few back-and-forth rounds with a warrior I remembered I had a reaction ability (2024 Monk).  I used Deflect attack to try to reduce any incoming damage.  I managed to reduce the Sword's damage to exactly 0 (Whew) And was willing to spend the Focus point redirect the attack back at the attacker, who failed their DEX save (Whew again) and just managed to take him down. B)  \"This is getting ridiculous. Looking at the slashes and blood covering my body.  I grab the wrist of the hand wielding the sword as I sidestep the stab. With my other hand I give his arm a sharp strike to the inside of his elbow then quickly take that hand put it on the butt of his sword and push the blade into his chest.  Seeing the shocked and confused look on the warrior's face I inform him the fight is over, and he lost.\"  === DM \"The warrior falls and your fight ends. Nex turn my first action was Heightened Focus Patient Defense for the much-needed 2D10 (7) Temp HP. (Should have done that earlier)",

Like, what’s the issue? I wanna preface with the fact that I love daggerheart, I bought and played it with my friends and it’s a great system. I also love dnd. So I don’t understand why people are acting this way about their system choice. Does the system really affect things that much for people? dnd or daggerheart, the method of storytelling is fundamentally the same both ways despite the mechanical differences. Also, Critical role is a media company. their aims are a bit beyond being nerdy ass voice actors who play dungeons and dragons. They’re gonna do what they’re gonna do, and plus, the story’s probably gonna be cool either way. Now I don’t think they should have done one system or the other, either one would have been cool. So I really mean no hate, i’m just confused. why is this a big deal? help me edit: okay i understand it. parasocialness aside, I see the issue but the seriousness of it was blown so out of proportion from the comments ive seen that i assumed it was a bigger deal than it actually probably is i’m going to bed now. peace and love",

      "content_preview": "I do not intend to express any hatred; I am simply curious and would like to hear other people’s opinions. I began watching long ago, back when the show was streamed on Geek and Sundry . I honestly do not even remember why I started watching that Twitch channel, but I had difficulty engaging with the show until the Briarwood arc. At that time, I had no prior knowledge of Dungeons & Dragons—I only understood it as a tabletop role-playing game where one rolls dice. However, once the story became more engaging, I subscribed to both the Twitch channel and the official website. I thoroughly enjoyed the ending and, in fact, most of the first season. Season two required several attempts—three or four, to be precise—before it drew me in. Over time, however, the story became increasingly compelling. Although it felt lengthy at moments, it was ultimately very rewarding, and I managed to watch the entire campaign. With season three, however, I have struggled. Despite repeated attempts, I have never been able to fully engage with it. I do not want to skip episodes, as that feels unfair to the story, but I simply cannot seem to connect with it. As a result, I eventually returned to watching season one instead. Exandria Unlimited with Brennan was an excellent experience, which is why I wonder if I am alone in these feelings. It does not seem so, yet I also do not want to criticize without a valid reason. Should I give season three another chance? Does it perhaps take ten to fifteen episodes before it becomes more compelling? Perhaps this difficulty lies with me. I know the cast is playing a game and enjoying themselves, and we are fortunate that they broadcast it for free. Nevertheless, I feel that something about the experience is different. Perhaps it is simply that we are all aging and our tastes inevitably change. In any case, I sincerely thank you in advance for your comments and perspectives.",

Lilliana being funneled by Ludinus!< I've been thinking for a few episodes about her situation. Leaving her behind to spy on Ludinous was a reasonable decision. Thanks to that, BH've got info about the meeting with the Unseelie. However I noticed during that arc, Hells did not plan much in regards to Temult's situation. Let's say you were Luda. Your enemies sabotaged your 'secret' meeting. The most reasonable course of action would be to locate how the information of that got leaked . Assumptions that Daleth would be smart enough to know of Temult's shaken loyality long before, aside. Lack of communication with Liliana before commitment to the assault, to give their Spy time to evacuate before she is in hot water, is partial reason our characters of interest were in that situation. Hells had information before that Snowdinuses have means to communicate with original with that pearl on their forehead. Which Matt specifically pointed out during their fight (during Ashton's hdywtdt). Hence NotLudoMcgillicutty was aware of the sabotage. At some point (back in FeyWild iirc) there was an unknown check asked of Laura - 18, which I assume was in regards to Imogen's mother deception/stealth. A high roll, but not neccessarly succeding. It's quite possible only because of that Luda waited with elimination of her. Who knows what would happen with nat 1. No shade against the cast. Sessions were like once a week. Only superattentive viewers(maniacs) and/or catch-up crew who consumed those episodes in a span of few weeks, would have kept such things in mind. It's completely reasonable they might have forgot about it during breaks. Such details and plans of action are things worth to keep in a todo list for the game, but it does not protect from forgetting to check it. We know at least one person at the table had that story aspect in mind. DM. The cliffhanger left us with slight possibility that the funneling was still in progress. My guess it's about 30min left of the process. I have avoided spoilers in regards to Temult's fate and I really hope they will catch up before the story reaches a bad ending. It's honestly still quite possible absorbtion of an exaltant was still part of the plan, regardless of Liliana's loyalty. I am still looking forward to the next time I'll be able to watch the rest of the campaign. Regardless of recklessness, This is a really interesting tension in the story and wonder how it's gonna resolve.",

      "content_preview": "Almost every post about Brennan DMing has a number of comments about \"I don't know if he can handle a full length campaign\". This is based on Dimension20, where the pace and storytelling is build around fitting arcs into 20 episodes, or 10, or 4. It's also edited heavily, chopping out a lot of idle table stuff, likely 20-30 minutes an episode if not more. Even then, Fantasy High is 60+ episodes over all the seasons, they're at level 15 now, and they have a season left at some point, bringing them likely to an 80-85 total, which is totally reasonable for a long term campaign using milestone levelling at a quicker pace than XP. For reference, NADDPOD season 1 was 100 episodes, 1-20 and it didn't feel rushed at all. Long form campaigns don't have to go on for 150 sessions and still be reasonable. A few things you might not know if you're only familiar with EXU or surface level D20: Brennan has been doing this since he was like 9 or 10. It was 20+ years of regular DMing in long term campaigns before he even appeared on camera playing TTRPG. He's finished multiple long term campaigns over the years. He recently finished his 10+ year home game. D20 is the outlier here. Like Matt, he was a forever DM until actual play gave him an opportunity to get back to the table as a player. He's got a screenwriting degree, worked and volunteered at a LARP camp, and taught improv. He's a massive fantasy nerd. Siobhan said he was built in a lab to DM. Over his body of work, he's proven he can adapt to tone, he's not always the big personality, move fast DM. HIs character work can be subtle and meaningful (he plays parents really well). Combine all of this and there should be little doubt that he can do the CR style justice (with his own flavour). Worlds Beyond Number, his podcast with Aabria, Lou, and Erika, all of whom should be familiar faces to CR fans, is a masterclass in longer form storytelling. It's different than Critical Role, for sure, but if you want an example of something that tonally shifts away from D20 and shows his fantasy world building chops, it's there. It's also just plain awesome.",

Or someone is doing a completely over the top accent. (Thank you Liam for not doing that) It is understandable that they won't fly in actors from abroad for a little extra role in a TV show. But now we have a different case. Since it is voice actors and there is a huge scene of voice actors in Germany (because of dubbing kind of everything and audio books being popular etc), it should be fairly easy to find a highly professional German VA's, who speaks fluent English for the English parts and can record in a professional studio for a price that I imagine should be comparable to the ones of their US counterparts. So all that being said, do we have any info on German voice actors for mighty nein? Or any info of VA's for main Zemnian roles (apart from Caleb obviously)? Edit: changed VO to VA, since that's what I meant to say. Also since it seems I expressed myself confusing: The flying in was an argument why they don't use actual Germans for TV shows and movies. For voice acting this is a pro since the German voice actors can record in studios in Germany, as I mentioned.",

      "content_preview": "EDIT: Just after making this post, I discovered a quote on the \"what is campaign 4\" thread, that makes me feel even more certain about this theory. I'll drop it, as an introduction: \" a question hangs over Aramán: without the Gods, what great deeds now fall to us? \" Hiya folks. I'm very excited for BleeM to go wild with the new world of campaign 4. Especially since this will be the first cr campaign I can follow live as it happens. So I'd like to throw my two cents in, and take a guess at what inspired Brennan's naming of \"Aramán\". No spoilers for anything CR related, but spoilers for Tolkien's \"Silmarillion\". The second I heard that name in the trailer, a little bell started ringing in the back of my head. And that's because Araman is a place in Tolkien's world, too. A frozen, desolate place, on the shores between the icy northern sea, and the mountains that wall of Aman, the land of the Valar (the \"gods\" of middle earth, and the whole world of Arda). So it's right outside the \"blessed realm\" where the gods live. It is also the way the Noldor (the high elves) use, when they forsake Aman. The elves used to live in Aman, amongst the gods, for ages of bliss. But they left, against the will of the gods, and headed to Araman, to cross into the \"real\" world of middle earth. To make it even more clear, the gods send a messenger to Araman, to \"pronounce Doom\" over the elves, should they not return and ask for forgiveness. (Which some do, but those are never told of again. They continue to live in stasis with the gods. while the rest go on to die and suffer and create new realms and new wonders) And to close my case, you can look at the Quenya (high elves language) name Araman: it translates to \"outside the blessed realm\". The \"blessed realm\" being the physical place where the gods resign on earth. I think this would be a very fitting namesake, considering everything we know so far about the setting. Especially since Brennan already talked about how much Tolkien is an inspiration to him. Hope this explanation all makes sense, and fits here. Or maybe I'm just being crazy, digging up obscure lore. But I think not.",

Much to her shock, Delilah and Sylas Briarwood treat her with the utmost care—almost like a daughter—as she recovers within the relative safety of her own childhood bedroom. On edge and suspicious of their motives, Cassandra adapts to survive while processing the trauma of her family’s demise and Percy’s abandonment. The Briarwoods delight in parading Cassandra around the city in an attempt to convince the despairing populace of their benevolence. Instead of becoming their paragon of obedience, Cassandra unwittingly becomes the guiding light of the rebellion attempting to rescue Whitestone, particularly in the eyes of her childhood friend and rebel leader, Archie. Cassandra vows to do whatever she can to help her beloved home, but are the ghosts of her past powerful enough to overcome the ghosts in her present, or will the Briarwoods’ brainwashing drown out all reason? \" The graphic novel comes out March 10, 2026",
