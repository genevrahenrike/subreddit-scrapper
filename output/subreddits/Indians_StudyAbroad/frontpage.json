The reason I ask which country is because you need to know the local language to make it easier to land jobs.

I’m trying to decide between the two, but I’m a bit stuck. My_qualifications: I'm a BBA graduate, have done 2 internships, have a few certifications like Excel, Business Intelligence and Financial Modelling. My main concern is the job market in Australia after graduating. For those of you who’ve done either program (or know people who have), how’s the job scene currently for international graduates in finance/Business analytics/management? Are employers valuing one university over the other in the finance sector? How tough is it right now to land a role in Australia after completing these degrees? Any insights on networking opportunities or internships from these unis would also be super helpful. At last, would the MIM be of any use if I come back to India after the course, in search of jobs? Would really appreciate any advice or firsthand experiences. Thanks in advance!",

UTS feels a bit too expensive so I might drop it, but I’m confused between RMIT (Melbourne) and QUT (Brisbane) . I’ve got some friends in Brisbane so I am inclined towards QUT, but my main concern is jobs after graduation. I’ve heard both RMIT and QUT are good with work-integrated learning, but where do you actually get better opportunities? Does Brisbane have enough good companies for AI/tech or is Melbourne the safer bet? Also, how much does networking actually matter? From what I’ve read, RMIT has stronger industry links. If I study at QUT, would it be harder to apply for jobs in Melbourne/Sydney later, or is it still manageable? Do you think I should just stick with RMIT, or is QUT equally good? And is UTS worth reconsidering just because of its ranking, despite the high cost? Another thing – people say competition is tougher in Melbourne since there are more students. Is that true, or not really a big factor compared to the opportunities? Aso, I heard Brisbane (QUT) makes it easier for PR. Should I factor that into my decision? Lastly, how realistic is it to cover living expenses with part-time jobs in Melbourne vs Brisbane? my_qualifications: BTech in CSE from a tier-2 college",

I’ve started researching universities, but I’m getting overwhelmed with the application requirements and documents. Things like: Apostille / legalization of documents Which transcripts/certificates are usually needed How to prepare recommendation letters and SOPs Deadlines for different countries (seems to vary a lot) Scholarships for non-EEA students I’m finding it confusing to piece all this together since every university/country has slightly different processes. If anyone here has gone through the process (especially from India → Europe), I’d really appreciate guidance on: -Which documents to prepare first (so I don’t miss deadlines). -Whether apostille is needed for all universities or only specific countries. -Any tips to manage multiple applications without getting lost. I’d be grateful for any help, resources, or even your own experience 🙏 Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, I’m an international student on an F-1 visa and I’ve hit an unexpected problem while applying for a Social Security Number (SSN) here in the U.S. My given name (AAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBB) on my passport is quite long - over 16 characters - but the SSN application portal only accepts up to 16 characters in the First Name field. I’m unsure if I should: Let the system truncate my legal given name to fit, Split my full given name so the excess spills into the Middle Name field (First name -AAAAAAAAAA, middle name -BBBBBBB (or) First name -AAAAAAAAAA BBBBB, middle name -BB) , Or use an abbreviation (which might not match my legal documents). Based on some research, the Social Security system in the US only allows a maximum of 16 characters per first and last name field in digital records, though up to 26 characters can appear on the SSN card when combining first and middle names on the card’s first line. The staff cannot override this at an in-person appointment. Questions for others who’ve been through this: Did you let the system truncate your given name? Did that cause problems later (with the DMV, employers, IRS, etc.)? Was splitting the given name between first and middle name fields an issue for identity verification? Any advice for keeping your identity consistent in government/official U.S. systems? Is there a way to add an explanation or note about the name truncation, or is it just something you have to live with? Would really appreciate hearing your experience or suggestions, especially if you had a name mismatch later! Thanks for your help! my_qualifications",

By the time I retried, the session expired. When I refreshed and tried again, it took me back to the beginning where I had to fill all my details again. So I logged in with the username and password I had received on Gmail, but it now says \"account not activated\" . If I try to register again with the same details, it shows my Gmail is already in use. Basically, I’m stuck in between — can’t log in, can’t register, and the payment didn’t go through.

      "content_preview": "Hi I'm an international student from India (and have completed my Bachelor's from the US). I have been accepted into the MSc Physics program at KIT (Winter semester 2025/26). I would also like to note that I am quite burnt out from the 4 years of my undergrad degree in the US. Do note that I do not have any knowledge of the German language nor have I started looking for any accomodation Also note that the visa process does take quite some time so I may be arriving late if I choose to go for this Winter semester. I have several questions regarding the same; Is there an option to defer my admission to the Summer semester of 2026? (I will contact the university too, but I was curious whether someone else had a similar experience/answer) Would it better to apply for the Summer intake? I will ideally be using this time to learn as much German as I can and do some online courses to upskill myself. (This question is in my head because I do not know whether or not a 6 months gap will be seen as detrimental to the admission office) Would not accepting the current admission offer for the Winter semester, and then applying again for the Summer semester impact my application at that time? (either positively in that I had been accepted once, or negatively in that I did not accept the offer) If I don't accept the offer and choose to reapply for the Summer semester, should I inform the admissions committee about my reason for not choosing this offer right now? (feeling unprepared, taking the 6 months gap to study German) Overall, would it wise for me to forsake the admission offer I have received and apply for the Summer intake now? Any help and clarification would be very much appreciated, I'm getting very anxious about this entire situation! my_qualifications: [For additional context, my undergraduate grade in the German system is 2.1, and I do not have any research experience]",
