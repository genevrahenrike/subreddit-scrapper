Here's the link: https://forms.gle/aeHAUHiYzAgmKiXi8 It's truly short (5 minutes at max), completely anonymous and strictly for academic purposes. Your participation would mean a lot!! The more responses, the better the data! Feel free to share it with other players too. I sent it on r/leagueoflegends but I didn't get enough responses there so now i'm having to go to EVERY champion subreddit. That said, would you consider taking a moment to respond, please? PS: Some people have been asking if they’ll be able to see the results, and yes, you will! Once it’s done, I’ll make a post on r/leagueoflegends and share the link in every champion subreddit.",

Would anyone be interested in watching a stream or VOD of the journey, no idea where I'll get to but with the lack of Leona otp or mains that steam I thought it could be a place for us all to learn from each other and help watch other out.

I always had Leona in my champion pool but was never trying to learn her, was just going full golem and charging at first sight ngl Tho recently I really tried to play smart, but story short my 2 most played supports are Ahri and Sona so I kinda feel like trying to master the opposite element of my playstyle, I get the law of all in lvl 2/3 and find it funny and most of my laning phase is usualy going well, but in long games (30min+) i feel like my pressure is going down and my utility as well So do you guys have any tips for the decision making and mechanical elements to outplay for mid/ late game ? I try to do the E + R combo but the R never land right #skillissue x) For the stuff, nothing new, solari + armor/ tenacity boots + knight vow if adc good + despair and then i adapt the build to the ennemy team",

      "content_preview": "Recently i've been following some niche content creators and i noticed a thing, Leona literally has no dedicated content creator (yes, we dont count I0ki). I've seen otp korean channels for even the most forgotten champions, ike zyra, lissandra, or even for new champions like ambessa. And when it comes to main support YouTube channels, there is only for enchanters in general, but i',ve seen dedicated soraka, janna, sona ones. As for engagers i already saw Braum and Thresh otp as well. There is some very famous players like Polypuff for bard mains and Alicopter for Alistar. If you wanna watch taric, there is lightrocket 2. Pyke? There is a lot of pyke mains channels. There is even a guy that mains lulu top. But Leona literally doesnt have nothing of this. And it sad that the only thing that we have that may come next to an otp channel is I0ki's one. That for me is a support version of Professor akali and Zwag (if you dont know them, they are two clickbaiters that farm views stomping bronze players saying they are high elo). If you guys know someone that plays religiously leona or engane champions at least, tell me.",

      "content_preview": "Hello! I am new-ish to league and have been playing since November (probably like a lot of people who watched arcane). I've had friends helping me learn and I've really taken to Leona! I love her so much, she's so fun. I've gotten her combos down, and I spent a ton of time learning laning, items, when to engage (more like when not to amirite), etc. I imagine it was like having a dog barking and constantly pulling on the lead for my poor ADC main friend 😂 but we made it through. Im looking for any recommendations of streamers/clips/players to watch to help me learn how to play Leona better. I've found that I'm not a game changer, as in I'm almost entirely dependent on my ADC being average or better. I want to help us win! but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong so I'd love to watch someone who is very good play 🙂 Thanks for any help!",
