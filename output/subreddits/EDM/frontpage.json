      "content_preview": "Unity: Insomniac & Tomorrowland I’ve seen some other posts and reviews but I really do want to add my own. WHO SHOULD SEE THIS SHOW? First and foremost who is this show for? I would say the primary demographic is longterm ravers especially those who love Progressive House and that golden era in the 2010s. But there was also plenty of newer and even older stuff. In regard to actual music I would say the only genre NOT played was probably Hardstyle. There was Dubstep, D&B, Trap albeit not too much. A lot of the music is remixed and blended together while in sync with the visuals (more on that later) and of course the orchestra which was incredible. Though they only seemed to play for the Tomorrowland sections. So the main demo is true ravers it is also very much a show that I think anyone could enjoy. I ended up talking to some guys while getting water right before it started and they had no idea what they bought tickets to. They said they kind of knew Eli Brown but had no idea there was going to be a whole show leading up to it. Just something I found funny. THE SHOW ITSELF The show ebbs and flows from different songs and landscapes with a period for more Tomorrowland esthetic and Insomniac history. My wife loved the Insomniac parts much more than Tomorrowland but that’s obviously her bias because she has gone to Insomniac events for over a decade now. I don’t want to spoil too much but I’ve seen the Postcard from Earth show which is only about 45-50 minutes and while good it is every short. This being a solid 2 hours with then a hour DJ set after is far more worth the money IMO. SEATING We sat in section 309 and I feel for the sphere it really is better to have a seat to really take in the full visual experience. The chairs are pretty comfy though if you are a bit tall like me you will want to stand or half sit with the seats raised up and leaning against it. One big word of advice is if you want the true visual experience DO NOT BUY TICKETS IN AREAS WITH AN OVERHANG. That is typically after rows 20 in the 100s section and some of the back rows in the 200 section as well. The floor is definitely for those who want more room to dance and don’t mind not getting the full scale of visuals. Turning your head up for so long is going to bed tough. UNITY VISUALS I’ve seen more negative that positive which I find very odd. The majority of things were very very good IMO. I will say any actual humanoid looking figure does not look good up close except for those they used actual Motion Capture for. The Mocaps looked amazing especially for a song by a certain Drum & Bass artist. (again trying to avoid spoilers but you could probably just look it up online) For those expecting the same level of scale as Anyma I’m not sure why you would think that. He’s the son of a billionaire who is probably buddies with the owner of the Sphere James Dolan. Also the Anymas team is not the same as Tomorrowlands or Insomniacs.  I will say I wish there was more Mocap stuff because when it was on screen it looked great. CLOSING DJ VISUALS We were there for Eli Brown last night. Big fan and we’ve seen him live a few times most recently at EDC 2024. It does seem like the DJs themselves do not get there own separate visuals and just the default screen from the start with some level of things like color changes fireworks etc but nothing that is very fluid (no Excision, Prydz, Anyma type stuff) This is something that overall is fine but maybe a little disappointing especially for anyone going to see Subtronics and expecting a Cyclops takeover. I don’t think it is going to happen unless maybe he spends the money to do it. So you’re just getting a set from the end DJ and that’s mostly it. GETTING TO THE VENUE…..AND LEAVING Easiest way is from the Venetian. No issues. Leaving the venue DO NOT USE THE SPHERE RIDESHARE AREA. It’s way too crowded empty out to a small street and takes forever to get out. Uber/ Lyft get overwhelmed, and rides just keep dropping. It is much better to walk back to Venetian and get rideshare there. You will save yourself a lot of time. DRINKS, FOOD, MERCH If you want merch get there early and stand in line. There are merch sites on the higher floors with shorter wait times. Drinks/ food is pricey as hell. We just got two waters which are small and you CAN NOT take the cap with you which is very stupid. PRICE We are locals to Vegas and were lucky enough to get our tickets for half price in row 4 section 309. For $150 a ticket I think it was very worth it for what we got. Great sightline for everything including the Orchestra. I think if we paid full price it would be a bit harder to justify. BEST PARTS Honestly everything, great talking to people seeing a lot of variety in older and younger ravers and the genuine excitement that there was. Also after the main show I went to the bathroom and could tell like every single person was high AF and having a tough time keeping it together to use the restroom. Whoever was in the stall fighting for their life near section 309 I hope is alright. Oh this is something that you can definitely enjoy sober as my wife was or…well not. It will definitely enhance the experience and a lot of people in this crowd definitely took full advantage of that. WORST PARTS First, the way this was marketed was terrible. The orchestra is incredible and it took forever to even know if it was going to be a live orchestra or not. That should have been one of the main selling points. The marketing was way too vague. Second…and I hate saying this but Eli Brown’s set is probably the worst I’ve seen. Which is to say still good overall but very mainstream. So many bangers he DID NOT PLAY including; (Deep Down, Drop it Down, Escape from Planet Monday, Love is Free, Gasoline, Pyramid Rave, Feel the Energy, I Got Money, When I Push). I was hoping for something like his 2024 Sterobloom set at EDC. One of my favorite sets of all time honestly so definitely disappointed. Makes we wish I caught Chase & Status instead. I really hope the next DJs go all out. Sara Landry should bring that Hard Techno, Subtronics his heavy bass stuff etc. Oh and third…going to work in the morning was no bueno. THE FUTURE I hope something like this happens again but one thing that I wonder about is the cost to make this happen. Prydz could do something insane and Excision needs to happen. I think a partnership would need to happen though with multiple DJs or partnering with Insomniac would have to happen (Excision, BTSM, Subtronics) as one show or (Prydz, Rezz, Tale of Us) or if people get back into it a Trance/ Psytrance night etc. Oh side note, the main show had so much progressive house due to that golden era in the 2010s but not a single progressive house artist (except Kaskade) is playing? That is a missed opportunity. Hardwell or Armin would bring the damn house down. Make it longer, make more shows overall and make it more affordable.",

      "content_preview": "I would say the ancient theater of Orange, the place is super beautiful, rich in history, and its Positiv Festival is great. I went there three times with my parents, the first time was with Martin Garrix and Justin Mylo in 2023, it was the first time I went to a EDM concert and it's absoulutely amazing. the second time it's was with Kölsch and Carl Cox and it's was also amazing. however, the third time we came, he have mixed feelings about the music. Joachim Pastor and Romain Garcia were amazing (the latter excceded my my expectations), Mind Against and Paul Kalkbrenner were a bit disappointing. Mind Against beginning and end of the set was great but the middle was a bit too repetitive. Paul Kalkbrenner set was also a bit too repetitive in my opinion (i like his music though). Sound quality at this venue is great (although the bass for Mind Against and Paul Kalkbrenner sets were took up too much space on the rest). staff at Positiv Festival are very good and crowd are pretty good. Not EDM, but Olympia and other parisian venues like Bataclan, Le Trianon, L'Élysée Montmartre, Salle Pleyel have also very good vibes when there EDM artists, and staff is very good. For the worst, i would say Amnesia Cap d'Agde (name of the city added to avoid confusion with a nightclub of the same name located in Ibiza). i haven't been here but after hearing the Google Maps opinion on that venue, i decided i would never put a step here. overcrowded, too many people under 18 (I'm under 18 and I am not against festivals being allowed to -18 but this nightclub should be forbbiden to -18 like other nightclubs), and agressive staff. even if my fav artist came here, i would prefer x1000 going to a set by my favorite artist at a festival in the Netherlands, Germany, or Belgium than at this nightclub. In your opinion, what are the best EDM venues and the worst EDM venues?",

      "content_preview": "I've listend to all kinds of EDM over the years. When I was younger, late teens/early adulthood (late 90s/early 00s), I was a Tiesto fan. AVB was starting to become popular, Ministry of Sound was big, techno, trance, I grew up in the 90s, so Eurodance was big, etc. But when I started to go out a lot, mid 00s, house was popular. So I guess I naturally always drift to that sound (I like Axwell, a lot, obviously). Born Slippy is probably my favourite EDM song ever and Teardrop by Massive Attack, there was a time that's all I wanted to listen to. I just love that sound. Anyway, I recently discovered Layla Benitez and think her set at Tomorrowland was fantastic. What is that sound, is that her typical sound (i know they change up their sets for Tomorrowland), but it's particular. House-y, no? It sounds like a lot of the music I listen to on my playlists in Apple Music. Marc Phillipe, Deep Kolis, Solomun ... Am I wrong to think her sound is a little different, not quite House, but close enough. I'm not good with the terms of the different genres Thanks",

I already found other Ukrainian stations with 24/7 EDM (why Ukrainians love EDM so much?) but I will love to listen other stations in other countries. Can you please recommend stations that I can find on TuneIn? Thanks in advance ;)",

(thats when i realised how absurd the lyrics were and payed closer attention). the whole chorus is just the guy going \"then dance\". i don't really know subgenres, sorry! PLEASE help me i need to find this song. it was like a fever dream.",
