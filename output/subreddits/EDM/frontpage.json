      "content_preview": "My husband and I saw Unity at the Sphere last night - we specifically got tickets for this date so we could see Kaskade close it out. Went in not totally knowing what to expect about the show itself (for some reason, there seem to be a lot of negative reviews on Reddit about the visual component of it). Regardless, I knew Kaskade would throw down and that I could not miss seeing him in this venue.The Unity show itself was absolutely incredible from start to finish, with immersive, mind-blowing visuals and pristine song selections, taking you on a nostalgic journey through the history of rave culture and different subgenres of EDM - all complemented by the incredibly talented Tomorrowland orchestra. Crowd and vibes were great - was happy to see most folks there were decked out in rave gear/otherwise recognizable as people “in the scene.” I already would have given the show a 10/10 based on that segment alone.But to have Kaskade step on stage for the last hour and play some of his most iconic songs, clearly recognizable but remixed so exquisitely and seamlessly, elevated this show to one of my top music experiences of all time. He even played a new song that, to my ear, was an instant banger with a classic Kaskade sound. I’m a huge Kaskade fan, seen him many times - at big shows, smaller redux shows, clubs, and at EDC - and in my opinion this will go down as one of his best sets of all time.The only reasons it might not be my favorite Kaskade set ever are 1) it was only an hour long (I’m spoiled to have been to a few of his Bill Graham shows that were 6+ hours), and 2) due to the massive size of the Sphere, it felt like he was really far away from the audience, making it feel less personal/intimate than other shows with comparable or even larger audiences.TLDR: Unity at the sphere is a must-see if you’re an EDM fan, and seeing Kaskade in that venue doing what he does best, and reminding us why he’s the f***ing GOAT, will live in my memory as one of the best and most magical live music experiences of my life.For anyone else who was there, either last night or on opening night of Unity, would love to hear what y’all thought.",

Crowds leaving in the middle of the closing act would agree with me.Any Anyma @sphere opening act is better than Unity’s closing act.The show is not bad overall, but it doesn’t meet the expectations.",

But not cartoon or drawn, like they used pictures from a dissected body superimposed onto each otherI think this song was probably from 2017 or earlierI believe it had vocals, either screams or growls almost, and the synths were kinda trappy.My first thought was Getter but I went through his discography and nothing matched the album art I have in my head.Edit- I FOUND IT!Not sure why I couldn’t find it before but it was Getter after allGetter - Colorblind",

I know Arcane stopped making them because of licensing when Rezz came out with her own line. The Arcane owner originally stated he would still do repairs on Arcane products but has since gone MIA and doesn't respond to website messages or Instagram.I wanted to see if anyone out there that has the Rezz Arcane Goggles (not the glasses) doesn't use them anymore and might be interested in selling them to me?? I miss having them at festivals so much!",
