      "content_preview": "I have been investing $1000 a month into TQQQ on top of my standard monthly investments since Sep 2021, and was up ~85%.  I backtested my portfolio against just investing it into QQQ, and showed that I netted ~$30K more over the same time period.This was always intended to be more aggressive than my standard monthly investment in VTSAX, and VOO and my TSP.Right now, I intend to sit on the ~$110K in my Money Market for the next month or so.   I believe the closure of the de minimis loophole, the suspension of postal service from 25+ countries, and the steady increases to inflation are going to start impacting the market.  (Yes, I saw today's news headline that the tariffs have been deemed not legal, but with tariffs continuing until at least mid-October, I think the markets are going to have a rough fall.)Not sure why I'm posting this, I expect I'll primarily get scolded for timing the market, but this was only ~7% of my holdings in a more aggressive, highly leveraged fund and I thought was time to take the profits.  Will be interesting to see if my thesis holds true, or if I regret getting it out.Interested in what others are anticipating the market to do over the next few months.",

      "content_preview": "$DOLE is currently on a 10% off sale for a non-fundamental reason (a legacy owner unloading all its shares)The legacy owner (David Murdock, ~13% equity owner) passed away in June 2025 at age 102, and it announced a secondary offering at $13.25 this morning (10% discount to 9/3 closing price). The market responded with a 10% decline today.David Murdock (and his family) have no role whatsoever in the business and have long expressed their intent to exit. The sale is taking place right after his passing, timed for a step-up cost basis (tax management) for his heirs.This is a classic 'fake insider' sale that carries negative sentiment, but means little to the business fundamentals. fwiw, McCann family(Chairman) owns 7.7% equity, and hasn't sold a share.For a short-term trade, I expect the market to recover to its level of 9/3 (~$14.7).For a long-term investment, the largest legacy equity owner's exit clears hurdles for many potential owners and opens doors to various opportunities. In the meantime, Dole itself is a fine/profitable business, currently valued at ~6x Ev/Ebitda, and <10x FCF.",

      "content_preview": "For investors interested in a factor tilted portfolio, these two funds seem to be the names that consistently pop up. While it’s not challenging to obtain exposure to a small-cap or value oriented portfolio, having exposure to more than 1 or 2 factors in a single ETF is hard to find outside of these funds. I’ve been debating between which of the two asset managers to go with.Avantis factor tilted ETFs seem to offer slightly more competitive MERs (AVUV 0.25% vs DFSV 0.30%, AVDV 0.36% vs DISV 0.42%). Avantis is also slightly more aggressive in their in their tilts toward small-cap, value, profitability, and low investment. I’m not aware of either of them targeting momentum, although I understand that they try to avoid the pitfalls of index tracked ETF rebalancing. I also understand that Avantis is more flexible with their criteria and includes highly profitable stocks in its SVC even if they aren’t true “value” stocks, while DFA is more purist. DFA and their products have been around for longer and have higher AUM, although these earlier products were mutual funds. I have to credit Avantis with bringing their ETFs to the market first, with DFA mutual funds previously only being available through institutions/advisors. I’m sure Avantis played a role in DFA eventually launching their own subsequent ETFs.While I’m interested in the differences in approaches by these two firms, I’m also more practically interested in deciding which of the two asset managers to go with for factor tilted ETFs. I know that one cannot really go wrong with either fund, but the lower MERs and more aggressive factor tilt have me leaning towards Avantis (AVUV & AVDV) over DFA (DFSV & DISV). Would appreciate any thoughts or to know if I’m missing anything in my analysis.",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys, this is something that's been nagging at the back of my mind for a while and I'm hoping someone here might be able to shed some light on how this works.My current investing plan feels pretty common: while I am young I'm investing heavily into diversified growth ETFs and other riskier assets with the goal of better gains over the next 20-30 years. Then, when it's time to retire I'd rotate my investments into income paying assets like bonds and dividend stocks/ETFs .My question and confusion on this is how do you do that rotation without having to pay an arm and a leg in long term capital gains taxes?For example, let's say I have a portfolio of $3M at the end of my investment journey. I've been investing for 20 years and I stopped buying new assets 13 months ago so everything in my portfolio is long term capital gains. Let's say $500k of that $3m is my money and $2.5M is long term capital gains.If I sell $2.5M of profit in VOO and buy SCHD, when tax time comes around I need to pay (roughly) $450,657.50 in taxes, meaning I only have $2.5M left in assets. I've lost a huge chunk of that next egg.This feels like the wrong way to do this, as a huge chunk of the money you've made is lost to taxes. What am I missing here? Is rotating into income not the move? Do I have to do it slowly over time to take advantage of some of the lower tax rates at earlier LTCG volumes? Do I have to choose to be a dividend investor now and forego larger gains now but make up for it in lower taxes later?I know we all have to pay taxes one way or another, but yeeting 1/6th of my portfolio to taxes makes me feel like I'm probably missing something critically important.",

Both numbers matched economist expectations, thoughthe annual pace marked the biggest rise since February.Meanwhile, US consumer sentiment declined to a three-month low as consumers in a University of Michigan survey suggestedthey expect inflation to surge over the next year.But, I don't think \"The Markets\" really cares about -inflation-.  Rather, increased inflation means less chance of a Fed rate cut, which is -really- what Mr Market wants to see.In fact, in my role as Curmudgeon here, I'd say that for most of this year, eight months so far, any fundamental news is pooh-poohed in its own right, and ONLY given any value if it, two or three steps removed, increases the odds offinding the Holy Grailgetting another rate cut.There's got to be more to The Economy than the next Rate Cut./rant",

There’s little reason to replace or reduce it if the goal is broad market growth.For investors who want to add a dividend tilt, a more practical approach is to supplement with something like SCHD rather than switching out of VOO. This way, you preserve broad exposure while gradually incorporating more mature, dividend-paying companies.In practice, VOO can remain the “core” allocation, while SCHD can be built up slowly with new contributions as a smaller satellite position. This balances long-term market growth with a layer of dividend stability, without triggering unnecessary taxes or overcomplicating the portfolio.",

In an interview with Fox Business, Trump didn't dismiss the possibility of a recession, saying that there will be a \"period of transition\".

      "content_preview": "Everyone piling into “September rate cut” bets is ignoring the actual data and listening to wishful thinking. The Fed isn’t going to hand out a cut just because markets want it.The labor market is still holding up. Sure, unemployment has ticked up a little, but it’s nowhere near a collapse. Powell has already said they’ll tolerate some labor pain before even thinking about easing. If you’re waiting for the Fed to rescue every weak jobs print, you’re not paying attention.Inflation is still too high. Core PCE is hovering above 2.5 percent and closer to 2.7 or 2.8. That’s not a victory lap. That’s exactly the range where Powell has said he doesn’t have “confidence” inflation is under control. Cutting now would risk reigniting it and blowing up the last two years of progress.Powell is not a dove. Every time markets get ahead of themselves, he slaps them down. Jackson Hole is coming up, and if history tells us anything, he’ll remind everyone that the Fed is data dependent, not market dependent. Translation: he doesn’t care about your bets.Credibility is everything right now. Cutting while inflation is still running hot and the jobs market is still functioning would make the Fed look weak. They’d rather be accused of holding too long than cutting too early and losing control.History backs this up. The Fed doesn’t pivot on one or two soft jobs reports. Policy lags mean hikes are still filtering through. They know it. That’s why they’ll hold.Bottom line: There’s no cut in September. Unless we suddenly get a jobs collapse and inflation magically melts away, the Fed is staying put. Markets want it, politicians want it, but Powell isn’t going to give it.",

What counts as an “investment?” Is any of this binding?It sounds like a feel-good headline that allows Trump to tout a win, but makes little material difference to Apple’s existing spending. In exchange, Apple gets the tariff exemptions it wants without actually giving up much.From CNBC:https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/apples-tim-cook-convinced-trump-to-drop-made-in-usa-iphone-for-now.html“Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn’t break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple’s suppliers are contractually required to keep the information secret. Apple doesn’t report how much its new campuses in Austin or North Carolina end up costing.Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.Apple said in February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.In Apple’s fiscal 2024, Apple spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses, and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.Teffler said she didn’t think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple’s profitability, especially since it already has existing relationships with the various companies such as Corning.”",

Been researching public benefit corporations in real estate.Found Padsplit, which does affordable workforce housing while giving property owners 2x traditional returns. They focus on essential workers making under 80% area's median income. The model works because it addresses a real market inefficiency - huge unmet demand that traditional developers often ignore.Looking at the numbers, properties average 15-20% returns vs 7-10% for traditional rentals in the same neighborhoods. Lower vacancy, multiple income streams per property, and weekly payments reduce risk. Social impact is measurable, too - residents save hundreds per month and can build credit through payment reporting.For anyone wanting investments that generate alpha while creating a positive impact, this space is worth checking out. Not charity - actual business model innovation. The housing crisis won't be solved by the government or traditional developers. Private market solutions that align profit with purpose might actually work.",

I'm making a decent income (~$15k/month) and I'm looking to put away $3k-$5k a month for the long term. I've been doing my due diligence and I feel like I'm getting a really good deal, but after reading so many horror stories online about other expat plans, I'm getting nervous. Is this a classic \"too good to be true\" situation? 😬 Here’s what I know about the plan so far:No early surrender penalties! My advisor confirmed in writing that I can stop contributions or even pull out my money at any time without a penalty. This sounds amazing.100% of my money gets invested immediately. No initial \"commission period\" where a chunk of my cash disappears. 🤯The annual fee for the default fund (L&G Diversified USD Fund) is only 0.18%. This seems incredibly low.There's a small fixed admin fee of $30.75 per month.I know many of you have strong opinions on plans like Zurich Vista or Futura, but this one seems completely different. Am I missing something huge here? Is there a hidden cost or a clause I might be overlooking? Any insights, advice, or warnings would be massively appreciated! 🙏 Cheers, A Nervous Saver",

      "content_preview": "VanguardVanguard doesn’t think U.S. equities can repeat the last decade’s dominance. Valuations and profit margins are already stretched, leaving little room for another runaway cycle. Their 10-year base case is low single-digit returns for U.S. stocks, versus mid-single-digit returns for developed markets outside the U.S. The reasoning is pretty simple: international equities are cheaper, they pay higher dividends, and if the dollar weakens, that adds another tailwind. Put together, Vanguard expects ex-U.S. to have the upper hand over the next decade.BlackRockBlackRock draws a harder line between short-term and long-term positioning. Over the next couple of years, they’re still overweight the U.S and for good reason. American companies dominate AI, earnings momentum is stronger than peers, and the U.S. system is better at scaling new technologies. That’s why they see the U.S. as the clearer near-term bet.But their broader 2025 outlook is less about business cycles and more about what they call “mega-forces”: AI, climate transition, geopolitics, demographics, and digitization.These are structural shifts that shape where capital flows and which regions come out ahead. When they zoom out to 10-year assumptions, the math flips. They see higher expected returns from non-U.S. equities, both developed and emerging, than from U.S. large caps, largely due to cheaper valuations and better yields abroad.In practice, this creates a paradox-lean into the U.S. today, but build portfolios expecting international markets to take the lead over the decade.Personally I'm still overweight US but I am monitoring ex-us funds too, in particular EU and Japan/China",

      "content_preview": "I'm interested in your thoughts. Context: I'm divorced, age 58, have two college-age kids who have college paid for through a 529. I also have a paid-off home worth about 800K. I don't count that as an investment. I am retired on disability and live on an income of about $130K from disability and also rental income. Not saving anything anymore. I live pretty modestly (in a high COL place).I have a financial advisor but I am also a big believer in asking people who have no stake in it. I am curious your thoughts on my allocation and whether you think it's too aggressive, too conservative or just right. My goal is to spend a little money on travel but also leave money to my kids.Currently I have $1.8 million invested through an advisor. It's about 1/2 taxable money and the other half in a Roth IRA.  It's invested as follow:45% in US equities (funds and ETFs)20% international (funds and ETFs)17% private equity (6 individual companies, 1 fund)17% private debt (funds, 3 different managers)In addition, I have three rental properties that are mortgaged (tenants paying) and I have equity in those of about $650k. The mortgage balances are 960K and I intend to keep them mortgaged and take cash out as I refinance as it's non taxable. I don't have anything invested in fixed income (other than than private debt funds) because I feel like my real estate investments are similar to fixed income. My average ROI right now on the rental properties is about 6%. If I sold the rental properties I would have to pay about $200 in taxes/depreciation recapture so my \"true\" equity is about $450.If you take my real estate holdings into account, my allocation is30% rental real estate46% public equity12% private equity12% private debtOK thank you for reading this VERY long post and if you have any thoughts about shifting my allocation as I go forward, please let me know. Also if you think I should get rid of real estate assets to make things simpler for my kids after my death. (I am healthy but anything could happen LOL)",

      "content_preview": "To make this clear, this idea would not work in strong economies like USA's as local investments are already prioritized. I imagined this idea based on Canada's economy so you could apply it to any ~2 trillions economy.Imagine if citizens could invest without any annual contribution limit in companies based in their own country through a ROTH-like account. This policy could provide multiple benefits: 1.\tStimulate the local economy – Investments go directly into domestic companies, creating jobs, boosting consumption, and supporting innovation. 2.\tIndirect tax revenue for the government – Even if gains are tax-free for individuals, the state still collects taxes through corporate profits, employee income taxes, and sales taxes. 3.\tEncourage long-term investment – Citizens benefit from compound growth, building wealth over time while supporting their own economy. 4.\tStrategic national advantage – Prioritizing local companies strengthens technological and industrial sovereignty, reducing dependency on foreign capital.Yes, investing locally might yield slightly lower financial returns than investing abroad, but the combined societal, economic, and strategic benefits could outweigh the short-term profit difference.",

According to my current e-trade statement, I’ve lost about 15% over this period.I don’t know much, but I’m not sure why to keep these any longer versus putting into something better such as an ETF. I do have various other ETF/MFs across brokerage, 401K and Roth, I’m just confused if there is some reason to keep those and/or why anyone would be buying into them or why they’re highly rated bond funds.Seems like my $5k could have done waaaaaaay more for me over the past decade unless I’m missing something. I was 25 when purchased, way more risk tolerant then.",

I grabbed their latest filings and ran a DCF just to see if the current price makes sense.Revenue went from ~$182B five years ago to ~$371B now, gross profit up 123% to $218B. EBIT nearly tripled to $140B. Net income’s at $115B vs $40B, and EPS is 9.37 TTM. Margins actually improved: gross 59%, operating 33%, net 31%. Pretty wild at that scale.Balance sheet looks fine. Cash + ST investments ~$21B, total assets $502B. Debt climbed (long-term $23B, total $41B), but net debt is –$53B so they’re still sitting on a big cushion. Shares outstanding down 11% from buybacks, retained earnings up to $275B.Cash flow doubled: operating cash $133B vs $65B. Heavy CapEx, likely data centers. Current ratio dropped from 3 to 1.9, liquidity a bit tighter, but ROA 23%, ROCE 34%. Debt/assets low at 0.28, interest coverage ~348. Dividend yield basically 0, but technically there.Valuation stuff: P/S 6.9, PEG 1.67, beta ~1. Ran an advanced DCF (10y projection, 2.5% terminal growth, 8.3% WACC). Fair value came out ~$207/share. Current price ~$211 → basically in line, around –1.9% downside. Feels like the market’s got it about right.(For anyone wondering: I pulled the raw data and crunched the DCF onbretza.comWay easier than setting up spreadsheets.)",

But does that not matter because im willing to ride out the ups and the downs until my mid thirties. And is there anything you want to add?
