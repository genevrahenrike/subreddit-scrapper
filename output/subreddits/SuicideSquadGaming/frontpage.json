I think it’s kinda clear that it’s obviously a good deal either way, but more so for the deluxe. So my question is what does the deluxe really give me as someone who has no idea about the game and is it worth it to pay the extra 5 or so with tax.",

Shouldn't I be starting with white and getting higher and higher rarity of loot instead of going to high-end right away? What am I missing here?",

      "content_preview": "This game was only hated because it wasnt another batman game. Because it wasnt what people wanted in their heads. Thats not a valid reason to hate this game for what it is. I know forsureeee that if this released with another arkham game. Or one was shown and in development, people would have adored this game the way it deserves. Its all entitlement and influencers riling people up and making them feel justified in their childish entitlement, all for a quick buck . Ive officially stopped listening to the internet communities and infleuncers/content creators when it comes to games and I implore you to do the same. I GENUINELY think influencers and entitled fans are destroying the industry as badly if not worse, than rising costs and the need for studios to monetize post launch. There is no consistency. Some devs can't so so much leeway and will be defended to the death even when tney dont deserve it and make trash, like fromsoft did with nieghtreign. Which is a live service games btw while People literally argue against that in some delusional attempt to protect them. Zero consistency. Defending a live service asset flip thats just a bad game all around, from a studio who people held up as being above it all. People whining like actual CHILDREN about \"the bad guys are killing our heroes\". That was an unironic, serious comment from someone that got thousands of likes somehow. People were genuinely offended by the very CONCEPT of suicide squad killing the justice league. Number 1, its a comic book universe. We all know they werent staying dead, and anyone pretending otherwise is flat out lying to themselves. Number 2. Just wut. The idea of having these god like heroes all go rouge and act almost like, and in some cases exsctly like, horror movie villains is an incredible idea. It is genuinely wonderful. The whole batman fight being this terrifying horror level was top notch stuff. You get to play the perspective of the underdog villains, something you RARELY ever see. It was unique. And they played with that concept in the best way they could have. As a side note, Harley \"killing\" batman was super satisfying?. If you read comics, or care about these characters, there is more to love here than any of the other DC games frankly. There is so so many references and call backs and the characterization is LITERALLY factually spot on. Its some of the best iterations of these characters ever put on screen. And the writing of their interactions and banter is better and more natural than anythinggggg James gunn or Zach Snyder have ever done in their films. king shark with the lantern ring, that whole scene, i mean CMON . it baffles me, completely baffles me, that someone could pick up a control and play as boomerang, flipping around and teleporting around with some of the best traversal in an open world game ever, rivaling (or even beating) spiderman 2 on ps5. The game took risks, it wasnt paint by numbers, the combat was unique and fantastically polished (reminds me a lot of doom eternal), the traversal is nigh unmatched, the visuals are stellar, the campaign is wonderful and fully fleshed out no less than any arkham game. Whats happening is, studios are getting scared to try anything new or take any risks what so ever. It should be OKAY to make a game that doesnt resonate or to just experiment sometimes, without it being the end of all fucking things in the gaming. And none of it is consistent. Its okay for some studios to make live service games but others can't? Who decides that? How's that fair?  One live service games doesnt at ALL indicate that they will never make single player games again. A lot of times studios are making these multiplayer games, to FUND THE SINGLE PLAYER GAMES.  Its hard to take risks on single player gamss, spend 10s if not hundreds of millions, ever increasing budgets, while sales of individual copies of games are not rising to enough to cover increased budgets. Thats why mtx exists in the first place. These studios themselves, are not billionaires. They arent making billions a year. Gta, cod, fornite, those are exceptions to the rule. A 200million dollar flop, can kill the biggest of studios. Live service games can provide a safety net. So much of games success, is luck. It is. Timing, and luck, and hoping to god you dont get caught in some nonsense on Twitter that every greedy outlet and influencer jumps on. You cannot expect studios to not try to chase what gamers OBJECTIVELY want to play MORE. This isnt opinion, the stats are clear, live service games absolutely crush single player titles and even multiplayer games without constsnt support. Its not even remotely close. Those games make even popular single player games look like niche indie games. Plussssss If people actually played the fucking thing, they'd realize it has a full really really good single player campaign and you can ignore the live service aspects entirely. Which was the number one complaint for these looter shooters, that the story contsnt was an after thought. Destiny is a big one in that regard, the story telling is a genuine joke and so are the campaigns. It blows destiny away as far as single player and the campaign",

A long time ago, close to release in fact, I ran into a glitch with the final Toyman mission. When I beat it, my screen went black, I got no \"end of game\" screen, I was thrown back into the open world, and the achievement for the final Toyman mission didn't pop. For a long time it's been the last achievement I need to obtain the platinum, and because there isn't a side mission replay feature, I don't have many options. Back when I got the glitch, I tried contacting WB support multiple times and got no help. The only solution I can think of is someone who hasn't beat the final mission adding me, inviting me to their squad, and then beating the mission with me. So, yeah. If you haven't beaten the final Toyman mission yet, please consider helping me. It'd be very much appreciated. I play on PS5. I'm free for all of today (12PM-10AM PDT) and the next two days (same time).",

      "content_preview": "I am a fan of shooter looter games, and since I am taking a break from my main 2 games, Destiny 2 and The Division 2, I decided to give this one a try since I got it for free on PS plus. I had no expectations, but after finishing the main story and seeing a glimpse of how the end game will be like I can say that I actually like the game. Gunplay is solid Traversal is awesome and varied (jet packs are the best by a mile tho) I liked the main story, VA was great and most of the jokes did stick. Although I would have preferred if Toyman never spoke. Loot is starting to be exciting now that I started endgame There seems to be a grind, a good thing in a looter shooter. You can reroll perks, upgrade weapons, gear sets, secret perks, and dk what else I am yet to discover Difficulty scales nicely I like the fact that I can increase difficulty by progressing on current invasion tiers In a lot of ways the game reminds me of Outriders, but I prefer this one. The combat is chaotic and fast paced and truly exciting. Main flaw for me is probably the repetition of the mission design, but I don't mind it so much because I am used to repeating the same nightfall 10 times in a row in Destiny so it is not a dealbreaker. There are mutators, lots of contracts/bounties and small things to chase. I am yet to explore the seasonal content but I am liking it so far. Kind of wish they supported the game more and added more content becauase there was potential, but unfortunately bad reviews and a bumpy launch killed this game. If you are reading this and wondering if it is wroth playing, I would say yes since you can get it for very cheap and if you like looter shooters and not expecting a superhero game, then you will like it. Cheers!",
