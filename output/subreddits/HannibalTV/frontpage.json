But first, help us understand this new serial killer, who seems to be staging his murders to recreate scenes from that movie you and I discussed last week. Also, Will Graham said you are trying a new therapy method where you make him drink mushroom tea before laying 11 knives in front of him and asking him which one best represents his last unpleasant customer service experience.‚Äù Hannibal: ‚Äúof course. But first try my new recipe for femur bone soup. It tastes like an old friend‚Äôs unexpected goodbye.‚Äù",

She hated will for killing her father, and those hallucinations will had was him showing us that he was an unreliable narrator. The whole family narrative Hannibal told was a lie, becauseHanniball knew Abigail was desperate for a family, Hannibal wanted to conjoin his 2 favourite projects, like that N a Z1 doctor who tried to make Thoracopagus twins(conjoined twins). Abigail viewed Hannibal as a father figure, but not truly. Hannibal manipulated her into feeling reliant and dependent on Hannibal. So whenHanniball passed her over to Will to be a parental figure, he essentially made Abigail more dependent on Hannibal. And PERSONALLY, I think Hannibal was grooming her into becoming a mini chesepeake ripper, Bc when it was revealed she willingly let hannibal cut her ear off it seemed very groomy...Like when a cult leader says \"kill your whole family\" and they do it. But then hannibals lust for will happens and she dies.",

Abigail hobbs was a orphan, with no resources, seen as a accomplice by the FBI, who killed and ate people since childhood with her father who was a psychopath and serial killer. She saw ger father being shot to death in front of her own eyes, while almost dying because of having her throat slitted by her own father after, seeing with own eyes, her mother being killed by her own father. How can someone like that with Trauma genuinely have bonds with two strangers with their own motives for everything they do?. Hannibal loves Abigail hobbs as a daughter?. This is the same man who killed her in front of will just because of his and Will's drama?. She wasn't a victim. But she never quite got her own agency. She bonded with Hannibal like someone does with their captor if they are a captive. Also, you people really think will felt grief over Abigail's murder? This is the same man who doomed his team by signalling a serial killer who they were going to ambush. This is the same man who says he feels good while killing. This is the same man who left his wife and step-son for the same serial killer. Abigail hobbs was never loved. Nor did she love anyone. But what are your thoughts?.",

We never get to see his prime peak self or how dangerous he was before being caught.. For me, Movie version represents what would happen if hannibal stayed locked up and how he still remains a threat. TV show version feels like it focuses more on how truly dangerous he is in his element. Dude is in his peak prime form, not in jail yet and virtually shown to be unstoppable and too dangerous.. We get to see how evil and artistic he can be in his killings and how he has both brains & the brawns to win any scenario.. TV show version represents what would happen if hannibal was out there and how much of a threat he is..",
