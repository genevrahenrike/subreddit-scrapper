      "content_preview": "I would love to have a storage system that I can throw storage, hdds, ssds etc... at and have a set of policies defined that ensure data is placed where needed to accomodate those policies.For example a policy that requires 2 replicas, performance such as read throughput minimum (10MBs) and a write throughput (500MBs). Which would tend to indicate cold storage on HDDs, inbound write buffer to SSDs/NVME with writeback to HDDs.Another policy could be IOPs based that would tend to excluded HDDs or require striping across many HDDs or maybe a policy that says recent data does not need replicas but once its 10days old it does (and maybe hands off to another policy) to accomodate scratch areas that must be fast but less likely to be needed when unused so could write back to HDDs for example.Another policy concept could be a based on access patterns such as 'if 500MB of data is read from a particular directory, preload the entire directory to fast storage'Or maybe something like requiring at least 2 replicas but if there are lots of HDDs with capacity available system can replicate 10x to speculatively improve read performance (can read from all/any of the 10 replicas).  If capacity drops below some threashold replicas can be reclaimed.In other words I want CRUSH but soemthing ZFS-like (local filesystem).  Define rules/polcies, throw hardware (HDD, SSD, NVMEe) into a pool of capacity, iops, throughput and let the system dynamically figure out how best align those requirements.  I'm also in a place where my awesome, power hungry, cluster running Ceph is turning into a single threadripper server which means I'm losing all the awesomeness that is Ceph/CRUSH by converting all my storage to ZFS.",

      "content_preview": "Not in the way of \"I'm done with Linux\", oh no no. It's just...I think in the life of every Linux person (or maybe it appeals to other hobbies/passions) there comes a time, when you're just simply DONE. Done reinstalling the system every couple of weeks. Done finding the best, newest trend there is. Done spending hours and hours troubleshooting and fixing issues with your extremely customized setup. Done scouring the forums and Reddit looking for answers on why this absolute newest, bleeding edge RC kernel is causing you problems. Just DONE.I've been distrohopping since I can remember. I had a brief year of using Arch (but not really, I was hopping between all Arch-based distros), then about a year or two using Fedora, but still trying out everything new that was coming out. I was in awe with all the new and shiny.But now I'm in my 30s. I don't have time, nor headspace to wonder if my system will boot today, if the update won't break anything, if this new kernel won't cause me some weird, unexplainable issues. My OS has to boot and get out of my way. It's my terminal to the work, not my work.So here I am. Writing this on Waterfox (basically Firefox ESR) from Linux Mint 22.1 with LTS kernel, installed on absolutely ridiculously powerful gaming machine. Do I care if I don't get new bells and whistles that come with newer kernels, newer DE versions, newer Firefox releases? No. I absolutely do not. I value the fact, that in about a year of having this Mint installation, I have NEVER had to reinstall it or fix anything. It just works. I feel no incentive to change anything here. I even use the default theming.So, what's your story? Am I the only one, who came up to this mindset? Or maybe there are more of us? I leave the comments to you.EDIT: I see there's a confusion. \"Why would you have to reinstall every couple of weeks?! Just learn to use Linux!\"Guys... I'm working as sysadmin for 8 years, I know how to use Linux :P I didn't HAVE TO or NEED to reinstall my system. I just WANTED TO. To try new distro, new DE, new function, change something in my life. It was purely for fun and games. But I don't have time, nor headspace for this anymore, so I don't do this. This is what all this post is about.",

      "content_preview": "Sorry for asking this.I really want a GNU/Linux phone to run some of the apps I enjoy, but it only makes sense with a handheld attached physical keyboard, because otherwise the screen space is very small. Maybe what I want doesn't exist and the way is to use an SBC or something. It is OK if the phone runs only with Halium.Basically, all I need is a Nokia N900 with more RAM.Please do not tell me about Graphene or whatever here. I don't want only privacy but also freedom. Also, I don't need any of my current Android apps, in any case I can take an Android with me if I see I really need them.From what I know Planet Computers and Fxtec are not actually shipping and are probably forgotten.And if such a phone doesn't exist, why doesn't it?",

Clicking the \"Errors\" button will produce an error report about errors that may have occurred during the file-copy operation (or delete, move, symlink etc) and the \"Reports\" button produces a report of all the files that get copied (source to destination) and also shows the speed rate each file got copied at. Really handy for benchmarking. The actual reports are ASCII files and are saved in /tmp so they are gone after a PC reboot. The file-copy dialog gets automatically closed when the operation is complete unless errors have occurred OR the cursor is hovering the dialog when the file op is complete. This is by design and it is to give you a chance to click the \"Reports\" button in case you want to analyze what's been done. I was thinking of adding a \"Close dialog when finished\" check box but I will do that in the next release.New: Added a search box in the mount points menu which is accessed via clicking a button in the toolbar.New: User home directories (any user) now have dedicated icons. This is similar to the dedicated icons feature I added for mount points. So let's say you are userA using PC1 and you are using Qutiny as a file manager and you navigate to /home. Each of the users' home dir will have a dedicated icon so you won't have the standard directory icons used by your icon theme. This works regardless of what the location, it doesn't have to be /home. It isnothard coded to \"/home\".New: keyboard shortcuts for scroll to top and scroll to bottoom in Qutiny file manager.CTRL+DOWNarrow to scroll to bottom andCTRL+UParrow to scroll to top.New: \"Generate File List\" to the context menu in Qutiny. When clicked, it produces a list of files recursively in a log files and opens it up for viewing.New: Now when pressing Alt+Enter key will bring the file properties dialog like other file managers do.And just a note to anyone that does not know. The three panes in the Orbitiny's menu can be resized or hidden. There is a transparent splitter bar between the panes and that last pane on the right can be completely hidden. Just drag the splitter bar all the way to the right and when it stops moving, still, continue to drag and it will snap/close completely. To re-show it, just drag from the right edge to the left and it will reappear.Orbitiny Desktop Environmentis a new, innovative and traditionalQtbased desktop environment for Linux. My target audience is anyone who wants afamiliarandtraditionaldesktop but at the same time a desktop that offersinnovativeandadditional featuresnot offered by any other desktop and this release brings you yet another innovative feature (this time with the file manager) not seen on any other desktop before.Again, I can't stress enough,please continue to report bugs. I willnotand I donotignore your reports. If you don't report the bug, it will never be fixed because I won't be aware of it.Code:https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktopDownload:https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/At the moment, Orbitiny Desktop binary releases are hosted onSourceForge.netand at the time of writing this, several big and popular Linux projects are hosted onSourceForge.net.Again I want to point out that Orbitiny isn't going anywhere and is here to stay and I am developing it because I do not like what's currently on offer and although my primary focus is X11, I do not dismiss Wayland support in the future. It is just not my priority right now.",

Recently I have enjoyed using fedora and being able to send a middle finger back to microsoft over various issues ive had in keeping my system running.These days ive thought about either going back to school for CA to get a job in linux development or maybe self teach myself.I did go to university before but failed out of programming 1 as the universities programming 1 course was more difficult than the 1 at my original college by a factor of like 10 plus my time was limited through external work at the time.I feel this time I could have a better chance by taking 1 course a semester.Or I could self learn via projects until I eventually get a position as a developer. What are peoples thoughts here about this? What are some fields a passionate linux developer can get into that is not Kernal development?",

After hesitating for a bit I gave it a try and I was not pleased by what I found, contrary to popular belief CachyOS lacks polish and is less usable and stable than Manjaro. Let me break it down.Boot time. After running the same optization on both distros, namely using the contents /etc/xdg/autostart as reference point to find out if there are programs or KDE features I don't need that I can uninstall, editing GRUB timeout and changing the value to 0, installing the latest available kernel version, editing Background services using the KDE window with the same name and turning off and disabling services I don't need and after editing Configure System Tray and disabling widgets from starting automatically at boot that I don't need the results were....crash. CachyOS stuttered, crashed the plasmashell once, after forced reboot it did the same but this time it reverted back to the log in screen and proceeded to freeze after entering the password and attempting to log in and after a second forced reboot, it froze once again while using Configure System tray, but this time it managed to restart the shell after a few seconds. Was this a KDE problem? Was it a kernel problem? Was it something else like zram which is automatically preconfigured for CachyOS and very aggressive? Maybe, idk, but the experience was not pleasant. Also after one of those reboots it also failed to enable the keyboard after booting.Getting back on track, boot times. After finishing optimizations the best result I got on Cachy OS was 18s while on Manjaro with the 6.17 kernel I managed 13.2shttps://imgur.com/a/yA5WwMihttps://imgur.com/a/xddFOU1There is not much to say here other, other than lowering the grub timeout, the same bios (UIEFI) settings were used and yet the results are quite different. Almost 50% more time needed for Cachy OS using the same boot loader, namely GRUB.Ram usage while idling on the desktop after fresh restart, which to me communicates how bloated the system is compared to how optimize it could be with a common sense setup that provides all the needed functions while not being as bare bones as the command line stans would desire. Here again I noticed a gap with CachyOS being more RAM hungry after simillar optimizationsCachyOShttps://imgur.com/a/jX1xTrJManjarohttps://imgur.com/a/6Gpv6xxOf note here is the pretty aggressive use of zram which on one side does appear to make the GUI more responsive but also has introduced the chance for freezes and stutters which I would qulify as a fail for a normal, daily use OS and Manjaro did not really feel slow ever, in fact the most impactful setting one can make for KDE to make the GUI appear to work quickly and be responsive is to go to System Settings>Quick settings or General Behavior (depending on the distro the wording for this category might be different despite all being Plasma) and finding the \"Animation speed\" slider and setting it to the fastest value. Here's a lsblk from Cachy displaying the use of zram which was configured by the installer, I had no input.https://imgur.com/a/Rd2YpsULastly, though a bit unrelated to performance and more related to usability, the Package Manager for CachyOS is far less intuitive to use having a very simplistic GUI compared to Manjaro which offers by contrast an easy way to browse installed packages and install/uninstall them at leisure. Not so clear or usable on the CachyOS side though I give it props for listing the repo packages in a list which makes it a lot more usable for casual use than requiring to know the console command to install them. This is a feature that Manjaro should copy.CachyOS (crappy) GUI for packageshttps://imgur.com/a/cxQumhGCachyOS (useful repo list of packages) GUI in the package managerhttps://imgur.com/a/07vSBGQOverall I am not impressed with CachyOS compared to Manajaro for daily use, far less stable and easy to use for casual PC users, especially those migrating from Windows. I give it props for the responsive GUI, likely a combination of aggressive zram config and fabled CachyOS optimized and kissed approved kernel but this trades off stability and leaves a bad first impression. These, imo should be user enabled features post install and not configured automatically from the start. Mediocre boot time, dodgy GUI decisions and overly enthusiastic optimizations, frankly speaking fanboys need to take a sit and be more humble, Manjaro in my findings is far more casual PC user friendly and better set up for first time Linux users. Use CachyOS at your peril, better dual boot with a stable distro, it doesn't boot fast anyway so no need to cry about it with multiboot.",

According to their data, Linux is currently showing a market share of 9.63% on desktops. That number surprised me quite a bit, because for years Linux has usually been sitting in the low single digits, often around 2–3%. Now I’m wondering: is this number actually accurate, or could there be some skewing in the way the data is collected? StatCounter tracks visitors to websites using analytics code, so the results can vary depending on which sites are included, the regions sampled, and how devices are detected. For example, sometimes ChromeOS devices are counted separately, and sometimes they get lumped in with Linux. If ChromeOS is included in that 9.63%, it could explain the jump. Another factor might be that Linux usage has genuinely grown, thanks to more people trying it out, gaming improvements with Proton/Steam, and the general dissatisfaction some users feel with Windows updates or privacy policies. So I’m curious what you all think. Do you believe Linux has really climbed close to 10% of the desktop market, or do you think this is just a measurement artifact?",
