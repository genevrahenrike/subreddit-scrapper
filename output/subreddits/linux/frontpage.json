This driver is working on Mint 21 but I don't want to downgrade my kernel. Is there anyone who succeed to install it on Linux kernel 6.8? If so, how can can I do it? Thanks a lot for your help!",

      "content_preview": "Orbitiny Desktop Environment Pilot 5 Test Release is a significant and major new update with many severe bug fixes and many new features. https://preview.redd.it/orbitiny-1-0-pilot-5-released-a-major-significant-new-update-v0-687am8gs7mmf1.png Changes in Orbitiny 1.0 Pilot 5: BugFix : Fixed rubber band selections not working under some circumferences. BugFix : Fixed issues with dashboard sometimes hanging when requesting to close it BugFix : Fixed panels displaying incorrectly on non-1080p screens BugFix : Fixed Orbitiny not starting properly in dedicated mode BugFix : Fixed wallpaper not stretching when Orbitiny portable folder/dir is run on a computer with a resolution screen higher than the one it was run on. BugFix : Fixed panel not resizing properly when display resolution is changed BugFix : Fixed desktop window not resizing properly when display resolution is changed BugFix : Fixed some graphical theming glitches in panel vertical mode BugFix : Now the panel can be re-positioned to the edges of the screen reliably by holding the panel handles or the edge button while moving the mouse pointer New : Added initial/preliminary/experimental MTP support - now you can MTP your device and manage files New : Brand new File Copy/Delete dialog with big speed imprisonments and two new additional buttons: \"Errors\" and \"Reports\". Clicking the \"Errors\" button will produce an error report about errors that may have occurred during the file-copy operation (or delete, move, symlink etc) and the \"Reports\" button produces a report of all the files that get copied (source to destination) and also shows the speed rate each file got copied at. Really handy for benchmarking. The actual reports are ASCII files and are saved in /tmp so they are gone after a PC reboot. The file-copy dialog gets automatically closed when the operation is complete unless errors have occurred OR the cursor is hovering the dialog when the file op is complete. This is by design and it is to give you a chance to click the \"Reports\" button in case you want to analyze what's been done. I was thinking of adding a \"Close dialog when finished\" check box but I will do that in the next release. New : Added a search box in the mount points menu which is accessed via clicking a button in the toolbar. New : User home directories (any user) now have dedicated icons. This is similar to the dedicated icons feature I added for mount points. So let's say you are userA using PC1 and you are using Qutiny as a file manager and you navigate to /home. Each of the users' home dir will have a dedicated icon so you won't have the standard directory icons used by your icon theme. This works regardless of what the location, it doesn't have to be /home. It is not hard coded to \"/home\". New : keyboard shortcuts for scroll to top and scroll to bottoom in Qutiny file manager. CTRL+DOWN arrow to scroll to bottom and CTRL+UP arrow to scroll to top. New : \"Generate File List\" to the context menu in Qutiny. When clicked, it produces a list of files recursively in a log files and opens it up for viewing. New : Now when pressing Alt+Enter key will bring the file properties dialog like other file managers do. And just a note to anyone that does not know. The three panes in the Orbitiny's menu can be resized or hidden. There is a transparent splitter bar between the panes and that last pane on the right can be completely hidden. Just drag the splitter bar all the way to the right and when it stops moving, still, continue to drag and it will snap/close completely. To re-show it, just drag from the right edge to the left and it will reappear. Orbitiny Desktop Environment is a new, innovative and traditional Qt based desktop environment for Linux. My target audience is anyone who wants a familiar and traditional desktop but at the same time a desktop that offers innovative and additional features not offered by any other desktop and this release brings you yet another innovative feature (this time with the file manager) not seen on any other desktop before. Again, I can't stress enough, please continue to report bugs . I will not and I do not ignore your reports. If you don't report the bug, it will never be fixed because I won't be aware of it. Code : https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktop Download : https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/ At the moment, Orbitiny Desktop binary releases are hosted on SourceForge.net and at the time of writing this, several big and popular Linux projects are hosted on SourceForge.net . Again I want to point out that Orbitiny isn't going anywhere and is here to stay and I am developing it because I do not like what's currently on offer and although my primary focus is X11, I do not dismiss Wayland support in the future. It is just not my priority right now.",

I made a comment on a Linux mobile post about a month ago saying that we were one egregious, unpalatable announcement away from seeing real progress in mobile Linux. With Android’s recent announcement about killing side-loading, is this the opportunity Linux devs need to justify dedicating more resources to mobile Linux? I have only been using linux for a bit over a year and I am interested to hear from the old-heads on this one. Linux is starting to (modestly) surge in popularity on the desktop/laptop side of things which I know has been years if not decades in the making. With the current Linux landscape, is there any reason to expect Linux mobile to get increased attention, and if so when would be reasonable to expect mature software that could see wide uptake? From what I have found, it isn’t there yet but I do not have the knowledge to understand how far away this future may be.",

      "content_preview": "Not in the way of \"I'm done with Linux\", oh no no. It's just... I think in the life of every Linux person (or maybe it appeals to other hobbies/passions) there comes a time, when you're just simply DONE. Done reinstalling the system every couple of weeks. Done finding the best, newest trend there is. Done spending hours and hours troubleshooting and fixing issues with your extremely customized setup. Done scouring the forums and Reddit looking for answers on why this absolute newest, bleeding edge RC kernel is causing you problems. Just DONE. I've been distrohopping since I can remember. I had a brief year of using Arch (but not really, I was hopping between all Arch-based distros), then about a year or two using Fedora, but still trying out everything new that was coming out. I was in awe with all the new and shiny. But now I'm in my 30s. I don't have time, nor headspace to wonder if my system will boot today, if the update won't break anything, if this new kernel won't cause me some weird, unexplainable issues. My OS has to boot and get out of my way. It's my terminal to the work, not my work. So here I am. Writing this on Waterfox (basically Firefox ESR) from Linux Mint 22.1 with LTS kernel, installed on absolutely ridiculously powerful gaming machine. Do I care if I don't get new bells and whistles that come with newer kernels, newer DE versions, newer Firefox releases? No. I absolutely do not. I value the fact, that in about a year of having this Mint installation, I have NEVER had to reinstall it or fix anything. It just works. I feel no incentive to change anything here. I even use the default theming. So, what's your story? Am I the only one, who came up to this mindset? Or maybe there are more of us? I leave the comments to you. EDIT: I see there's a confusion. \"Why would you have to reinstall every couple of weeks?! Just learn to use Linux!\" Guys... I'm working as sysadmin for 8 years, I know how to use Linux :P I didn't HAVE TO or NEED to reinstall my system. I just WANTED TO. To try new distro, new DE, new function, change something in my life. It was purely for fun and games. But I don't have time, nor headspace for this anymore, so I don't do this. This is what all this post is about.",

      "content_preview": "My story with mobile linux started a decade ago when i was roughly 18, and I was getting into linux and mentioned to my friend that \"I wish I had linux on a phone\", and they mentioned SailfishOS. Back then I didn't even know english, had no money, and the only SFOS (sailfishos shortened) available was released year ago Jolla Phone. So how do I get my hand on SFOS? Well the only option was to port it to my phone. Action of porting is adjusting OS to a device so that every feature works, unlike desktop, where thanks to ACPI and drivers and generalized hardware stuff generally just works. Phones are not really generalized hardware and each has its quirks so it needs a wee bit of work. So I've acquired, then vastly uninteresting Motorola Moto G2, back when Motorola was under Google. And with my trash english in hand and my motorola in other I went to #sailfishos-porters on freenode IRC. Now up till this point I've had quite an experience flashing custom ROMs on my old htc explorer. So I went to IRC and started porting sfos with help of very nice and very helpful people there. Now fast forward cause I don't want this to be too long, I've ported g2, then went to port nexus 7, moto x2, moto x force, huawei p8 lite, moto z, moto x, moto x play, moto x pro, moto g2 LTE, moto g3, fxtec pro1 asus zenfone 5z, 8, and recently oneplus 6 and xiaomi pad 6. Yeah, I've been busy. Beside doing more ports than Jolla (SailfishOS owner) at the time, I've been studying software engineering and decided to make an app, then another, and another. Currently I've developed 10 apps, and as of today I'm supporting 6 devices, including Motorola moto G2 from a decade ago. Yes its still alive. Yes I'm still using it daily. Some of my apps worth noting are youtube client and telegram client. Youtube client people praise to be better than android/ios ones. People when talking about mobile linux just tend to flat out ignore the biggest alternative to android/IOS we have to date like it never even existed which is very weird, and tad annoying. Some people say that \"SailfishOS is proprietary\" but no, no it's not. I couldn't have contributed to it if it was closed source don't you think? Yes, it's partially proprietary but in places you wouldn't even notice. All the OS part and hardware adaptation is *opensource, thanks to that, other OSs like ubuntu touch or mobian or halium could exist, because people forgot where libhybris comes from, and it comes from Sailfishos. The only closed source parts is the gui and in very small amount because all libraries surrounding it are opensource. It's quite difficult to come across something closed source. Now I said \"biggest alternative to android/IOS to date\", this is true. People who have been in this space for as long as I've been know that. SailfishOS is the oldest one, and has the most amount of apps, AND they're most polished. Second place on the podium would've been taken by ubuntu touch, as its also using libhybris and it has many apps but ecosystem is not as great as SailfishOS. Then is the rest of small fries but pmos as a project to port mainline kernel would probably take a third spot. But libhybris is way faster and way easier to achieve compatibility. So ye, if you read all that, thanks, now AMA. I'll be here all day (+- next 12h)",

      "content_preview": "I recently got my hands on a Lexmark Z33 inkjet printer. I thought it would be a cakewalk to set up with Gutenprint — but it turns out the Z33 is the only Lexmark inkjet that runs on a proprietary, undocumented “Z-code” driver, with no PPDs and zero Gutenprint support. The only saving grace is that Lexmark still hosts their ancient Linux driver for Red Hat 7.3 (2001): CJLZ33TC.TAR.GZ → https://www.downloaddelivery.com/downloads/cpd/CJLZ33TC.TAR.GZ After days of trial and error (Raspberry Pi emulation, failed source builds, etc.), I found a working method: run Red Hat Linux 8.0 in QEMU with the original Lexmark driver, and forward its LPD queue to modern CUPS (2.4.x) on Debian Trixie. Cyan ink still fails inside RH8, but works fine once bridged to modern CUPS. On the Debian host, install QEMU and CUPS: sudo apt update\nsudo apt install qemu-system-i386 qemu-utils cups Unload usblp so it doesn’t grab the printer before QEMU does: sudo rmmod usblp Grab the Red Hat Linux 8.0 Professional DVD ISO (from the Internet Archive). Create a disk image: qemu-img create -f qcow2 redhat8.qcow2 4G Boot the installer with USB passthrough and VNC enabled: sudo qemu-system-i386 \\\n  -m 384 \\\n  -hda redhat8.qcow2 \\\n  -boot d \\\n  -cdrom red-hat-linux-8.0-professional-install-dvd.iso \\\n  -net nic,model=rtl8139 \\\n  -net user,hostfwd=tcp::515-:515 \\\n  -usb -device piix3-usb-uhci \\\n  -device usb-host,vendorid=0x043d,productid=0x0021 \\\n  -vga cirrus \\\n  -display vnc=0.0.0.0:1 At the boot prompt, type: linux text vga=normal If you skip this, the Lexmark installer will later fail due to console restrictions. After installation, boot normally with the same command, but -boot c . From another machine, connect to QEMU’s VNC session: vncviewer <host-ip>:1 (or use xtightvncviewer / vinagre depending on your distro). Inside the VM, mount the CD: mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom Install required RPMs from the RH8 DVD: rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/slang-1.4*.rpm \\\n          /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/enscript-1.6*.rpm \\\n          /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/gcc-2.96*.rpm \\\n          /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/make-3*.rpm \\\n          /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/libstdc++-2.96*.rpm \\\n          /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/libstdc++-devel-2.96*.rpm Start X11 so the Lexmark installer can run its GUI: startx Download and run the Lexmark driver: wget https://www.downloaddelivery.com/downloads/cpd/CJLZ33TC.TAR.GZ\ntar -xvzf CJLZ33TC.TAR.GZ\ncd lexmarkz33-1.0-3\n./lexmarkz33-1.0-3.sh This will install through a GUI and create an LPD queue called lexmarkz33 . Start the print daemon: /etc/init.d/lpd start To check the printer is talking, or to print the test page (cyan will fail here), run inside an xterm under startx: z23-z33lsc On the Debian Trixie host, open the CUPS web interface at http://localhost:631 → Administration → Add Printer. Add a Generic PostScript Printer with this URI: lpd://<IP>:515/lexmarkz33 Now the RH8 VM acts as a bridge, and modern CUPS 2.4.x handles the jobs correctly (including cyan). To start the VM invisibly at boot, add this to /etc/rc.local on Debian: #!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n\n# Free the printer from usblp so QEMU can grab it\n/sbin/rmmod usblp 2>/dev/null || true\n\n# Start RH8 VM in background\n/usr/bin/qemu-system-i386 \\\n  -m 384 \\\n  -hda /home/printer/redhat8.qcow2 \\\n  -boot c \\\n  -net nic,model=rtl8139 \\\n  -net user,hostfwd=tcp::515-:515 \\\n  -usb -device piix3-usb-uhci \\\n  -device usb-host,vendorid=0x043d,productid=0x0021 \\\n  -serial file:/var/log/rh8-vm-serial.log \\\n  -daemonize -display none -serial file:/var/log/rh8-vm.log\n\nexit 0 Then voila, the LPD queue, and the Z33 is now available through CUPS on the trixie machine, regardless of the missing Gutenprint, CUPS, and PPD driver files. If anyone (which is very unlikely) tries this and runs into an issue, feel free to ask. I have spent days on this and probably have had the same issue.",

Do you encrypt your disk? Do you enter the password twice then on boot or do did you configure auto login after decryption? I might set up my Fedora + Rasp Pi new with it enabled, I assume it can be easily set up during installation? How do you handle it?",

I use a hybrid GPU laptop which has a Intel and Nvidia GPU (Gigabyte G5 RTX 3050ti with propietary drivers) laptop and I want to have the maximum energy savings while still keeping performance. The thing is, after tinkering for DAYS, I found up the culprit of every rendering problem happening when resuming from sleep with Nvidia GPU, it was not the nvidia GPU causing corrupted graphics on Minecraft, it was Minecraft's OPENGL. I first noticed this when Vulkan games didnt crash but OpenGL did. Then I installed the Vulkan mod for fabric and DONE, Minecraft stopped corrupting graphics on resume for the nvidia propietary drivers. Just install this and you are done, big kudos to the author: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vulkanmod Personal Note: I hope this gets into Sodium somehow, Vulkan must be standard as of now!",

I'm just curious what else is out there, since for my use case KDE fits me quite well, and I do tend to go for rolling release distros. What would you guys recommend? I'd like to have a good amount of software in whatever package manager the distro uses but I'm also perfectly fine using flatpaks or additional repos if needed. (Currently using Arch, have used Fedora before.)",

Untarballing stuff in the wrong place for this version. Hours on forums trying to get my wireless to work. Standard early Linux stuff.
