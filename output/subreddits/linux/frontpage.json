      "content_preview": "I would love to have a storage system that I can throw storage, hdds, ssds etc... at and have a set of policies defined that ensure data is placed where needed to accomodate those policies.For example a policy that requires 2 replicas, performance such as read throughput minimum (10MBs) and a write throughput (500MBs). Which would tend to indicate cold storage on HDDs, inbound write buffer to SSDs/NVME with writeback to HDDs.Another policy could be IOPs based that would tend to excluded HDDs or require striping across many HDDs or maybe a policy that says recent data does not need replicas but once its 10days old it does (and maybe hands off to another policy) to accomodate scratch areas that must be fast but less likely to be needed when unused so could write back to HDDs for example.Another policy concept could be a based on access patterns such as 'if 500MB of data is read from a particular directory, preload the entire directory to fast storage'Or maybe something like requiring at least 2 replicas but if there are lots of HDDs with capacity available system can replicate 10x to speculatively improve read performance (can read from all/any of the 10 replicas).  If capacity drops below some threashold replicas can be reclaimed.In other words I want CRUSH but soemthing ZFS-like (local filesystem).  Define rules/polcies, throw hardware (HDD, SSD, NVMEe) into a pool of capacity, iops, throughput and let the system dynamically figure out how best align those requirements.  I'm also in a place where my awesome, power hungry, cluster running Ceph is turning into a single threadripper server which means I'm losing all the awesomeness that is Ceph/CRUSH by converting all my storage to ZFS.",

      "content_preview": "Not in the way of \"I'm done with Linux\", oh no no. It's just...I think in the life of every Linux person (or maybe it appeals to other hobbies/passions) there comes a time, when you're just simply DONE. Done reinstalling the system every couple of weeks. Done finding the best, newest trend there is. Done spending hours and hours troubleshooting and fixing issues with your extremely customized setup. Done scouring the forums and Reddit looking for answers on why this absolute newest, bleeding edge RC kernel is causing you problems. Just DONE.I've been distrohopping since I can remember. I had a brief year of using Arch (but not really, I was hopping between all Arch-based distros), then about a year or two using Fedora, but still trying out everything new that was coming out. I was in awe with all the new and shiny.But now I'm in my 30s. I don't have time, nor headspace to wonder if my system will boot today, if the update won't break anything, if this new kernel won't cause me some weird, unexplainable issues. My OS has to boot and get out of my way. It's my terminal to the work, not my work.So here I am. Writing this on Waterfox (basically Firefox ESR) from Linux Mint 22.1 with LTS kernel, installed on absolutely ridiculously powerful gaming machine. Do I care if I don't get new bells and whistles that come with newer kernels, newer DE versions, newer Firefox releases? No. I absolutely do not. I value the fact, that in about a year of having this Mint installation, I have NEVER had to reinstall it or fix anything. It just works. I feel no incentive to change anything here. I even use the default theming.So, what's your story? Am I the only one, who came up to this mindset? Or maybe there are more of us? I leave the comments to you.EDIT: I see there's a confusion. \"Why would you have to reinstall every couple of weeks?! Just learn to use Linux!\"Guys... I'm working as sysadmin for 8 years, I know how to use Linux :P I didn't HAVE TO or NEED to reinstall my system. I just WANTED TO. To try new distro, new DE, new function, change something in my life. It was purely for fun and games. But I don't have time, nor headspace for this anymore, so I don't do this. This is what all this post is about.",

      "content_preview": "Sorry for asking this.I really want a GNU/Linux phone to run some of the apps I enjoy, but it only makes sense with a handheld attached physical keyboard, because otherwise the screen space is very small. Maybe what I want doesn't exist and the way is to use an SBC or something. It is OK if the phone runs only with Halium.Basically, all I need is a Nokia N900 with more RAM.Please do not tell me about Graphene or whatever here. I don't want only privacy but also freedom. Also, I don't need any of my current Android apps, in any case I can take an Android with me if I see I really need them.From what I know Planet Computers and Fxtec are not actually shipping and are probably forgotten.And if such a phone doesn't exist, why doesn't it?",

      "content_preview": "Orbitiny Desktop EnvironmentPilot 5 Test Release is a significant and major new update withmanysevere bug fixes andmanynew features.https://preview.redd.it/orbitiny-1-0-pilot-5-released-a-major-significant-new-update-v0-687am8gs7mmf1.pngChanges in Orbitiny 1.0 Pilot 5:BugFix: Fixed rubber band selections not working under some circumferences.BugFix: Fixed issues with dashboard sometimes hanging when requesting to close itBugFix: Fixed panels displaying incorrectly on non-1080p screensBugFix: Fixed Orbitiny not starting properly in dedicated modeBugFix: Fixed wallpaper not stretching when Orbitiny portable folder/dir is run on a computer with a resolution screen higher than the one it was run on.BugFix: Fixed panel not resizing properly when display resolution is changedBugFix: Fixed desktop window not resizing properly when display resolution is changedBugFix: Fixed some graphical theming glitches in panel vertical modeBugFix: Now the panel can be re-positioned to the edges of the screen reliably by holding the panel handles or the edge button while moving the mouse pointerNew: Added initial/preliminary/experimental MTP support - now you can MTP your device and manage filesNew: Brand new File Copy/Delete dialog with big speed imprisonments and two new additional buttons: \"Errors\" and \"Reports\". Clicking the \"Errors\" button will produce an error report about errors that may have occurred during the file-copy operation (or delete, move, symlink etc) and the \"Reports\" button produces a report of all the files that get copied (source to destination) and also shows the speed rate each file got copied at. Really handy for benchmarking. The actual reports are ASCII files and are saved in /tmp so they are gone after a PC reboot. The file-copy dialog gets automatically closed when the operation is complete unless errors have occurred OR the cursor is hovering the dialog when the file op is complete. This is by design and it is to give you a chance to click the \"Reports\" button in case you want to analyze what's been done. I was thinking of adding a \"Close dialog when finished\" check box but I will do that in the next release.New: Added a search box in the mount points menu which is accessed via clicking a button in the toolbar.New: User home directories (any user) now have dedicated icons. This is similar to the dedicated icons feature I added for mount points. So let's say you are userA using PC1 and you are using Qutiny as a file manager and you navigate to /home. Each of the users' home dir will have a dedicated icon so you won't have the standard directory icons used by your icon theme. This works regardless of what the location, it doesn't have to be /home. It isnothard coded to \"/home\".New: keyboard shortcuts for scroll to top and scroll to bottoom in Qutiny file manager.CTRL+DOWNarrow to scroll to bottom andCTRL+UParrow to scroll to top.New: \"Generate File List\" to the context menu in Qutiny. When clicked, it produces a list of files recursively in a log files and opens it up for viewing.New: Now when pressing Alt+Enter key will bring the file properties dialog like other file managers do.And just a note to anyone that does not know. The three panes in the Orbitiny's menu can be resized or hidden. There is a transparent splitter bar between the panes and that last pane on the right can be completely hidden. Just drag the splitter bar all the way to the right and when it stops moving, still, continue to drag and it will snap/close completely. To re-show it, just drag from the right edge to the left and it will reappear.Orbitiny Desktop Environmentis a new, innovative and traditionalQtbased desktop environment for Linux. My target audience is anyone who wants afamiliarandtraditionaldesktop but at the same time a desktop that offersinnovativeandadditional featuresnot offered by any other desktop and this release brings you yet another innovative feature (this time with the file manager) not seen on any other desktop before.Again, I can't stress enough,please continue to report bugs. I willnotand I donotignore your reports. If you don't report the bug, it will never be fixed because I won't be aware of it.Code:https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktopDownload:https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/At the moment, Orbitiny Desktop binary releases are hosted onSourceForge.netand at the time of writing this, several big and popular Linux projects are hosted onSourceForge.net.Again I want to point out that Orbitiny isn't going anywhere and is here to stay and I am developing it because I do not like what's currently on offer and although my primary focus is X11, I do not dismiss Wayland support in the future. It is just not my priority right now.",

What are peoples thoughts here about this? What are some fields a passionate linux developer can get into that is not Kernal development?",

According to their data, Linux is currently showing a market share of9.63%on desktops. That number surprised me quite a bit, because for years Linux has usually been sitting in the low single digits, often around 2–3%. Now I’m wondering: is this number actually accurate, or could there be some skewing in the way the data is collected?",

When I break old benchmarks, I feel like I’m fine-tuning an F1 car. I’ve contributed to many projects in this area, including CPython:https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121563. Also I had worked creating tools with AI that generate code to automate tasks (automate the automation).Now, I want to transform my manual code optimization process into an open source AI agent that automates and scales optimization across an organization.This agent would operate autonomously generating reports and identifying opportunities for improvement.1-> Analize project structure.2-> Analize and run tests, suggest more for edge cases.3-> Analize bottlenecks and optimize code.4-> Compile, fix errors.5-> Generate reports or discard changes if no improvement is found.Even a 5% increase in code efficiency could have a major impact on organizational performance and operational costs.The project will be open source under the MIT license, developed by and for the community and organizations, allowing anyone to use it and contribute to its evolution.I have these questions:Which framework, language, or platform would maximize the impact of an autonomous AI optimization agent?How could this be sustainably funded while remaining open source under an MIT license?Is this a worthwhile investment for organizations and the broader developer community?What would you name this project?",

I made a comment on a Linux mobile post about a month ago saying that we were one egregious, unpalatable announcement away from seeing real progress in mobile Linux. With Android’s recent announcement about killing side-loading, is this the opportunity Linux devs need to justify dedicating more resources to mobile Linux?I have only been using linux for a bit over a year and I am interested to hear from the old-heads on this one. Linux is starting to (modestly) surge in popularity on the desktop/laptop side of things which I know has been years if not decades in the making.With the current Linux landscape, is there any reason to expect Linux mobile to get increased attention, and if so when would be reasonable to expect mature software that could see wide uptake? From what I have found, it isn’t there yet but I do not have the knowledge to understand how far away this future may be.",

      "content_preview": "Technology for real impactThere is one thing that many of us here on Reddit have in common: a passion for using technology to not only build cool features, but also to create real impact. For example: using smart AI to create solutions that reduce CO2 or realise projects that benefit millions of people. But what does that actually mean?You want to......work with AI technologies?...reduce CO2 emissions?...work in international teams?...have flexible working hours?...benefit from individual support?...have a job that inspires you?Sounds great? But what does it really mean?What's behind the buzzwords?When it comes to technologies that will shape our future, some of these big buzzwords often pop up: AI, metaverse, digital twins, etc. Sounds fancy, but what's behind the buzz? Here at Siemens, it means that engineers are working with innovative tools that digitalise industrial processes, reduce CO2 emissions or make every day working life easier for everyone.And that's exactly what our CTO addressed recently at CES - how the engineers behind Siemens Tech are implementing innovations, in real projects, for our customers and how we’ll use them to work together on future projects.Improving the everyday lives of many people – and get involved yourself?What really matters? Projects that make a difference and people who want to do more than just move their mouse. 😉 Many engineers want to tinker with the technologies of tomorrow. And that's the challenge. Tech develops quickly, so you always have to stay on top of things. But that's what makes it exciting.So, what does that look like in practice? Here's a video that shows how we realise ideas - and what that means for the everyday lives of many people:What does that mean for you?The exciting part is that many teams work together globally – from Germany to the USA, from China to the UK. Working remotely and flexibly has long been the standard for us. Part-time working, sabbaticals or hybrid models are not an extra, but part of the job.It is important to us that you feel comfortable in our company. Because great ideas can only emerge and grow in a positive, appreciative working environment.You can find an overview of the benefits at Siemens here:https://www.siemens.com/us/en/company/jobs.htmlFeeling curious?If you want to learn more, check out our careers page to see what awaits you with us.
