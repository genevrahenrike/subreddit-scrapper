      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, I will start taking Astrobiome and I’m planning to document the journey. For anyone who hasn’t heard of it, Astrobiome is marketed as a “postbiotic metabolite complex.” Most of us know about probiotics, the live bacteria you take for gut health, and prebiotics, which are the fibers that feed those bacteria. Postbiotics are the bioactive compounds that come after fermentation, basically the real molecules that do the work in your body. What makes Astrobiome stand out is that it doesn’t just stick to one metabolite like butyrate, which is what a lot of other companies focus on. It includes a whole mix of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, acetate, and propionate, plus some really interesting mitochondrial peptides such as Humanin and MOTS-c analogs. These are being studied for their role in energy, longevity, and recovery. So the idea is that you’re not just helping gut health but also supporting resilience, energy, focus, and even athletic recovery. It’s not cheap at all. I paid $150 with a discount for a month’s supply, which is pretty wild. So the way I’m approaching this is as an experiment. I’ll be paying attention to my energy, digestion, recovery from training, focus, and sleep to see if it lives up to the hype. If it actually works, it could be a game-changer. If not, then at least I’ll know and hopefully save others some money.",

I've ruled out any oral issues being the problem....this is a gut issue. Does anyone know or any particular types of bacteria in the gut that could be causing this? Or if microbiome mapping could help pinpoint why I have this? I also struggle with IBS (belching, bloating) for certain types of foods (garlic, raw onions mainly). A parent also had bad breath and a dodgy stomach, so I'm fairly convinced that I've just inherited the same type of gut bacteria. Also worth mentioning that I had bad eczema when I was younger and around the age of 14 I suddenly developed stomach allergies to nuts and shellfish (from seemingly out of nowhere). Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!",

      "content_preview": "I have complex MCAS, STAPH colonisation and SIBO Im currently waiting on a new gut test and a sibo test to arrive rn. I had a gut test last year which showed dysbiosis and bad fat malabsorption. Since then I’ve had food poisoning and more antibiotics. I am having a lot of weird symptoms EXTREME symptoms after having antibiotics. I now can no longer torelate antihistamines, supplements or medications. I was on antibiotics on and off for eight years and I’ve kind of realised what the root causes and what is going on with my health: -Antibiotics- less good bacteria- sibo- mcas- I have severe MCAS and histamine intolerance because of no good bacteria (said undetectable amounts of lacto & bif) but I also have sibo. My breathe, sweat, urine and stool smell like sulfur. Catch 22. No good bacteria and sibo. Both make each other worse by treating the other. My kidneys are very affected by this all. I have a lot of pain but my tests are ‘normal but I have a lot of debris in my bladder. I can’t process the toxins from meat due to the no good bacteria so I can’t tolerate protein (urea toxins) and I can’t tolerate supplements without having a near life ending reaction from histamine and extreme kidney pain. My body isn’t making neurotransmitters properly either due to the fact I’m having no protein, have no good bacteria to make them, and I’m constantly reacting to everything. It’s causing me very very intense neuropsychological symptoms. Every system in my body feels like I’m being poisoned everyday. I’m down to white rice and even the act of eating full stop causes me to react. I’m reacting to everything- being alive haha. My histamine bucket is just full all day everyday? The root cause needs to be addressed first and I don’t know how too. If I could just get some good bacteria in, I could start tolerating meat again and maybe some supplements to fix the sibo. But probiotics trigger sibo. I’ve seen some people on here who can’t also tolerate meds but then I never seen them posting again. Any insight to my experience?",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I’m sharing this to provide hope and information to people as well as discuss the concerns I still have. 10 months ago I took Clarithromycin which wreaked havoc on my digestive system. The day after I started taking them I had black stools with some blood and terrible abdominal pain. After 3.5 days of taking the antibiotic I decided to stop. I was put on PPIs for a month due to the black stools. During that month I got the flu shot and over a week later I got ringing in my ears. I kept on with the PPIs because what choice did I have? After a few days being off the PPIs the black stools returned, tarry this time. Following this, I was put on PPIs for a second month. Following this I became fed up with the PPIs and yellow stools. I knew it was a bandaid solution. I decided I was done with pharmaceuticals and needed to fix my GI system. It has been a LONG journey but let me tell you what I learned. I went to a naturopath. I was put on deglycerized licorice (DGL) chews and “GI soothe” supplement (contains DGL, slippery elm, and marshmallow root) which I took before every meal. My stools began to go from pitch black to brown!!! I believe it’s from taking these supplements which coat and soothe your GI tract. Thank God. However I was very constipated. My stools remained hard and small like pebbles. This has lasted until a month or so ago. A GI doc suggested I take an osmotic laxative (restoralax) which did help somewhat with regularity, but my stools remained hard rocks. It took an exceptionally long time, but I can finally report my stools are a normal colour and consistency. They are sometimes slightly loose and on the odd occasion I’ll get diarrhea. I’m going about once a day now which is also similar to how I was before all this. A comprehensive stool analysis done with my naturopath also revealed extremely high citrobacter freundii complex, low bifidobacterium, low lactobacillus, and low butyric acid. I went anti-inflammatory, low FODMAP for my sensitive system, and MEVY (meats, eggs, vegetables, yogurt) for the citrobacter freundii complex. I completely changed my diet - no refined sugar, no dairy except kefir and butter, no gluten except 100% organic sourdough. No seed oils, no extremely fatty meats, no deep fried foods. I added in probiotic supplements to address the dysbiosis. For probiotics I mainly take metagenics which contains various strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacteium. However I also during this time took 3 packages of align’s extra strength at different points. In the past few months I incorporated s. Boullardi which i think helped me turn a corner and now am weaning off. To address the low butyric acid I started taking sodium butyrate but just one a day. I also started taking in probiotics through food. I am eating sauerkraut, kefir (dairy or coconut), non-sugar kombucha, and most recently, kimchi. To manage the high citrobacter freundii complex I started taking a supplement from my naturopath that contained grapefruit seed extract. I also drank ginger tea, licorice tea, hibiscus tea (also targets e.coli), and mint tea. Vitamin C also helps. As does taking an iron supplement. To support my GI lining I did a few things. I took l-glutamine powder dissolved in water 2 - 3 x a day. I made sure I had 1 scoop in water on an empty stomach in the morning and one glass in the evening as the last thing I drank. I started taking zinc carnosine which I think also helped me turn a corner. To aid in the digestion of fats - whenever I have a slightly fatty meal like at dinner I take a digestive enzymes supplement that contains both herbals and ox bile in it. I also sometimes take pancreatic enzymes. Drinking dandelion root tea is also supposed to help. I also don’t eat too much fat at once and stick to healthy fats and definitely not seed oils. I can’t tolerate fried foods and even olive oil chips caused diarrhea so I just don’t chance it. But my body can now tolerate most healthy fats in moderation  - although I still break out in acne and I’m pretty sure from fats. If anyone has ideas on this let me know. To help with constipation I have been taking  PHGG in water with a little bit of fruit juice, pears, plums, leafy greens, and other fibrous foods. I also at one point was heavily taking Metamucil and the osmotic laxative but I’ve tried to wean off it. I also think a big cup of green tea helps with the movement but I am mindful that caffeine is hard on the digestive system. Other supplements I take consistently are magnesium, methyl b complex which contains methyl folate and a bunch of B vitamins in their proper form and Dr. Berg electrolyte powder which contains calcium, magnesium, chloride, sodium, and potassium. I also try to get vitamin D through sunlight everyday but if not, I have a vitamin D+K supplement. Supplements I take occasionally include NAC, coenzyme Q-10, omega 3, turmeric, quecertain, bromelain, beef liver, and iodine in my water. It’s been a long road and I thought I was dying a few times. Not everything in my digestive system is fully there yet, but I’m glad to report I don’t feel on death’s door anymore and my abdomen is not in constant pain now. That said, I’m not completely out of the woods. Recently I have had a day of vomitting and a day of explosive diarrhea. My system is still sensitive and I’m not sure what is triggering these issues. I noticed I get nauseas intensely sometimes - even just to smells. If I have a big salad or fibrous foods sometimes the left area under my rib cage becomes intensely painful like it’s seizing up. Sometimes my stomach also feels crampy even to the point I have a hard time walking/breathing momentarily. I remain very sensitive to fatty foods like chips or anything in oil - even panfried. It’s something about oxidized oils and seed oils. I also would be cautious of very fatty meats, pork, and too much olive oil. I’ve had a bunch of tests done including an endoscopy, scope, abdominal CT, ultrasound, stool samples, blood tests, and urine tests without a definitive cause. I am not celiac according to their tests. I have been diagnosed with mild chronic gastritis and constipation into my small intestines so likely have functional constipation/motility issues. I have lost over 30 lbs. and am having difficulties not losing more weight and putting weight on. If anyone has ideas on what might be going on in part or whole, please let me know. I have never had so much chicken breast and yams/rice/cooked then cooled potatoes in my life before! And boiled eggs for breakfast! Yay for safe foods. What I want to say is thank you to everyone who provided insight, shared information, talked about their experience, shared anecdotal evidence, and research articles. I am very grateful to have found you and I don’t know where I’d be now if I hadn’t looked to Reddit. The only reason I got on here was because I was desperate with my health situation, but I’m so grateful and find encouragement in the people who are also struggling but persisting. I want to say hang in there, it could take a really long time, but have hope that things will slowly get better. I’m here if anyone has questions or wants prayer. Much love. ❤️",

I’m currently looking into FMT (fecal microbiota transplantation) as a possible solution. Before committing to such a procedure, I want to make sure I do the right steps to confirm whether it’s likely to help in my specific case. For those who have gone through FMT or have experience in this field: What tests, evaluations, or consultations would you recommend doing first? Are there specific markers or conditions that clearly indicate FMT might be effective? Any red flags or situations where FMT is not worth pursuing? I’m not looking for medical advice specific to me, just general guidance on where to start and how to make an informed decision. Thanks in advance for your insights!",

My motion was fine before I started taking it, but since taking it, I barely pass motion. My tongue is also constantly white, and my doc suspected candida overgrowth, part of the reason why she prescribed this probiotic. What should I do?  What does my motion being bad mean?",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, My father spent several months in ICU and continues to test positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae in both throat sputum and rectal swabs, 7 months later. He’s otherwise stable, no current signs of infection (no fever, chest issues, etc.), so we’re assuming it’s colonisation. It's not on the skin. In Austria, tests showed it's MRGN 4 (the highest level of multidrug resistance). We’re being very cautious with hygiene and monitoring, but we’re struggling to find any effective strategies to help his body eliminate or reduce colonisation . We’ve been told there’s no treatment unless it turns into an active infection, but I’m wondering — what else can we do to help his body clear it? Thanks in advance",

      "content_preview": "First of all I want to say THANK YOU so much for everyone who has been contributing to this thread. You think that you are leaving a small comment here or there but you don’t understand how much helpful and life changing that comment is for someone else ❤️ I have been reading in this thread but I want to share my condition and what my protocol hoping that someone can help me further or let me know if this is expected. I have always had acid reflux and I was put on PPI around 10 years ago. As time went by my acid reflux got better and I started phasing it out to the point where I was taking 1 pill every 2 weeks. However I started developing symptoms like having to go #2 30 mins after food, lactose intolerance (even though I am over 30), horrible insomnia (average 3 hours). Fast forward to around 1.5 years ago where I started developing new symptoms along with acids reflux (came back). I had: -white tongue -soar throat -dry and burning sensation in mouth and lips -cramps -very very bad breath -gases and bloating -liquid like stool and very smelly I did a couple of endoscopies and a colonoscopy, did a breath test for h pylori, a mouth swap for candida, blood test for h pylori and nothing came back with a detection. Tried probiotics, ACV (made my acid worst), kombucha, bland diet, a lot of green smoothies, no sugar and was also put on nystatin multiple rounds. Nothing helped. So I decided to go to a naturopath and did this GI stool test which was finally a test that came back with detections (I was so happy because at least now I know I am not going crazy and I do have something wrong). The naturopath placed me on these medications (microbx, gastromend and glutaloemine). On week one I also added oil of oregano for 3 days. In that week I felt super fatigue, very bad mood, and I don’t think there was any changes in my symptoms. 4 weeks went by and I didn’t notice any progress so I started doing some reading and chatgpt and decided to add a binder (GI Detox+), dandelion root tea, Zinc carnosine, and going to sauna 4 days a week. Since starting this I feel like my symptoms are worst (across the board) including my hair and skin getting super dry and looking very unhealthy. I also lost weight because I am sticking to a low fodmap diet and eating smaller meals. On week 5 I added Phosphatidylcholine because I thought maybe I need to support my liver to remove toxins. I also discovered that I am low in vitamin d3 (and I take 50,000 every week since 5 weeks already), vitamin b12 deficient (which I had to stop taking because it gave me more acid reflux) I also stopped going to the gym (honestly it doesn’t matter because no matter how hard I hit the gym or stick to a high protein diet for years I look like a person who never stepped a foot in the gym - I just can’t build muscles). I even tested my testosterone, doctor told me it is low normal and I should just go to the gym and diet 😢 I have been on this for 7 weeks but I am not seeing any progress (not even small progress that can encourage me to continue)",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone. I'm just going to copy/paste a post i made on the c.diff reddit forum to here, as it accurately described my issues/journey and where i'm at. I thought i'd come to this community because i figured you might give me extra angles and perspectives, or suggestions to help tackle this problem; ie, probiotics to take, prebiotics, any services i can use that test my microbiome? that sort of thing. I would really, hugely appreciate any and all suggestions and advice. Anywhoo, onto my post: i'm a 35yo male with no known immune disorders or major health issues - EXCEPT for being underweight and having mild and chronic GI sensitivities (moslty attributed to mental health/anxiety) ive taken amoxicillin 4 times in my entire life - no other antibiotic. Tooth infections. Basically i have no past history of excessive antibitioc use. My stools though, were always fairly regular, firm to near hard, and typically once a day. So, how did i get c.diff? Debatable. i got C.diff (or, at least, it made itself known) back in december last year. a close relative died in hospital and i was spending ALOT of time at their bedside. Emotionally it destroyed me, and the theory is i likely picked it up from hospital and it took over my body during that grief. My relative was not formally diagnosed with C.Diff or displayed symptoms. That, or i've had it for many years (would explain my gi issues for decades) and the trauma of grief allowed it to take over to a significant degree. The onset occured within a few weeks of my relatives passing; I was getting profuse and foul smelling loose stools - porridge like in appearance, and it just wouldn't go away. going between 3-10 times a day, with gradual worsening urgency. anywhoo, after a round of Vancomycin and fairly rapid recovery, a week later i developed re-occurance - it was fairly brutal, and hospitalized me. It near gave me sepsis - high heartrate, fever, agonizing stomach pain) I was given a course of Fidaxomycin (Dificid) and this seemed to slowly bring me back. I was sent home within a week to finish the course. Time marched on, weeks and months passed - slowly - With frequent and intense fear and panic; i have major health anxiety, and the nature of C.Diff is elusive and surprising. So, yeah, traumatic to say the least. It did however make me invest significantly in probiotics and eating better. (S.Boulardii, Symprove, etc) which i took RELIGIOUSLY daily. fast forward to 12 days ago, i gave a stool sample at the doctor's at their request; i complained of weakness and fatigue. My bowel movements were....inconsistent. (never back to pre-c.diff quality, but no foul smell, sometimes toothpaste/mushy, sometimes semi-solid) but ot herwise not alarming. anywhoo, a couple days later, i was C.diff toxin B positive. I'm so exhausted by this now. And i've started another course of Fidaxo/Dificid. I've popped my last tablet and i feel so deflated, weak and just \"off\". My last bowel movement earlier was typical, very soft, getting softer as it passed to pure mush. can anyone here relate? I really dont understand how i could have this, especially with the level or reoccurance given that i'm not excessively \"poorly\" or suffer with chronic diseases like many others. I'm so tired (and, honestly? terrified) of this. When i first started this fidaxomicin/Dificid course, my stools seemed to firm up and go very good within a day or two. Now i've observed they're just mushy like this and i generally feel pretty gross. And i'm utterly terrified of a reoccurance like what occured before that hospitalized me (from the Vancomycin) anyone else got any experience or similar story with the loosening of stools on Dificid? edit- Should also mention i spent a small fortune buying \"Clinell\" wipes, green and red (red advertising they kill C.Diff specifically) that i used frequently for months. Alongside regular hand washing (again, anxiety tendancies you'd think would help!) So, even in spite of all of this, and regularly disinfecting, i still got this god damn infection, again. And im otherwise a moderately healthy young individual.",

I’ve been reading on a number of forums that people have issue with the liquid form ‘melting’/‘dissolving’ the capsules. I was wondering if I could get a bunch of maltodextron and trehalose powder at the correct ratios, then squirt some FMat solution over the powder to make a somewhat sticky/solid material to then encapsulate. Any advise would be appreciated.",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been reading up on the links between NAD+ metabolism and the gut microbiome, and it's surprisingly complex. A few papers suggest that NAD+ precursors like NR and NMN may indirectly influence gut function by modulating inflammation, supporting barrier integrity, and even impacting microbiota composition  though most of this is still in preclinical or rodent models. I’ve personally been using NAD+ support as part of a larger metabolic wellness routine (via a telehealth platform called Elevated  they focus more on structure and rhythm than just supplements), and I’ve noticed improvements in digestion and bloating that I wasn’t really expecting. I have PCOS and used to get a lot of lower GI discomfort around hormonal shifts  this has been way more manageable since I started combining NAD+ with regular meal timing and daily movement. My questions for the community: Has anyone here tracked gut changes or symptom relief while supplementing NAD+ precursors? Are there any human trials showing microbiome modulation tied directly to NAD+ levels? Could the benefit be more about circadian alignment/metabolic rhythm, which then improves gut health? Appreciate any insight, studies, or anecdotal experiences trying to connect dots beyond just what we see on product labels.",

Im someone who has had gut issues for my entire life where every few months I will have a kind of attack which more or less renders me useless for that night. But so far its been bearable and Ive mostly been functional. Some time last year it suddenly got worse and more frequent so I went to a specialised gut doctor who gave me some probiotics called pro gut which I took for a while. It helped a bit at the start but the moment I stopped my stomach went into overdrive and started cramping and making me feel nauseous. Instead of a few months I now have attacks every few days and Im constantly feeling like puking and clutching my sides in pain. Went back to the doctor and did all tests including an ultrasound, breath test, endoscopy etc and was diagnosed with IBS for which I was told there was no cure. Its been six months since then and Im still feeling nauseous and crampy all the time, with only a few days in a given week where I feel fine. Im not sure what to do now, have tried everything from peppermint pills to purging any high fodmap foods etc but its not helping me prevent these random attacks. Does anyone have any experience on how to handle this?",

Today another household member bought a side table from marketplace second hand, the seller also dropped in after the purchase that she had c-diff last year some time. The side table was still taken, not knowing the power of c-diff and how spores can still cause harm for months. The table is now staying outdoors till it can be cleaned with bleached before it enters the house, is this going to be enough to completely eliminate c-diff? I’m really concerned about a c-diff outbreak in the household which would be catastrophic for the vulnerable household member.",

This past week and a half I’ve been waking up with diarrhea every morning. It’s getting a little better but definitely not how it was before. It’s also causing a lot of fatigue. For reference, I have Hashimotos, MCAS, and POTS so certainly that can contribute, but like I said my gut was feeling pretty good until the bad sushi. I take Seed probiotic, saccharomyces boulardi, and l glutamine for gut support. Is there anything else I should do or any diet I should follow? I’m gluten free currently. How can I heal it?",

      "content_preview": "Everyone heard about the gut health claims: The way its connected to your brain, your skin, immune system and nutrient absorption. And they are all true. Then you search on ways to improve your gut health and you find: Reduce your stress, increase your amount of exercise, improve your sleep, drink more water, eat a big variety of foods and... eat more fiber? People fill their plates with fruit, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes, believing they’re feeding their gut. but most of the fiber people eat for gut health doesn’t actually help the gut. Fiber recommendations of 25–38 grams/day weren’t designed around gut ecology or brain function. They were built to prevent constipation and lower colon cancer risk. Only five fiber types have real, human-proven benefits. Everything else is animal data, which Chris explains pretty well its not very useful in this case https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/the-greatest-error-in-microbiome . 1-Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) (6 g/day) Proven in RCTs to lower cortisol, ease anxiety, boost Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus, improve calcium uptake, and reduce infections . https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-014-3810-0 The only fiber type with proven mood/cognition effects in humans. 2-Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) (5 g/day) Increases Bifidobacteria, speeds up stool in constipated people, and enhances calcium & magnesium absorption. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11675838/ https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-5-8 3-Inulin  (7 g/day) Feeds butyrate-producers (Faecalibacterium, Roseburia), raises mineral absorption, and lowers liver fat in NAFLD patients. Boosts Bifidobacteria. https://www.nature.com/articles/1602127 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/effects-of-inulintype-fructans-on-lipid-metabolism-in-man-and-in-animal-models/C7AB49178C1505A85201489E206D5C53 4-Resistant Starch  (15 g/day) Boosts fecal butyrate, improves insulin sensitivity, raises GLP-1/PYY, and blunts post-meal glucose spikes . https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4928258 5-Psyllium (7 g/day) Clinically proven to lower LDL cholesterol, tame blood-sugar spikes, and normalize stool consistency in IBS and constipation. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522030076 All other fibers either add bulk or feed microbes modestly, but lack hard human outcomes. Insoluble fiber is the most common one, it adds bulk and speeds up movement, but its poorly fermented – it doesn’t feed your gut microbes much. Soluble fiber forms a gel that help the stool to form properly. It feeds microbes a little bit and smooths digestion. Most people get too much insoluble fiber, and not enough of the 3 types that matter for gut–brain health. Im gonna use myself as an example, my diet in an usual day has 300 g of sweet potatoes 200g of yam 2 bananas 1 avocado. I get a ton of insoluble fiber, but almost no resistant starch. Little to no fermentable oligosaccharides. Nearly zero gut fuel remains. Even tho cronometer will say i have 40g of fiber a day. Conclusion If you main focus is fixing stool, 8–12g soluble fiber and insoluble to keep structure, but not dominate (10-15g) may do the trick. But if you want to get the real benefits of gut health try going for the proven fibers above and add polyphenol-rich foods to supercharge SCFA production and barrier integrity.",

I stopped using them over a month ago, but the situation has not improved. My blood test results are good (there are no issues with my kidneys or liver). I stay well-hydrated, floss, and brush my teeth daily. I don’t drink or smoke. I have already visited both a dentist and a GP, but they were unable to help. My blood tests are fine, and my condition is not due to reflux. I started taking probiotics (Mouthgenics and BioGaia) a few days ago but have not seen any results yet, and I am worried that they will not work because of my low pH. I live in the UK. Can you please help me? How can I raise my oral pH and rebuild healthy bacteria? Thank you.",

      "content_preview": "35, M. History: acidic sensation in stomach lead me to push for hpylori stool test in 2020. Was positive. Did triple therapy antibiotic and tested negative after. Did 4 breath tests, 1 stool test over span of 9 months after and all negative. EGD showed mild gastritis with 2 small peptic ulcers. This is from someone who maybe has <10 alcoholic drinks a month and eats fairly bland, minimal processed foods. Continued normal diet, did 1 month of antacid. 1 year later, EGD was completely clean. All my blood labs are normal - CBC, liver function, thyroid, full rheumatology panel, urinalysis, metabolic, pancreatic enzyme, and inflammatory markers CRP and ESR. Fecal Calprotectin is <10 every test. No bacteria or parasites found in general full doctor ordered panels in 2 years, 2 tests. Fecal elastase was over 800. I did a Thorne test in 2020 after my EGD and it showed dysbiosis: elevated staph aureus, eserichia coli, strep, etc but also some overly high good bacteria like Bifido and others. I’ve been doing fine this past year after getting on a TCA of 10mg (Nortriptyline to calm my mind). Every month in the past 6 months I average 18-23 bowel movements a month. I go every day, within 1hr of waking up but the urgency comes on fairly quick and within 10-15mins later I’m going. Forced easy to pass, quick but it’s not that cracked log texture I had probably the last 15+ years of my life I can remember. Unsure if the antibiotics for HPylori caused this disruption 4 years ago or what.. My stool texture/consistency however is like a Bristol 4 but in Bristol 5 amounts. Smaller 1-2” softer pieces. Don’t really break apart when flushing. The color ranges light to dark brown.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all - I’d never had any issues before a few years ago. Then during a surgery my colon was perforated and I had a colon resection and ended up with a colostomy. Two weeks after that I had another colon resection. Then after 6 months the colostomy was reversed. When all of that happened I had sepsis and had MANY antibiotics. Then back in December I had a hernia repair.  My abdomen has been through it and gut has not been the same since. I never had acid reflux or constipation before and now I have both. My doctor told me I am on my way to getting Barrett’s Esophagus as well. I’m exhausted. I do eat better. But not as well as I should so I want to be transparent. I was overweight and lost 40 lbs last years. I am on my way to losing another 20 before years end. I have a weight goal in mind. I have  started a newer way of eating. Cleaner, more fiber, more veggies and fruits and less processed sugar. But I was given a prescription for acid reflux and it stopped working. So I started taking Prilosec and it works 85% of the time. Then a friend suggested Flora Biome to me. It seemed to work great and I only had 1 flare up. But I also started have migraines like crazy. I don’t know if they were related so yesterday I stopped taking it. I genuinely don’t know what to do at this point. I am so frustrated and tired of doing the wrong things. And thinking “oh yay this finally makes me feel better” only to have another issue come up days later. I would like so badly to reset and get my gut to normal but I don’t know what to do. Especially with my history of antibiotics. Any advice?",

      "content_preview": "Half of my root-canaled tooth (lower 6) fell out three months ago, and the dentist placed a temporary filling. Somewhere behind or below that filling, bacteria started to cause a really bad smell. The filling was removed after a few weeks, but during that time, I also began to notice a slightly sour taste in my mouth/saliva constantly—especially after waking up. Later, the entire tooth was extracted, but the taste persisted and has also been causing bad breath. I’m worried that either the bacteria from the filling (it smelled REALLY bad for a second or two when it was removed at the dental office) and/or the chemical mouthwashes I used at the time may have caused this unusual taste and bad breath by creating a bacterial imbalance, which has continued even now—two months after the tooth extraction and after stopping mouthwashes. The pocket from the extracted tooth is clean, free of food, and almost fully healed. I do not feel any pain, swelling, redness, or signs of inflammation anywhere. My blood test results are good (no issues with my kidneys or liver), I stay well-hydrated, and I floss and brush my teeth daily. I don`t drink or smoke. The dentist examined my mouth and said he did not see anything that could be causing this taste, but I still have it. My GP (I live in the UK) is also unsure, and the reflux medication Omeprazole did not help. I feel that my digestion is ok. The problem began when I experienced this terrible temporary filling infection and used mouthwashes, so I would consider that the direct cause. Could you help me understand what it did and how to fix it? I guess that it can be lowered PH in my mouth, and overgrowth of bad, acidic bacteria causing bad taste and breath?",
