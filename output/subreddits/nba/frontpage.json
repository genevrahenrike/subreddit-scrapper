And that presents its own playing-field quandary. Getting a player of Leonard’s caliber for, say, the mid-level exception would launch a bizarre sweepstakes the likes of which the NBA has never seen.You thought the Warriors getting Durant in 2016 because of a cap spike was unfair? Imagine if the Oklahoma City Thunder get Leonard for $8.5 million, what remains of their non-taxpayer mid-level exception, per Keith Smith’s cap analysis.

It’s about time we called out their BS, because they’ve sold their integrity and journalistic credibility for the sake of lucrative broadcasting deals, clickbait engagement, and corporate influence.Recent examples:— They cut a deal for the NFL to purchase 10% equity in their company, damaging their journalistic independence in favorite of rights deals and ill-gotten influence.— They downsized their Enterprise/Investigative Unit, including firing reporters who were pivotal in uncovering the NFL CTE and NCAA money scandals.— They backed out of a partnership with PBS Frontline to produce an NFL concussion documentary, reportedly as a result of capitulating to NFL pressure.— They canceled Outside the Lines.— They demoted E:60 from a weekly schedule to an “occasional” (irregular) special.— Meanwhile, they hire clickbait artists for shout-y nonsense shows and fire more of their best journalists.— Countless other examples, big and small.ESPN is not to be trusted as a source of truth in the sports media landscape any longer. The days of Stuart Scott, Bob Ley, Jackie MacMullan, Tom Farrey, and Keith Olbermann are LONG gone.And I’m pissed, to be honest. Because sports fans deserve better; we deserve the truth through aggressive and independent reporting. And the powerful entities who control the sports ecosystem need to be held accountable.So yeah, pls joint me in telling ESPN to F-off, and let’s all go subscribe to The Athletic.",

      "content_preview": "TLDR is at the bottomBut the Leonard deal was a curious one, a source within the company told Boston Sports Journal.According to our source, none of the high-powered executives were consulted about the massive, $28 million endorsement deal Leonard signed, and Cherny never presented the deal to Aspiration’s Board of Directors.BSJ has learned the deal was presented to the executive team as-is, with no opportunity for further analysis.The $28 million deal was to be paid in quarterly installments over four years,but it was not the only compensation Leonard received. According to a high-level source, Leonard also cut a side deal with Aspiration to receive an additional $20 million in company stock. The stock was to be paid out from Sanberg’s personal holdings in the company over four years.That brought the total of promised compensation to Leonard to $48 million.Around the same time as the Leonard deal, Aspiration was going through its rounds of fundraising. They had raised approximately $600 million, including the previously mentioned $250 million from Oak Tree Capital Management. That number also included a $50 million investment from Ballmer. That investment has been characterized to Boston Sports Journal as having been made with light-to-no diligence.The commitment from Ballmer was also curious, as he paid a higher price for his shares than others. The Oak Tree commitment to Aspiration came at $10 a share,but Ballmer paid a premium of $11 per share, raising his overall investment to $50 million.Typically, an investor of Ballmer’s caliber would have been wooed with a discounted share price, so the company could tout the investment of a major player.Source:https://www.bostonsportsjournal.com/2025/09/04/exclusive-kawhi-leonard-endorsement-deal-that-triggered-nba-investigation-actually-worth-48-millionTLDR:Kawhi had a separate side deal with Aspiration for $20 million in stock options. Add that to the original $28 million deal andhe was actually paid $48 million total by the company.Steve Ballmer invested $50 million into the companySo, In other words,nearly all of Ballmer’s $50 million investment was paid directly to Kawhi Leonard, using Aspiration as a go-between.",

      "content_preview": "I listened to Danny Green's podcast to see if he would have any inside perspective on the Kawhi situation given the proximity to the Raptors and 2019 free agency as a whole. He says he didn't know anything about it and would never get a deal like that because he's a role player.What was interesting was the tone he and his co-host had about the whole situation. His co-host Harrison Sanford, who also works for ESPN Radio, completely without irony, proudly calls himself a \"journalist\" but also says he would never want to report anything that hurts the image of those he is covering and characterizes Pablo's reporting as \"checking your pockets\" or basically snitching.Sanford:\"This delineates the type of journalist Pablo Torre is and ... journalists like me. If I found that out, I might ask for a favor, but that's between us. I'm not about to check your pockets. I'm not reporting that you got up to 28 million dollars for a no show job. Because I'm not trying to get on Kawhi's bad side, he could give me an exclusive interview! I'm not trying to get on Steve Ballmer's bad side. Because the Clippers are going to exist for the next 50-100 years. I want to be able to walk into that building and talk to people and have relationships that could lead me to other breaking news that doesn't necessarily hurt the image or perception of the people that I'm covering. But then there are the Pablo Torres of the world who are gonna do it anyway.\"This is what everyone accuses Shams or Shelburne or others of being, but it's remarkable to hear someone admit it so proudly and seemingly not have any awareness of how it sounds. Their worldview appears to be that the access journalist that never reports anything negative is the good kind of journalist comparatively. Neither Green nor his co-host could seem to comprehend there being any reason to report this other than wanting to be \"first\" to report some news. Green says if he were a reporter he would have essentially blackmailed Kawhi and the Clippers into giving him special treatment.Source clip:https://streamable.com/8usl99",

Then she asks if he’d be interested in what Kawhi has to say, and he goes (paraphrasing):“That’s really his business with Aspiration, so I wouldn’t ask him about it.”That right there is the dead giveaway.Think about it: Kawhi gets$28M for doing literally nothingplus$20M in free equity, while Ballmer had to spend$50M of his own money just to get 3%of the same company. A company that supposedly 'defrauded' him.And we’re supposed to believe good old Steve-o isn’t the slightest bit curious how Kawhi fleeced Aspiration while Aspiration fleeced everyone else?The truth is blatantly obvious:Ballmer doesn’t want Kawhi talking AND they’ve almost certainly already spoken and agreed to stick to a certain story.The idea that Ballmer hasn’t asked Kawhi a single question, and has zero interest in how he got paid tens of millions for nothing is the clearest proof he’s lying about this whole situation.",

I’ve spent my 15 year career knowing that one day I would have to walk away, and yet actually saying goodbye to basketball today has been the hardest decision I’ve ever made.It's been the honor of a lifetime to compete against the fiercest competitors under the brightest lights and to challenge what the world thought was possible for someone who looks like me. I've lived out my wildest childhood dreams to play in front of fans all around the world. I will forever be the kid who felt fully alive everytime I touched a basketball.So many people have sacrificed and poured into my journey, more than I could ever repay. Thank you all for believing in me, for walking with me, for celebrating my highs and picking me up in my lows. This is a ride I never wanted to end but I know it’s time. I will forever miss playing basketball in front of you all but our time will go beyond just playing. Here’s to what’s ahead.Love you all ❤️",

Now they’ve been eliminated in the group phase in what was a thrilling fight to the end against Greece. This game was the stuff of legends.For Spain: Former nba player Juancho Hernangomez choked on 3 free throws at the end of the game and Santi Aldama was 2/11 from the field and also missed a clutch free throw.Source:https://www.fiba.basketball/en/events/fiba-eurobasket-2025/games/122991-ESP-GRE#boxscoreNote: They gave Giannis credit at the end for the rebound even though it looked like he got it after the buzzer so I edited the post",
