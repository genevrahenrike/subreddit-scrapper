The text will not be smaller than 6mm and ideally up to 0.7mm thick. I have been looking online and it seems we need a 50W fiber laser but I have no experience in lasers having only dealt with 3d printers. I have been given a budget of up to 2000gbp. Could some kind person please advize me on this as I have no idea where else to ask? Thank you kindkly for your time.",

But recently i bought an old Epilog Helix with new tube, for around 8k to add on to my collection, not so pleasant, yet atleast. I really dont care about funticons cameras etc, RF and an automated the workflow is my thing, i dont want to click a single thing. Epilog lasers has an API but apprently not for an old Helix, eventhough the salesman said so. Iam a bit stuck here i dont want to use corelldraw or some other program with functions that i dont want, how do you guys optimate you workflow? Sholud i just send the laser back and buy a new one from epilog with API? My old workflow, website -> parsed json string-> python-> SVG-> print.",

Sometimes I only need to get a rectangle with precise measurements, sometimes I have to cut out: for example a rectangle with an \"S\"-shaped hole... so I need the laser to be able to interface with a PC that sends it the drawing. I wish to get the cheapest machine that can do the job.... Can you recommend some models? I've seen some small laser cutters on Aliexpress, but when they list the cutting thickness for acrylic, they always show a matte sheet. Is cutting transparent material more difficult? Are acrylic and plexiglass the same thing? Thank you !",

I am hoping there is a device that has both of these features together so I don't need to figure out how to get two separate devices to work together.

I was able to for the most part to get that eliminated, but now it’s move to mirror 3. After it goes through mirror 3 to the cutter lense I got it centered straight through the hole, but now I can’t even get it to leave a mark on the fabric. I’m so confused and lost.

Since I also spend a lot of time coding, I ended up building a small program that takes any regular picture and automatically turns it into an .svg file. It splits the image into elements and creates an SVG that you can just drop straight into LightBurn and send to the laser. Right now I’ve only been running it locally on my computer and it works great. I was wondering, would anyone else actually find this useful? If there’s interest, I could make it public so everyone can use it. Also, I added a feature where you can just type a prompt to generate a design, and boom, you instantly get an SVG file ready to cut. What do you guys think, is this something worth sharing?",

      "content_preview": "So I focus using my Omtech 80watt for making marine / boat stereo / gauge / dash panels. So I am copying an existing dash, and then cutting it with my laser CNC, and then installing it for the customer. Some panels, I can take home from the marina I am working, then I have a 36\"x48\" rulled mat with some really detailed markings I take photos from above with my iPhone 15 Pro, (has a front to back and side to side level you can turn on), I photoshop it to remove what i don't need, and then add the photo in Lightburn, and check a couple measurements to get it scaled correctly. I would really enjoy finding some sort of handheld LIDAR scanner I can basically scan a panel, leave it in the clients vessel, and then take that file and import it into Lightburn so I can basically cut whatever I need. Is there anything out there or anyone doing similar could steer me? Thank you in advance.",

I didn’t think it smelt bad at first but when the pieces are kept in a box then it gets quite bad. I’ve gone through the steps of dialing the laser in to minimize burn (edges are a dark tan now rather than a full char!). Experimenting with sanding and wiping down with various agents (water, soap, wet wipes, alcohol) and leaving out doors to air. That’s all helped to reduce the smell drastically, however it still seems to build up if kept sealed in a box. Any tips? Will a layer of clear coat spray help seal the smell in?",

I'm shopping to replace my laser, but in the ten years since I bought it SO MANY new models have hit the market that I'm awash in search results and product reviews, and I'm struggling to narrow the list down to models that meet my (fairly specific) criteria. I feel like I'm trying to find two apples to compare in a ball pit filled with ten thousand oranges. This is a long shot, but I know some of the other niche tech communities maintain collaborative projects like this: Does anyone know of a resource that catalogues which laser models have what features/capabilities? Or even just a more comprehensive list of current-generation models to start from? (I'm shopping in the high-end hobby to low-end professional range.) I've found a lot of rec threads on this subreddit, but many are older posts and the info is out of date, or the posters' product needs differ substantially from mine. I'm trying to do my own product research, and not just dump my list of criteria here and ask people to come up with a model that meets them, but I need to find a more efficient approach than endless slogging through search results looking for a specific unicorn. I'd appreciate any vetted resources, suggestions, or general help for narrowing the field!",

I was quiet enamoured with the Xtool M1 oder M1 ultra (I could potentially get rid of my Silhouette Cameo and I adore the hot foil transfer of the ultra) BUT the company isn’t known as the greatest so I hoped to get recommendations here. For now I want do cut and engrave wood and maybe metal tumblers. My das loves to build laser cut cars and stuff so I’d really like to be able to cut some for him (that’s to say the working area should have at least 200x200). It’s a hobby so if I’d pay less then 1000 € that’d be great. I’m in Germany, looked at the Roly MK1 but they’re American and don’t seem to ship to Germany. I have two small kids so safety is a concern for me and one reason I wouldn’t want a non enclosed machine with the enclosure not only something to put on top although maybe I’m too paranoid. I hope you can help me out here 😊",
