Locking nut is unimportant as Floyd's are a pain for lower tunings I've read but I'd figure it out. I already have an Ibanez RX20 that's a beater but I love the neck so that's a keeper and my wife got me a Warlock Bronze Series 10 years ago that plays pretty well - considering it's a Bronze Series - so that's another one that's not going anywhere. Looking to expand the family so to speak. I play metal, not much of a leads guy (more into Scott Ian, James Hetfield, Jim Root rhythm stuff) than Rhoads or VH. So if you had the budget of around $200, which would you choose and why? Ty all in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hi, apologies in advance for any formatting issues. I'm on mobile. Hoping that the hive mind can help with a very random request. My Dad built a guitar known as the Vulcan many a moon ago and he mentioned in passing that it was photographed and used on a magazine cover. The only details I have been able to confirm was that the magazine was sold in the UK and this was likely in the 1960s or 70s. It definitely wasn't past the mid eighties as I came along to cramp his style. The guitar itself was an electric, I believe six string. It is, from what I remember, quite clunky in appearance with the electrics on show (it doesn't look like a professionally made guitar but it sounded very good). I vaguely recall a metal box on the front but I haven't seen it since I was a child so that might be completely wrong. Can anyone suggest which magazine this was likely to be in so that I can narrow my search a little? I know I'm asking for the moon on a stick but I'd love to track it down and source him a copy of it to frame/coo over.",
