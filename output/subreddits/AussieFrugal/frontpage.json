      "content_preview": "Hi All, I adopted a kitten 2 months ago and the litter is playing havoc with my asthma and allergies. I have been using Breeders Choice since that’s what he was used to. Even with wearing a mask and taking the litter tray outdoors to do the full change, and switching to a deep tub for the litter tray (my guys a digger), and keeping the tray in a well ventilated area, my symptoms are just getting worse over time. I’m overwhelmed by the options. I would be happy to have a subscription litter, or something that can be purchased at Bunnings, Aldi or Pet Stock. Nothing that’s exclusive to Kmart/Big W/Target/Reject Shop please - there are none anywhere near me. TIA Sorry this sub won’t allow me to pay the kitten tax. The extra antihistamines are costing me $40 a month, so I could go as high as $70/month for a litter that solves this problem and still be saving money. Ideally $20-40/month though.",

For example, when you make a purchase, you may get a fixed amount or a percentage of the amount you paid returned to your account. Essentially, cashback programs give you cash back when you make an eligible purchase at a participating retailer. They work a bit like a piggy bank – you could earn a little bit of cash each time you shop online, which adds up over time. For example, Cashrewards is a cashback program that is free to join and offers a wide range of popular retailers, including food and grocery providers like Menulog, online marketplaces such as Amazon, and travel sites like Booking.com. There are often great deals for everything from everyday products to big-ticket items like furniture and appliances from popular brands like Koala and Bing Lee. Your furry friends are even covered with Petstock! Some of our users are big fans of Cash Back apps! Example of Cashback program includes: Cashrewards, Shop Back, and Top Cash Back. 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸 For your information...

You can then open the page of that cheaper retailer to show the in-store staff and get them to price match. Feel free to give me any feedback - I just wanted to make something that I personally would use. I'm maintaining the database myself.

While I was waiting as I was 9th in line, I called the phone line, they offered $27. Sweet. Then the chat was available and they offered $28.54. Its not much of a difference but for those of us on a budget it can be. Just wanted to let people know the next time they shop for something at JB HI FI to ask for a deal in both the chat and over the phone :) It can be different every time. I have a picture but I can't post it here it seems.",

It feels good to have lump sum at the end of the year that I didn't anticipate I'd have budgetting-wise. I'm pretty disciplined in terms of budgetting and living a frugal lifestyle so I don't really have any urge to use or spend it right away. So I'm just curious on what others do/did with their tax refunds.",

I’ve got most of my learner hours done, but I’ve been struggling with the last bit because of a few things: My parents moved overseas and sold the family car, so I don’t have a vehicle to practise in anymore. I live alone, so I don’t have a supervising driver available at home. I’m also dealing with financial hardship, which makes paying for professional lessons and car hire pretty tough. I’ve applied for the Salvation Army Drive for Life program, but I’m wondering if anyone here knows of other cheap/free ways to get driving hours done, or affordable car access programs for learners? Have any of you used community driving programs, volunteer mentors, or cheaper alternatives to lessons/car hire? Would love to hear how others managed this without breaking the bank. my dad and I stopped at 90 something hours Thanks in advance",
