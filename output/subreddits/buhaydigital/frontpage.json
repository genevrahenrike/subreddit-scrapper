      "content_preview": "Basically, the summary of a traumatic experience that I am still trying to get over. I was hired late last year as a Content Assistant for a Copywriting business. We were a 5-man team, and we were directly reporting to our CEO. I was the only Pinoy in this team. The job was seriously a dream. We had no time tracker, we were paid more than most WFH people (this is where I got my first 6-digit pay) , and this boss was very lax. He was firm, very nitty-gritty about details, but he wasn't micromanaging us in our work. He was really a good boss overall. Early this year, our boss treated us to an overseas trip somewhere here in Asia for 2 weeks. Most of the time, our boss would talk about LONG-TERM plans for each of the team members—how he wanted us to grow in our roles, how he wanted us to take on more responsibilities as he expands his business, and how he wanted us to stay long-term in his 5-man team. I felt assured hearing this from him, most especially since I've never had any major problems in my work. During our one-on-one sessions, his feedback was always good. When I ask him what I would need to improve on, he would always say that there were minor things that he could easily train me on. Even when we were on our overseas trip, I made sure to accomplish all my daily tasks. On our last in-person one-on-one session during the trip, he even mentioned that he's looking forward to the new roles that I'll be taking over. Monday after the trip, he messaged the team that the incoming week was going to be business as usual. He even tagged each of us to \"continue with the usual\" and said he \"appreciates all our hard work.\" Imagine my surprise that come Wednesday, I get a message from him saying that he's sending a difficult message and wants to terminate our working relationship in 2 weeks. I was just logging in when I got the message and I felt my stomach turn. It didn't make any sense at the time, especially after all the mentions and promises of long-term work for each of us in his team. I became so ashamed of it, most especially when friends and family members would mention how lucky I was to have a boss treat me to an overseas trip. I couldn't tell them I had been sacked. I had a lot of WHY questions running in my head. I tried reflecting on what happened, but most of them led to more confusion than clarity. I felt like I was led on. I felt like I was blindsided. I kept on replaying everything I did during the trip, if there was something that I had done or had said that may have led to the decision. Ultimately, I just gave up thinking about it for my own peace of mind. I'm sharing this experience as a reminder: In the line of work of WFH employees, anything could happen anytime. Sometimes, there are no warnings. You have to brace yourself for all the possibilities. Honestly, my respect for WFH employees increased overnight because of my experience. I know that my case is not an isolated issue. I've read many horror stories about immediate layoffs. When it happened to me, I went back to looking for an office job because I got traumatized over the horrors of job security in online work. I salute everyone here who managed to get up and put on a brave face after being fired. I wish I had the same grit.",

      "content_preview": "Hi. I have a bit of time so I thought I'd share my story. This will be a very, very long post so bear with me. Let me start with where I am today: I'm 27M, single, working from home, earning a comfortable monthly income of 175k a month. And this story started back in college. College : I took a degree that I never really liked, not because my parents forced me to, just because I never really knew what I wanted it and it felt like a safe choice, all things considered. I knew early on in the program that this isn't for me but it was a little too late then to shift to another degree, my parents won't allow it. Thankfully, friends from classes and from my organization helped make college feel like a breeze despite sheer boredom with my chosen program. I failed a lot of subjects, heck, I even failed my last subject (internship) before graduation. But the biggest highlight is most probably my leadership experience. That's where I really learned a lot of the things I know today: from leadership, to project management, to budgeting, you name it. I've learned so much and gotten a lot of connections in high places that the first job I got was a direct referral from the university's Vice President to a startup's CEO that happened to be looking for graduating student leaders. First Job : I landed my first job which I honestly really thought I'd lose just because it turned out, I'm not graduating after all (remember: failed internship). I'm so lucky because my boss back then just told me \"I don't give a fuck if you're not a graduate, just as long as you're a great leader.\" (NV) My stint here lasted a little over two years. Coupled with my college leadership experience, this job gave me tons of skills: I learned basic skills such as photo and video editing, website development, UI/UX design, project management, all the way to high level skills such as business development, product development, and so much more. From a starting salary of 30k, it grew to 35k and then 75k. Eventually, I felt the need to let go and find my own footing elsewhere and apply everything I've learned so far and hopefully continue to learn. Post-First Job Unfortunately, the job market wasn't as easy as I'd thought it'd be. After all, I hardly made an effort to land my first job. In any case, I did try for a couple of months until I finally gave up and decided I'll use the time to rest for a bit. Thankfully, my connections landed me a few short gigs of design and development work which earned me up to a hundred thousand in just about 1.5 months. Eventually, my old boss reached out and asked for my availability to work on a side project, part time. I was only paid around 35k a month, just enough to pay for my expenses and a bit of leisure here and there. This setup didn't last though. I've had to go back and look for a more stable and higher-paying jobs. Second Job I eventually landed a marketing project manager role with the help of a friend from college. I was given an 80k salary to start with and I worked for an international company based in EU. It was a huge team of Pinoys and an even bigger international team from all over the world. The process was pretty stiff and all I really had to do was fill in the blanks and make sure things are moving--contrary to the kind of environment I came from the startup company (my first job) where everything was dynamic. This job felt boring to be honest and I didn't really last long. Third Job Just a few months in, I've gotten an offer elsewhere to be poached for a little higher income (95k). The company was based in the US this time and I'll be working as a middle manager. Work was great, teammates even more so. I even referred a handful of friends over (afaik, they're still working there). I felt like I could finally last in here, possibly even up to two years like my first job. But then came this new hire, an operations manager that changed the whole company. I was one of the last men standing from the old guard as he'd found ways to replace most of the initial management team. Then came a confrontation about my AL which had long been approved, even prior to when he came in. That was the first of the last straws until I eventually decided to let go and just resign on the spot. Not my proudest moment but the environment had gone from a really healthy culture to something worse than a hustle culture. Might be their style (US), but definitely not mine. I enjoy working but I enjoy living just as much, if not more. \"Long Break\" With no backup plans, I was once again left without a job and income. This, at a time when my fixed expenses had already gone up (with rent and car since the last time this happened). Savings are quickly drying up. I've been in a handful of interviews but couldn't really find a good fit, the interviewers themselves must've felt the same because nobody really came back with an offer. After 3 months, I've decided to go back home to my parents and suck it up as a \"palamunin\" once more. To be fair, just before resigning, I had two acquaintances reach out with a potential offer so I thought I'd be safe. But the offer never really came so I was stuck. Close to the Christmas holidays so might as well give up now and just try my luck after new year. On the fourth month (this was around early November), my boss (again, from my first job. Lol, I love this guy, he's saved me from so much trouble already) reached out for another part time gig so I gladly accepted. And just a few days later, another company reached out for a project. I've been saved! Moonlighting Phase Working with my old boss, it was pretty much the same as before so this wasn't really that big of a deal and barely took much of my time. I was paid 70k part time for barely 15-20 hours of work a week. The other job was meant to be just for a short project to help the company build its systems and processes and earned me about 30k a month (hour-based comp) for work that barely took 20-30 hours for the whole month. 2025 Fast forward to today, I once again left my first job (I know, I'm sorry) for a better opportunity with the other job that was willing to hire me full time for 125k. Not long after that, I've asked for a small increase to 150k. Meanwhile, my old boss wanted me back for much, much less commitment so we've come up to an agreement of a 25k retainer (with or without work). At my age, 175 may sound like a lot but you'd be surprised how I can sometimes find myself going from paycheck to paycheck months on end. I've recently made a decision to end my unhealthy spending habits after seeing posts of people that earn less but end up saving more. I was envious and quite frustrated after reading a handful of those posts, yet grateful that I did. I rarely find myself ever content so I may decide to leave or ask for another increase eventually but for now, I'm kind of happy where I am. With all that being said, I really do wish I can share the same opportunities with friends. And so I did. A ton of referrals throughout, even at my current company. But I often find a lot of gaps. The underlying skills just aren't there. It's not luck that allowed me to have gone through what I had gone through, even those \"lucky\" referrals were born out of something that I did. To summarize how and why I think I am where I am today, it'd be the following: Leadership skills. This isn't just about managing people, it's about helping them succeed in their roles. Because their success is ultimately yours and the company's. Problem-solving skills. A lot of people are great at problem solving but doesn't really address the root cause of the problem, just bandaid solutions; while the other half are great at identifying problems. You've got to be in a place where you can do both. Jack of all trades. There was a time when there was such a huge negative connotation to generalists. But it takes skill and effort and time and dedication to learn a lot of things. Not helpful enough? Here's one final tip: portfolios. I find it odd that only designers and developers ever really collect a portfolio. On the other end of the spectrum, even employers build their own. You'll see startup CEOs collecting all the companies that they founded and adding it to their portfolio. With the rise of AI these days, it's so easy to fool people with pretty words in a resume. Make yours stand out by adding a portfolio to back up your claims. I was \"lucky\" to have landed at my job today despite having none and my boss just taking my word for it. But we're not all lucky. Show your worth and experience because the reality is that not a lot of people make it past the initial paper screening process during applications. This was a very long story to share. I tried to be as generic as possible in areas where I can't really disclose any material information. But I do hope it's at least helpful/useful, or at the very least inspiring.",

Our manager hasn’t noticed, and I feel like keeping quiet makes me part of the problem.

Nag enjoy pa nga ako kasi wala na kong trabaho. Pero hanggang 2 days lang pala kasi meron ulit bago hihi and i’m super thankful. But my point is, hindi talaga ako naiyak or na-sad. My drive to find another client was on another level. Yung kapatid ko na stress na nawalan ako ng client. Pero ako patawa tawa lang. Idk who needs to hear this but don’t let 1 job discourage you.

      "content_preview": "Hi, first time lng po ako magPost dito and bago lng po din ako maging freelance(like not even half a year). Its been a while since nagwork ako due to family circumstances(had to help my lola w/ dementia pero maayus na ung situwasyon na un) and now first work ko as a frelance analyst pero fulltime. Mejo madali lng once nakapa mo na sya pero the reason why I'm posting is I made a mistake on my first task. Not giving too much context but basically my task was half done. I'm not blaming on this anyone but myself. I took accountability and tried to catch up or finish the rest of it. But it keeps coming back even though I alreasy redo it from scratch. And this time, its not my fault or rather the company tool we're using is acting up. In any case, it gotten so bad TL already messaged me that I already got called out twice for this. Today me and TL were able to finally found the root of the problem and hopefully this will end. But due to this, it made me more nervous than ever on the performance or if they still want me to be here as their workforce. And once the bad thoughts starts, it made me think the most outrageous outcomes that can happen. All due respect it was my first mistake yes, the other tasks that I've been given were properly finished and very few were able to comfort me that its going to be fine(one of my seniors did), but still, cant help the feeling of helplessness and insecurity of it. I really don't want to lose my job since I'm at the point where I have to pitch in now more than ever. Already spent my EF for our family predicament and now when I finally got a good job, this happened. Idk.. I wanted to rant lng but at the same time, seeking if I'm not alone on the rookie mistake or advice on how to cope with it. Or turn things back around.",

Ayaw ko na rin naman sisihin sarili ko since nangyari na, pero hindi ko rin maiiwasan. Ang dami ko nang sinend na applications online. Isa pa lang yung nag-reply for an interview, at hindi pa ako pumasa. Yung iba, wala responses. Tambak na rin bills ko at mapuputulan na ng Internet sa Sept 10... Sobrang limited ng job opportunities dito samin, dahil nasa Province. Nag-try na rin ako maghanap sa katabing bayan, pero wala pa rin. Naisip ko mag-apply sa BPO, pero yung na-receive kong interview invite nasa Makati pa. Hindi ko alam paano ko kakayanin ‘yon, wala akong kilala doon, at wala rin akong pera para mag-stay. Nakakatakot lang isipin, kay hindi ko na tinuloy... Ngayon, sobrang frustrated ko na, lumala na rin anxiety ko, at sobrang depressed na. Iyak na lang ako ng iyak tuwing gabi at hindi na rin makatulog. To anyone who wants to quit without back up plan, please DON'T! Naghahanap pa rin ng work hanggang ngayon, at sana makaland kahit papaano. Sorry dito pa ko nag share, gusto ko lang mailabas...",

My number 1 reason dati is gusto ko sana gawin yung mga bagay bagay ng naaayon sa tama. Dagdag pa dun yung mga positive things na natutunan ko sa mga nabasa at napanood ko about sa pagbabayad ng tax ng mga freelancer. Di naman din lingid sa kaalaman natin na marami ring hindi talaga nagbabayad ng mga tax. May mga kakilala rin tayo na nalalaman natin di sila registered... Minsan iniiwasan ko isipin yun, pero deep inside parang napapaisip rin ako kung dapat ko ba sila gayahin? Pero kahit sumasagi yun sa isip ko noon, nangingibabaw sakin that time na panindigan yung ganitong regular na pagbabayad. Nitong mga nagdaang araw, linggo... Grabe yung mga naglalabasang balita. Mga garapalang pangungurakot ng mga punyetang tao. Tapos yung iba sobrang kakapal pa ng mga muka i-post sa mga social media nila yung mga nakulimbat ng pamilya nila. Napapadalas ang panonood ko ngayon ng mga interview about it, pagbabasa ng mga detalye at kung anu-ano pa. Hanggang sa umabot na ko sa point na to na tanungin uli sarili ko, dapat ba talaga ako nagbabayad ng tax ng tapat? Simpleng tao lang naman ako, di naman kalakihan sahod ko at may mga pangangailangan rin na di agarang nabibili. Naisip ko ngayon, pwede bang ipasara ko na lang muna yung account ko? hahaha hays... Pwede bang saka nalang uli ako magbayad pag marami ng nakulong sa mga ulupong na magnanakaw? hirap lumaban ng patas, hirap gumawa ng tama...",

      "content_preview": "Currently, I’m living a digital nomad lifestyle, palipat-lipat ako ng place, usually mga fully furnished na apartments/condos/rooms na kasama na lahat ng utilities. Wala nang hassle sa electric, water, internet, or buying appliances. Ang pinaka-bentahe pa for me is: Unlimited aircon (super important sakin kasi I work from home and laging naka-aircon) No deposits or advance na kailangan bayaran upfront Flexibility to travel anytime kasi wala akong long-term na commitment No need bumili ng appliances/furniture since provided na lahat On the other hand, iniisip ko din: kung mag-rent ako monthly (long-term), mas mura ba in the long run? Pero downside: Kailangan ko bumili ng appliances and basic stuff Magbabayad pa ako ng electric at iba pang bills (lalo na kung malakas ako sa aircon, baka tumaas sobra) May mga deposits/advance payments pa na kailangan bayaran So ngayon, nagtataka ako kung alin ba talaga ang mas tipid: Staying as a digital nomad (palipat-lipat with all-in rates) Or mag-stick sa isang long-term rental at ako mag-shoulder ng bills and appliances? Anyone here na naka-experience ng parehong setup? Curious ako kung alin ang mas worth it not just financially, pero pati sa convenience at peace of mind.",

      "content_preview": "DigitalCareers.ph is made by the red flag workplace Arash Law Philippines. It is their new hiring platform. The group photo and statements posted in the website doesn't have the full consent of the employees in the photos. Exploit to the highest level! Nagsawa na siguro sila to be exposed about their OLJ and Indeed posts siguro. Arash Law is nowhere to be seen in the content of this website. Things to avoid: Work tracker Teramind used by this company reads all activities web history from all browsers, even separate users in the same PC it is installed in. It runs once the PC is turned on and still reads your data during off working hours even if you end it through task manager. It is still sending data to them. This is too intrusive. Google Meet monitoring all through out the shift. Simpleng alis mo lang to get something is called out ka agad. Simple internet or PC troubleshooting mo, called out ka agad. At least, have better or humane implementation if you really need this work. Carlos, the owner of the business is different from Arash Law in California. The website, SEO requirements of the company is only handled by this group. Outsourced. This pig of a dude once said that Filipinos only deserve to be paid 1/3 compared to that of Americans. I won't retract how I hate this guy and because of how small he makes it seem of the Filipinos that work for him. TL's have very questionable approach and practices toward their employees especially in the writing team handled by their \"powerful, empowered women\" team leaders. They call out writers all the time that's why people leave their team. They change practices more than their progress. \"International standards\" daw dapat. Umay ka on how they really rub their presence to the people on Gmeet and group chats. They love cozing up to Carlos Carrera whenever he posts something on the main thread kahit wala naman talagang sense. Recently, an employee na ni wala pa nga atang 1 year was revealed in an anonymous email to everyone in the Dev group na he was taking screenshots of the Google Meet call, sending inappropriate/unsolicited messages and stalks female employees on social media. This in itself is a crime. May screenshots attached pa nga of that guy attached. Ang creepy and disturbing yet walang ginawa ang admin team about him. As far as we know, he's still working there. Sadly, they even have him as their Jr. Team Leader. Aubrey, Senior Operations Leader is just an errand girl to Carlos. All decision delays are caused by her. She doesn't know how to properly talk to employees. Very palengke ng approach at pakikipag-usap niya. You'd really want to avoid talking to her. Bawal daw ang virtual background pero siya naka virtual background. It is obvious naman na she gloats on top of everything that is happening. Napaka unjust on how she handles the employees. She disapproves benefits and salary increases with no acceptable or sensible reason. Most likely, kung ano lang ang trip or mood niya in handling these decisions. \" HR team doesn't know how to handle employee concerns. They just follow what Aubrey or Carlos tell them to do. Employee page always asks for charity donations which employees ignore or find odd kase it is too much in your face yung approach. Yes we know the value of helping pero having the donations deducted from our salary is quite a questionable approach. If you want to help then do so as a company initiative. Don't get from employees' salaries na regardless if they consent it or not. It is NOT a place for career growth. To all planning to apply or reading this post in the future please avoid this company as much as possible. I do hope that the Arash Law in California would know of how exploitative and inhumane the practices in this company and people they have chosen to work with and hopefully do something about it. TO ALL PLANNING TO APPLY, AVOID THIS PLACE FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.",

I am considering switching to BDO, I'd like to know if this is also the case with them. I know they have $10 inward remittance fees and I think they have $0.05 rate difference when converting USD to PHP over the counter (ito lang din kaya sagutin nung branch dito samin) but how about if it's done through app? Need some REAL WORLD experiences here please. So if anyone has both USD and PHP account, I would really appreciate you guys can try and give some comments! Didn't get any luck with Unionbank but open to other bank suggestions too, except BPI (I'd like to stay as far away from them as possible). PS: I am using Wise for any client that's fine with shouldering the fees. Otherwise, I use local PH USD accounts direct through SWIFT. But this is for another topic!",

I just had an initial phone interview and they’re moving me to the next step (not hired yet). From my quick research, Wrkpod seems to be positioned differently from companies like Cyberbacker, though I’m not sure how true that is. Has anyone here actually worked with them or is currently with the platform? How’s your experience been? For context, I’m currently employed but underpaid, so I’ve been applying to VA jobs with the goal of eventually resigning. I just don’t want to quit cold turkey without knowing more about Wrkpod first or any other remote works. I was also very hesitant to ask during the initial interview about the training. I know that they offer training but do trainees receive compensation? Any insights or advice would really help. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I just want to share with you some of my thoughts as an OF Chatter. Before I got married and became a mom, sa field ako nag wowork (hindi ko na specify). Since my husband is an OFW, napagdesisyuhan namin na magresign na lang ako and mag focus sa baby namin. He's a good provider naman kaya never niya ako nirequire na mag-work. Pero bilang isang independent girly dati, gusto kong may sarili pa din akong pera na pinaghirapan ko. He is supportive naman sa decisions ko since we were (first relationship namin ang isa’t-isa) BF/GF for 10 years bago kami nagsettle down, no history of cheating or whatsoever kaya the trust is there given yung nature ng trabaho. Nung naging toddler na ang anak namin at hindi na masyadong alagain, nagtingin tingin ako ng WFH job, doon ko lang nalaman yung OF industry. Nag apply ako as a chatter kahit walang experience and fortunately, natanggap ako. 6 days a week/8 hours a day. I'm earning around 40-50k a month, 10 months na ako dito. I think okay yung agency na napasukan ko since most scripts are provided naman and may partner TL ka if ever you need help. Hindi din toxic ang management. I'm handling one model lang and hindi naman ganun ka traffic since day shift ang pinili ko (midnight sa US kaya low traffic). Parang halos nag fb fb at nagne-Netflix lang din ako maghapon pwera nalang sa days na boosted yung account. Yes, wala kang time tracker or screensharing so I can attend to my child’s needs even while working. Need mo lang talaga magpaalam if mawawala ka for more than 10mins para mabantayan ng TL yung page (wag lang masyadong abusado lol). Also, as long as hindi ka nale-late sa responses and mass messages, hindi ka maccall-out. Pero syempre may quota pa din naman at nahihit ko naman kaya ako tumagal ng 10 months. My only dilemma is parang walang growth dito. Every day, same lang ang ginagawa ko, walang learnings. Copy paste, konting edit sa scripts. Konting adlibs sa preferences ni fans, that's it. Hindi naman problema sakin ang NSFW contents since may option naman sa Infloww na pwedeng naka blurrred and most PPVs sa agency namin is may caption naman. No offense to people in the industry, ha? Nag-eenjoy naman ako sa work na ito since naaalagaan ko din ang toddler namin while working pero parang (personal thoughts) yearning ako sa ginagawa ko before ako mag-asawa. Pero nahihirapan ako ilet-go siya kasi 50k is no joke. Imagine nag-eearn ka ng ganung amount na hindi ka halos pagod? Walang transpo, walang traffic, and everything else. Sorry, ang gulo ng point ko. Pero sana mabigyan niyo ako ng insights if continue ko pa ba or mag-resign na ako ang magrisk sa ibang niche? If kayo ang nasa sitwasyon? Thank you! PS: For everyone messaging me, we don’t do referrals. Meron po kaming HR team na nagrereach out sa mga groups sa blue app or sa mga job hiring sites whenever may opening kami. And sorry because I can’t disclose the name of the agency for safety purposes since l’ve shared lots of info here.",

      "content_preview": "Hello, fellow redditors! So this school year na yung graduation ko, and right now I'm still undecided whether to continue with my electrical engineering career path or shift to another one after the board exam. Although I'll be focusing soon on my boards, I'm still hesitant about what type of field I should take to become successful one day. Btw, engineering wasn't really my forte, it's just that I had to take this course before due to practicality, so medyo hirap ako with adapting to engineering concepts immediately hahah. But I eventually appreciated it and even enjoyed it after my internship at a construction company. Right now, I'm planning on improving my skills related to a sustainable and high-paying job. My long-term goal kasi is to have a job with a WFH setup since I love to travel, so I really want that work-life balance lol. Then a few weeks ago, I came across the term \"construction VA,\" but I'm unsure if there’s actually a type of job like this for EEs. So if you guys have something to share, baka pwedeng manghingi ng tips and answers to my questions: Is it sustainable to have a VA type of job for EEs? Will there be jobs for EEs in the VA world? If there are electrical engineers out there who took this path, is it worth it? What skills and experience do I need, or what online lectures should I focus on to improve? Thank you so much, may balato kayo sakin soon jk.",

From what I’ve seen, scaling as a VA usually means choosing one of these paths: • Become an OBM (Online Business Manager) → moving into operations, project, and team management. • Build a niche agency → specialize in one area (like lead gen, social media, or recruitment) and grow a team around it. • Create a VA agency → generalist support but with multiple VAs under you. • Develop a course or program → teach others your area of expertise. • Become a trainer/mentor → guide new VAs entering the field. Curious to hear from others who’ve gone through this: • Which path did you choose (or are considering)? • What challenges did you face? • If you could start over, would you take a different route?",
