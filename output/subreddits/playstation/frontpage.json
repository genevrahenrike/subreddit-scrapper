        "title": "r/playstation Rules",
        "content": "Keep it civil and treat others with respect whether they are a community member or not. Personal attacks, harassment, abuse, hate speech, insults, threats, unsolicited messages of a personal nature, and trolling are all prohibited. Conversation must primarily focus on PlayStation games, hardware, services or culture. Discussion of other brands or products is allowed only if the central aim is to compare or connect back to PlayStation. On-topic PlayStation posts that touch on political themes in passing are allowed, but any conversation which seeks to engage in further political debate or provide extensive political opinion outside of the related topic will be removed. Do not post unmarked spoilers or put any spoilers in a post title. Use the post spoiler tag if your post contains spoilers. Use spoiler formatting in text bodies when making comments in any post that does not have the spoiler tag active, or if your spoiler falls outside of the expected topic of conversation. Do not create posts or comments seeking to actively engage in piracy, hacking, jailbreaking, gamesharing, account sharing, or distribution of game images with other community members. Solicitation or seeking transactions of any products, services, contests, requests, accounts, or websites is not allowed. Sharing PlayStation themed original content (images, art, videos) is allowed, but posts strictly asking for visits, follows, subs, etc. is not allowed. (Attribution to an original creator is OK.) PSN code giveaways are allowed as long as the code is posted directly in the subreddit and is offered unconditionally. Petitions are allowed as long as they are on-topic. Sharing your own branded / channel-based multimedia content is allowed only if you have a post submission history where no more than 50% of your last 10 posts (across all subreddits) are also similar self-promotion. A submission history of at least 10 posts is also required. Sharing your non-branded / personal multimedia content (ex. screenshots, trophies, gameplay clips, photos of your gear/setup) does not fall under this rule and is allowed as long as they are on-topic. Do not post claiming to be an employee of Sony or Sony Interactive Entertainment. If you wish to engage with this subreddit in an official manner on behalf of your company, please contact the Mod Team via Modmail. Please check for any active Megathreads that have been made a sticky prior to posting. Any post that is created outside of an active Megathread with the same topic is subject to removal. We have a weekly \"Recommendation Central\" Megathread. All posts pertaining to recommendations for games or hardware must be posted there. No low-effort content or comments - Submissions must have enough substance to initiate a discussion or provide value to the community. Self-posts with only a title and very little or no text are not allowed. Comments must add meaningful value to a discussion (e.g. comments such as \"I really want a new PSP\", \"I wish this was on PS4/PC\", or reaction GIFS will be removed). Before submitting or adding a comment ask yourself: \"Does this add significant information or merit to the discussion? Any topics already covered in this Weekly Discussion Thread will be removed if posted separately. This helps keep the subreddit organized and ensures everyone can participate in a central discussion. Please check here first before creating new posts about ongoing topics. All Tech Support and Purchase Recommendation questions should be posted in the dedicated Tech Support & Purchase Recommendations Megathread. Posts on these topics made separately will be removed. If the original source is unavailable, you may link to an appropriate alternative. Avoid blogspam—websites that copy or embed content without adding value. However, alternatives with meaningful analysis may be allowed, but the original source should be prioritized. If a source redirects to another, link to the one with the most context. For example, if a tweet links to a developer's blog post, link directly to the blog post. Use the original title when possible. If unclear or too complex, modify it for clarity without sensationalism or editorializing. You may add relevant context like the author's name, spoilers, NSFW warnings, release dates, or platforms. Titles must be in English, civil, and concise. Avoid all-caps (unless in the original), inflammatory language, or phrases like \"This deserves attention.\" If more context is needed, consider a self-post. Posts asking users to fill out surveys, forms, or participate in polls will be removed."
