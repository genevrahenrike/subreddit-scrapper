For my own protection I would only provide pictures in DM. I anticipate the following to be relevant: techniques relating to locating pinpoint holes in surfaces, especially where surface tension (or whatever phenomenon) might intrinsically be effective to secure the can’s pressurized contents with or without further manipulation location of marks or other off color markings or aluminum markings, etc. indicating possible manipulation how to go about setting up lab tests for an array of common toxins likely to be employed by a budding murderer (based on clumsiness with destruction of evidence I anticipate the known was their first) A bit of backstory: I do know that the J. Doe suspect has a penchant for secretly stalking me and destroying my property and other significant aspects of my life (e.g., recently destroyed my spotless decades long public persona and got me evicted very aggressively despite my actively paying rent and being in good standing with entire neighborhood and formerly the landlord). I’m not sure whether Doe is aware that I know so much due to longtime well hidden home surveillance system (not much of a system really, just a couple sneakily placed cameras placed early in Doe’s destructive days) and my overhearing a pivotal confession of sorts while Doe attempted to secure an accomplice for the murder post hoc.",

      "content_preview": "Hey Reddit I’m 17 and heading into my final year of high school. Ever since I can remember I’ve been fascinated by forensic pathology. The idea of helping families get closure, uncovering the truth, and doing meaningful work has always drawn me in. I come from a family where no one has gone to college, let alone pursued medicine, so I feel really lucky and thankful that I have the financial means to go through all the schooling required. But here’s the thing. As I’ve started thinking about the path seriously, the reality of it hit me. To become a forensic pathologist I’m looking at around 13 years of schooling undergrad, medical school, residency, and specialized training. Doing the math that means I probably won’t be done and practicing fully until I’m about 31. And now, I’m struggling to figure out if it’s actually worth it. I’ve always loved the idea of the job, but the more I think about the time, the sacrifices, and the mental load, the more I question whether my passion is enough to carry me through over a decade of school. I don’t have anyone in my life who’s gone through this kind of journey to give me a realistic perspective, so it’s hard to know what’s truly normal to feel here. Has anyone been through something similar? How did you stay motivated when the goal was so far away? Or, if you’ve changed paths, how did you realize it wasn’t worth it for you? I really want to help families and do meaningful work, but I also don’t want to spend my life in school if I’m not truly sure I’ll love the day-to-day of the career. Any advice, personal stories, or encouragement would really mean a lot. Thanks A 17-year-old trying to figure out the future",

I am not too fussed specially, I just wanna work in forensics and I have been out of uni for 2 years nearly and have been work in a lab since so I have plenty of lab experience and everything that comes with it and I feel like I need to get started now before it becomes too much of a jump down in pay! I like in Oxford and there just seems to be nothing around in terms of CSI or forensics lab jobs and I am open to moving but I still cannot find a thing! Any advice/help is massively appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "I know that the FBI’s CODIS system for DNA profiles can reliably match people back to themselves and detect when people have sibling or parent-child relationships (for example, this is how the Grim Sleeper serial killer out of California was identified in 2010 after his son was convicted of a felony and his profile was found to be a partial match to semen samples taken from murders committed by his father). I was curious what other relationships can be determined using STR testing and the 13 or 20-loci profiles that get entered into the system. I understand that it obviously wasn’t designed for this purpose, that the further away you get from a person the amount of shared DNA will get exponentially smaller, and that you need a lot more genetic information in order to do things like ancestry analysis and finding distant relatives like in genetic genealogy research, but I was curious what the most distant relationship would be that could still consistently return a CODIS hit? Can it detect grandparents and great-grandparents? Half-siblings? Aunt/uncles and nieces/nephews? I’ve tried to answer this question myself through internet searches but I have not been able to find a concrete answer from a reliable source. Thank you for your time.",

What makes matters worse is that the country I'm living in ( GCC) don't really have much crime nd neither do they hire non-locals. So I've been hoping to get a job like that somewhere in the States or Canada, but obv its not tht simple. Then it comes to what i want to study, I'm thinking abt continuing with Forensic Science but ppl tell me theres not much scope nd I should pursue something like Chemistry or Biology, or biochemistry. To add to tht i hear its super competitive nd my chances of becoming a forensic analyst of any kind are slim. Need advice.",

      "content_preview": "Hello!! I posted this with the education flair and it got locked, so I'm trying with the toxicology flair! I am a recent (ish) college grad and just got an invitation to take the written exam & practical exam as the next step in my job process! I have extensive biology and chemistry background, and have bought some study materials for the written exam. I'm a little nervous about the practical exam though. I graduated college in '23 and have not touched chemistry lab equipment since. Additionally, my degree was unrelated to actual forensics. I'm not really sure where to start for the practical exam preparation. Would simply re-familiarizing myself with GC/MS/LC-MS SOPs be sufficient? Do I need to memorize standard GC run times or MS m/z ratios for common drugs and toxins? Or do I simply need to prove I'm capable of learning and following basic directions? (I promise I'm not asking for question answers!! Just not even sure where to start my studies!) I'm really eager to break into forensic toxicology, so I want to make sure I'm prepared as possible for this test! Thanks in advance! Edit: The position is toxicology forensic scientist I at a police department in NV",

Some background of mine, graduated with a BS in Forensic Science, currently an MLA at a hospital (so if worst comes to worst I get certificates in HT or MLS), I interned at Illinois State Police within their Forensic Laboratory. I'm open to moving anywhere in the country besides the midwest (no shot at the midwest, but I've lived here practically my whole life, so a new scenery would be amazing). Some states I would love to work in would be California, Texas, Washington, Georgia, Virginia, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Illinois, Carolina's, Massachusetts, New York, or Maryland. Fields in Forensics I love the most, 1. Latent Fingerprints, 2. DNA Bio, 3. Firearms, 4. Anything Chem related.",

I work as an RN full time now, but earned my MS in forensics in 2014. I also worked for different MEs offices and accrued ~20k hours of experience in death investigations according to the ABMDI site. My last full-time ME job was back in 2017. Now that I’m back in forensics, I want to apply for board certification but am concerned my experience is not current enough. I know I must apply to be a registry diplomate first, and six months after I can apply for the certification. If you’ve been through the process, would you mind outlining the steps with more clarity than I’ve found on the site? I know education might also be able to apply to my experience, but how much? Also, what exactly are the timelines for the exam?",

How unrealistic would it be to one-hit-kill someone with the blunt force of a rounding hammer (one of those hammers blacksmiths use) to the head? On that note, how unrealistic would it be to one-hit-kill various animals, ranging from German shepherd to horse sized, with that same hammer to the head? The character who would be doing the hitting is very strong and muscular with good battle instincts, so if there’s a better way to hit them, that’s what he’d do.",
