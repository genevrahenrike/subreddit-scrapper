As always, I am very happy to answer additional questions about these packs, my builds/design/etc or take more detailed photos. Eve if not interested in these two packs, feel free to ask questions about anything you see at #dextergear on IG. I do not post everything I make. * I want to add a little background to these packs and my brand, DexterGear, #Dextergear. I build these packs completely by myself with self learned knowledge and technique. I do not have a production facility, but a basement with poor lighting. *Please excuse the photos here as the lighting outside was less than ideal at the time of day... I built my first backpack in 2017 after I hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2016. I started with a Ray Jardine backpack kit and used my mothers sewing machine. I had never used a sewing machine or sewn anything prior. I never finished that pack because I had more ideas on fabric and design that I wanted to use. I scoured the web for info, found RSBTR, Questoutfitters, Thruhiker, later LEARNMYOG, and went from there for the next few years making packs (basic designs), chalk bags, hammocks, underquilts, top down/synthetic quilts, flat tarps, shaped tarps, down JACKETS, down/synthetic vests, insulated hoods, Fleece sweaters and pants, ZPP bags, and wallets. All up to my own standards. During that time I have worked in the outdoor industry on a basic level while maintaining my outdoor hiking prowless, always obtaining more miles and experience. I gained a tremendous amount of firsthand knowledge in the outdoors and in the gear I used. I've hiked both the CDT and PCT with mostly gear made by myself. In later years closer to now, I was given the opportunity to expand and USE my knowledge and skills in working on technical design of outdoor goods for a larger brand, where I was able to gather friends, acquaintances', and knowledge of both the larger industry and some of the details involved with higher end production and higher end quality practices. That is the short story. I am a triple crown though hiker, with many many thousands of miles of experience, in all four seasons, that I put into my own designs. I am based in NH where I sew everything on my own. Again photos of current packs: https://imgur.com/a/UflWAt8",

      "content_preview": "Verification Images All prices include shipping and G&S fee to continental US. No international shipping, sorry. Stored indoors in a non-smoking household. I have cats if you're reactive. Xmid - $150 SOLD 29.5 oz, can include the shepherd hooks and silpoly stake sack it shipped with if buyer wants them but probably should consider it tent only. This is a 2021 Xmid  1p v1, the model that was offered on Amazon. I'm the second owner but it was unused sealed in the bag when I bought it. Minor wear/dirt stains on the outer and floor, but no tears or holes. The netting in the inner has some snags that I tried to highlight. It's still perfectly bug-proof but just an fyi to interested buyers. They smooth out if you rub them with your nail. This was my main shelter from 2021-23ish and it has 50-75 nights on it. Enlightened Equipment Enigma 850 20F Reg/Wide - $200 SOLD 23.8 oz in stuff sack 850 down fill, 10D Red exterior / 10D Navy interior, regular wide size. First owner, purchased 2021, used 50-75 nights. Stored lofted when not on trail. Includes pad straps, stuff sack, and storage bag. Always used with base layers and socks. This was offered as a blemish item by EE. The blemish was a needle hole that was repaired before shipping, details in photos. I had it professionally cleaned using the service EE recommends about a month ago. A few spots are shedding down like any down garment, but there are no holes and I always  pull them in from the inside. I would consider this in like new condition. I've since moved on to a zipperless bag I prefer. Yama Swiftline 2 - $150 SOLD 35.75 oz, silpoly, green This shelter is in fair cosmetic condition but fully functional. It's one of the older generations, manufactured in 2020. The previous owner patched a few small holes and seam sealed the tent himself. I tried to get good pictures of them, but in summary: -The floor has one patched hole -The fly has one patched pinhole -There's a pinhole around one of the zippers Previous owner used 20-30 nights, I only took it out for 2 nights. I didn't have any rain on my trip but I tested it with a hose in my yard and the seams were all water tight. The guy-lines are a mix of stock and replacement. Some of the guy lines/bungees are a little thicker than UL standard but none of them bothered me enough to change. This is a true two person tent. I'm selling because my partner is more into freestanding tents and I never take this on solo trips. Listed for sale last January and now it's back with a $100 price cut. Sea to Summit Ultralight Insulated Pad - $70 18.5 oz w/ pump sack 2\" pad offered by S2S. 21.5\" wide. R-value 3.1. The pillow attachment are permanently installed. Purchased 2021, used 50-75 nights. This is good for 2.5 seasons and I've taken it down to 20ish degrees with a Switchback underneath, not particularly warm but I slept. I prefer a thicker pad now but always enjoyed the simplicity of this design. Good starter pad. I've mainly used it as a loaner since switching to an Xtherm in 2023. Condition is good, no leaks, some trail patina that doesn't wash off. Just gave it a Bronner's dunk and rinse to test for leaks and clean. Yama Bug Net - $30 3.3 oz Bug canopy purchased March 2024. Never used. Never quite figured it out. Have other options now. Willing to bundle with another item for a discount. Here's Yama's page for it, sold out/discontinued. SOLD Ursak Major - $80 SOLD 6.5 oz No smells or anything. Stitching around the cord openings seems a little iffy, but functionally it's good to go. I made peace with my bear canister. Purchased used January 2024, used 1 night by me, unknown use history. Comes with 2 Opsaks.",

      "content_preview": "Image link: https://imgur.com/a/Rez58WE Zpacks Arc Blast 55 medium pack/medium hip belt Excellent pack, used but has a ton of life left. Comes fully kitted out with the zpacks shoulder strap pocket, water bottle pocket, two hip belt pockets, and the side compression straps. On my last trip, one of the carbon fiber stays snapped and punctured a hole in the bag, l've since repaired that with DCF tape provided by zpacks and put some gear tape on the outside for good measure. I've included photos both before and after the repair. There are some small abrasions on the bottom of the pack, but the DCF is fine, just the outer fabric that has worn away. I've placed gear tape on those as well for good measure. I was in pretty consistent rain on my last trip and never had water getting into the bag. Lastly, the way the pack sat on me caused the hip belt to rub and it's started to wear out, l've included photos of that. It's still very useable just something to keep in mind. Asking $250 shipped OBO Mammut Aenergy TR HS men's XL A truly ultralight rain jacket. Unlike most UL jackets, this is a full 3-layer jacket coming in at under 6.5 ounces. I only used it on one trip, so it's basically brand new. Only selling because it doesn't fit me very well. Retails for $270, I'm asking $150 shipped. Patagonia Terrebonne Joggers Men's L Lightly used, no holes, stains, or snags. Pond green colorway. Coming in at under 6.5 ounces they make an excellent choice for hiking or trail running in all types of weather. SOLD Spuds Adventure Gear Stick Stashers 2.0 Brand new and unused. Really cool idea, they just don't work with my pack. I'm asking $40 shipped for these. PayPal g&s and Venmo are both acceptable.",
