I was driving for DoorDash today and getting out of a convenience store parking lot after picking up an order. A man about 30 is in an oversized pickup, the kind I like to call ‚Äúdouche trucks‚Äù. I hear him loudly grumbling out his window behind me, and he saw me looking back, and shouted ‚ÄúLET‚ÄôS GO!!!‚Äù, I knew the grumbling was about me then. He had called me a ‚Äúslow bitch‚Äù.",

      "content_preview": "So I‚Äôm a nonbinary transfem thats been on hrt for a year and a few months. At work im out as nonbinary, even have a little they them pin on my name tag. Though I‚Äôm pretty sure most people don‚Äôt see it/don‚Äôt care cause I‚Äôm mostly called he at work. Anyways this was about a week ago, 8:58 pm, 2 min till the store closed for the night. I was walking back up to the registers when my manager calls me on the walkie and asks if there are any customers left in the store. I say yes, there is a mom and her kid. My manager tells me to ask them to hurry up/head over to register. I turn towards the mom and say ‚ÄúExcuse me but we are closing in 2 minutes‚Äù, she says ok and starts saying something to her kid. I start walking back towards the register before thinking oh she might need some help, so I call out and ask if she needs any help finding anything. The mom says no, but also says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to be so rude‚Äù she paused for a second or 2 then questioningly said sir. I was mostly confused by her remark and a little sad but that all was outshined by the euphoria of her being confused about my gender. At the distance she was away from me she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to see my they them pin, so I know she was just actually confused on my gender. It was honestly pretty weird to get euphoria from this experience since she was just being weird? to me, but hey I‚Äôll take it.",

I tell him I just got out of school (it was a Saturday) and I don‚Äôt got money on me. He then asks me why I have a pink backpack n says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a boy you‚Äôre suppose to have a black backpack‚Äù so being the person I am, I turn into a smart ass. I keep asking him ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù and he keeps saying bc I‚Äôm a boy, I‚Äôm suppose to like girls, and having a pink backpack is gay and keeps asking me if I‚Äôm gay. I dance around the question just to fuck with him and keep saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and he‚Äôs getting more and more annoyed by me, and at one point threatens to slap me for having a pink backpack but doesn‚Äôt bc he liked my shoes. I feel bad bc there was a girl sitting in front of me n he was bothering her basically trying to set us up with each other, but she didn‚Äôt wanna get involved obviously.

The whole time at the bus station, I kept on getting stared at with either smiles or dirty looks. There were a few guys that came up to me trying to shoot their shot, but the one that stuck in my head was the guy that said he could tell I‚Äôm trans and that I was really beautiful ‚Äúfor my kind‚Äù. He said it in a way where it felt like he viewed me as a different tier of human. Thankfully, a girl at the bus station came to my rescue and the guy backed off, so that felt really nice.

And then realizing that so many women with Adhd had been actually been misdiagnosed with Bipolar disorder made me kinda happy because well, I'm a girl and that literally just happened lol. (Wasn't actually a diagnosis but you get the idea) I'm not annoyed at the friend btw, I actually feel really happy cause it gave me both relief and euphoria so worth it.",

      "content_preview": "So, I recently started working in a supermarket in the electronics section (I love being a stereotype!!!). I've had lots of male customers be really flirty and gross with me, but I had something happen with a coworker recently, too. First time I met this guy he was buying a natty light, which I later learned he was drinking in the store while riding around in a scooter for disabled customers, possibly while clocked in (details are fuzzy). He's normal in this interaction, maybe a little quiet even. The next day, I came in late, and he's at the door with carts on one of those loaders for them. He says yo, I say hi back and that I'm late. I'm visibly in a rush, and he reverses so that he's blocking the entrance to the store with carts. \"Ayo, can I get your number?\" Stares in most obvious lesbian to step foot in this store. \"I'm gay.\" I then move around and walk in through the exit door. \"But can I get that number?\" I stupidly thought he meant in a platonic way for a second and said, \"Maybe when I'm not running late.\" It clicked that he was still trying to get in my pants five minutes later, and dread hit me. 8 hours later, and 11 pm at night, I clocked out and walked to a deserted part of the parking lot where I was parked. I see the guy in the distance on a hoverboard with rainbow lights. \"Please don't see me...\" \"HEY, SWEET CHEEKS!!!\" I tried to get in my car and pretend I didn't hear him, but by the time I got the key in the ignition, he had his hand on the drivers side door, holding it open. \"I know you said you're, gay, but I'm gay too! Well, not gay-gay, I'm more of a dominant, ya know?\" Visibly confused d**e. \"Yeah like I don't fuck with dudes or transgenders or nothin' like that shit.\" \"Well I am a transgender so...\" \"Yeah but you're beautiful!\" \"Well I appreciate that, but it doesn't change that I'm gay, I don't date men.\" \"Not into dudes even a little?\" \"Nope... I'm a lesbian and I'm taken.\" \"Shit you're taken!?!\" \"Yeah... I tried though! I did mean it, you are beautiful.\" \"Thanks...\" \"So... not even if you were single?\" \"I don't date men.\" \"Never ever?\" \"Never.\" \"Aight...\" Rolls away sadly on his hoverboard. Sooooo that experience was terrifying but as soon as he was gone I started cackling in my car. Never thought I'd meet a man in his early 20s who didn't understand the concept of being gay.",

For context, it was like 8 am, I was running off of no sleep, my fianc√©e had just gotten put under for surgery, and I had some stuff to take care of before picking her back up. Stressed and ravenous, I stopped at a gas station. I live in the city, and I‚Äôve been harassed at gas stations/corner stores/what have you before, but mostly at night when gross men feel more comfortable being shitheads. I pulled up and noticed this guy sitting outside. When he saw me, he looked me up and down and said hey. I silently waved and smiled while walking past because I‚Äôm terminally lazy and haven‚Äôt voice trained. He kept making comments as I got closer ro the door. As I got to the entrance, he yelled behind me, ‚ÄúHey, come back here pretty girl, I‚Äôm not done with you!‚Äù I don‚Äôt usually bother replying when men say weird shit to me, but I think the fact that I was getting harassed at 8 in the fucking morning coupled with the stress of the day got to me, so I flatly replied ‚Äúfuck off, I have a dick‚Äù without even looking back. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he responded. I turned around and and repeated myself more pointedly. This didn‚Äôt end up being the deterrent I thought it would be because he smiled and said ‚Äúthat don‚Äôt matter‚Äù as I opened the door, and as I was walking out, he told me to have a nice day with a creepy but slightly sheepish grin. Yes, I know it was stupid to out myself, especially in such an, um, abrasive manner. No, I don‚Äôt know why I thought it would be a reliable deterrent, because let‚Äôs be real, like half of these straight men find us attractive regardless of our varying situations downstairs. I just thought he‚Äôd at least be embarassed or something üòÖ",

We decided to get some food to go from a local restaurant and eat on the beach. While we were waiting for our food, two older, country looking guys came in to order and were chasing at the table next to us. Later that evening, my wife told me that while I was in the restroom, those guys made some small talk with her. They said that our daughter was cute, and one of them asked she was my wife's daughter. To which his friend cut in and said that it was obvious that it was obviously her biological child (my daughter looks more like my wife for sure). The first guy then defended himself saying that he didn't want to assume since the other lady (me), was holding and playing with her, too. Was pretty cool to get gendered correctly on public without make-up or really trying, but it's the first time I've realized that most people are going to assume that my wife and I are just friends and not a married couple.  Somewhat bittersweet. TLDR: Got gendered correctly for once, at the expense of lesbian erasure.",

YOU ONLY 15?!!!, damn, well nice to meet you, then shakes my hand and leaves and i yell out HEY ITS ALL GOOD, NONE TAKEN!!!, then he yells ALL GOOD!!! then i get to the library, and i was like, well that was scary but atleast he found me attractive pre E, (EUPHORIA MOMENT!!!)  i had a wig on and got all dressed up to see my friends, with the help of my mom to choose an outfit of course, im still not on E but i was happy to know that more people think i pass than not, i think i pass most days but some days i just have the craziest dysphoria, maybe i pass cuz i have more estrogen in my system, due to my face and the way my body fat stores itself, plus u got pre E boobles, but one thing is for certain, im NOT A HOOKER!!!",

Even my boss‚Äôs boss, who‚Äôs also older than my grandpa. And he spent 15 minutes bragging to me about random stuff, glancing down every couple seconds, Yesterday this guy held the door open for me while looking me up and down and was like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nice and tall‚Äù in a weird tone, Had a dude the other day ‚Äújokingly‚Äù asking me to pour a cream I was selling into his mouth and then he repeated it to my boss, Was shopping with my girlfriend a few weeks back in this cute crop/skirt combo I thrifted and this guy looks at the two of us licking his lips and smirking üò≠ And the other day I was in the men‚Äôs bathroom touching up my hair and a guy walked in, made eye contact with me, and walked right back out Honestly all of this stuff feels so jarring. Like why can‚Äôt mf‚Äôs just chill. I also officially go by he/him and my ID‚Äôs still male so the coworkers that ‚Äúknow‚Äù my pronouns seem slightly confused about it. One kept saying she and correcting herself too üßçüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

      "content_preview": "I (a trans woman) was hooking up with a guy and having a lovely time. He had me on my stomach and was doing his thing to me from behind. Then he paused for a moment and pulled out before re-entering. It immediately felt different in a way I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on. But soon I realized that he had taken his condom off and resumed fucking while hoping I wouldn‚Äôt notice, or at least hoping that if he just went for it then I‚Äôd relax my strict policy around using protection. I‚Äôve had a lot of sexual partners in my life but only a handful since I started transitioning. Nobody ever tried to pull shit like that when I was presenting as a man but like the fourth person I hook up with as a woman thinks he can get away with that. Ewphoria fr fr. edit: really appreciate everyone validating how deeply fucked up it is that he did that. I‚Äôm totally fine and this was many months ago so it‚Äôs all in the past. Thanks y‚Äôall.

One time when I was in a store getting help an employee asked a coworker, \"Can you help this ...person?\" I could tell she was trying to be polite and just didn't know if she should say \"gentleman\" or \"lady\" but there was a tense pause until she found the word. I smiled when she landed on \"person\" and she seemed so relieved that I wasn't offended.üòÖ Another time I was in a Mexican restaurant and the waiter called me Se√±or. I'm AFAB and I've been called Sir a lot and I'm just like ü§∑ because I genuinely don't care, but for some reason I was tickled when I was called Sir in Spanish for the first time.",
