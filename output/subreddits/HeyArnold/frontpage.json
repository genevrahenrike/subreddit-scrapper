It's brutal, but it's honest. \"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\" The more I think about that ending, the more impactful it feels. How the whole scenario would not be resolved, but reversed, showing what happens when you take things too far. And, to be fair, I do think Arnold deserved some of the blame. He could have contained his laughter. If not, he could have lied about what he was laughing at. If he ended up saying it happened at Iggy's house, he could have at least not fed his friends clues. It was as if, deep down, Arnold WANTED to tell them more than he wanted to uphold Iggy's wishes. I do think things could have been done better, though, and I do think Arnold was out of character. I almost feel like this should have been someone else's episode. But, overall, I do at least understand the moral and the impact of the episode, and for that, I can't say I hate the episode. Also, I think Curly's Girl is a worse episode.",

I have many reasons...But for now I will write some of them. Arnold knew how bad Helga's family was and this was confirmed by Craig himself. He didn't stay away from her like the others just because she was rude and bad to him he tried to get closer to her, he believed and saw that she could change, he knew that the reason she was like this was because of her family.The only person who can save Helga from her family is Arnold.Arnold is the only light in Helga's life, without him she becomes way  more depressed and withdrawn.

Of course, I don't know if most people agree with me Or not I just see this, and he's actually a very smart and funny character and manipulative, almost like a Mastermind in animes. It's funny to me that the other kids see him as a stupid idiot, especially Rhonda(Rhonda reminds me heather chandler from heathers) also I know he blackmailed Rhonda, but I still love Curly's obsession with Rhonda. It's funny to me. Of course, I DONT support anything he does. But I think he's a very smart and funny character. The same goes for Brainy and Helga! Even Craig Bartlett says Helga is a genius. Brainy is a smart and artistic character in my opinion.Rhonda thinks Curly is a stupid and easy-to-please kid, but she's wrong to me lol Anyway, who are the characters that you guys find funny  talented or intelligent?",

      "content_preview": "So full disclosure, I didn‚Äôt come up with this theory, someone on the wiki did, but I thought I‚Äôd share it here, When I was a kid, this was my favorite episode. I liked it because it was about a train and I got a thrill from the haunted elements. Anyways, the theory is that Grandpa Phil was a witness to the actual wreck of Engine 25, and possibly one of the crew members. A steam engine like 25 requires an engineer and a fireman, and the legend as told by Phil doesn‚Äôt mention the latter. However, Phil also mentions that he worked for the railroad but doesn‚Äôt specify exactly what he did. What if he was engine 25‚Äôs fireman? What if he was there when the engineer went insane? Once he realized what was happening and that a crash was imminent, he likely jumped off the train? Considering the ghost of the engineer was shown to be real, what if Phil encountered said ghost later on and that‚Äôs how the legend began? Thoughts? Also on a side note, the engineer and his controls are depicted as being on the left side of the cab, which isn‚Äôt true for USA and Canadian locomotives, the engineer is always on the right side. Left hand running is a UK/Japan/Australia thing.",
