I already talked about this in my other posts but not everyone is comfy with that label, okay? Okay. Crazy how people clearly realise that no two romantic relationships are the same, and recognise the insanely wide range of dynamics, yet we have sayings like ‚Äúoh romance is different from what you feel for your friends‚Äù etc etc which to me just reduce friendship to a single flavoured concept and makes it seem as if every friendship is the same when that‚Äôs not how human connection works because literally every bond of mine is different whether it‚Äôs with a friend or a family member ok I‚Äôll stop yapping",

Today I kinda found out that that person is going to travel with \"a friend\", which most likely implied that they are together based on the body language (cause we are LGBT, so she didn't straight out say girlfriend, we live in a conservative country). While I may be wrong interpreting it, just a gut feeling telling me that she is attached already. The thing I don't understand why she is so friendly, talking to me after class. Now I am feeling kinda stupid. Like.... why? Why do i have to have crushes and infatuations? Why do our hearts behave this way?

      "content_preview": "Technically it's on the 25th of August, but it happened last year, which was a Sunday. I was kind of dreading this day for a while, but as time came closer, I started to not mind it. I still vividly remember what happened and what led up to her breaking up with me over text. Long story short, we were incompatible and I commend her for being the one to end it. There have been a number of times where we should've ended it, but asked to fight through it. She gave me way too many chances. I was crying for a week, until that Friday I said that I'm going to just focus on my friends and family. Well after about almost a month of plans not falling through or people being busy, I was kind of confused on what to really do next. Sure I can spend time on my hobbies or get better at things, but those are things I was already doing, or trying to do, during the relationship. I wanted to do something new, something I either tried to do before and failed or just something that'll give me a new, fresh take on life. Mid-September, I decided to attempt to lose weight again. During the relationship, I was 210lbs, which is pretty much on the borderline of being obese class II. I was so close to reaching my highest weight, which was 213.4lbs in April 2021. I knew I had to lose weight as new XL shirts (my size at the time) started to fit me tight. I dreaded buying new shirts because I had to stretch them to fit into them. I realize now that it was because I was on my way (or pretty much there) to becoming an XXL. This was something that made me concerned, as when I reached XL I hated it but not enough to warrant losing weight. Trying to lose weight while in a relationship is difficult, especially when your partner seems supportive at first, but then gets upset when you don't eat with them. If I was fasting, she would get upset that I wouldn't eat a sandwich with her during my fasting period; I broke my fast to please her. If I overate, she would get upset that she was the only one eating; I would get something when I wasn't hungry or didn't want to eat to please her. Before meeting her, I was going on walks at a park, and I had reached 204lbs. Obviously my weight picked back up when I met someone who liked me for me. I said \"to hell with this\" and tried again, this time making it a goal to walk 10,000 steps a day and stick to a calorie deficit. I've done a deficit before, going down to 190lbs, but got comfortable and picked up the weight again back in the end of 2023. Another goal of mine was to get a house before 30. I thought that would've been impossible with everything happening at the time, and the possibility seemed low with how much I thought I had to catch up to even put down a down payment. I shared this goal with her, and she said that she liked it, and we even made a goal to get married, get a house, and have kids. Now, the thing with me was, I wanted a house, marriage, and kids in that order. Create stability and a spot that I can pass down to my kids; she wanted kids before a house. I've been through moving throughout my childhood, and I hated it and didn't want my kids to go through that. Long story short, after the relationship, I went back to the drawing board and figured out I don't actually want kids. For what I want to do in life, I need time, money, and energy to be all on my side. I couldn't afford to invest it in a kid. So, I'm glad I figured that part out of my life. As with marriage, I'm in no rush now. So, with all that said, one year after the breakup, I accomplished more than I thought I ever could. That being: - Losing 60 pounds since starting in mid-September (I am now a Medium and considered Healthy!) - Got a house at 26 - Raising 3 dogs (these are my kids, and while they can be stressful at times, I much prefer them over a kid) - Giving going out to places alone a shot more (whether I enjoy it or not, I'm happy to say I did what I wanted to instead of saying \"I should've gone\") - Dedicate more time to personal projects and hobbies - Have gotten more comfortable being alone Never in a million years did I think I'd be where I am today a year after the breakup. I'm happy to have gotten up and prove that I can become better. Something I said to myself was \"I don't want to keep being the same person she broke up with.\" I didn't do all this to prove I can do it without her, but to prove that I am capable of getting back up from the ground and not stopping when I want something. I typed more than I thought I would, and I hope someone gets a little inspired and know that, while things may seem bad at the beginning, take control of the situation, and make something out of it! Easier said than done, I know, but if I can get back up, so can you. I appreciate you if you read all of this.",

I get to enjoy my single life and go on dates for that social connection. I craved sex with a man this morning, rubbed one out and now that craving is gone, replaced by a hankering for breakfast :D.  Which tells me it's an inconvenient internalized urge, not a need that fulfills me as a person. I don't want to have sex with people I don't have enough of an emotional connection to (and aren't willing to share test results or have an informed conversation), and it's very difficult to get there in 3 dates. It's been beyond the skillset I have and the people I have access to. Neither of us get unnecessarily attached and can just have a good time. The idea of a relationship based on what I've experienced feels like a trap for me. Dates end with a \"Thanks!\" and then we go our own ways back to freedom. Everyone's too busy enjoying their single lives, a fun date is just the cherry on top once so often.",

I was married for 12 years and that ended in the worst way it can. She led a double life behind my back the ENTIRE time. Then I was in an 8 year relationship with a girl that had SEVERE depression. I did all I could to help her but she would just yell and scream at me. I kept hoping the \"real\" her would come out but when I forced her to finally work on herself, she suddenly \"found God\" and left me because I am not religious even slightly. My relationships absolutely destroyed me mentally, physically, financially... pretty much every way one can be messed up. So I found myself a single father, approaching 50, survived bad breakups all my life (some in college, HS too) and lonely. I realized then that I never really loved myself and kept looking for validation in other people. I used to think \"No one will want me or truly love me cause I got such and such going on.\" But really its reverse. \"I love myself and I don't NEED anyone there. And if I do meet someone, they need to DESERVE me.\" The women I was with sometimes were low hanging fruit but they were lessons. I learned what I don't need or deserve in my life. In relationships, I people pleased. Walked on eggshells. Asked permission for things. Anytime I got something I Wanted, I felt guilty or had to apologize for it. They ruled me, told me what to do. Now, I do anything I damn well want! A lot of work, sleep, read, etc... but at least its peaceful! If I feel like listening to this rock channel in the car, I do. If I want to watch this movie or show, I do it. I can read when I want and not be \"ignoring\" someone. I can work on my art and writing and never get interrupted. Eat where and what I want. Travel expenses cut in half! Travel where I Want to go. Total freedom! I think I earned that after everything I have been through. I get lonely sometimes, but its not often anymore that I watch a couple walk by hand in hand and feel sad or envious. I think, \"Good for them! I hope it works out.\" Sometimes I'll see someone in a relationship obviously miserable or \"stuck.\" I just want to shake them and tell them to get out! Someday maybe I will have a meet cute with someone who is my type, won't hurt me in those ways, mature, driven, strong willed, strong morals, etc. If not thats fine. I got me! And me is all I need. Don't be sad to be alone. Its freedom. ENJOY THE RIDE!",

For those already happy with their own company, it's still a great course for embracing it. I haven't worked on it in a while. I have felt more attractive single than when I was in a relationship. I have felt unattractive but also have had moments where I felt too sexy for my shirt. Ernest Bourgnine inspired me to come up with this idea. This course all came from a funny movie scene: My course/class teaches: Self love Self respect Embracing your identity and how you look Not giving a shit about what others think Being happy single Being comfortable with standing out Not taking rejection or rudeness personally Self care Being happy and comfortable with singlehood Enjoying your own company and doing things alone Doing things for yourself and not others validation or approval",

      "content_preview": "I've been reflecting on what I actually want from relationships versus what's expected. At 38, I've got my life sorted - house paid off, retirement planned, and I can handle all the domestic stuff myself. I don't want kids. When I'm honest about it, I really only want two things from a partner: good conversation some evenings (not every night) and physical intimacy. But for just those two needs, a traditional long-term relationship or marriage feels like overkill - especially when it often comes with drama and complications. My main life goals are inner peace and outer harmony. I've worked hard to build a stable, drama-free existence. So I'm questioning whether the conventional relationship path actually serves someone in my position, or if I'm better off finding simpler ways to meet those specific needs without all the extra baggage. Anyone else feel like they've outgrown traditional relationship expectations?",

      "content_preview": "Tl; dr: You main person doesn‚Äôt have to be a spouse; friends/other family members/anyone can be central too. friendships can have intimacy and commitment without sex. terms like gf/partner are too loaded so i just say best friend, who‚Äôs the person i wanna spend my life with. queer platonic relationships exist and I love the meaning but they tend to get undervalued too. I don‚Äôt like shipping friends bc that kinda erases their bond imo. everyone‚Äôs needs are different, some find them in friends, some in romantic partners. both are valid. Love and relationships cannot be divided into neat categories because everyone is different. End of tl dr It makes me hate marriage and romance all together. I hate hearing a word about them. They‚Äôre all people talk about. The language used when talking about romance (‚Äúhaving feelings‚Äù ‚Äúlove of my life‚Äù ‚Äútogether‚Äù ‚Äúman/woman I loved‚Äù ‚Äúlike like‚Äù ‚Äúsomething (meaning romance)‚Äù ‚Äúnothing (meaning no romance even if there‚Äôs a different bond)‚Äù I had to do a double take when I saw someone say ‚ÄúI love this person but have no feelings for them‚Äù) makes it look like it‚Äôs all that matters, it‚Äôs the only ‚Äúreal‚Äù thing. I hate it. I hate the way umbrella terms are mainly used in the romantic context, meaning words like love or intimacy have been reduced to the romantic meaning and people just expect you to assume they mean romance, if that makes sense. I don‚Äôt hate the concept of a person you spend your life with. But I hate how only one type of person is given that role. Spending your life with your mom? Sibling? Friends? Fifth cousin? Never heard of that. In media, it‚Äôs always the spouse that‚Äôs the first priority (ok fine that makes sense in most cases but not always bc BALANCE, but again I hate how the primary person is ALWAYS a spouse), the one you like spending time with the MOST (‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù mindset I‚Äôve seen where some people act like you either love your spouse the most or you don‚Äôt love them at all. You either enjoy spending time with them the most or you don‚Äôt like spending time with them at all. We apply the ‚Äújust because I love them doesn‚Äôt mean I love you any less‚Äù mindset to other people, so why not spouses too? I don‚Äôt get it), just your #1 in everything, which by the way is a lot to put on one person. I just wish media showed other relationships like friendships being the centre of one‚Äôs life. My best friend is literally the love of my life I love her so much and she‚Äôs the one I wanna spend my life with yet we don‚Äôt see such relationships in media or even in real life we don‚Äôt see people talking about these relationships much. Some romantic relationships in media feel so forced. I feel no chemistry, and they‚Äôre way closer to other people in their life than each other, yet they somehow love and care for each other the most üòê because they‚Äôre dating and it‚Äôs supposed to be that way or whatever üòêüôè And when people are talking about friendship being undervalued, someone goes ‚Äúfr let‚Äôs marry our friends‚Äù again with the marry. It‚Äôs frustrating. It‚Äôs also annoying to see friendships immediately get the ‚Äúsibling‚Äù label slapped onto them. Idk. It‚Äôs just annoying. They‚Äôre friendships just let them be what they are. might just take this as a chance to yap more about my best friend üòÅ I LOVE HER SMMMMM she‚Äôs my favourite person. I‚Äôm literally in love with her. I remember seeing someone say that we should all be a little in love with our friends and I tend to agree ü´© She‚Äôs my primary person and my friendship with her is way different from my other ones which brings me to another point that not all friendships are of one flavor. Not every friendship is without intimacy or commitment. Oh yeah there‚Äôs some people who say that intimacy in friendship is weird :( no im not talking about sexual intimacy. That‚Äôs not the only type of love intimacy. I know people usually use the term ‚Äúgf/bf/partner‚Äù for this type of person but erm that‚Äôs way too loaded with weird implications and expectations that I don‚Äôt like üò¨ People will think I‚Äôm in a haram relationship! And I don‚Äôt want people calling me a lesbian. Life partner would‚Äôve been a good term that I could use for this type of friend but again, it‚Äôs tied to sex and romance and marriage. So I just say best friend üò≠ I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong for me to say that I think there should be a separate term for the person you‚Äôre spending your life with but are not sexually involved with them (and this term would be very broad because this person could be anyone. You can spend your life with anyone you like). And if sex gets involved, then have another term for that. That‚Äôs basically the same thing but indicates sexual involvement. I think we already have a term called Queer Platonic relationship, and I love the meaning behind this term and why it was created I think it‚Äôs perfect, but personally I still use the term friendship since I like it better but anyways there‚Äôs still many who treat this term and lesser than romance üòê whatever I guess it‚Äôs their choice. And yeah, to each their own. If you‚Äôre happy with the way you‚Äôre living then no one has the right to say against that. This is why I hate shipping, more specifically the shipping of two people who are not dating. It feels like trying to erase what‚Äôs already there (for example, friendship if the two people are friends) instead of appreciating that such a close bond exists and hence normalise it. But noooooooo nothing tops romance and apparently that‚Äôs a universal truth. üòê overall I hope I made sense. Basically that 1. Friendship is undervalued and given a light meaning 2. Not everyone wants to call their person whom they don‚Äôt have sex with as ‚Äúgirlfriend or boyfriend‚Äù because of the meanings attached to it still. I also agree that calling a relationship ‚Äújust friendship‚Äù because it has no sex is also wrong but only because of the ‚Äújust friendship‚Äù part. For me that‚Äôs your most special person. Your person and the one you‚Äôre committed to fully and spend your daily life with. I just think that friendship can stretch enough of include this bond. If we could stretch friendship to include friends with benefits then we can stretch to include a person you spend your life with. Which is why things like ‚Äúromantic feelings are different from what you feel for your friends‚Äù make no sense to me because every friend is different, in my experience at least, and I feel differently for every friend. But hey if the opposite is your experience then that‚Äôs also fine. I think we shouldn‚Äôt invalidate any bond and not expect relationships to be copy and paste because everyone is different. Trying to divide love and relationships is like trying to divide people when they‚Äôre all different and cannot be divided. [this next paragraph is from an Islamic POV so non Muslims can skip it if they like] I know in Islam there are preset differences between certain relationships, but those differences are more practical (if I‚Äôm using the right word) like rights and responsibilities, and sexual intimacy and kids for spouses. But those don‚Äôt erase the fact that apart from these preset differences, love and relationships cannot be divided, hence questions like ‚Äúthe difference between so and so relationship and so and so relationship‚Äù that go beyond the preset differences are meaningless. [back to general pov] I don‚Äôt mean to dismiss anyone, and if you feel that anything here doesn‚Äôt make sense then please let me know. Please do let me know if I‚Äôve worded anything wrong or if I‚Äôm wrong about anything. I‚Äôm willing to have healthy discussions as long as it‚Äôs respectful. Also wanted to add that everybody has different needs. Some get all of them fulfilled by a friend or sibling or whoever. Some feel they need a romantic partner. All are valid. I found a best friend willing to spend her life with me. Many find that in a romantic partner and that is valid. edit 2: typos",

      "content_preview": "So, I have been single for a while now and pretty comfortable being single. I don‚Äôt usually put myself out there in any social events hinting I‚Äôm open for any kinda dating. I have my routine for the past 2.5 years and it‚Äôs pretty much my work, gym and pickleball. I‚Äôm 32F, and this old man (I think at least 60M) who I usually see him at pickleball almost regularly like 2 times a week, keeps making comments which hits that he is interested in me, like Once we were taking a break from game to game and he said, ‚Äú Im getting fat these days and I may need to find a girlfriend to workout and keep me in shape‚Äù.  Which I totally ignored and pretended like I didn‚Äôt hear a word he said. But he explicitly made sure to repeat the same statement when I told him I didn‚Äôt hear what he said I was distracted watching my phone. He also keeps saying things like ‚Äú you can play this game, I‚Äôll sit and take my spot in the game‚Äù when I let others play in my place,he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sitting so you can play, if you don‚Äôt wanna play, I‚Äôll go play‚Äù and he just goes on to play He keeps saying ‚ÄúI would like to have a young wife, you can actually be my wife‚Äù, which I totally cut it off and say ‚ÄúSTOP SAYING THAT‚Äù He keeps saying ‚Äú you‚Äôre pretty, why would people not want to play with a pretty girl like you, I‚Äôll play with you‚Äù - context was I was talking to someone and explaining why good players won‚Äôt want to play with me as their partner to avoid loosing the game. One day, I‚Äôm done with the game for the night p, and packed up my things and said bye goodnight to the gang and walking out of the building towards my car, he literally came right behind me. I got really scared as it was dark and I was alone in parking lot, so I got in my car immediately and locked the doors and called my friend to keep him on line just in case. The next day when we were on break between games, he comes sits next to me and says ‚Äú the reason I came right behind you yesterday was to make sure you got in safe and looking after you‚Äù which I felt creepy, given the history of comments he make. These are just some of the examples, I have a lot of other examples where he keeps asking people if I‚Äôm coming to play the game, where I play and he shows up, etc. Am I just overthinking or is this normal? Should I continue going to pickleball where he would be or find some place new and just avoid him? He knows 90% of the places that I play pickleball and now that winter is coming there is only one place I have to play and he would be there. Should I completely avoid him? And tell people to not give my updates to him?",

      "content_preview": "I mean, clearly it isn‚Äôt, right? People have very different ideas. Some say romantic feelings always involve sexual attraction, while others say it doesn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs just about intense emotional closeness, wanting to be around someone all the time, imagining a life together and so on but that makes me wonder that if I feel all those things for my best friend but don‚Äôt experience sexual attraction, is that still romantic? Some people might say yes, some no and some would just call it deep platonic love. Does it even make sense to try to put everyone‚Äôs experience into the same category? Can what counts as romantic for one person be platonic for someone else? Same thing about how we decide we‚Äôve ‚Äúfallen in love.‚Äù Is it simply whenever you decide that your feelings are ‚Äúin love‚Äù? For example, if I feel intense attachment to my best friend and I plan my life with her and imagine sharing everything together and love her very deeply and differently from everyone else, could I say I‚Äôve fallen in love if I decide that this is what falling in love is for me? Or am I wrong about what ‚Äúin love‚Äù means and that there is one correct definition? Edit: I‚Äôve said before obv that I don‚Äôt call my feelings for my best friend as ‚Äúromantic‚Äù because of the implications and I don‚Äôt want to be called a lesbian or for people to assume I‚Äôm in a haram relationship, etc etc. but that‚Äôs irrelevant to this post i guess because I‚Äôm discussing definitions in general. I do say that I‚Äôm in love with her but wouldn‚Äôt even say that around most people because otherwise they‚Äôll err.. assume things I don‚Äôt want. I mean, what one person describes as deep platonic feelings could be romantic feelings for someone else right? Same with the definition of friendship. From what I've observed, most people describe friendship as one flavor, or not one flavor, but more casual? And things like always thinking about the other person, wanting to be around them 24-7, and wanting to spend your life with this person doesn't come under the friendship category. But for me, I think any relationship could stretch to include a bond where you want to spend your life with somebody. And I talked about this in my other post as well. I think that‚Äôs basically just a difference in boundaries, but back to feelings, I guess one just feels romantic love once they decide that what they feel is romantic? That‚Äôs how they define it? Idk. Again, same for platonic and all. Do we follow society‚Äôs definitions of love and romantic feelings or do we get to define them for ourselves?",

I've been single since November of 2014. That's almost 11 years without being in a relationship. In that time, I've only been on five or six dates, my last one being in 2021. I've reached a point where even highly attractive girls that are way out of my league don't even interest me anymore. I've always been a long term thinker, and am aware of what it's like when the honeymoon phase wears off. I just never really have been the type of person that falls for someone, for life. I always get tired of the relationship (and no, I've never cheated on anyone). Even apart from romance, I'm super independent and love being alone. I often joke that I don't experience loneliness. Now, maybe this isn't technically true. Perhaps if I were on a deserted island for a year, I'd get lonely. But I live alone, and absolutely love not seeing people, other than my parents and sister every now and then. It sounds wrong to say, but I just don't like being around people. I'm much happier on days where I see nobody, and just hang out at home. Sociologicaly, I know this is nonsense. We need society and have to rely on each other. But apart from needing my fellow humans to drive trucks and stock grocery store shelves, I otherwise want to be left alone. Despite the fact that I'm kind and empathetic towards others, and always willing to help people out in need. (I wouldn't mind somebody knocking on my door because they needed help).",

It was not my decision to end my last relationship and I tried really hard for years to make it work; now I can't believe how scared I was of separating from my ex because I feared to be lonely. Today, this fear seems ludicrous to me. The fact is that I do feel lonely some days, but in retrospect I felt soooo much lonelier when I was in a couple. I felt lonely when I was misunderstood, I felt lonely when I was unsupported, I felt lonely when I was doing more of the emotional and household work, I felt lonely when we had a fight... I felt lonely most of the time! Now that I'm free, I'd say I feel lonely some days for an hour or two, but it's the kind of loneliness that evaporates with a good book, movie, coffee with a friend, walk in the woods with the dogs, chatting with a neighbour. The rest of the time, because I have so much more time and energy than before, I hang out with people I used to have no time for, and I get to know them more deeply. I babysit my nephews. I go to the dog park and meet new people. I watch people talk about their happy, fulfilled single life on social media. In a way I feel more connected to other humans than I did when I was in a couple; in that way I feel less lonely than when I was hoping for my ex to fulfill this need for connection. I had tunnel vision while I was focused on that one romantic relationship. Now I see people I wasn't paying attention to. Being single is not lonely. It's an open door.",

That's a choice I've made so this ain't a self pity party, I aint one of those Mens Lonliness Epidemic‚Ñ¢Ô∏è weirdos.

I know this ain't healthy and I'm working on nipping those feelings in the bud before they come up. I also shut down anything that looks even remotely like it's going romantic (platonic connections are fine as long as they don't go further than that). I'm kn the early stages of accepting that not everyone has an other half though, but I know I'll get there with time and patience. I ain't partner material despite my best attempts in my past relationships, and I'm working towards accepting that too. At some point I'll be able to take full joy in a life on my own.",
