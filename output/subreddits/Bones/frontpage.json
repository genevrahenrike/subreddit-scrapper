      "content_preview": "I have read a decent amount of these posts and I gotta say u people are ridiculous.  Hodgins is not hated by the writers it's just the way his character story and arc went throughout the episodes.  A lot of what he went through in the show just shows how well being tenacious, gritty, and jovial can help u get through a lot of life-changing events. The man goes through some shit from not being able to be with the woman he truly loves to having children with her. Then Pelant takes billions from him and honestly it doesn't even bother him that much. Also let's remember that it was Angela's inability to form meaningful relationships without sex that is the real cause as to why they couldn't marry the first time. Then Pelant comes in takes his billions, sets him up for murder and he goes about his life as if it's just another day. He then rises above this by partnering with Opie on the hot sauce which helps brings in some dough for the family. Then he is inspired by an intern to create multipurpose flooring designed to protect glassware from breaking making his own millions. Oh I almost forgot to mention his estranged mentally ill brother he finds out about after he loses his billions. He's also takes this in stride by going to get a loan in order to pay for his care. Finally the man gets paralyzed from the explosion becomes bitter and resentful(understandably so) but rises above it with help from his wife who reminds him that she's not a material person and only wants her husband back, their life back. It sounds like to me he's the example of a true man one who takes all of these life-changing events and barrel past them, overcome the diversity of life itself and what it throws at you. At any point he could've broke down and given up like most people do but he kept going through it all like a true man would. If you're a male and you disagree with me on this then well lets just say that speaks volumes about you as a person. P.S.: I almost forgot the man was also a victim of the gravedigger with Brennan which is something else he overcame with the help of Angela. Also in the episode where he becomes paralyzed there was a very obvious foreshadowing that something bad was going to happen to a main character. Somebody mentions how lucky both Aubrey and Hodgins are to just be alive and Angela says \"That's  just it why are we always the lucky ones.\" Honestly if anybody was going to be paralyzed Hodgins is the only character that makes sense story wise to do it to. Finally in the final episode he is given the responsibility of running the Jeffersonian institute while Cam is away building a life with Arastoo. That's an example of what happens when you overcome adversity in life you achieve great things. These are very positive outcome for someone you all described as hated. Plus every character goes through their own adversities and struggles in the show.",

      "content_preview": "So I am currently on my second rewatch of the show, hoping to finally make it to the end this way around since I have never done it before but this time I am very bothered by a lot of things I didn't mind the first time I watched it. I just got to episode 2 in season 5, and I swear it feels like the writers reset Brennan's emotional growth at the start of every season, making her MORE condescending, emotionless, and robotic. I am so bothered by her lack of awareness, empathy, or even care for other people's feelings, but we're supposed to rejoice when she does like something small that can sort of be considered nice? Like in the first episode, where Cam goes to hug her, but she's like why would I want a hug from you? Followed by her hugging both Hodgins and Booth. But in this episode when Wendal loses his scholarship and everyone is tiptoeing around the topic trying to find a solution, she bluntly tells him, \"yeah you lost the scholarship and I guess Cam was too focused on sentimental drivel to let you know you no longer have a place here\", but we're supposed to appreciate the catch in her voice when she says he's smart one of the smartest interns she's ever worked with? Or when she's showing off about money, but then buys Booth a book and tells him I expect you to pay me back even when he tells her I thought that was a gift, and she's like no, I wouldn't want you to feel like I am attacking your virility or some such thing and insists on the payback. I don't know how to describe it but at the start of every season, she is harsher and more cluelessly cruel than before, despite the writers spending all season talking about her wanting to be more empathetic and learning from Sweets and Booth, trying to understand compassion from Angela, and apparently being plagued by the need to get better, only for her to not learn anything. The issue for me is that, if she's this psychopathic, intelligent person with zero empathy, she at least learns from those around her, not by observing them, but by what they tell her to do and not to do. She has been told repeatedly what is rude and what isn't, what is appropriate and what isn't. She has been instructed on what to do and pretend, and she even claims she needs to THINK before she speaks, but when it comes to treating anyone else like garbage, she never thinks. Or is it just me?",
