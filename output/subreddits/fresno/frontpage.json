Little turtles in little plastic aquariums, for $25. \"Do they get any bigger?\" I asked. \"Oh, no,\" she said.  \"They're very easy to take care of.  They can just stay in this little aquarium and you feed them turtle food once a day.\" So I bought a fucking turtle.  It was so cute, I figured why not? Then I googled them.  Turns out they can grow to be a foot long and need huge aquariums with a bunch of specialized equipment.  They can live 30 years. Luckily, I was able to gift my turtle to someone who already has turtles and the proper setup for turtles. But I'm posting this cautionary warning: beware the turtle lady. It was in the area of Shaw and Marks if anyone is curious.",

Despite this both of whom had better urbanism and better attractions. Idaho falls had a whole natural history museum full of mummies and stuffs of extinct megafauna it was fucking sick. It also had very nice urbanism in its downtown very walkable and it had plenty of people out and about there were flower pots, many local restaurants. This bumfuck town in the middle of nowhere potato state had a downtown that stat cleared fresno it was HUMILIATING. Salt Lake City had a metroline, it has 3 routes too I saw it whizzing by pretty frequently and salt lake city also had an enormous impressive skyline despite having less than half of Fresno's population. Better amenities and better public infrastructure in its downtown its a damned travesty an injustice. What is the deal? Does Fresno just have the worst Bureaucratic corruption in the known universe? Why is it that we get lapped by smaller cities in smaller, poorer states? Why is it that we have no museums, that we have no metro line, that we have so few libraries, that we have so few public parks? Where is the investment in our public infrastructure? Why is our downtown skyline so stagnant? Why are our downtown buildings empty and unused? Does it all get siphoned off by the PD? Is there an army of bullshit jobs filled by friends of the mayor that takes up half the city budget? I need answers",

      "content_preview": "1960 - 1974 and later years. My sister, 15 years older than I, worked as a life guard at the San Joaquin memorial high school.  My first swimming lesson about 1962 was being tossed into the deep end, sister watching to see if I sunk or swam.  A nun appeared, telling my sister I was too young to be at the pool.  I was taken for two summers to help the nuns make bracelets and check out sports equipment while my sister did pool duty. There was about three large swimming pools, plus city and high school pools during the summers. Graduation from 6th grade 1966 required a swimming certification to go to jr high in Fresno.  I got my lessons at Fresno High school. High school at Mclane required one swim class, I did summer of 10th grade. I use swim at Fresno State University pool summers 70s 80s, use to cost $1. There was a Continental  grocery store on Fresno Street and McKinley, on the south east corner.  The ditch bank flowed underneath.  We would ride inner tubes from First street to Fresno street under the store towards Blackstone, 60s Five to ten of us would ride inner tubes in the ditch from east Clovis to Blackstone and Shields about 1966 1967…. Caution! Do not swim in the ditch banks because they now have metal grates installed to collect trash and debris. Use to ride the ditch banks from east of Clovis to Ashlan and Millbrook on mini bikes 1968 to 1970. Wild Water Adventures started 1974.  Island Water Park opened 1998.   Both I visited with family 1998 and later.  😁 There’s a creek and water slide. Drive east on Herndon or Shaw towards the hills past a graveyard, had a huge flat rock.  The rock had metal rings on the sides, we called the spot “the rings.”  We would climb up above and slide down the water slide in the rocks to a pool below.  Might be fenced off now. Swimming in Shaver Huntington Edison lakes is cold water.  The snow run off fills the lakes.  It’s so cold your body could get shocked.  Legs stiff can’t move.  May 1st through about end of September is season for being in the water.  Does snow in May and August September.  Weather can be tricky.  Good trout fishing at all these lakes. Above Dinky camp grounds there are pools to swim in.  There are good fishing spots above and below the camp grounds.  We would camp there as a family, I was about 10.  I worked at Dinkey May 1st to October 31st, summer job, 1985. If you sit real still in the deeper part of a stream, fish hide around the huge boulders.  Take your hand and slowly move it under the fish, tickle the bottom of the fish with your fingers.  The fish will move sideways.  Then if done just right, you can pick up the trout in your hands. Bass lake not as cold.  Good fishing at north end of the lake. Millerton Lake warmer.  Below the damn access closed after 9/11. Water below Millerton dangerous, past the bridge not as bad.  There was a spot east of the river below Millerton damn by the bridge where we road motorcycles in the 70s.  San Joaquin river flows from Millerton damn past the 99 freeway going west.  Never swam the river.  Below the 99 over pass use to be a great place to catch catfish at night, 60s 70s. Pine flat warmer water, way dangerous below damn.  Kings river below, swift.  Good fishing.  We use to fish below the damn, access closed off after 9/11.  Use to catch tons of fish below the damn 60s 70s. I worked at the grocery store at Sequoia National Park summer of 1984.  Spent most the day restocking store and soda machines around the area.  Lived in a huge tent. Yosemite. Merced river swift and cold.   I Jumped off a bridge into the river one summer, about 1974.  Had to swim at an angle towards the shore to get out. Dangerous!  Stupid, don’t attempt.  My friends and I survived.  Fishing best in August when the river not as fast from snow melt.  Best time to see water falls is in May beginning of June because of snow melt.",

      "content_preview": "Thanks for the morning thunder lightning n rain! At about age 13 in Fresno, 1967, burned the bottoms of my feet so bad, blistered. Took a walk on a summer day down the block to Tollhouse Park. Could not walk for about 3 days. My neighbor the other day told me to not walk in the street barefoot to the mail box. Fresno is considered semi-arid desert. Ran around in only shorts, no shoes or shirt from birth till graduation from high school, 1974. Public swimming pools were a necessity!  50 cents per day! When mowing the lawn or working in the yard, douse yourself with the water hose on hot summer days every once in a while to stay cool, get some in your hair. We use to ride bikes, mini bikes n motorcycles in shorts no shoes no shirt or even a helmet.  Not sure when motorcycle helmets became law, after 1974. House had a swamp cooler that failed to cool the air above 99 degrees.  We got our first house air conditioning installed about 1972. 1962, our car back then had no air conditioner. We had 4/60 cooling, drive 60 miles an hour with 4 windows down. Oh ya, no seat belts….  Got automatic transmission in our 1962 Rambler. Got automatic sprinklers about 1984… Sorry, just the memories of summers past!",

      "content_preview": "Born 1955 at Community Hospital down town, can’t escape this place.  Now there’s a Community Hospital in Clovis.  Disneyland opened 1955. Once upon a time there was no freeway 41, 168, Manchester, Fashion Fair, Clovis Mall, plus the corner of Blackstone and Shaw was the edge town.  We shopped at Mayfair shopping center. Fulton Mall was the about the only place to shop, bus trip.  The mall was put in and taken away, greedy politicians. Table Mountain bingo, Tachi bingo.  No slots….  Clovis card room. Clovis Rodeo! “You just lost it in the figs,” oops they tore figs out to build new homes convenience stores  and shopping centers. The owners and family of Perry Boys Smorgasbord and Ole Frijole sold out and moved to Hawaii. White Front, Kmart, Sears, Thrifty Drugs, PayLess Drug Stores, Rite Aid, Longs, Mervin’s, Montgomery Wards, Herb Bauer’s, Bob’s Big Boy, A&W, Sambo’s, Cony Island , Lester Burger, Pizza n Pipes and the Pop Shop are all gone. California income tax, sales tax, local tax, gasoline tax plus Fed income tax.  I was told when I was a kid that we pay taxes to help fix the roads. Why are there pot holes all over.  1/2 of my mortgage is tax. The water is sent via aqueduct to Southern and Northern California, so we buy veggies grown in Mexico. Everyone from Southern and Northern California is selling their homes, moving to Fresno buying homes at a bargain.  Getting way too over populated compared 1965 when I was 10 years old. There use to be a 5 and 10 cent store on the corner of Clinton and Fresno Street.  Half the store was penny candy.  One dollar got me 100 pieces, candy bars that sell for $2.50 now could be bought for 10 cents. I delivered the Guide and Fresno Bee, 100 customer paper route, age 11 to 13. Black and white TV till the 5th season of “Combat” 1966. In the 60s my father owned the meat market in the back of a grocery store off Princeton on Van Ness.  Tore down the market and built a house.  He then worked as a butcher at     Hanoian’s by the Fresno Fair grounds. We use to dove, duck, pheasant and rabbit hunt every year.  Dad bought me a 410 shotgun for my 10th birthday.  Took hunting lessons at Herb Bauer’s off Abby n Blackstone. Fishing was good at Dinkey, Shaver, Huntington and Edison.  Six mile hikes from above Courtright Reservoir to Nelson lakes. Drive n movies 🍿 👀.  I think Madera still got one…, Sorry 😞 just got myself thinking about the past.",

      "content_preview": "I was thinking of taking the kids but I haven’t been in 20 years. What’s the vibe? Is it still fun? Run down? Is the mini golf course in decent shape? Edit: After all on overwhelmingly positive reviews on this post, we took the kids today and had an amazing time! As many mentioned, it is absolutely frozen in time and is exactly how I remembered it, apart from some updated arcade games. I was actually very pleasantly surprised with the overall cleanliness and upkeep, especially given its age. Every staff member we interacted with was fantastic, helpful, and friendly. We played some mini golf and I was happy to see the turf was in good shape, and all the “trick” holes worked with the occasional stuck ball that you could easily get out with your club. When we were ready to pass out from the heat (I do not recommend mini golf any time between 11:00am and sunset in the summer), we hit up the arcade. The games were all in good shape and on the newer side very few out of order. My only complaint is that the claw machines are far too difficult - we played about a dozen rounds because the kids love them didn’t see a single win the entire time we were there (including the others playing). We also checked out the captain kids area which is a blast from the past, but very fun. I really enjoyed playing the vintage ski ball and super Mario pinball with the kids. The little kid rides are dated but very well maintained (especially compared to playland) and the operator staff were wonderful, friendly, and went out of their way to make sure the kids were having fun and staying safe (also especially compared to playland). Prices were reasonable for mini golf and the arcade, and the ticket redemption rates were decent. Definitely recommend the packages or unlimited play if you are going to do more than one activity. Overall we had a wonderful time and will definitely be back. Thanks to all who weighed in and nudged us to check it out again after all these years, it did not disappoint!",

      "content_preview": "Hey! I’ve been wanting to start a pop punk girl band but honestly, I’m super new to all of this. I don’t have band experience yet, but I do have a bunch of unfinished poems/lyrics that I’d love to turn into songs with the right people. I’m a singer, and I’m looking for guitar, bass, drums, maybe even keyboard if that fits the vibe. We’d be starting from square one, but I’m dedicated and really want to make this work. I’m a little introverted, but I’m trying to break out of that and I think music is the best way for me to do it. If anyone’s interested in collaborating, let’s talk!",
