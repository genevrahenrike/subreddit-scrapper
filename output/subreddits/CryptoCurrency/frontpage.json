      "content_preview": "Pudgy Party - Battle Royalelaunched last Friday and it's had a strong launch with over 250K downloads in five days - especially when you consider that Pudgy Penguins started as a web 3 NFT collection.https://preview.redd.it/pudgy-party-the-game-nfts-gameplay-guide-and-earning-rewards-v0-8nu2mxei17nf1.pngThe gameplay is easy to understand, just start a match then: race, fight, get KOs or play a handful of other game types. However understanding the Crypto connection or even the niche details for scoring well on DopaMeme to earn more NFTs becomes a bit trickier to understand.In this post we'll briefly review the crypto connection, the marketplace and the gameplay guide for scoring well in DopaMeme to earn more NFTs playing Pudgy Party.------Pudgy Party Battle Royale and CryptoWhen you play Pudgy Party you begin unlocking skins with different ability. The vast majority of skins you unlockARE NOT NFTsand currentlyDO NOThave any ability to be made into NFTs, some example of the current non-crypto/non-NFT character are:*Mango might get a talisman in the future to be converted into an NFT - but currently doesn't*So again most Pudgy Party characters currently are not and do not have any connection to NFTs. They're simply skins with different abilities and stats that you power up by playing.However some characters can be combined with a talisman to create a legendary pudgy NFT, one example of that is John Pork (currently earnable), at level 3 he can be combined with a Cheese talisman (also earnable) to get aTimNFThttps://preview.redd.it/pudgy-party-the-game-nfts-gameplay-guide-and-earning-rewards-v0-fox77knn17nf1.pngIn fact currently most free to play players will only get a single NFT currently worth around $10 after grinding for hours on the app (more free NFTs will likely come in the future). So just by itself that one NFT is not anything worth getting excited about if you're only looking to make money. However there are ways to earn more NFT characters via DopaMeme which we'll discuss later on.*It's also worth noting that pre-release players earned legendary skins that are no longer obtainable and are currently worth $60-$80.https://preview.redd.it/pudgy-party-the-game-nfts-gameplay-guide-and-earning-rewards-v0-d406x96p17nf1.pngSo it is possible that if the game is a big success later down the road some of the NFTs skins earnable now but not earnable later could see a long term increase in value. But as of now a $10 Character NFT for most people isn't worth playing a game for hours if you're not enjoying the gameplay by itself.----------Mythical MarketplaceTo be able to buy and sell NFTs you need to create an account withMythical Marketplaceand then link that account with your app. Once done you can use the website to buy and sell NFTs that you earn on the app.https://preview.redd.it/pudgy-party-the-game-nfts-gameplay-guide-and-earning-rewards-v0-7br1t96r17nf1.pngMythical Marketplace is aCustodial walletbuilt with Polkadot tech which is good for Dot ecosystem lovers, as DOT token holders can use any amount of good news at this point... Beyond the difficulties of getting funds on the marketplace for non dot users - The UI definitely needs an overhaul as lots of important information is missing or unavailable when trying to decide what to buy and sell on the app.One noteworthy part about the marketplace is the fact you have to KYC to withdrawal funds from your marketplace wallet. This might be a good way to keep away bots as they wouldn't be able to KYC to cash out but it's bad for those who want to remain anonymous while earning.Supposedly an in-game marketplace might be coming in the future but as of now it's not available so buying and selling has to be done on the Mythical Marketplace website.---------DopaMeme and earning more NFTsFor players who are good at the game and want to earn more NFTs that is possible with DopaMeme.Rank 1 on my roster and global known Rank 2!Dopameme is essentially the Pudgy Party high score system where users play five matches and are ranked on the sum of their best three in the following categories.Their Round Placements (max of 20 points)The speed to finish races (max of at least 22 points)The amount of Fish they collect (max of 9 points)If you used a bonus point character at least one round. (max of 2 points)The more points you get the better DopaMeme rewards you get, this is how top players can really earn NFT rewards playing Pudgy Party.There are multiple scoring rosters, so the highscore above aren't the only highscore in the game. This means lots of people will get 1st place in their specific rosters.The current DopaMeme roundintroduces for the first time the legendary character Ballerina Cappuccina (should be an NFT) for the top 70 players in each roster. With Rank 1-3 winning a level 3 Ballerina NFT and lower ranking players earning a lower level Ballerina Cappcucina.https://preview.redd.it/pudgy-party-the-game-nfts-gameplay-guide-and-earning-rewards-v0-6stb4g9w17nf1.pngSo if you are good at the game you can earn more NFTs characters that are otherwise unavailable to the average player.--------DopaMeme Tips,If you want help scoring high on DopaMeme to increase your shot at earning extra NFTs this section is for you,and if it's not just skip it.https://preview.redd.it/pudgy-party-the-game-nfts-gameplay-guide-and-earning-rewards-v0-ahaxd5kx17nf1.png#1 - To get the highest possible score you want two races for your first two games of a match. If you do not get a race in either of your first two games you can restart the app without the match counting as One of your five for DopaMeme scoring.#2 - Once you get your race lined up your next goal is to finish both races as fast as you humanly can, while collecting any fish you pass on your way to the finish line. The faster you finish your races in match 1 and 2 the more Time points you can earn (with the highest score I've seen being 22 Time points)#3 - Getting first in both races and 1st in the last survival game will give you the maximum 20 Rank points + If you collected enough fish throughout your 3 matches you'll get the maximum 9 fish points. Using the bonus point character at least once should give you 2 bonus points.After you get your those 31 points for doing well and collecting fish it really just comes down to speed and who can speed run the different race maps the fastest. So your speed really makes ALL the difference on Dopameme rankings.#4 - Some pudgies have different abilities and stats you'll have to play around with the different pudgies you unlock to find out what you think is your fastest available pudgy.-----------Have any questions or feedback drop them below and I'll do my best to answer!One last note make sure to link your Party Pudgy account to the Mythical Marketplace, or you will lose all progress if you ever have to uninstall/reinstall the app.*",

      "content_preview": "1. Stop getting price-gouged when you shop online.The ultra-rich obviously have personal shoppers to compare prices for them, but most people don't have that kind of time…I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but Capital One Shopping has always worked well for me and I'd recommend trying it (link here).When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will automatically compare prices for you, and auto-apply coupon codes when possible.2. Your home equity is a gold-mine. If you need cash, stop taking out high-interest loans.So many people take out high-interest payday loans – please don’t do this. If you get into trouble you can typically get a relatively low-interest HELOC (a home equity line of credit).Essentially with a HELOC, you’re borrowing against the equity you have in your house and use it for whatever you need (much like a credit card).Typically, you’ll get lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms compared to traditional loans.Here’s a calculator you can use to see how much/little you could borrow (link here).Side note: if you hate debt, you can still get money out of your home’s equity by using something like Hometap, where you more or less sell investors a portion of your equity without a loan)3. Switch auto insurance companies every 6-12 months.If you haven’t compared auto insurance rates in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$400/year¹).Example: I cut my car insurance bill by ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers (same exact coverage too) and it took me a whopping 5 minutes.Take two minutes and pull up a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, Auto-Savings.com is fine too) and compare multiple offers from different companies in one go.Worst case scenario: you stay with what you’ve got. Best case scenario: you save a few hundred dollars a year.Here’s a link to a good comparison site: link.4. Get yourself a dang advisor.Most people are under the false impression that financial advisors are just for wealthy people.They absolutely aren’t: if you have a net worth of $100k+, you can typically qualify for an advisor. Having an advisor can boost your yearly net returns by 3%¹.If you don’t have an advisor in your family, use a site like Datalign to find somebody with good reviews in your area.5. You don't have to pay off your debt by yourself.Very few people know about it, but If you have $10k+ in debt, you can technically ask a debt relief to come in and take over the process for you.It’ll typically save you 23% off your total debt, after fees (according to NDR, a big debt relief company).They’ll negotiate with your creditors and try to get your debt reduced (then they take a cut of the savings).Typically people who are struggling with debt save 23% on avg. when they ask for help from debt relief companies.Here’s a little calculator you can use to see how much you’d potentially save: link.6. Save on home insurance.Some homeowners save $1k+/year just by switching home insurance providers (typically saving them more than changing auto insurance policies).If it’s been over a year since you’ve reviewed your rates, it might be worth taking a few minutes to compare offers. Here’s a home insurance comparison site I’ve used: (link).",

      "content_preview": "I have been following stablecoins and something really caught my eye recently: apparently around 8 billion USDT was minted in just one month. That number seems insane to me.I get that Tether (USDT) is by far the biggest stablecoin and is used as the main trading pair on pretty much every major exchange. I also understand the idea that each USDT is supposed to be backed by real assets like cash, short-term treasuries, or other collateral. But at this point I can’t help but wonder — is every single new token actually fully backed? Or is there some kind of fractional backing going on?On the one hand, I know Tether regularly publishes attestation reports and claims to have large reserves. They’ve even said a big chunk is in U.S. Treasuries, which are very liquid and secure. On the other hand, the sheer speed and scale of new issuance makes me question how that process really works behind the scenes. For example:If billions of new USDT are minted in a short time, does that mean billions of dollars worth of assets flowed into Tether’s reserves just as quickly?Are exchanges or big institutions basically wiring huge sums of money to Tether and then receiving freshly minted USDT to use for trading liquidity?Or is some of this minting just moving supply around between chains/exchanges, rather than new money entering?I’m not trying to spread hate or FUD here — it’s a genuine question. Stablecoins play a massive role in the entire crypto ecosystem, and USDT is the foundation for most trading pairs. But the scale of the minting lately makes me wonder how sustainable it really is and how transparent the actual reserves are.Curious what others think: is this all just normal stablecoin mechanics that look shocking from the outside, or is there reason to be skeptical?",
