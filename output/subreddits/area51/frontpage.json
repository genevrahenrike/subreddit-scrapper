I found a map and exported to a KML file you can open in Google Earth. A LOT more than I ever saw on GE, at least 100+. \"Guzzlers are human-made rain or snow collection systems that store water in a reservoir for wildlife to drink during drought\". Apparently helicopters do water drops at these locations as well. Listed as for bighorn sheep, but I bet a lot of other wildlife rely on them as well. There is actually one just down the slope from Tikaboo Peak, to the west: 37.335216°, -115.391424° https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/d0ckmar0ssy3srb9d9h37/Nevada_Bighorn_Sheep_Water_Guzzlers.kml?rlkey=z4pzefldksyx2ddulhnruqlx9&st=wykihvel Here's a PDF file if you ever wanted to build one! https://ia600101.us.archive.org/16/items/wildlifewatercat00brig/wildlifewatercat00brig.pdf",

      "content_preview": "Most of us are familiar with the CIA electronic reading room. If you are not, the reading room has documents regarding Groom Lake when the CIA ran the base. (Obviously it has more than just Groom Lake documents since the CIA did other stuff like remote viewing and overthrowing governments.) There is some history to how it got online. What the CIA had provided was an electronic list of the documents available online, though initially not a complete list. If you wanted to see the documents, you had to go to the NARA (National Archives) facility on the University of Maryland campus. You could not just walk in since it was for authorized researchers. Fortunately the authorization requirement could be met by watching a power point presentation and passing a quiz. Then you got ID to actually go in the facility. The CIA had a small section of the library on the 3rd floor. There were two tables with a few PCs to search for records contained on servers that were under cages bolted to the floor which were under video surveillance. Remember this is stuff not considered secret anymore! As you found documents, you could send them to the CIA laserjet printers. The CIA provided the paper. But you weren't done yet. To leave the library, you had to cross out the security markings at the top and bottom of each page. Then the documents would go in a secure courrier bag(s) so you could walk the hall and use the elevator. That is you can't just walk around NARA with papers in your hands since you might be stealing documents. Once in the lobby the security guard would unlock the courrier bag and you could leave with the documents. This was a bit of a deterence. My \"today I learned\" moment was nonprofit Nation Security Law group filed the lawsuit to make the CIA just put the documents online. Here are the relevant links: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/what-electronic-reading-room https://www.nationalsecuritylaw.org/donate https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.166675.8.0.pdf There are all sorts of people who have claimed to have worked at Groom Lake that have a story to tell, but not all are truth tellers. Nothing beats a declassified document!",

It is the same name as the old file so there may be an overwriting issue. I pulled the text below from page 288.  A \"Q\" radar is usually a large radar at a high elevation. There is only one Q radar (QAS) though we know the NTTR has many high elevation radomes.  The google AI suggests QAS is Angel Peak. Yeah, probably true even though I generally am a skeptic of AI. TPH is Tonopah civilian. There is TLP which is unknown. However pages 316-319 have XY data from TLP (known as sensor 10). Possibly the radar sites can be reversed. -------------------------- UNCLASSIFIED Beechcraft 1900C, N27RA, 20040316KTNX001A Ill.

Why a basement when you have plenty of land or enough money for a second floor? Who knows. Are there basements for some buildings at Groom? Yeah why not but I don't know they exist for a fact. However there aren't underground rail systems hooking up the various desert bases. That is a step too far. For you kids out there, a LAN party was when you gathered at one location to play networked computer games. The internet at the time was too slow so you had to be on the same LAN.  There was networked Doom at work back in the day when IT departments didn't give a crap about people loading software on their machines. By the time Quake came out, the suits took a dim view of this and locked down the machines. https://imgur.com/a/LcuR3My https://imgur.com/a/EptuXQZ https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/7fe213f5bdb942818898eaf0b706e8a4/view",

What little solid coverage there is, is subject to the vagaries of equipment failure. Shit happens. Anyway, some of us are sad losers of such magnitude that we MAY have several trackers lurking around in the wild, not all public. SAD! Anyway, this morning, slightly before 6 AM, Groom launched U4054557. It reached a burst height of 16,800 meters, which was low, and perhaps why other trackers didn't see it at all. It was last tracked at 4,600 meters at 37.75712, -115.71535. We now return you to our normal discussions of where S-4 is located and \"What is this thing I found on Google Earth?\" already in progress.",

      "content_preview": "Well, this was fun! I've been using Perplexity a bit and it occurred to me to ask it what it made of Lazar's story. So I entered the following query: Robert Lazar has long claimed he once was employed at a secret facility called \"S4\" located adjacent to Papoose Dry Lake in Area 51. He further claimed he saw a number of UFOs or flying saucers stored at this facility. Please review and analyze Lazar's claims and provide a rough estimation of the validity of the story. Highlight what supports his claims and also what discredits his claims. Perplexity spit out a few pages of detailed analysis listing the story's pros and cons. It was very thorough. Rather than reproduce all that, I'll cut and paste the Conclusion. It strikes me as a fair assessment: Conclusion Bob Lazar's most compelling support comes from his claims' specificity and his early mention of certain technical details like Element 115 and gravity propulsion—concepts consistent with speculative science and later military research topics. His body language and consistency have made him convincing to some observers. However, the weight of evidence discredits his story. There are demonstrable fabrications about his education, no employment documentation, and no corroboration from other credible sources. Official government releases about Area 51 consistently contradict his extraordinary claims, showing only conventional (albeit secret) military technology development. The overall estimation: While Lazar is a fascinating figure who ignited public fascination with Area 51, there is insufficient evidence to accept his UFO and S4 claims as credible. The contradictions in his background, especially academic and employment history, severely undermine the validity of his account.",
