      "content_preview": "Hi all! I have been trying to do some research on these things, but am really not finding the information that I am wanting. My father and grandparents do not have any good input on this. Any advice or input would be amazing! A little background on my situation: my father was born in Curitiba, and him and his family moved to the US when he was 3. I (19F) was born in Northern California, and grew up in the Bay Area. We are going to the nearest consulate soon (SF) to register me as a citizen. I planning to move to Brazil in the next 2-5 years, either before or after college (I am currently in my second year of community college studying Business Admin). Here are my questions: How would a US associate's degree compare to a degree in Brazil? Would it be wise to continue college/university in Brazil rather than getting my bachelor's degree in the US? AKA, move to Brazil sooner or later? I am on a cocktail of psychiatric medications. How difficult is it to obtain medications of this nature? What does the medical system look like, especially as a possible naturalized person? Is there more stigma around psych meds? I am, by no means, fluent in Brazilian Portuguese. I am making lots of progress on the Babble course, but I feel like I am not actually absorbing anything. There are no schools in my area that offer actual Portuguese classes, so just curious if there is anything accessible out there that is not Duolingo or Babble? I am trying to figure out places that I would easily acclimate to. My family lives near Maringa, about 6.5 hours away from Curitiba. I have narrowed down my choices to Sao Paulo, Florianopolis, and Curitiba, but am unsure what might be a better fit. As a broke college student, I don't have a ton of funds to visit every prospective location in the near future. I will be visiting my family in April of this coming year, and am trying to get ideas of any other place to check out. Thanks so much in advance!",
