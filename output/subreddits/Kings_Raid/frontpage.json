      "content_preview": "Mangasoft just sent out this email, in case someone didn't get it, here it is: \"Hello, This is our first message through the King's Raid newsletter. To everyone who’s been waiting for King's Raid’s new beginning, we’d like to start by sharing something meaningful — Q&A Part 1. We received so many questions on our official Discord, and each one reflected the care, curiosity, and support you’ve shown us. We’ve done our best to respond with the same thoughtfulness in return. We hope this first note marks a quiet but important step toward reconnecting with everyone who's been part of this journey. So — here’s Q&A Part 1. If you’d like to stay close as the journey moves forward, you're always welcome on our official Discord. Q. What platforms will King’s Raid be released on? King’s Raid will be available on both Steam (PC) and mobile (Android, iOS) platforms. You’ll still be able to enjoy the game on mobile as before, but now with enhanced graphics on PC, including 4K resolution support via Steam. Q. Will previous gameplay data be carried over? Since King’s Raid will be newly serviced by Masangsoft, previous gameplay data unfortunately will not be linked or restored. We understand this may be disappointing for many of you who’ve invested time and love into your heroes. However, we’re doing our utmost to improve areas that were previously inconvenient, ​​​​​​​and are focusing on delivering a refreshed experience and full of excitement—so please look forward to it! Q. Will I still be able to recruit heroes the same way? Yes, the core King’s Raid experience of recruiting heroes from the Inn will remain. Additionally, just like before, guaranteed recruitment via the Special Shop will still be available. Q. Can you share more details on the Transcendence rework? As mentioned in our previous dev note, the Transcendence system will continue to allow each hero to maintain their unique identity, while certain aspects will be adjusted for better balance. ​​​​​​​ You'll be able to choose a growth path aligned with either Light or Darkness, with a total of 5 stages of progression. We’re aiming to make Transcendence more approachable, ​​​​​​​while also reducing the performance gap between transcended and non-transcended heroes, in a more player-friendly way. Q. Will Soul Weapons be returning? How are they changing? Yes, Soul Weapons will be included with the content available up to Chapter 6. However, we’re redesigning them to be an optional enhancement that lets you express affection for your favorite heroes, rather than a mandatory power gate. Because the Soul Weapon update is tied to the previously planned class-themed Transcendence overhaul, some elements of the “Trials of the God King” (Soul Weapon Dungeon) may change. That said, our overall direction remains the same: lower the barrier to entry for acquisition and upgrades. Details are still being finalized, so this is as much as we can share for now. Q. Will Pets (Raiders) return? Yes, the Raider system will not be launched in its original form, but will be redesigned into a more appealing and well-balanced feature before its re-release. While specifics are still under discussion, we’re reviewing areas that were previously considered unbalanced or inconvenient. Since the design is still in the planning phase, we’d love to hear your suggestions and feedback —your input will help shape what’s to come\"",

The character designs, the story, the team-building, and that satisfying progression just felt perfect. I’ve jumped from game to game since, but none of them have that same spark. Anyone else feel this way about KR, or have you found a gacha that scratches the same itch? Drop your thoughts!",
