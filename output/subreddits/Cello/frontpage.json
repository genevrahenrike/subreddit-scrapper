      "content_preview": "I have been thinking about getting an electric cello for a bit after playing an acoustic one for 6 years. The acoustic cello I learned on has been sitting at my parents for a long time now because the logistics of moving it are expensive. I believe the hard case I need cost more than the cello did when I bought it. Instead of moving it I am considering just getting an electric cello. While I love my bow I do not think my cello is anything special. We bought a great quality cello for me to learn on and I never upgraded from that initial one. The biggest thing for me about an electric cello is to have less maintenance involved, have to worry a lot less about climate control, and it travels/moves a bit easier. It also annoys neighbors much less. These days I mostly focus on adagios/legato/song like music so I am really looking for an electric cello that can still sing the way a real cello would. Besides the goal is more personal enjoyment and music composition and not performance. I'll mostly be using this with headphones. When I listen to demos of electric cellos I find they sound nasal-y. Part of that could be the difference in being behind or in front of an acoustic cello or that some artists like to play that aspect up for a more \"electric\" \"vibrant\" sounding cello sound. I really like how audio modeled VSTs for cellos are sounding these days. They are simulating the physics of what goes on down to bow angle, position, pressure, speed etc and it gets a remarkably compelling result for my tastes. Using a fancy MIDI controller (Seaboard) with SWAMs solo cello I get a sound I am looking for. I just can't quite get the knack of expressing the same things I would with my bow on their software (even though it is theoretically possible) Anywho. I am curious what the \"state of the art\" is for what an electric cello can sound like when compared to an acoustic one for a more legato piece. Do the higher end electric cellos have better built in voices or is it more you can combine them with software to improve the sound quality?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all. I’m starting sixth form soon (college, if you’re American), and I’m taking music as one of my subjects. I’d really love to go to a conservatoire after sixth form and pursue a career as a cellist. My main worry, though, is that I won’t progress enough over the next two years to get into the conservatoires I want. I feel I’ve made some good progress in the 10 months I’ve been playing—I’ve managed to reach Grade 2 and am just about to move on to the Grade 3 book. I practice for about an hour each day, but I plan to do more once school starts. So what I’m really asking is this: realistically, if I practice enough over the next two years, would I be able to reach Grade 8? Or am I being unrealistic? I know it’s a huge jump, but I’ve heard of people doing it before. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone. My rising 5th grader will be in their second year of cello at school. They will have “5th Grade String Ensemble” twice a week, and are set to have a private lesson at school during what the school calls “flex time” once a week with a teacher who also taught them in 4th grade three times a week - two in “4th Grade Strings” (a class taken with other strings playing classmates), and one as a private lesson after school on campus. The teacher is very nice, but I have a slight concern because she is not primarily a cello teacher, but is rather a violin/viola teacher. She has a BA and MA in violin performance, and has performed with dozens of orchestras in her career. Her official title/role at the school is “4th Grade Strings,” which implies she has more than a passing familiarity with the cello, but it’s obviously not her main instrument. Some additional background: At my child’s school all children in the 4th grade are required to learn an instrument of their choice within brass, woodwinds, or strings. With a few exceptions, all children were new to their instrument. Last school year my child was the “star” student in their 4th grade strings class. The teacher told me my child was hands down the best student in the class (easy to achieve by actually trying and practicing… it seems many classmates were just going through the motions, often forgetting to bring their music books or even instruments to school!) Because my child was actually putting in effort, throughout the year the teacher gave my child solos and extra parts to play during school performances. In 5th grade, music is still required, but an instrument becomes optional. It seems most classmates are still continuing with their instruments, but some kids are “one-and-done” and doing choir instead. As mentioned above, my child will be doing “5th grade String Ensemble” which meets twice a week. They will also have a private lesson with their previous 4th grade strings teacher during school hours, but as mentioned before, she is primarily a violin/viola teacher and not a cello player/teacher. Worth mentioning that the teacher told me in private that they expect my child to find “5th grade String Ensemble” to be “easy” (assuming my child shows the same good attitude and effort as they did in 4th grade) Question: Does this matter at the novice level? Even with a year of cello under their belt, I think my child is still considered a novice? Or would not having an actual cello teacher be doing my child a huge disservice? Important to note I am not hoping for my child to join competitive orchestras or ensembles in the future, but if they are spending time and effort learning something, I want them to be able to maximize what they get in return for what they are putting in. Pro’s of keeping the violin/viola teacher: teacher/student are already familiar/comfortable with each other from last year lessons can be conveniently done at school during school hours (no need to commute to a music school after school or on weekends) since the teacher is a faculty member of the school, there is the possibility of the teacher giving my child additional opportunities to perform throughout the school year or opening up other opportunities Con’s of keeping the violin/viola teacher: not an actual cello player/teacher, worried this is potentially a significant disservice in my child’s development as a cello player If you made it this far, thanks for reading! TL;DR - my child is in their second year of learning cello with a teacher who is primarily a violin/viola teacher - is this okay or a terrible mistake?",

Of course when I was little my family had barely enough to get by let alone sending the kids to music lessons. My teacher has many younger students and apparently not all of them take it seriously or practice regularly. The one that does is the top high school cellist in our city. I just want to say that you have been given a gift and a wonderful opportunity, and like many difficult things that requires intricate nervous connections and muscle movements, it takes a lot of discipline and it is best done when you are young. I do envy you because I will never be as good as you can be. Don't let the opportunity go past you.",

Now for context, whenever I write fast, I get this pain in my hand that goes down to my right lower arm or even up to my shoulder (I am a right-handed person). So that day, 2 days ago, I was writing quickly because I was doing a past paper under timed conditions. I felt some sharp pain in the area near my carpal bone. I had to stop writing. Fast forward to now, and the pain has gotten worse. Yesterday, I had severe pain in my middle and ring fingers. It was sort of flaring, tingling. And now when I put soft pressure on the right carpal area, I can feel soreness and pain. Opening the door of my fridge with my right hand is near impossible now. I cannot eat with my hand without discomfort - even eating with a spoon is painful. I have been typing this post with my left hand because it has gotten that bad. Having gone onto the NHS website, my symptoms are that of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). As I am a cellist and pianist, I am worried that I do have CTS. Fellow cellists who have carpal tunnel syndrome, is there a chance that I have it? If so, what does it mean for me? I have exams for school in 2 days time and I am panicking.",

Recently, I've had the privilege of learning with a Korean cellist, where Goltermann is almost as ubiquitous as Suzuki in Korea. It's not the absolute stunner of pieces that you would hear on the radio, but it is incredibly technical and musical in its own way. I highly recommend it to intermediate to advanced/performer Cello players as it works on both your left and right hand in so many different ways. I don't believe there has been a recent piece I've worked on that has advanced my skills as much as Goltermann. If you want to have a go, I would suggest going 5,4,3,2,1.",

      "content_preview": "I went to Denver Violins to trial cellos in the $5-10k price range. They only had one, but let me play cellos in the higher price ranges. For comparison, the $2k rental that I have from them is quite good , punching well above it's price/weight. However, I'm starting to tell that it's not quite sensitive/responsive enough, and the dynamics are somewhat limited on the instrument. The $10k cello I tried first was significantly more responsive and sensitive. It was a workshop instrument, an \"advanced student model.\" But the tone quality wasn't satisfying: it was like someone turned the mids up a ton. Louder, yes, quieter, yes, but it lacked a nice bass and didn't have a brilliant top-end. My rental is quieter, but the relative balance of tones makes it both feel brighter and bassier. The next cello I tried was around $18k, produced by an independent American maker. This one sounded clear, focused, punchy, beautiful, singing, bright - but it lacked a warmth and bassiness that I really like from the instrument. The responsiveness was even better than the $10k instrument, but this also amplified mistakes and technical errors. To some extent, I sounded slightly more competent on my rental, as it covers up most subtleties, and there are more subtle mistakes than subtle wins. The $28k cello (also an independent American maker), on the other hand, sounded absolutely phenomenal- bassy, punchy, bright and brilliant but not harsh. It had all the positive qualities of the other cellos wrapped up into a single instrument. I crave this instrument, but I know I cannot afford it, and even if I could, I cannot justify it. There were a few other cellos that I tried in the ~$15-30k range, but I didn't like them almost immediately on trying them out. They weren't bad - but they weren't big upgrades over the $10k instrument. Finally, I had the opportunity to try a 220 year old English-made cello in remarkable condition. I was told that this cello was \"in the six figure range.\" It was a fantastic instrument, but I'd place it somewhere between the $18k and $28k American cellos. Unfortunately, the cellos mostly had different string sets. Some were consistent, but I won't be able to know if I didn't like a cello because it had a certain string set, or if what I was really enjoying was a set of strings instead of the instrument itself. So, what have I learned? Price appears to be a product of \"quality\" (craftsmanship, responsiveness, resonance, etc) and \"prestige\" (ie age, reputation of maker, etc). And probably also \"taste\" (the subjectives, like warm vs bright) with more popular taste commanding a higher price. If so, then for a given price, increasing prestige probably reduces quality. Even a very high quality cello may have the wrong subjective traits. I'd rather own a cello that had the right tone character and a worse total quality than vice versa. Fuck, this hobby is expensive.",

I'm absolutely in love with the instrument, but playing a single note for more than 5 minutes feels like hell. My ears just get tired overall, and I get no choice but to leave the cello and try again tomorrow. I discovered that putting a piece of cloth under the cords can mute the instrument. And the whole experience is just more pleasing and I feel more connected to my body and movements. So my question here is: Is there a problem if I try to bow control without emitting sound? What other elements can be trained without the need for sound? Thanks beforehand!",

      "content_preview": "I've been working on this piece for about 3-4 months and there's this passage that just sounds HORRIBLE despite the amount of time I've spent practicing that passage... so clearly I'm practicing wrong. Does anyone have any tips with practicing artificial harmonics? Right now, I'm practicing it in a bunch of different ways: Pressing my thumb down on the note, pressing my finger down on the note with the harmonic, then taking the pressure off the finger to play the harmonic. Playing the artificial notes really loud, using full bow & making them as clear as I can make them Playing the passage with a dotted rhythm Playing the passage very very slowly (and then bringing the tempo up) I'm learning a lot of pieces right now and because this passage sounds soooooo bad every time I come back to practice it, I'm kind of distancing myself from it (which is HORRIBLE!!) so I need some advice from people... And I know I may be speaking too hastily and need more individual practice time but this passage makes me so frustrated every time I try to practice it because it sounds so so so bad. Yesterday I practiced this specific passage for 5 hours (I don't know what came over me I don't usually do that) and I came back to it today expecting something but it just sounded soooooooooooooo bad .... I'm gonna go back to practicing after I post this but this passage just makes me so mad that now I have to know how other people are practicing artificial harmonics because something's not right with the way that I'm practicing. And so any tips with dealing with frustration during practice or with practicing artificial harmonics would be greatly appreciated.
