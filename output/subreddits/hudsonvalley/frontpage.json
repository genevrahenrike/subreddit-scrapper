A year ago I got a speeding ticket on the taconic in Carmel- plead not guilty and got it reduced to a parking violation and paid $250 on my court date. Today, got hit again with a speeding ticket in the same area. I just mailed it back pleading not guilty. I was driving northbound home from working overnight shifts both times. I know speeding is bad and I’m really annoyed with myself. I took a drivers defense course as well last year. Besides last years violation and this current ticket, I have a clean record. Should I get a traffic lawyer for this time? I’m worried I’ll get points on my license if they see the reduced ticket. Thanks guys.",

I'm working on making a list of restaurants to reach out to for this. We're currently looking around New Paltz, Poughkeepsie, Kingston, Beacon, Newburgh, and all in between. We have about ~15 people (may be closer to but definitely not over 20) total. I'm hesitant to call it a \"wedding\" dinner because we aren't looking for anything but table space- we don't need a private room, decorations, specific music, etc. and we're on a strict budget (Approx $1500 at the highest). Much respect to all that goes into those larger scale events, but we're really just doing a large group dinner! We don't want or expect a fine dining experience! We're a pretty nontraditional couple and just looking for good food and good vibes- we're up to explore just about anything from the type of establishment (restaurant, bar, arcade, etc.), to cuisine, to format (dinner, small plates, brunch, etc.). If you have any recommendations for places that aren't going to drive up prices because it's a \"wedding\" and may even be open to a fixed-menu or per-person format, please shout them out! We love this area and how much it's given to us and our relationship!",

      "content_preview": "Hello, we are coming in October and doing NYC to Niagara falls road trip.  We have 1 week.  We want to hit Cooperstown which looks like a little bit of a deviation from the route people would normally take through the Catskills.  We also want to hit the Finger Lakes region. Should we take the day driving up the Hudson River Valley, seeing stops along the way and then overnight in Cooperstown. Cooperstown the next day and then continue on to Finger Lakes. Or is it more interesting to explore the Hudson River Valley then overnight in one of the little Hudson River Valley towns.  The next day Drive onto the Finger Lakes and just hit Cooperstown on the way to the Finger Lakes. Should we prioritize the Hudson River Valley, Cooperstown or Finger Lakes?  What town in the Hudson River Valley is best to stay in?  What town in the Finger Lakes is the best to stay in? We are coming from AZ with 2 teenage boys.  I am from NJ, everyone else is an AZ native. All suggestions welcomed.  Thanks so much. Cross posted.",
