      "content_preview": "I am hoping that Mizu was able to pay for private quarters with its own privy, otherwise the latrine options on a 17th century sailing vessel were very open air, no real privacy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRGuBpphVEo&t=277s I've been imagining Mizu working alongside the crew, mainly to stay in shape, and also to have something to do. I assume for safety's sake she'll still try to pass as male during the voyage. So, to be \"one of the boys\", \"he\" will be expected to occasionally use the same sanitary options as the crew; retreating to the passenger's private privy every time would seem prissy or effete. She's smart, I can imagine Mizu working out how to pee & poo without revealing too much (or too little).",

Mizu already killed one guy, we don't know much about them, but this could be Conquest (some initial leader or pioneer of the group of four). He's a white horse, which is a term for heroin/opium, so maybe he was the major opium dealer of the four, which would make sense because we see in a flashback Mizu asking for \"the white man that sells opium\" early in the show. Next is Fowler, a red headed gun dealer which is a stand-in for the red horseman of war, the second horseman of the Apocalypse in Revelation. The next two are Famine (Black horse) and Death (Pale horse). It could be interesting to see how they're shown in the series. Thoughts? Edit: Apparently the next two guys are slave traders. Black horse fits there, along with famine and death. I feel like this has to have been a pre-existing theory, lol",

He referenced a few other shows that the main character runs on revenge or in general a dangerous journey and dies at the very end. He noted that it makes the most sense in terms of her characters main motivation. I see his point for sure but I really hope it doesn’t end that way.

      "content_preview": "So as I understand it. It's the 1600s, Japan is walling itself off culturally and there are only 4 white men in Japan. They all just so happen to be close enough friends that Fowler knows their locations years later, he can also intuitively just pick up on Mizu wanting to murder them all specifically because she just hates her dad? And he just so happens to know the woman who raised Mizu wasn't her mom it was her maid... Is Fowler now just confirmed to be the dad? How would he know of the secret whore and bastard child of some other man in the country, even if this small group of men share a unique nationality? I don't get how the show's premise is simultaneously such a big mysterious secret, and yet it's also just common knowledge. And I don't really get Mizu's want for revenge. If he is the dad, why are they sailing to London after the other two men? So as a kid, a half breed, Mizu had to hide from either literally everyone, and she vows revenge on her whomever her father is for making her a half breed... Or is the \"Bad men\" she and her \"Mother\" are hiding from men specifically sent by her father to track down and murder any bastard kids? Either way, Mizu is eventually discovered and the cabin is burned down and Mizu thinks her mom is dead and swears revenge on all 4 white men not knowing which is her dad. She trains to become a skilled swordsman so she can kill them. Then years later she kills one, (Violet and we haven't seen this) and is hunting the other three. But then sees her mother is alive, has a brief bout of marriage, feels betrayed, and sets out again for revenge. And then the bulk of the show in season 1 is her tracking down man #2 Fowler. So if Mizu's entire thing is wanting revenge for being a half breed and wants to kill her father, why is she after all 4 men? I get the idea is she doesn't know which one is her dad, but if she learned which one it was, would she just drop her revenge on the remaining men? Why during all the years spent with her mom didn't she ask or try and get clues about which one it was? Especially after killing the first one and meeting up with her mother/maid a second time? Isn't that basically her entire character, just blindly hunting these men? I feel like I'm missing something because despite being the protagonist, Mizu is one of my least cared about characters in the series. It's a great series, and I love a lot of the other characters, but I'm not clicking with Mizu. I don't connect with her being emotionally vapid. Her only real drive is just how she REALLY wants revenge. But she doesn't seem at all interested in avenging anything, and this separates her from a lot of other popular revenge focused characters like the Count of Monte Christo. Mizu seems to hate being a half breed and instead of accepting that, thinks she'll be satisfied if she just murders her dad... How will that help? The woman who is Mizu's \"mother/maid\" is unnamed. But Mizu should absolutely know her name right? Fowler somehow knows this unnamed woman well enough to know she isn't Mizu's mom but is just a maid, or was until the money dried up and she turned Mizu in for \"medicine money\". So when she has a knife to Fowler's throat, why not just ask her about said unnamed person? How does he know her? Why can't Mizu just ask and narrow down her suspect list? I'm a little frustrated that the show's biggest premise is this revenge plot, but it feels like a half contrived and not thought out plan just so the story can have an excuse to always bring in action scenes. And that undercuts a lot of the action. Mizu doesn't want revenge against any particular slight against her, she just hates her half breed side and wants to kill the man who gave it to her, but also is so frustratingly bad at finding out who that is. And as an audience member I'm trying to figure out why I should care. Mizu pushes away Ringo, Taigen, Akemi, etc. She's just a walking ball of pointless angriness and isn't that fun to watch. She seems set on being so brooding because she must only focus on revenge. And I don't even understand the revenge part. What's she so mad about? Why does she think killing will help? Does she just hate her dad or all white men? I don't feel like the show is the great masterpiece a lot of people say and I'm clearly missing something because I have a lot of questions and not a lot of amazement.",

      "content_preview": "I know I might be too late coming into BES, but I just got into it recently and I am quite, literally, OBSESSED with the series. I wrote a fic recently and posted it in AO3. I would really appreciate some views, insights and feedbacks, since the BES fandom in AO3 is so small and probably... dead. Lmao. I poured a lot of passion and love into this fic! It's short as it's meant to be a One-shot- only 1.6k words! THE SEED Genre: Psychological horror, dark drama Characters: Mizu, OCs Premise: Stopping in a remote village, Mizu senses an ancient, invisible, unnamed threat spreading among its people. Can she contain it before it consumes everyone—including herself? AO3 Link: https://archiveofourown.org/works/70041196 Summary (skip this if you want to avoid spoiler for plot twists): Mizu stops by a small, remote village and immediately senses that something is deeply wrong. She considers passing through, but an approaching storm leaves her no choice but to stay. She meets the village’s Nanushi and his sick wife, who direct her to Hanami, a widowed innkeeper living with her young son, Akano—who is also ill. Visiting Ueda, a mysterious yamabushi near the village, Mizu uncovers the horrifying truth: he has been spreading a deadly contagion, which he named “The Seed” , intending to purify and strengthen Japan, beginning with the villagers. Ueda claims the plague originated from European traders. Faced with impossible choices, Mizu is forced to mercy kill Hanami and Akano, then methodically destroy the village to stop the contagion from spreading further. By the story’s end, the fate of Mizu herself remains uncertain—she may carry the seed she fought to eradicate. https://preview.redd.it/a-possible-canon-blue-eye-samurai-bes-fanfic-v0-3szhprcy76mf1.jpg (Free Mizu wallpaper I made to 'bribe' you, lmao.)",

      "content_preview": "I heard something happened to old Violet. Was that you? - That line Fowler said to Mizu at their first meeting used to nag at me. If Violet and Fowler were business partners of a sort, why didn't Fowler know more details about Violet's death? That a blue eyed ronin cut Violet down? If the trailer is set on the night that Violet dies, then I can see one way that Mizu wasn't connected to Violet's death. She was hidden in the crowd of attackers. It would be assumed that Violet was killed by a laborer who got lucky and managed to get past the defenses and enter the fortress/gateway. ==== A theory - Mizu did have an explicit role in the attack shown in the Season Two trailer. It was to disable the defensive machinery that was shooting the flaming arrows. There are taller structures located behind the fortress/gateway, much of which seems under construction or repair: https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueEyeSamurai/comments/1mygofg/not_a_fortress_just_a_gateway/ Any laborers working on those higher structures can look down at the defensive equipment and machinery at the top floor of the lower gateway. Maybe they've even seen them in action: https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueEyeSamurai/comments/1mxszt3/comment/na7osvt/ The attacking group we are shown seems pitifully small compared to the immense building they are attempting to enter. But what if the main purpose of the initial attack is to get Mizu to the building? And a much larger force of laborers are hanging back, waiting for her to disable the arrow-launching machinery? It explains the formation which initially surrounded Mizu, kind of like protection, and also to hide her. And she's using a large laborer's tool in the attack, which makes her seem more like the others and not a ronin. Mizu's expression of surprise once she gets to the top of the gateway is not at the machinery, but that there's no one directly operating or guarding them. u/Seperate_Business880 has a neat idea that the arrow shooting machines are controlled from inside the building. To fulfill her role in the revolt, she has to figure out how to disable the arrow machines. If they are controlled remotely, she may just need to cut the control lines.",

      "content_preview": "Its clear by how the people in the S2 trailer were armed that theyre partaking in a peasant revolt. I have a theory that Mizu joins a peasant revolt against a corrupt leader protecting Violet. I think there will be several flashbacks about Mizu speaking to sort of revolutionaries who know the lord who is oppressing them is harbouring a white man. This could tie into the rest of season 2 here me out.... So in S2 we know shes going to London and the last episode of S1 was set in 1657. By the time Mizu Cromwell (the Lord Protector of England) will be about to die. Cromwell was a tyrannical leader who overthrew King Charles the first in the English civil war. I think it'll be revealed that another one of the white men is being protected by Cromwell or his government and Mizu will align herself with another set of revolutionaries (those trying to install King Charles the throne). It'll make a lot of thematic sense and tie the flashbacks to the rest of the show. We could also see Fowler escape and also align himself with Cromwell's men. If my theory is true it'll be really interesting seeing Fowler's reaction to England because I think hes been in Japan now for 20-ish years. He knows the other 2 white men are in London but how aware would he he about English politics?",

I don't see how any of the above mentioned characters can further contribute to the plot. They played their role and tied everything together with their deaths. Violet also might be alive to plot something evil with Fowler. But then, all these efforts and Mizu can't kill a man completely? I would think that she would make sure the man is really really dead.",

      "content_preview": "Ok, so we know that at the end of Season 1, the Great Fire of 1657, that took place in Edo, Japan, happens, right? Well, what if in Season 2, The Great Fire of London happens? Maybe in a similar way it happened with the Great Fire of 1657, or just somewhat different too, but it ends up happening. Random thing that popped in my head and I thought it would be cool if it did happen, considering the Great Fire of London happened in 1666, which would also probably fit in with the timeline? Who knows. Can’t wait for Season 2!!!",

      "content_preview": "Do you think there will be any romance with Mizu in season 2? Personally I ship Mizu and Taigen the most. I love their relationship (especially Taigen being adamant he’s the only one that can kill Mizu). I can also maybe see Mizu and Akemi, or maybe we’ll get a new character, but wondering other peoples thoughts on this? To me it would make sense if there’s no romance at all because Mizu doesn’t have time for that shit and isn’t really emotionally available to have a relationship anyway (she’d be toxic af) but it would be cool to see how that would play out. Plus, genuinely drooling over Mizu every second she’s on screen and it would be a TREAT if we got to see her develop a romance with someone 😂",
