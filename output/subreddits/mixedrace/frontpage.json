My one year old was waiting in line with her white father when two latinas behind them said \"wow, what a racist baby\" because she was staring at them with a stern look on her face. She's been making that face at everything that interests her since she was a few months old but because her skin was paler than theirs, they assumed it was a racial death glare! It was surreal because I'm hispanic too and I always thought of my kid as mixed despite the fact that she inherited zero melanin. It's weird to realize she might go through life treated like a fully white person and that might involve occasionally getting called racist for existing while pale üò¨üò¨üò¨",

Types 1a-4a are not even black exclusive hair textures. Learn about your childs actual hair type if you're struggling. Also more general PSA not related to parenting, any race can have type 3 hair. I don't know why people think type 3 hair is a black hair texture just because half black mixed race people tend to have it, it doesn't mean everyone with type 3 hair is mixed with black. It is common in latino, middle eastern, south asian, and white people, even east asians have it sometimes. Ironically this hair type is actually rare in black people.

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôve noticed a pattern in convos on this subreddit and the black women and men‚Äôs subreddit: the idea that mixed people (especially Black/white mixed) are just ‚Äúmad at the Black community‚Äù or blame Black people more than white people. And I get why that narrative exists, but I want to unpack something deeper that I don‚Äôt see talked about enough. When we‚Äôre growing up, a lot of us mixed kids experience direct racism from white people teachers, neighbors, classmates. Sometimes even from our own white family. That kind of racism shapes us early on. But because of the history we learn (slavery, colonization, segregation, etc.), and what we see on social media, we expect that kind of rejection. We expect white people to not fully accept us. We already walk in knowing ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really want me.‚Äù And most of the time as these white people grow with us they become more accepting and see us as one of them. But with the Black community, it‚Äôs different. We go in expecting kinship. Solidarity. We think, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been through this too you‚Äôll understand.‚Äù So when we‚Äôre rejected there, it hurts a lot deeper. It‚Äôs unexpected. It feels like a betrayal. That‚Äôs why so many mixed kids talk about having identity crises not because we think we‚Äôre better than anyone, but because we expected safety in the Black community and didn‚Äôt get it. And when we meet other black children when we‚Äôre children they can share the same harsh views as white children but in a different way. And to be honest, in some spaces, the Black community is a lot more vocal with their dislike. Harsh jokes. Dismissive comments. Constant gatekeeping. When white people are racist now, a lot of them know to keep quiet or hide it. But Black folks will straight-up say things like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not really Black,‚Äù ‚ÄúPick a side,‚Äù or ‚ÄúMixed people are just watered down.‚Äù It‚Äôs often not seen as ‚Äúracism‚Äù because it‚Äôs coming from another marginalized group, but it still hurts. So no, most of us aren‚Äôt ignoring the history or downplaying white racism. But when you‚Äôre expecting to be rejected by one group and hoping to be accepted by another, it makes sense that the rejection from the latter cuts deeper. Just wanted to share this perspective, because I feel like the nuance gets lost a lot. It‚Äôs not about blaming anyone it‚Äôs about explaining why so many mixed people struggle with identity and belonging.",

Nothing about me looks Mexican in any way. Also, my Nigerian father was a deadbeat and I grew up only with my Mexican family. I also grew up in an area with very few black people. I don't look like a mixed person, and I obviously don't look Mexican, so I've always just had to be Black. Even when people become aware of my heritage, it is simply a fun fact. But I am never really considered to actually be Mexican by anyone. When I visit family in Mexico, I am seen as an outsider. When I speak Spanish, people act surprised and ask if I learned it in school. People always think my family is not my real family, or that I am adopted (I even took a DNA test because of it). These things are more frustrating than funny/cute to me honestly. I have tried to research Nigerian culture to form a connection, but honestly, there is no connection. It's pretty hard to feel pride in a culture when your only connection is a deadbeat father. I don't dislike Blackness or Black features. I just don't like how my appearance basically erased my entire Mexican identity. I can't even claim that I am mixed without being questioned. Maybe the experience is different when you grew up with both cultures, or when you look like the typical ambiguous mixed person. But honestly, I really can't think of a single positive aspect about me being mixed. How do you guys find pride in your identity/appearance?",

      "content_preview": "For some context, I've identified as mixed my entire life; I didn't get a choice in the matter. My mother is Brazilian- specifically, indigenous and black Brazilian- and my father is the typical \"white\" American. I don't look European and the reason I know this is because the FIRST question people ask me when they meet me is, \"I don't want to be offensive, but what are you?\". Likewise I was always considered the white kid when I would try to hang out in Brazilian circles. Even more so, when I would try to hang out in general Latina/Latino circles, I would again feel I don't belong because of the language barrier. I mean it's hard to hang out with people when they rightfully want to speak one language (Spanish) and I don't know that language (I speak Portuguese). I don't want to go too deep into this part because we've all been there. A community event happened near where I live that was advertised as being for people of color (POC). In the advertisement, they specified that mixed people were welcome based on how they interacted with other POC. If POC felt comfortable around you/ didn't feel the need to be on guard around you, you were welcomed. If not, the advertisement said, \"We are not erasing your mixed identity or defining who you are. We are simply trying to create a space where QTBIPOC nervous systems can relax\". I went to the event because I thought I would fit into the environment AND it would be a chance to meet POC I didn't know! When the event started, they repeated their message to mixed people and I asked if I could say a few words on it. The people running the event happily gave me permission and I brought up how I always struggled to feel like I belonged in places (for the reasons I mentioned above, as I'm sure every person reading this post is familiar with). I thanked the event for intentionally bringing awareness to it but then immediately shut up because I felt wrong. That dread you feel when you know you answered a question incorrectly, when you can tell people just want you to stop talking, that self-awareness that you just messed up big time. I stayed quiet for the remainder of the event. Not like I could even have the chance to speak because when people were broken up into smaller discussion groups, not a single group accepted me. I left early so I wouldn't become a tearful and regretful mess and apparently the rest of the event went off without a hitch! I already know I messed up by hogging attention for longer than I should have and I understand how it sounded like I was denying my privilege as someone who is \"white passing\" (as I was described by someone who later messaged me, even though I disagree with that descriptor for me). I was even messaged by someone that I shouldn't blame POC for not accepting me because when I'm not accepted into POC spaces, it's likely because I \"already aligned yourself with their oppressors\" (the person who messaged me exact words). The person (who identified themselves as being mixed to me but in other contexts has only ever identified as being black). I was told I had done the one thing the event organizers asked not to have happen. The person even talked to me for a bit and said they were tired of mixed people doing nothing but complain and that \"no good ever comes from the emotion of not belonging, so move on\" (their exact words again). All of that was about 2 months ago. I've spent this past time working on myself and trying to get to the bottom of why this happened. I've been working on talking less, reading books people have recommended to me, started therapy with a POC therapist who is working with me on detangling my identity, and most importantly, I've stayed away from other events labeled as for POC just so I don't sour moods. This past week, I messaged one of the organizers (she listed herself as the person to talk to if you didn't know if you should come to these events or not, it wasn't out of the blue) if I could come to this month's event. I expressed that I would be quiet and I didn't need to participate if people would be comfortable, I just wanted to restart my attempt at joining a community and working on alleviating my loneliness. She responded, as politely as possible, that I shouldn't come. She instead invited me to her house for us to have a baking night but has since ghosted me on my attempts to schedule such a night. I honestly don't know what to do from here. I don't want to pour my heart and soul into a Reddit post, but trust me when I say I am very very lonely. I'm desperate to find people in person who relate to me, can have fun on a regular basis, and that I don't have to feel like some token brown person or the exotic friend. I don't have any Brazilian friends because I lost all of them when I publicly left the religion I grew up as and came out as bisexual. There are no \"Brazilians of *insert area*\" Facebook groups. I graduated from college so I can't keep attending my school's club, I've already talked about why general Latina/Latino spaces don't work for me, and now I'm afraid that this group won't work either. So, Reddit, what should I do?",

      "content_preview": "I'm not the only person who has noticed this. There will be some random white lady who has bad sun damage and filler in her lips, someone who has 3a hair and isn't the color of an actual ghost, or just someone who looks \"unique\" and is ginger. There will be dozens of BLACK people, claiming that they look black, they know \"us\", that someone in the family is lying, etc. Even when presented with evidence of the contrary, these people will become very upset by this and double down on their crazy claims. The strange thing about it is that ninety nine percent of the time, the people that they're talking about don't look mixed at all, they just have fuller lips, olive skin and curly hair, or occasionally they're just funny looking ( and have no black reminiscent features whatsoever). People also forget that not all white people look the same. White people also come in different shades and phenotypes. This is not exclusive to black people. Yes, there are dark whites with olive skin and darker features. This is common in a lot of places. There are white people with curly hair. There are white people who have full lips. Yet, regularly, people will tell actual non-white presenting mixed people that they are white presenting, or \"passing,\" as those idiots say because they don't know what words mean. It's really strange. People will claim that very obvious POC looks \"white\" somehow. I recently saw a mixed girl being described as \"white passing\" by an entire comment section, and she was literally MEDIUM BROWN. She looked ambiguous, but you would assume South Asian if anything and definitely not fully European or white in any way. I've seen a lot of black people call any mixed person who does not look unambiguously black \"white passing\" when, in reality, it's just a lot of mixed people who are ambiguous but are clearly still people of color. This is a pet peeve of mine, and i'm the only person who's noticed this. They'll \" we know our people\" to someone that looks like Honey Boo Boo but tanned and with lip filler, but they'll claim that Doja Cat or Zendaya is white passing. Make it make sense.",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm Eurasian. My dad is German, my mom is Filipino. I was born and raised in Germany and lived here my entire life. I am 26 years old (female) and have never been in a real serious long-term relationship. Growing up, back in school, I‚Äôve never had guys showing any interest in me. So as a teenager I never dated. I started actively going on dates around 2 years ago by using dating apps. I‚Äôve met multiple men and was surprised to even meet guys who showed some level of interest in me. ‚ÄúOh so I am desirable?‚Äù was a thought I had. But 2 years ago I wasn‚Äôt as discerning with the guys I chose to go on dates with. Now I‚Äôm more cautious and try to get actual quality matches. The problem I have is that people will see my pictures and get flooded with tons of biases and prejudices about where I could possibly come from, and my background in general. 80% of the likes I get are from men who are really into Anime and/or are fans of anything Japanese related. Those are the types of men who only like my profile because of my exterior. They fetishize and objectify me. And when you call them out, they will deny it. Why? Usually because they aren‚Äôt even aware themselves that that is what they‚Äôre doing. Most of those men aren‚Äôt even aware that this issue exists in the first place. But they are fetishizing me. They just don‚Äôt have the knowledge to be able to name it. I will explain it to them but they don‚Äôt seem to genuinely care to understand, why this is such a major wound for me. They like the idea of me. (Due to watching too much Asian p*rn most likely.) and not who I am as a human being. It‚Äôs fine to like me because you think I‚Äôm physically attractive. It becomes a problem if you only like how I look because of my roots and my Asian features. There‚Äôs a difference between saying ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a beautiful woman‚Äù and ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a beautiful Asian woman‚Äù. The latter is objectification. Keeping this distinction in mind is important. It hurts when my ethnic background is the number 1 topic of conversation they will bring up. Every single time. Europeans will deny it, minimize and invalidate it and say ‚Äúoh but where you come from doesn‚Äôt matter, idk why you‚Äôre making a big deal out of it.‚Äù Oh really? If it actually doesn‚Äôt matter, why is that the number 1 question I get asked every single time? So it does matter to an extent, no? Around 3 years ago I traveled to San Francisco for vacation, and opened up tinder just out of curiosity. And I got 10 times as many matches as I would back in Germany. I couldn‚Äôt stop scrolling. The app broke down due to the amount of matches I received. In Germany I don‚Äôt even get nearly as many matches. Not even close. That was the moment where I thought ‚Äúmaybe in order to find love, I need to move abroad‚Äù. It will still be hard, but I feel my chances might be higher at least. But I could be wrong. Either way, the more I put myself out there and the more I meet those types of men, the more I lose hope. It‚Äôs so bad, I start to cry a lot sometimes. I‚Äôm learning to love myself and I understand that I have a LOT to offer beyond my racial background. I wanna be liked for both equally. My looks and my personality. But not purely because of my race and your associations with that race. I am tired. I am tired of EXPLAINING MY IDENTITY to every single new person I meet. And then have that not be understood and dismissed. And I don‚Äôt believe dating apps are even the problem. The problem gets amplified, yes. But this for sure happens to me even in my day-to-day life as well. Everywhere.",

As an African American person, it's never sat right with me how the black community was so quick to turn on him and say he's \"not like us\" or that he's a culture vulture. He's AA by blood, so it is his culture.. which he has genuinely tried to connect with since he was young. Plus his Uncle is Larry Graham from Sly and the Family Stone, who were a major part of AA music & culture. Why would he not be inclined to follow in his family's footsteps? However, one could argue that his Caribbean-inspired songs are a form of cultural appropation.",

He was rude to everyone, always insulting students, and seemed to enjoy making people fail his class. But with me, he went even further, and the worst part was that he mocked my Asian features just bc I questioned his teaching methods. He would constantly say I was \"sleeping in his class because my eyes were closed\" call me \"Ching Chong\" in front of everyone, and even once at lunchtime told the whole class that I ate dogs. Ik it sounds stupid and unoriginal, but when it‚Äôs your teacher saying it over and over, in front of everyone, it really starts to weigh on you. Tbh, it messed me up a lot. I started hating my own eyes and feeling ashamed of my roots. It frustrated me so much that I even got angry at myself, as if having those features was somehow my fault. Luckily, when my parents found out, they immediately reported him, which helped a lot. But I still had to endure two years of his comments and his hatred toward me. Idk why I'm writing, I guess I just needed to let it out. Although sometimes I feel angry that I couldn‚Äôt stand up for myself more back then.",

My dad's side of the family won't talk to me because they believe mixed race children (esp brown ones) are the \"seed of satan\". No fucking joke. I don't have any family that fw me. I want to bang my head on a wall and cry. About a month ago i posted my dna results on the 23&me sub and holy shit were people so weird and xenaphobic. I got told I was a pathetic Mexican trying to be white. Told I was self-hating and obviously brown. A disgrace to my ancestors, etc. I'm just so fucking tired. I don't even know what tribe I am from because my moms side of the family is so embarrassed about being native. My dad used to yell at me for saying my mom was brown meanwhile her skin is as dark of fucking coffee. I wish I felt complete. I wish I had a community and could fit it. White folks, not even from my own family consider me other. Most natives consider me other (can't really blame them since I know nothing about the culture).

So now I‚Äôm extra messed up because I already knew she didn‚Äôt really love me but now I‚Äôm wondering if she secretly hated all of us (me and my siblings) just for who we were?? Has anyone else gone through this? Also, do you have any YouTube channels you go to for learning about black history and Native American history and stuff? I mostly listen to audio nowadays because reading is hard right now. I would ask my family members but I was cut off from them basically my whole life because of her.",

You don't see black people as humans who are allowed to be flawed. Anytime we have this conversation, it is always the same sentiments, and it always reads off as, \"Well, I hold black people to a higher, damn near unreachable, moral standard, but everyone else is allowed to mess up!\" I've heard things from both sides of my family, but I have never pinpointed one marginalized group and laid all the blame on them. Some of you have some real issues with monoracial black people, and I beg you to dig deep and figure out why you don't hold others to the same standard, because you should. What's good for the geese is good for the gander. Again, I don't excuse or condone any ill-treatment that they've perpetuated. Those individuals should be held accountable.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, this is a very loaded post with a ton of questions to help add to the conversation. So as question states, did you have a white mom ad how did she impact your cultural identity? Was she racist? Was her family racist? How did all of this impact your relationship with her? How did this impact your relationship with your culture? Did you have siblings? Are they also mixed? If your mom didn‚Äôt build your relationship with your culture who did? Besides the treatment of order (ie oldest, middle, baby) how does your relationship differ from theirs with your mother/them? And how is their relationship with their culture? Personal context: I am multi gen mixed(Chinese/white/Mexican), but my mother is mixed(white/mexican) and extremely white passing, to add her mother‚Äôs side is racist. My mom is just learning how to take care of her curly hair in her 50s because when I chopped my hair all the weight came off and my waves turned to curls lol. She‚Äôll claim being Mexican all day but God forbid a qualified person who happens to be Mexican gets the job she wants since they‚Äôre ‚ÄúMexican and know someone higher up‚Äù. I am grateful for where we lived and my friends‚Äô families that raised me when my mother worked a lot because they taught me my culture and language, my mom would tell me stories and I‚Äôd talk to my grandpa occasionally but not enough to feel like they changed my life lol. I am the middle child and my relationship is extremely strained with my mother especially since having my daughter. My older sister has a different dad(white) but my sister will never claim to be mixed, she loves to be the ‚Äúwhite girl from CA‚Äù. My brother and I share the same dad(Chinese) but brother also doesn‚Äôt claim Mexican because ‚Äúbeing mixed is already a lot‚Äù which he‚Äôs not wrong lol. My dad wasn‚Äôt around so while I‚Äôd get a very diluted form of Chinese culture I spent a lot of time in my adult years reconnecting with my dad‚Äôs mom and learning more about this side of myself. My moms favorite of her children is my sister, there‚Äôs a ton of reasons why but the main one is the when she says racist things my sister agrees and will not check her because as a white woman, no one‚Äôs gonna care more about your problems than another white woman lmao. Off note: while I‚Äôm mixed and my partner(black) have a daughter she is very wasian passing with curly hair lol. While she is only one, I‚Äôve noticed that my mom is a deadbeat grandma to her but is constantly involved with my nieces and nephew. We live closer to my partners family and they are my family, and treat me as such. I don‚Äôt really care if my mom is this way towards my daughter because she‚Äôs black tbh, I care that she calls my partner her ‚Äúfavorite son‚Äù because he‚Äôs black but does bs like forget his AND my daughter‚Äôs birthday(yes they share a bday lol). Im about to go no contact with my family because I don‚Äôt need my daughter growing up and seeing the difference in treatment or hear the things said and not understand why it hurts her feelings or how she sees herself. Plus I don‚Äôt water relationships that need me to argue with them in front of my child to communicate. I have filled my life with so much love that I don‚Äôt feel the pain of cutting my family off, especially when it‚Äôs better for the family I created‚Äôs wellbeing. My daughter FaceTimes all her abuelas, nanas, tias, etc.. anyways, I hope you all enjoyed this and I can‚Äôt wait to hear about everyone‚Äôs experiences good and bad, have a good day!! :)",

I‚Äôm sure some of the ppl in this sub have heard this stuff said to their parents and stuff like that. It matters for us to know that it‚Äôs STUPIDDDD and DISGUSTINGG and that love knows no barriers, even with how stupidly tribal ppl get when they have to deal with the fact that sometimes people don‚Äôt wanna ‚Äústick with their own kind‚Äù in a relationship.",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm a multigenerationally mixed person with grandparents that are: West African + Scottish Portuguese-Jewish + Indigenous (Latin America) Indian + Melanesian West African + Indian I still culturally connect with all of these identities. I grew up eating the foods, participating in traditions, and it has helped me feel a sense of belonging, especially as an immigrant to the US. However, I‚Äôve noticed that depending on who I‚Äôm talking to they‚Äôll completely disregard my mixed heritage. My white and East Asian friends exclusively refer to me as Black, and anytime I speak on my other identities, it‚Äôs dismissed. I don‚Äôt deny my Blackness, but it seems as though being mixed with Black completely overshadows the rest of my heritage. They see my skin color, and ignore everything else. Even when I push back and say I‚Äôm mixed, I get told ‚ÄòNo you‚Äôre just Black‚Äô. And since Black is often used interchangeably with African-American, it feels like they don‚Äôt even really acknowledge my specific Black heritage. However, when I try to fit in Black spaces, Black Americans don‚Äôt see me as fully Black, and I get a lot of ‚Äòwhat are you?‚Äô ‚Äòyou look weird‚Äô ‚Äòwhy is your hair like that?‚Äô I‚Äôve tried to interact in Latino spaces and get ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt look like you‚Äôd speak Spanish!‚Äô South Indians (but typically not North Indians) have generally pretty accepting of my Indian side, but not my mixedness and I feel like I have to hide the rest of me. Since I‚Äôm not mixed in the ‚Äòtypical way‚Äô (both parents different races), I‚Äôve found it difficult to relate in that way to most other mixed people too. It feels very isolating and I wish I could just fit in.",

But it is hard to see people already playing the guessing game with my daughter, or commenting on her skin color or eye shape in ways that feel invasive and sometimes, even offensive. Everyone has something to say, and it is starting to grate, even when the commentary is well-intentioned. Why can't people just be NORMAL and say, \"Your daughter is beautiful!\"? Why do they have to say, \"She looks XYZ ü§®\" or \"Her skin is kind of dark...\"? Worst is when it comes from my White stepmother. Like, get that colorist nonsense out of my house! It makes me sad, I guess. I viscerally remember being a child and feeling like I didn't fit in with my own family. I don't want that to EVER happen to my baby girl.

      "content_preview": "This is something I have been intensely experiencing lately. I come from two biracial Jamaican parents and grew up in London. The part of London I grew up in was so multicultural it was actually a God sent growing up there. I never experienced racism a day in my life until I left the region of London that I come when I was about 12 and left to go to secondary school which was way outside of my borough. The reason we never experienced racism was because there was so many mixed kids about and I also have a whole biracial family and had white cousins and black cousins. This was such a common story that even growing up a lot of my friends who were black Or white also had mixed cousins etc So my race was never a factor. I wasn‚Äôt black or white I was just me. Now in my 30s I have started to experience a level of jealousy I have never before from Black men - predominantly much older black men in their 40s and 50s and keep having older black men try to clash with me. In the apartment complex I was living in a few years ago I lived next to a block of social housing that had a history of really bad asb. I lived there for about 10years and had to leave as a group of older black men living there came together and tried set me up to assault me unprovoked out of intense jealousy - I have to stress I did not know them nor had we ever had an interaction. It turned out they had been stalking me and watching my coming and going for awhile and had felt away about me for a minute. I grew up doing martial arts and ended up given these men the beating of a lifetime one in particular but it meant I had to move after. It happened again in the next building I lived in where some older black men again decided to set me up due to me just apparently thinking to much of myself. Again no interaction was ever had with them to upset them or set them off. I called a favour to some family I had that used to be in the streets whose name holds weight who gave them a warning to step off. But I‚Äôve noticed that non stop even when I pass black men in the streets they mutter under their breath and cast jaundice looks, become extremely wound up like I just set them off. Jamacains and Africans alike. It‚Äôs always ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs him‚Äù whilst scowling‚Ä¶ Or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the one I was telling you about‚Äù‚Ä¶ Or in a furious tone ‚Äúdid you see him‚Äù üò° The thing is I struggled with confidence and Looks so much growing up cos I grew up in my teenage years getting dirty looks from mostly black people that made me feel and think there was something wrong with me. And only until now I‚Äôve realised it was always jealousy and it always has been. I know what I sound like poor beige mullato me. But the level of heat I get it‚Äôs not normal the things that have happened are not normal. Again I live in my own bubble and am kind to people who are kind to me but assholes to the assholes. I get threatened by black men often also not directly but in passing, I have had black men threaten to throw acid at me more then once. I‚Äôve had black men wish death on me multiple times. My looks are always a topic ! I again have mostly black family although 60% of us are lightskinned. But for the first time I have started to separate myself from the black race. Growing up I was desperate to be part of the black community but I‚Äôve realised it‚Äôs so crabs in a barrel ‚Ä¶that in order to succeed in life I need to be outside of the black community as they do no uplift anyone who succeeds more then them. Their first inclination is to tear anyone ascending down by any means possible. I know it‚Äôs all jealousy but it just wants to know if anyone else has experienced this or how you have dealt with this if you have. Because I would be lying if I said it doesn‚Äôt get to me at times and I would rather be invisible. It can be a struggle to keep my head up due to not wanting to upset black men. I‚Äôve always started to notice that I agitate Indian men also which is a new phenomenon which I suspect is due to skin colour also But it has been a strain on my mental health. Sorry if this came off narcissistic and delusional but it is the honest to gods truth. This is no way an attack on dark skinned black men or any other race. But the behaviour I have endured all my life has been down right just evil and wicked.",

Then after he kept saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre brown, I‚Äôm white‚Äù it occurred to me that something happened in his understanding of the words themselves, which I think needs discussion. The white race named themselves ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and they‚Äôre the only ones who named themselves after a color. As inaccurate as it is, cos the reality is they‚Äôre all colors‚Äîtan, pink, olive, peach, pale. I also think him hearing his sisters say, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre white AND Hispanic‚Äù gave him the idea that white was describing color, not his white race. So in his 4 year old mind, I‚Äôm the ‚Äúbrown race‚Äù. Isn‚Äôt that fucked up üòπ so my wife and I talked and we decided the 5 of us are just American, first and foremost.

      "content_preview": "Hi all! I'm curious about folks who are mixed with a Black and White parent, but look completely White. This dynamic specifically interests me because of how charged the relationship between these two demographics have been for centuries, particularly in America. Obviously, to be Black carries a lot of connotations that have had a profound effect globally. Whether you're in the Americas, Easter Island, and everything in between, navigating this fact in life is a part of the Black Experience. Ignorantly, I wouldn't expect this to play much of a role for those who are White Passing. At the same time, I would expect there to be a lot of second-hand experience, and probably identity challenges growing up. Of course, I am only speaking from the perspective of someone who is only guessing. My curiosity was sparked by NFL player Mason Taylor . His father , himself mixed, is a Hall of Fame former NFL player. There was really no question of his ethnic identity as he received hate mail for being married to a White woman. If I offended anyone, I apologize. This post is simply to gain greater understanding of this experience, as I've noticed it's become more common in the last decade or so. I myself am Black, but a second-generation immigrant in America from a fairly isolated part of Africa where this isn't common.",

I have tons of pictures with his mother (my grandma) and step grandad, but none of him.  I have never seen what he looks like, and though I know I‚Äôve met him, I have no memories of him due to being so young.  My mom and (step)dad split when I was around 9 and I stayed with my dad and brother for the rest of my childhood.  So I am culturally biracial with my direct household was always white (aside from my brother, cousin and I). I‚Äôve always wanted to take a dna test in hopes of finding my family on his side.  A few months back I submitted my dna to Ancestry.  As I waited for the results I started to search with what little information I had about my bio dad.  I was able to get passed addresses, ss number, possible schools,  birth records, etc. About 3-4 weeks after submitting, I got my results and learned that I‚Äôm not white, I am mostly Black and Filipino.  Despite this info I kept on searching for my family based on who I knew my bio dad to be. I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit, that just a couple weeks ago it dawned on me that my dad cannot be who I‚Äôve been told he is. For more context - I am about 45% Black, 40% Asian (mostly Filipino) and the last little bit is German and some other European.  I have found distant connections online, some of them present white (I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs why it took me a minute to figure it out) but there‚Äôs no possible way that my father isn‚Äôt a Filipino man, right? While I was excited for those results I am deeply saddened by the fact that this pretty much means I have zero chance of finding my bio family.  The people I‚Äôve reached out to on Ancestry seemed deeply uninterested, and asked for info I just don‚Äôt have. I am a little heartbroken.  I‚Äôm also sad that I wasn‚Äôt raised with any Filipino influence.  It‚Äôs almost a shock to my system, cos how I would have loved to have passed down anything other than my culture-less your upbringing.  We have no traditions.  I‚Äôm just sad.  The other day, while filling out some additional paperwork for my daughter‚Äôs preschool, I was stumped by the question ‚Äúwould you be willing to share any cultural traditions with the class?‚Äù Im just silently spiraling since all of this info. Thanks for reading if you do.  And I would love to hear from anyone else that‚Äôs had this experience.",

Does this mean that my race isn‚Äôt south asian because I don‚Äôt look it? I‚Äôm so confused bro",

      "content_preview": "This whole idea that mixed people are so \"exotic\" and so \"mysteriousss\" is so uncomfortable. People where i live touch my hair because \"they've never seen something like it\" and make \"jokes\" about donating my hair to them when they're nowhere near bald. Its weird af and just because im mixed doesnt mean i came from a whole different planet. I dont know about americans but theres also this cultural differenciation between monoracial and multiracial black people here which is so very obvious (west africa). People talking about how im lucky to be mixed because so many people \"want me\"?? \"I need to be proected because im muxed\"??Bitch what Youre flexing colourism and fetishisation?? Do you not realisebhow embarassing that is, why is the norm choosing someone who's not fully black just because they're partially \"foreign\"?? They have the wrong idea of what a mixed person is and dont realise it goes deeper than just looks. They also think biracials and half ehite/black people are the only definitoon of what a mixed race person can be. My own dad is mixed (Asian,european,North African) and people just call him white because he has paler skin, despite trying to explain, my own mother refuses to acknowledge his origins and so does he. My mother also gets weirdly excited when she sees another visibly mixed girl, saying stuff like \"oh she looks just like you!!\" Do you frankly think that just because she has curly hair and tanned skin like I do?? Do i look at random darkskin women and say you are twins? NO. She also differentiates other black people from me in whatever way that is because im mixed. This has also happens with my white grandma who calls me exotic looking and other weird shit because im her only mixed grandchild. And this is nowhere near a quarter of it. Aside from my own personal experiences, this is just the way so many people view us and its disgusting how normalised it is. Grown monoracial adults of entire different races all over the world/internet saying stuff like \"im going to get my mixed babies\", as if its a task, or some sort of experiment. These are the same people hating on mixing and saying its watering down cultures. Ew",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, This is for me, a very weird post. I'm not directly mixed race, as in, my parents come from the same country. My country has a very bad relationship with it's past, and we deny that we are mixed (I don't, but most do). Many of us have black and north african ascendence, and you can tell. And in my case, it's VERY clear. I spent my whole childhood being asked if I was adopted, if my father was black or people questioning if I'm truly from the country. All baby dolls my mother ever bought me were black or brown babies. Because they looked more like me. Obviously, I've been called racial slurs on the street. Even today, that Im less tan (I actually have vitiligo), I still get mistaken for countries with big subsaharian mixture. Even by the people from said countries. The last person I dated was an adoptee from brazil. And we kinda looked similar? I had always dated \"white\" men before (because that's what most available). I did his hair, as he had never had it done. But, our pictures as kids? We looked like siblings. We shared a lot of experiences about the not belonging feeling and being racially profiled by the police, follwed at stores or accused of stealing with no reason. It felt great that I could share this with someone without being called exotic (in my own country?) (He ended up being a terrible person so that was sad). For some reason, maybe being close to 30, has made me start thinking that if I marry someone from my country (as in, white), my kids are just never gonna look like me? My kids are probably not going to look, well, mixed at all. They are just probably gonna look white - tanish. And that makes me feel... Weird? I never felt like I was fully from where I am because of the narrow view of what being my ethnicity is. So, why would I want my kids to look less... Black/brown? Less mixed? More... White? Be mistaken for my kids \"nanny\"? (Like if I could ever afford one anyway lol). Like, I would not marry or have kids with someone just so my kids looked a certain way. That had never crossed my mind, and I don't think I could ever. But like, I feel very weird thinking the day I might have kids they won't look light skin/brown? I don't believe in any sort of racial purity or anything of course. This is about: I always felt like an outsider to my own culture and country because of how people treated me. I was never allowed to feel like I belonged. I had to BUILD my identity. Studying a lot about my country's past and how it was ereased, too. Have any of you ever felt like this?",
