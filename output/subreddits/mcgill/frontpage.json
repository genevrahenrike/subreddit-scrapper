Both classes also have enough people that my absence wouldn’t be obvious. Has anyone had experience with this? Am I still able to get credit for both courses?? Or is this a bad idea",

I know with the social dynamics of this brand of Canadian person is you don’t go to the cottage unless you’re supper close BUT ILL ASK ANYWAYS. THIS IS MY APPLICATION TO COME TO YOUR COTTAGE BEFORE SUMMER OVER: I can pay the gas to get there. I can sail. (Wild ik) And I am fine being crew instead of skipper. White parents love me. I am especially good at boomer white parents and both stay at home mom + career moms & essential oil white parents + finance capitalism oil white people. I am even better at all brands of immigrant parents. I can cook really good steak and kebab. (And tbh everything) even vegan shite. I will bring the steaks. I have a guy. I have a guy for everything except cottage. I have never water skiied or tubed before but you can launch me in a tube or on skis and see what happens idfk. Are you afraid I’ll be good at it? 6.I am also really good at alcohol. Both being drunk and supplying alcohol. (Mostly beer but I can make 10/10 sangria if your family swings that way). I have skills: I can paint if you have an art family or do music if you have a music family. I have outdoors skills from scouts. I'll keep up with your outdoors parents. I can fish. I straight up have caught a plethora of fish in the Toronto downtown harbour with the noise pollution and regular pollution. If I can do it there, I can impress your fishing family. Both white dad and asian grandma anywhere. If you’re wondering why I haven’t gone to the cottage yet with all these skills, it’s because I haven’t nurtured relationships with people in sororities or frats and I am sorry. I’ve been too busy doing bachata with your moms. If you have a cottage and are reading this, there’s one thing you should be thinking. Screw it. This’ll be a story to tell. LIFE IS FOR LIVING lemme bring this mf to the LAKE. Edit: I am being 100% serious.",

Anything that comes to mind would be really helpful, as I, frankly, have zero clue. Thanks for the help, guys!

Sorry OAP managers for throwing a shade, a couple of you are my friends, but the solution is simple. Also, I understand people who cut too (unless they come in with a huge group). It is the only way to get in, and if you decide to be a good person you will be taken advantage of. If your country is corrupt and everybody evades tax, you should too until you can change the system. Here are potential solutions: 2-3 people monitors the lines at all times to kick people out who cut lines ban people who have cut lines for that semester extend the line block with tight rope for longer I think these solutions basically cover the big governance to dos. People need to know there are rules (laws in a modern state), the rules are made sure to be followed by some kind of a watchdog (police), and there are punishments to disincentivize (jail, fines). Light education (signs, schooling etc) is also helpful. McGill students (should) strive to make events inclusive; make it inclusive to newcomers, or people who might not know the right people. - coming from a person who does know the people, who has cut the line before, and is a seasoned mcgillian Edit: some people seem to think i have a problem bc i couldnt get in or smt. That is not the problem guys, the problem is that people who are waiting in lines like they are supposed to are being taken advantage of whether or not they are able to get in.",

Apparently this wasn't the case in the previous year: according to the wayback machine , OneCard could be used at off-campus locations back in April. The page appeared to be under construction in May , and references to off-campus locations are removed by June 20th . I think back in February they just introduced a new location for OneCard to be used at, but now they're all gone?

      "content_preview": "Hi!! I am a recent graduate from McGill CS. In my final semester, I built a web app to help McGill students with degree planning. This summer I took some extra time to refine it, and I’ve just completed the updated version. I would love to share it with current students to see if they find it useful. I also plan to keep improving it based on feedbacks AcaMapa screenshot When I was picking electives, I often struggled to find ones that actually fit what I wanted. On top of that, it was hard to see what advanced courses I could eventually take, since the information is scattered everywhere. The program requirements were just a flat list of courses, but whenever I tried to plan out a semester I’d end up opening a dozen different tabs to cross-check prerequisites and rules. For overall planning, I mostly just used general tools like Notion or a simple Google Doc, but whenever I needed to make changes I’d often lose track of things or have trouble keeping it organized. That’s what pushed me to build this tool, it started from my own pain point of trying to make sense of all this: AcaMapa.ai *AcaMapa stands for Academic Mapper, in case if you’re wondering;) Here’s what it does: Takes the messy McGill course/program info → parses it → presents it as clean, interactive cards. Handles complicated pre-/co-/anti-requisite logic with simple, color-coded feedback (green = qualified, red = not yet). Shows you the future courses that open up once you take a prerequisite , so you can plan ahead strategically. Lets you drag-and-drop plan your entire degree visually by choosing courses for each terms. Links back to official McGill sources for trust + details. I think this might be helpful for these people: Pre-university students → Explore programs easily, preview what courses/requirements look like before applying/choosing. First-year students → Build a degree roadmap from the start, avoid surprises, see how requirements fit together. Upper-year students → Track what you’ve already taken, unlock new course options, fine-tune elective planning. Still a work in progress! but I’d love to hear if anyone else runs into the same problems. (I've so far only adapted the UI layout to PC and laptops) Please come to try it out! … … This project has taken me wayyy longer than I expected, and TBH I have no idea if anyone will actually find it useful🥲. I also regret that the product missed a big half of this term’s course selection period due to how slow it has came together. Still, I really hope this project can be seen, tried out and liked by some of you So please — If you have any comments, questions and feedbacks, please please leave a comment or reach out to me. I’ve also planned on making more releases moving forward to bring new features to live (ex. Log-in and AI feature). Lastly, see how there’s 5 As in AcaMapa.ai ? This is a grand wish for y’all to gain at least 5 As in your upcoming term ;) Huge huge thanks!!!",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone! I've seen a couple of super cool apps others have shared on this subreddit to help with planning courses at McGill, but I couldn't find anything that helps you plan courses that align with program requirements. So, over the summer, I created DegreePlanner, a web app that makes planning courses at McGill way easier. Instead of scrolling through the course catalogue and navigating endless website links, DegreePlanner lays out program requirements in a clean and intuitive format so you can focus on choosing courses relevant to your program and quickly find information about them. The app's main focus is on progress tracking throughout a student’s entire program, showing how completed courses align with program requirements. It also provides tailored course suggestions based on what students have already completed. https://preview.redd.it/a-degree-planning-app-to-track-your-progress-v0-heoz32mvanmf1.png https://preview.redd.it/a-degree-planning-app-to-track-your-progress-v0-fxsti2mvanmf1.png https://preview.redd.it/a-degree-planning-app-to-track-your-progress-v0-9egx62mvanmf1.png Right now, the app has a handful of programs (mostly from the Faculty of Science), and I’ll be adding more over the coming weeks. Feel free to drop your program below if you would like to see it in the app and I'll work on adding them as soon as possible! The idea is to eventually have all programs centralized so you can quickly check program requirements, courses, and progress. You can try it here: https://degree-planner-rose.vercel.app/ I’d love to hear your thoughts! Any questions, suggestions, feedback, or bug reports are all super welcome! In the future, I hope to add scheduling features and the ability to save your course plans so that you can visit your planning anytime throughout your degree. My goal is to make this genuinely useful for McGill students, so anything that can make it better helps a ton! Thank you for checking it out, and good luck with the semester!! 🍀",

I know there's no “right time” for anything, but it does sometimes feel like this phase of life where people start pairing off (esp. in law school). I’m not actively looking to date in my first year, but I’d be open if the right connection comes along :) I’m not in any rush, I’m still young and probably around the age of a lot of 3rd or 4th years undergrads, but I was genuinely curious how others have met their partners here.

      "content_preview": "TLDR: ACTUALLY LOSING MY MIND but it's chill (cope) Long version: I'm a U3 student who applied for Winter 2026 exchange super excited and hopeful. After all, it really is an experience that you only get in university!!! And all the stories I've heard from past students have been that as long as it's your first time applying, you meet all the requirements, and write a decent statement of purpose, you'll likely get your top 1/2 choice. Tsinghua was my top choice for so many reasons. I won't get into here but there were a lot of education and personal benefits I could see. Like it really seemed perfect. I definitely acknowledge that I don't have a super high GPA but I'm still fully eligible, did all the applications, paid the application fee, etc. Nominations come out last week and I see that I didn't get any of my top 4 choices. Already really devastated but fine, that's on me for getting ahead of myself. I'm looking at the list of alternates choices and pick 2 Hong Kong universities, 1 France, 1 England. I wasn't as excited about these schools as I was for Tsinghua, but I was finding things to be optimistic about. On Monday, August 4, I log into the alternate webform at 9:00AM to choose my four new schools. It's done in a minute. Today, I get an email saying that there were no spots left at my alt. 4 choices AGAIN. So I need to consult the list on the webform and reply to a Servicepoint email to rank ANOTHER 4 schools. If I do that, that'll be TWELVE schools I've applied for. Honestly I'm writing this post to vent. Because I don't even know what to do at this point. I'm really struggling to find schools I'm interested in out of the remaining list. I'm in Arts so ISA outside of Canada isn't even an option for me. I'm set to graduate soon so Winter really is my last shot at exchange without delaying my grad too much. If I do delay my grad to try for a Fall 2026 exchange there's always the possibility that this will happen to me AGAIN. and maybe this is more common than I thought! But damn I feel really misled, because at least everyone one that I've spoken to previously has always talked about how easy the nomination process is. There's also a bitter part of me that thinks I probably deserve to go to Tsinghua more than at least one person who got nominated. Because it really was such a perfect opportunity. But obviously that's a stupidly toxic way of thinking that I'm trying to beat to death with hammers. Anyway I guess the purpose of this post is to have a public meltdown, wallow in misery with anyone else who might be going through the same thing, and solicit any advice/pity if possible. Joking but also not really.",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone It’s my first time as a TA at McGill. I did not do my undergrad in Canada and I feel like the tutorial sessions are not the same one as the one I had in my university. When I was in Undergrad a tutorial session would start with the prof/TA handing out a set of exercises then we would be given a few minutes to try out the exercises before the teacher provided the solution or picked a student to go on the board and share their solutions. For some courses we would have the exercise list a few days prior to the tutorial so that we could start at home and then tutorial would be more about providing solutions and answering questions regarding the exercises. Is it the same at mcgill or are tutoriels handled in a different way ? I do want to make the most out of this opportunity and be helpful for the students. Any tips from former/current TA or students are more than welcome Thanks",

I have bought some groceries, but I find I never have the time or energy to make anything really nutritious, and I think I’m starting to feel it. I’m really not trying to leave McGill with gout… I was wondering if anyone here had advice on how to make meal prep more simple and easy. Bonus points if you also have ADHD.",

      "content_preview": "Hi, dear McGill community. I'm wondering if there's no McGill Quantum Club or something related already, I want to create one where we gather like-minded people to talk and learn about quantum computing/communication/sensing/AI. I created a discord server where I will post anything related to quantum computing/communication/sensing/AI...etc. like articles, websites, free courses or even internships? If I see any on LinkedIn. Prof. Coish (who's on sabbatical) has shown his interest in my idea, so there's one professor supporter there. If you are interested in building a quantum community at McGill with me, please DM or comment! I'm a 2nd year physics student who took IBM summer school this year and got into Quantum Computing. Since, UBC and Toronto have their group I think McGill should have one too, and also I think QC is really cool and it should get promoted more to celebrate 2025 the year of quantum. IBM Fall quantum fest. application is open currently and I have signed up to have the chance to be a potential host, which will then be on McGill Campus. If you are interested in signing up as well let me know! I'm a shy individual and it's my first time to want to make a club because I think it would be really really cool! Let me know if you are interested! Thank you for yall time!",

      "content_preview": "Hey! I’ve never actually been on campus before, and I’m moving into upper residence later this month. Anybody have any recommendations on places on/surrounding campus to visit and familiarize myself with? Any chill study spots for winter? Is there anywhere you wish you knew about before move-in? Thanks!",
