      "content_preview": "Hi all, I'm considering buying my friend's 2015 Nissan Versa Note with 112k miles. We have agreed on below market value--KBB lists private party value range as $3,496-$6,295 if we put condition as \"very good,\" which I think is the best guess, but she would sell it to me for $3k. We just got a pre purchase inspection this morning, and this is what we found: a few smaller repairs (battery is weak-->$220, replace front tires soon-->~$350 let's say, A/C recharge-->~$200), but what I'm worried about is the CVT. I noticed when test driving that when driving/accelerating at higher speeds it periodically makes a quiet whir. The mechanic confirmed that this noise was coming from the transmission--said it's not supposed to make noise so not great, but hard to say, could go another 50k miles or could fail tomorrow. He offered to change transmission fluid if I wanted but warned that it might help or might do nothing and it could fail anyway, it's a gamble. The only recommended repairs were new battery and changing engine air filter. Apparently if the CVT does fail, that will cost up to $3k. At face value, I'm being sold a car at a very good deal, but with this scary gamble that could double my investment. I will hopefully obtain carfax/service history from my friend later today, but I know it has no accident history. I know these cars' CVTs are infamous wild cards, but I've also heard that newer ones aren't as bad? Is 2015 in the \"problematic\" generation? Any advice greatly appreciated. (FWIW, my alternative is buying a 2011 Prius with 95k miles from family for $7k. The car has history of 1 trivial accident and 1 moderate accident (~$5k repair), but solid service history and new front tires. So if the versa's CVT fails, I've basically paid almost as much as for the Prius but for a worse car.) Edit: Also, what is the usual lifespan for these cars? Let's say I end up dumping $6.5k in all together, worst case scenario. How many years am I going get out of that, supposing I drive about 10k miles a year? More than 5 years? Edit: the Prius \"moderate\" accident, according to my Dad, was a $5500 body repair (the front was crunched), but nothing mechanically affected. Of course he is an interested party but he is also my dad and I trust him.",

I dont want to put coins, cards, random stuff in there because it turns on the wireless charger and idk what thatll do to cards if their in there. And theres no space to keep your phone either. And the vents are so low that a vent mount only gets in the way. It has the cutout that the rogue did underneath, but they put a sheet up behind it. Like the mold is tbe same, i am so tempted to try and remove the plastic they put up to block the little alcove.. but theres no storage! Even the door cupholders-not cupholders but round enough for cups, is at a specific angle to spill it all! First world problems and all but geez.. not comfy :(",

Hoping someone here has experienced the same and can help me confirm the diagnosis. Issue Summary: •\tAfter changing the car battery 10 days ago, everything was working fine for a while. •\tA few days later, the engine won’t start, and I can’t even get to ACC or ON mode. •\tI can still roll the windows down/up using the key fob (long press on the unlock button in the key fob to roll them down, using the physical key to lock the car and keep it turned for a few seconds in the lock position to roll them up). The car door and internal lights still work, but the radio or anything that needs ACC unlock doesn’t. •\tThe Start/Stop button does nothing,  no lights, no response, no crank. •\tThe key fob still works fine to lock/unlock the doors both remotely and via proximity (door handle button works). •\tOccasionally I get a “Key” orange warning light or “Insert key in port” message on the dashboard. I tried: •\tHolding the key against the start button •\tInserting the key into the port (next to the steering wheel) •\tWrapping the key in foil (in case of signal interference) •\tPressing the start button repeatedly with and without the brake •\tReplacing the fob battery •\t“Soft NATS reset” by inserting/removing the key in the fob port quickly 6 times in 10 seconds. Still not able to get a response. Really appreciate any insights.. Thanks in advance!",

Then the car started to rev high to about 1k then 2k and then drop back to 1k, and the radiator fans would not kick on causing the car to overheat, then I noticed it would not move out of park, I seen online that if the brake lights do not come on then that is the issue (brake lights were not coming on), took a fuse from the spare fuse spot and put it into a random empty spot on the inside fuse box and the brake lights started working and the car was able to shift, note I have tried the idle relearn procedure and still no luck, any help would be greatly appreciated!!",

      "content_preview": "The class action lawsuit alleges that Nissan didn’t adequately address terminal engine issues. Nissan faces a class action lawsuit claiming its VC-Turbo engines ( also used in some Infiniti models ) can suffer major malfunctions, and that Nissan skirted its responsibilities for addressing the alleged defect, leaving customers with high out-of-pocket costs. Filed in a Delaware court, the suit also dismisses a recent recall involving the engine as inadequate. The three-cylinder and four-cylinder VC-Turbo engines are the first mass-produced automotive engines capable of varying their compression ratios. In theory, that allows the engine to switch between lower and higher compression ratios to emphasize fuel economy or power, depending on how the car is being driven. But owners are reporting reliability issues. The lawsuit alleges that VC-Turbo engines can suffer from main-bearing failures and other issues, causing engines to hesitate, make high-pitched whirring noises, idle roughly, lose power, and stall or shut off completely while the car is being driven. The latter was reported by Dennis Becker, one of four plaintiffs named in the suit. Becker said a he purchased a 2023 Nissan Rogue from a Florida dealership on March 30, 2024. After driving the crossover just 157 miles (after whatever mileage the car may have already covered prior to its purchase by Becker), he said an “Engine Malfunction” message appeared on the dashboard, with “Power Reduced” and “Service Now” warnings. Becker said he stopped the car, after which it couldn’t be restarted. The car was taken to a dealership where its battery was replaced, but Becker reported continued issues, adding that a subsequent engine control module software update and replacement of the exhaust gas recirculation valve didn’t fix the problem either. Nissan issued a recall for VC-Turbo engines last month, saying it would replace some engines , but the lawsuit claims that repairs covered under the recall “amount to simply a few oil changes” for most affected owners. Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges that Nissan has routinely denied any issues with its VC-Turbo engines until warranties expired, and that it forced owners to cover diagnostic and repair costs themselves, potentially adding up to “thousands” in out-of-pocket costs that the automaker should have covered. The lawsuit covers 2021-2023 Nissan Rogue crossovers, 2019-2023 Nissan Altima sedans, and 2019-2023 Infiniti QX50 crossovers. VC-Turbo engines were also used in the Infiniti QX55, a coupe-like derivative of the QX50. When Nissan rolled these engines out, it seemed like a major engineering achievement, as other automakers had been working variable-compression engines on and off for decades without achieving commercial viability. VC-Turbo was touted by Nissan as a way to improve fuel economy without the added complexity of hybrid systems. But that promise hasn’t been born out in the real world. The 2.0-liter inline-four VC-Turbo Altima’s 248 horsepower and 29 mpg combined were solid, but not spectacular, numbers. Nissan discontinued the VC-Turbo engine in the Altima for the 2025 model year, and has dropped the Infiniti QX50 and QX55 entirely. VC-Turbo tech still lives on in the Rogue, which uses it on a 1.5-liter turbo-three. And underwhelming sales of all VC-Turbo models across their lifespans shows that this wasn’t the game-changing technology Nissan hoped it would be.
