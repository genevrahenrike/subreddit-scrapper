      "content_preview": "There’s nothing wrong with being invested and interested in these cast members since we all watch them in terms of the current cast members or in some cases watched them in terms of past cast members who are no longer on the show. But the big thing is… WE DON’T KNOW THESE PEOPLE LIKE THAT. WE DON’T KNOW THESE PEOPLE PERSONALLY. The weird comments I see on this subreddit ESPECIALLY directed to some of the ladies of the show is insane.  This isn’t me being a white knight or anything. It’s just calling out the people who have these insane takes on people that they don’t even know anything about. We don’t know these cast members like that. Sophie Laing - “Oh she’s a money grabbing social climbing whore who’s only with Jamie for his money and fame”. - Considering Sophie comes from a well off family and I don’t think money has ever been an issue in her life, so she’s definitely not in it for the money. Her and Jamie BOTH left the show around the same time in 2020/21. She’s been in Made In Chelsea and has had the exposure and storylines well before she even got with Jamie. So they both haven’t been on the show in 4-5 years and probably will never go back outside of a cameo appearance. Can’t be a fame hungry whore when she does stuff outside of their relationship. And the same goes with Jamie. He also has businesses and opportunities he does away from Sophie. Sophie can’t be that much of a money grabbing fame hungry whore to be with Jamie since 2019. Got married to him in 2023. We saw them move houses and now living in their marital home where they will be raising their children since Sophie is currently pregnant. So yeah. She’s that much of of a fame hungry whore that she married Jamie and now is having his child. If anything isn’t EVERYONE who has ever appeared on Made In Chelsea in some ways a social climber? No one appears on this show without the intention of at least having SOME sort of fame. So why is the whole “social climber” bullshit constantly directed towards Sophie then? Zara McDermott - “Oh she’s another one who’s a game hungry whore” - In what sense? She was already pretty known and famous before she even joined Made In Chelsea and began a relationship with Sam Thompson. She was on The Only Way Is Essex and was on X FACTOR. So how much of a fame hungry whore is she really? I saw someone say “why does she still live with her parents at 30 it’s so weird when she has the money to live with herself” if she wants to live with her parents then she can? Why are we saying it’s weird for her to live with her family? Doesn’t matter if she has the money to live alone. So we’re saying it’s weird that she wants to live with her own family? The fuck. Weird people with weird ass comments. There’s loads more of these women that people say the same shit to. Once again, WE DON’T KNOW THESE PEOPLE. AT ALL. Made In Chelsea isn’t this authentic television show to begin with. Just people we watch or watched  these people on the tv show doesn’t mean we know them. Even if we follow them on social media we still don’t know them. Stop with the weird comments towards people you don’t even know.",

      "content_preview": "Okay so I don’t listen to any of MIC cast podcasts usually but I caught the one with Jamie and Chad Michael Murray this morning. Jamie is such a liar, idk how he got where he is without being called out for his terrible behaviour. He said on the podcast that he has always “led with kindness” ever since he started out in show business. And that he has always radiated positivity and kindness. Umm he treated women soooooooo badly and he was just gross. I remember his first scene on MIC was literally him talking about “having to sit next to the fattest chick” on a plane ride because his family cut off his money spending and he had to sit in coach. People can say the show is scripted or whatever but his behaviour with girls was not, he treated them like objects and messed them around constantly well into his 30s. He has seemingly just erased all that and apparently he has always been this great, nice and caring fun guy. Let’s not forget the amount of times he cheated on women including his now wife. Who he slept with the same day he cheated on her and slept with another girl in the morning (Rosi Walden). He grosses me out and is desperate in my opinion. Same with Sophie, she just married him to get a one up in the fame game. Louise had her pegged as a social climber and it’s clear as day.",

It seems like almost every single cast member past and present has body image issues but to an extreme level. I find it so hard to relate to any of them and it’s frustrating to never see anyone look halfway normal on this show or not be relatable whatsoever. Everyone is stick thin (and consistently aspires to be that), filled with botox or fillers, obsessed with image/filters and everything else that is wrong with society. Look at Rosie and Binky, they are so thin and it looks like they are sick. Miles seems so messed up/sad and just kills himself to “look perfect”, he won’t even eat when he is in friggin Italy. Liv and Lucy were so naturally beautiful but Liv looks sick and frozen and Lucy has so many fillers. Yas and Jules were almost normal looking but now Yas is on ozempic and Jules is obsessed with running and juice cleanses. The cast right now seems to be the worst of the worst. It’s great to be healthy and I support that 100% but nothing these people put out in the world is healthy. Everything is about looks and what you can do to “fix” yourself or look better. It’s not just them, it’s all of society right now. Social media is a cancer to all of us. I’m not trying to hate on any of them, but what happened to natural beauty and loving yourself? It’s all just so wrong and sad. And it’s affecting me, so I can’t imagine the shit it’s doing to young teens and adults let alone us that are 30+.",

And then obviously so much in between with julius (as much as I dislike him too) but in the beginning of season 29 (also ignoring his whole thing with yas, I just feel that I literally hate him and yes it’s a TV show but he’s just an absolutely disgusting human being. Flirting with jules and then blaming her and causing arguments between them and just so much more which I literally can’t remember or even fit into this. And what I hate more is the fact that the people around him clearly enable this behaviour. Why are Rez and ruby saying it’s okay that he was flirting with jacks gf liv and blaming jules. Also liv having him on the podcast and whatnot. These people are just as horrible if they think it’s okay to be friends with him What are ur guys’ thoughts? Have I missed out any key sam prince hate moments??",

      "content_preview": "Of all time who do we think was the realest cast member? I mean a few things by this… first being they didn’t cause drama just for the sake of it, only if it was inflicted by the other side. Second, they actually stood up for people when they weren’t in the wrong and stood up to people when they were in the wrong, even if they’re friends. And lastly like they do seem their honest selves, they’re not putting up a facade of someone who you can tell isn’t really them. I think lucy watson is definitely at the top of this list, she shut people down when it was needed e.g. steph, stevie, spencer, mytton, louise, jamie, andy etc but was still able to be friends with pretty much all of them… she didnt lose her morals (relative to the rest of the cast). Only moment i can think of is when she had an argument with rosie for no reason when she invited tiff to intern for her. Controversial but new seasons lauren with the intenrstional school accent. She stands up for who she truly believes is right and against which I like about her despite finding her simultaneously annoying which is a key part of the question. I think people can be annoying but are they being real people if you get what I mean. Any other people? I guess proudlock too, he was always the more mature one, didn’t really get into arguments relative to the rest or piss people off for no reason. I would definitely put Gareth Locke at the top of this list because he’s undeniably the most sane person on the show and he’s so much more mature than the rest. Gets along with everyone and handles all the drama so maturely. I guess can’t make the full judgement however because he was never in the core cast members despite being an important member Who else do you guys think?",

I remember her telling Jamie something to the effect of \"people think I'm rude because I'm quiet. I'm not rude, I just dont't see the point of speaking when I have nothing to say\". I can relate tbf😅 - Gabilicious: yes, that was her actual moniker. She was Marc-Francis and Victoria's weird, monied friend who popped up in some earlier episodes now and then. I don't remember much about her, but I do remember her being very loud and very annoying. - Kimberley's horsey friend: I can't remember her name but she had a really hideous Maggie Thatcher voice, like nothing else I've ever heard. She rode horses. Kimberley got sacked from MIC after getting into a physical altercation with her off camera. Does anyone remember this? - Cillian: Paris' Irish boyfriend of a few months. He made her some jewelry and had a very funny-shaped head.",

Admittedly their dynamic could be very dry, awkward and annoyng at times, but it was still entertaining to listen to. Now Tom has left the podcast, I'm really not digging Liv as a solo presenter. My main issue is her half-arsed lack of show structure and lazy choice of guests. It's literally just her Made In Chlesea mates, her parents, her JOMO business partner, some random e4 producer woman she's pally with, and her botox doctor on rotation. Liv does have her moments where she's thought-provoking and witty, but I think she's kind of flogging a dead horse now. I mean, I do find her parents and Sam Prince hilarious, but how many more times can we listen to Sam Prince talking about the exact same things as he did during his last appearance? And the same old superficial chat about cosmetic procedures with her brown-nosing friend Dr Motox.I mean, one episode is fine, but why have two episodes a couple of months apart covering the exact same topic? She clearly lacks the finesse and research skills needed to be a decent podcast host. Or she's not at least willing to try and improve her presenting skills. Her editing is also incredibly sloppy (e.g. random bits of audio being chopped up and patched together disjointedly, and the same audio clip being repeated seconds apart). And don't get me started on her weird habit of constantly describing of everyone as \"sweet\" (\"my sweet sister\", \"my seeet neighbour\", \"sweet Khloe Kardashian\" etc etc). What does everyone else think? Do you see the podcast surviving much longer?",
