      "content_preview": "So I know I‚Äôm late on this, but rewatching Grimm reminded me of how annoying I find Juliette. First off, the actress constantly has this ‚Äúsmell the fart‚Äù Joey-from-Friends expression. It takes me out of scenes every single time. What really bugs me: how Nick and the others just‚Ä¶ forgave Eve for killing Nick‚Äôs mom and burning the trailer?? If Adalind had done even half of that, they would‚Äôve ostracized her or flat-out killed her. The double standard is wild. Season 5 annoyed me the most when Eve threatened Adalind: ‚ÄúIf you hurt Nick, I‚Äôll come for you.‚Äù Like, girl‚Ä¶ YOU are literally the one who hurt him the most. The hypocrisy is unbearable. Another weird inconsistency: in S5, Adalind could feel Eve dying because of their strange bond, but back in S4 when Trubel killed Juliette, Adalind didn‚Äôt feel a thing? Make it make sense. And honestly, I‚Äôll die on this hill: Meisner and Adalind had chemistry. I would‚Äôve loved to see their love story play out instead of being brushed aside. Huge missed opportunity by the writers. Anyway, that‚Äôs my rant. Curious if anyone else felt the same or if I‚Äôm just salty about Juliette forever.",

      "content_preview": "Sometimes our personal perspective is limited so I would appreciate some thoughts on the following story points that really distracted me after rewatching the show for the first time. There are plenty of really big picture qualms to have about the show but figured I'd keep this more specific. Black Claw and the Royals My biggest gripe and something I kept coming back to over and over throughout the later seasons is what happened to the biggest antagonists in the story??? Black Claw is a bit more understandable since they did try to explain the death of the organization with Portland being where they placed most of their chips but it still felt super half baked to build as much hype behind them as they did without a more satisfying end. Guessing they just fell victim to studio pressure (and the drying of the storytelling well) and had to wrap it up quicker? Black Claw was the perfect big picture antagonist but it all felt like a blip on the radar in the grander scheme of the show. The sudden disappearance of the royal family deserved far more explanation. Once the King got helicoptered, there is practically zero mention of them. Was his death that significant and destabilizing? Were they aligned with Black Claw and somewhat subsumed into the leadership hierarchy? Either way, I had forgotten that they are the big bad wolf for the first 4 seasons and then literally play zero part from thereon. 2. Renard Character Dev I'll keep this one short. Can anyone provide a better explanation for Renard's sudden 180? Was he really that power hungry to 180 on his principles and morals? If so, I didn't feel that in the way his character was developed. This is the guy who was effectively banished from his powerful family and seemed hellbent on dismantling wesen power structures. His mayoral arc cut against the strength of his character in my eyes after him becoming a favorite in the middle seasons. 3. Nick & Adalind Again, I'll keep this one short and ask for other thoughts. The start of the Nick & Adalind romance seems so forced from the start. Nick's initial mortification about having a kid with Adalind is so on point but then before you know it they're fairytale lovers.",

We just hear about it from Trubel when she shows up again. The show goes back to Wesen related murder investigations with Eve et al figuring out what the drawings on the cloth meant. The plot with the threat of the Zerst√∂rer was pretty much wrapped up in 2 episodes. I'm glad I watched it to the end this time, but it was a let down. I was surprised that they kept the staff. The 7 Grimm Knights thought it was too dangerous to be left intact, but Nick was okay with keeping it knowing what could happen if it fell into the wrong hands. Are we supposed to assume it no longer has the same power it had before even though they use it to hunt Wesen? Or perhaps it is because there was no longer a doomsday prophecy attached to it.",

      "content_preview": "So as the title says i just finished the show and I have so many things to say and didn‚Äôt know where to go lol. First of all before writing this I searched the sub a little bit and found out that the ending is not very like and that the final season was rushed. Despite all that I think I liked the ending for what it was. A happy ending, everyone‚Äôs alive, etc. Now I‚Äôll get to my other problems: first, the whole Juliette plot ever since she became a Hexenbeast. I know she became a Wesen, and not just any Wesen but the kind she hates the most, the one that almost ruined her life more than once. But there‚Äôs still absolutely no justification for her actions and the way she behaved to her friends. Maybe I missed something but the whole royals plot just disappearing after Meisner threw him from the helicopter makes no sense. The king died, suddenly there‚Äôs no resistance, there are no royals that try to find what happened to the king, Black Claw suddenly popping up. It just felt like a mess. And the worst part was Renard. I just didn‚Äôt buy that suddenly he‚Äôs interested in power and would evil after he himself tried to stop Black Claw. He never mentioned or was even slightly into the idea that Wesen should rule the world. And then after Black Claw were taken down he just goes back to normal? I didn‚Äôt like that at all. And I think the thing that is most significant in the show that I have a problem with is Nick and Adalind relationship. Even in the last episode when they kissed I was like ‚Äúthis is so hard to believe and weird to watch like it shouldn‚Äôt be). Overall I really really liked the show, my favorites were Monroe and Rosalee I just love them and I want me and my future gf/wife to have a relationship like theirs. That‚Äôs it I think I just had to share my thoughts and would like to know what everyone else thinks",

      "content_preview": "First time watching this show and the lengths the alley cat guy and his sheriff cousin go to to get the Unbezahlbar supposedly made of (very fragile for some reason) gold seem a little ridiculous considering it's smaller than a baseball.  Even a baseball sized chunk of pure gold, google says would be worth between $124k and $156k.  But this thing looked about the size of a slightly large strawberry, which if it were pure gold, I would think maybe $50k-75k at most.  I suppose the alley cat guy and the sheriff cousin just really wanted to get a slight head start on a down payment for another fancy cabin to rent out to vacationing couples?  They didn't mention any special use for it making it valuable to other monster folk, so all I can go off of is it being sold for its gold content.  Seems a bit extreme for someone who already owns at least two good houses worth I bet at least $600k in 2025 money.",

I was just waiting for the change up.  Now I'm sad. On to my next venture. It will be rewatched for sure.  I'm so glad I started watching it. On a whim, I might add.   Thanks all.

Does anyone remember what episodes have a character vomiting could someone make a list (also for episodes after s3) also add if the puke is actually visible, it happens of screen (so just audio)or is implied (like a bucket or toilet in front of their face or like turned around) (this is important because some versions trigger her less then others) Time stamps would be great if possible if anyone can help me with this id be incredibly thankful<3 (edited to add the line about time stamps because i forgot üòÖ)",
