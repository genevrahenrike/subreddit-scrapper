What is the difference in these two formats? I am getting frustrated because  I actually have a decent understanding of the material we are covering.

Ask classwork, homework, exam, and lab questions (including amateur labs) at Chemical Forums or r/chemhelp otherwise the post will be removed and you may be banned. So they reposted here. However, in less than 30 minutes the post had been removed from this subreddit as well. My question is why? This was their first interaction with this subreddit, and although they didn't have a specific question they clearly gave a topic and were asking for help. Rather than simply taking down the post, potentially putting the user off from ever asking for help again, why not provide some links to resources on the topic and ask them to give a specific question (with their work shown) in the future? Chemistry is hard and we make it harder when we take actions that discourage people from seeking help.",

So, it would be (597.8 * 10^-12) * 10^-3 = 587.8 * 10^-15, which I originally input as 5.878 * 10^-13, then input the answer as I got it from the equation; 587.8 * 10^-15. I then did the exact same things for ns, but as 10^-9 substituted for 10^-3. I asked for the answer and forfeited the point, but I kind-of feel cheated.

Unfortunately, it looks like the original manufacturer (Digilab) has been acquired by a company that was acquired and so on. Long story short I can't find a copy of Win-IR Pro anywhere. Does anyone know of either a place I could get a version of Win-IR Pro or if there is another software package that can interface with the Digilab Excalibur Series FTS 3500?

      "content_preview": "My chem teacher says that when adding significant figures, you get different answers depending on if it’s written in sci notation vs standard form. For example, on the question 1.30 10^4+6.5 10 2, she says the answer will have one decimal place because of the “.5” after 6.5. Therefore, the answer 1.3650 10 4 gets rounded to 1.4 10 4. First off, I don’t know how we can determine the decimals if the terms don’t have a common exponent. Then, she says if we leave it as standard form, the answer would simply be 13650 because it does not have a decimal to round to! Elementary math tells me to first get a common exponent to get 1.30 10^4+0.065 10 4=1.365*104 rounded to least decimal of hundredths into 1.37 10 4. Also, she says if the final answer does not have a decimal, don’t round, but I read online about significant place values. According to her, 5 10 3+1=501, not 500. Everyone seems to have a different idea on this. Is my teacher correct? Thanks!",

The NO2 group cannot use its strong mesomeric effect to stabilise the carboxylic acid, since it is a separate pi system that doesn’t conjugate well with itself and the ring. So pretty much all it does is stabilise the anion via the inductive effect. Heck it even forms a 6 member ring in the neutral acid, stabilising it, making protonation even harder. Besides that, it just seems like steric hindrance to me, so I do not understand how o-nitrobenzoic acid is more acidic than salicylic acid. Please help.",
