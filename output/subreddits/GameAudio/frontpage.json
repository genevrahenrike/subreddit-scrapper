      "content_preview": "Hello, Im working on my portfolio and got back into an old project in order to make some changes. Everything works pretty fine except that I don't have any sounds whatsoever, neither in Editor nor Builds. WWise is still referenced it seems, with events and all but I suspect the soundbanks to be missing. I have not been in charged at all of the sound aspect of the game so I don't know anything really about WWise. But I supposed I could try installing WWise and regenerate the soundbank myself. Thing is, I can't. It's not available on Audiokinetic website and when I searched up the forums some dude had the same request and somebody told him to use the contact form to ask them directly. And I did it contact them but I have not received an answer yet, and since Im kind of in a hurry I wondered if any of you had a link to Wwise archives files or something. The version Im looking for is the following: Based on Wwise SDK:     2019.2.7 Build 7402\nUnity Integration Bundle:  2019.2.7.1888 Thanks. EDIT: Audiokinetic answered my mail and told me: \"You should actually be able to use any 2019.2 version, and the soundbanks you generate will be compatible with 2019.2.7.  So 2019.2.15 should serve you well.\" Not really what I expected but I guess I will back up the project and try to make it work with the version is telling me and see if it works. If it doesn't I guess I will tell him it didn't work.",

Alongside this, I work as an electronic music producer, mainly focused on modular techno. I’m now looking to specialize further in game audio , ideally through university-level courses. I’ve seen a few options, like the HOFA online program and a one-year part-time university course in Ireland focused on audio for games. I’m also open to joining specific online classes from other universities as a guest student if that’s possible. My main questions are: Do you think these kinds of programs are worth it? Are there affordable options or specific courses you would recommend? Is it realistic to attend single subjects online (as a guest/auditor) to build knowledge without committing to a full program? I’d really appreciate advice on how to move forward and where to deepen my learning in this field. Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I'm currently working in the AA industry. I absolutely love the company I work for, but I'm starting to feel immense pressure with the time constraints I'm given. For instance, right now I'm given one day to create and impliment each main weapon of the game. We want AAA quality sound, but the continued pressure of constantly having to pump out things is putting me in a non-creative spot where I no longer feel I have the time to experiment or even explore ideas. This leads to me avoiding delving deep into the technical and meticulous sound design that I love and take pride in, instead taking shortcuts that impact the quality of my work. It's also worth mentioning that a lot of these tasks are ''we want it to be grounded and realistic, but we don't want it to sound like a normal gun, but also not like a scifi gun, something unique'' kind of thing. Meanwhile I see our 3D artists get a whole week to make a relatively simple 3D asset, but since I'm alone in filling the roles of both music production, sound design, Wwise implementation and blueprinting most of the audio in Unreal, I simply have to move fast to meet deadlines. I'd love to know how the norm is in terms of time and days for tasks. Any insights would be super helpful so I can better understand my position. Is it just a skill issue from my end? Thank you. Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys! You've definitely given me a lot of validation and good insight. I will take this with me and have a thorough conversation with my stakeholders about this. You guys are awesome!",

I currently accepted a volunteer role at an indie studio (exciting!) and am hopeful to learn a lot. I have a history of working with audio for film and designing audio for VR experiences, but have not worked in Unreal or Wwise before! The question that I have is that right now the studio is still working wit not a lot - assets are being created, the bones of the game are being put into place and they want to do a vertical slice of the game relatively soon, but I feel like there's not much for me to do right now and maybe I just got onboarded early? There's a lot of stuff that's new to me, like using GitHub and trying to understand what I need to see to work on audio, but it feels like I'm here way too early, and for the vertical slice they only want temp sounds. I wanted to hear the thoughts of you all and see if I could gain some insight. Right now I'm just going to try and focus on learning basic game dev stuff, Wwise workflow with Unreal and try to sink my teeth into whatever videos or resources I can find, and if you have any suggestions please let me know!!! I need them desperately, I feel. Thank you!",

I know I can link the initial delay property in the sounds to increase the time between each of them triggering, but would there be a way to decrease that time? Essentially the goal would be to play the sounds with a bit of overlap, so the next one triggers before the previous fully plays. I know I could just set the container to step and handle the variable time triggering in the game engine, I am just curious if there might be a way to do it directly in Wwise",

Is one of them strictly preferred or more sought out than the others? I'm not sure what the advantages are to choosing one program over another so I'm worried I'll pick the wrong one... or is it one of those cases where once you've learned one option, you've learned them all? Any advice is appreciated! I've just been having trouble finding answers on these different engines and their comparable pros/cons.

Does anyone with more knowledge of the game music business know how a licensing arrangement like that might come about and whether it's normal / legal?",

I agreed because I was assured that if I didn't know how to do something, I would have time to learn. Unfortunately, I was the only one who expressed a desire to try working with sound, and no one else among us had any experience in this field. So here I am, trying to master something that takes many people years to learn in a short period of time xD So far, I haven't been able to come up with anything better than learning the basics of music and asking more experienced people for advice (my experience is limited to piano lessons in elementary school). Can you help me understand what I should study? What should I do? How and where should I practice? Perhaps you can recommend some courses, guides, or tutorials on YouTube? I'll be grateful for anything. I tried to find solutions on this subreddit, but the ones I saw assumed that the person was studying/had studied something similar or had work experience.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! As the title says, I'm having issues building a game in Unity when using Wwise for sound implementation. Basically, when I launch the game, more than half of the sounds are missing. What’s strange is that it's not always the same sounds missing. For example, in one build, all the bossfight sounds were there, but in another build, they were completely gone. Has anyone experienced something similar when building a Unity project with Wwise? Here’s what ChatGPT suggested I check: Sounds not assigned to a SoundBank If an event, container, or audio file isn’t included in a SoundBank, it won’t be included in the build. SoundBanks not regenerated after changes If you add or modify events but don’t regenerate the SoundBanks, Unity won’t have access to the new audio. SoundBanks not copied to the Unity project SoundBanks need to be copied to the StreamingAssets folder in your Unity project after generation. Events not triggered correctly in Unity If sounds are in the project but don’t play at runtime, it might be a scripting or event-calling issue. Wwise not initialized properly in the scene If Wwise isn’t initialized, some or all sounds might not play. Platform mismatch The build target in Unity (e.g., Android, Windows, Mac) must match the platform used when generating SoundBanks in Wwise. Events are virtualized or marked as not playable Some sounds may get virtualized due to distance, priority settings, or instance limits. I’ve gone through everything multiple times—SoundBanks, individual events, platform settings, etc.—and everything seems in order. Does anyone have suggestions on what else I could try to fix this issue?",

However, I'm aware that it's not the best for game audio, efficiency-wise, and I know that Reaper is extremely powerful in this regard with all the scripts and expandability. I'm basically making this post to see if people have made the switch from Ableton to Reaper and found a lot of benefit from it? I genuinely am not sure how I could get used to working without Max4live. Max, and even a lot of the stock Ableton plug-ins inspire so much creativity from me. I know that I don't need to switch at the moment, but I'm curious of hearing peoples stories. If you switched, I'd love to hear from you! I'd also love to hear about any long time professionals using Ableton.",

I already have some samples that capture the vibe, but I’m looking for tools or techniques to get that authentic PS1-style sound using FL Studio . More specifically: Is there any free VST that emulates the PS1 SPU (Sound Processing Unit) ? Or alternatively, any known FL Studio setup or FX chain to simulate that compressed, low-bit, slightly distorted PS1 audio? Bonus if it works well for sample-based composition , since that's how a lot of early PS1 horror music was done. Any recommendations, tutorials, or personal tricks would be super appreciated. I'm mainly after that raw, nostalgic feel—something lo-fi, a bit unsettling, and authentically 90s. Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I’ve been working on audio for slot machine games for a little over a year, and I’d love to get some insights from people with more experience in game audio. I’m curious about a few things – mostly around how players perceive audio, loudness targets, and whether analytics can actually help us make better sound decisions. Do players really notice audio in slots? How much do players actually pay attention to the sound in these games? Does making certain elements louder (like win jingles) really enhance the feeling of reward and keep players more engaged? What types of sounds (arpeggios, chimes, etc.) tend to work best to engage players without irritating them? 2. Mobile platforms and quality Most of our players are on phones and tablets rather than desktop. In your experience, does a high-quality mix and master make a noticeable difference for mobile players? For win jingles, do rising melodies (ascending pitch) actually make wins feel more exciting? 3. Loudness levels (LUFS) My boss prefers -23 LUFS (broadcast standard), but from analyzing other slot games, most seem closer to -18 / -19 LUFS, and some even around -16 LUFS. For testing, I record 3–4 minutes of gameplay and measure Integrated LUFS. I know perceived loudness (how loud it feels) is ultimately more important than just LUFS numbers, but from what I understand, LUFS metering is still a key reference point. Does this sound like the right approach? And in your experience, do louder mixes actually help with player retention, or can that backfire when players switch between the game and platforms like YouTube/Spotify (-14 LUFS)? 4. Tracking how players use sound We’re considering tracking two anonymous metrics: •\thow many players mute the game audio, •\tand how long they keep sound on while playing. Has anyone here done this? Did it help you improve your mix decisions, sound design, or player engagement? I know it’s a bit of a double-edged sword (maybe I’ll discover nobody cares about sound – kidding 😅), but I’d love to hear how others have approached this and what insights it gave you. 5. Leveling up in sound design Can anyone recommend courses, tutorials, or resources specifically focused on creating audio for mobile or slot-style games? I currently work in Cubase and use the Komplete bundle, along with various UAD plugins and other tools for mixing, but I’d love to hear what other plugins, libraries, or workflows you think are essential for game sound design. 6. Beyond slots – other game genres (and cultural differences) How does this apply to other types of games – from simple arcade titles, to sports games (EA FC, NBA), racing games, and even shooters or larger action titles? Do most players actually notice the audio in these genres, or is it only a small percentage? Also, could cultural background play a role here? For example, do you think players in different regions (North America, South America, Europe, etc.) might react to certain sounds or music differently due to cultural influences? If you’ve worked across different markets and have seen differences in how players respond to audio, I’d love to hear about it. Analyzing how players respond to sound across different contexts fascinates me, so any insights would be incredibly valuable. Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences!",

I have a Switch Container in Wwise with different footstep types (e.g. “Dirt”, “Wood”), and I want the sound to change depending on what surface the player is walking on. In Unity, I’m doing a downward raycast from the player to detect what they’re standing on. I’m using tags on the ground objects (e.g. tagging dirt terrain as “Dirt” and wooden bridges as “Wood”) and switching the footstep sound accordingly like this: if (tag == \"Wood\") currentSurface = \"Wood\"; else if (tag == \"Dirt\") currentSurface = \"Dirt\"; else currentSurface = \"Dirt\"; // fallback AkSoundEngine.SetSwitch(\"FootstepsSwitch\", currentSurface, cam); AkSoundEngine.PostEvent(\"Play_Footstep\", cam); The sound plays, but it never changes — it always sounds like dirt, even when I’m clearly walking on a wooden bridge that’s tagged “Wood”. Things I’ve already done: Made sure the ground objects are correctly tagged. Added AkGameObj to the camera object (which is where the sound plays from). Verified the Wwise Switch Group is set up correctly and matches the names exactly (“Wood”, “Dirt”). What I’m not sure about: Should I tag the mesh directly, or use a separate invisible collider on top of the bridge and tag that? Is the hit.collider.tag the right way to detect the surface tag? Any tips on debugging what Wwise switch is currently active? Would really appreciate any guidance or examples. Let me know if you want to see my full script! Thanks!",

As it stands, they work fine without attenuation, but as soon as I enable it, the sounds its enabled on don't play at all in Unity (though they work just fine in Wwise, following the attenuation curves). I can see that they're being triggered in the profiler, and not only that, it shows the voice volume at the levels I would expect them to be playing at (which looks to not be factoring in any attenuation, I assume by design), but again, complete silence in Unity.  We have gotten some attenuation to work by writing a script to calculate the distance and feeding it into the RTPC, but the documentation I've found gives me the impression that shouldn't be necessary. We're running everything through a sound manager script, is it possible we're missing something (or have unwittingly added something) there that's preventing it the distance from being calculated? Edit to add I've only just noticed the in/out voice volume levels, which are different.  Also positioning is also not working, even when I manually adjust the panning, it doesn't change.",

      "content_preview": "Some context: I've 4+ years industry experience in game audio, covering composition, sound design, and audio engineering, with two commercial titles under my belt, several in development, and a bunch of game jams. I was recently asked to provide a price estimate for an hours worth of game music (roughly 16 tracks at 3 minutes, with 4 variations, and basic FMOD implementation, and some static 2 minute tracks) and I estimated it to be about $32k. They mentioned they received a quote from somebody else at $12k for 45 minutes (no variations or implementation) which struck me as being criminally low. Having said that, it did make me wonder if I'm charging too much. For reference, I charge a base of $75 AUD per hour, and quote based on how many hours a given track will take to complete. For the aforementioned tracks, I expect each to take about 24 hours totalling at $1800 per track. Am I charging too much, and if so, what would be reasonable for my level of experience? EDIT: Thanks for all your feedback! I greatly appreciate it. The 12k figure was provided by a casual employee working on documentary audio. 45 minutes of a singe, relatively homogenous track isn't the same as 15 individual 3 minute tracks for a game. Casual rates with a company will also always be lower than freelance rates. I also don’t believe this person asking for the quote is trying to undercut me as our conversation has been very amicable thus far. They're inexperienced in game-development contracting aren't familiar with how significantly the cost deviates depending on the medium and work-type.",

At the moment it has literally 1 song for the whole game, and 3 sound effects, so I'm starting to look into both free resources and to pay somebody for custom work. Just by playing around I found that I have several questions, so some guidance would be very helpful: - Some of the free/paid tracks I've seen that would be fitting for different scenarios are too long, so I'd need to \"cut/edit\" them a bit. Do you recommend any sort of software for this? Ideally free and as simple as possible. - Any specific format I should be looking at? For a mobile game game specifically, iOS does not support .ogg out of the box so I've just been playing with random mp3 and wav - For now I will be normalizing volume programmatically, but perhaps this can be done as well with that editing software. Sounds adequate? I do not even know the terminology :D - Any size optimization trick? I'd like the build to be as lightweight as possible, but these are heavy. Thanks!",

I tried google sound effect maker and it just gets filled with AI generators (anti ai personally). What individual tool or workspace should I focus my efforts on that is user friendly outside of Audacity? I know there are probably a lot of newbie posts so if this gets nuked I understand, the wiki is helpful and all but overwhelming for me so like any suggestions would be really helpful.
