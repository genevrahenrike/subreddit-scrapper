      "content_preview": "I clickbaited you, didn't I? And yet, I stand by it. I've personally seen at multiple residency programs how residents are pushed aside for learning opportunities in favor of midlevels and midlevel students. If residents at these programs do get learning opportunities, it's only because the opportunities arise during nights and weekends - when the midlevels and midlevel students aren't working. Some programs do take this seriously. But others are content to blame the resident and carry on with business as usual. \"You should report to the ACGME!\" I know people who did, and got forced out of their programs. Of course, the program will contrive any number of reasons to justify their ire, none of which will be the real reason. And yet, what is a person to do? If you sue the program, what other residency program will want to take you on? And how is a non-medically literate judge going to discern that the program targeted you for nefarious reasons? And even then, I've personally seen how little the ACGME actually does once they get involved. Their goal is to just keep collecting the checks. Last I heard they actually were planning on nixing regularly scheduled 10 year site visits, and only doing visits if they received complaints/bad survey results. Even then, a site visit is only useful if residents know they can speak openly without fear of reprisal. Most people at toxic programs are not going to risk that, so in effect you have a huge swath of residency programs that are completely unpoliced. Many people argue that residency is what differentiates us from midlevels. But what even is the point of having a residency system with so little oversight? I almost feel like we need a Flexner Report for residencies.",

I’ve done 4 years undergrad + 4 years pharmacy school + 2 years of residency in my specialty area. Plus an additional 4 years of practice. I’ve published research in my specialty area. I am an adjunct professor in my specialty area. And I work with a team of APPs who test my patience every day. I know you’re the PrOvIdEr for this patient but that doesn’t mean you know what you’re doing. You’re not an expert on dosing. You’re not an expert on treatment guidelines. When you repeat what you’ve heard me or the attending say like “the data’s not good for that” you sound like a 10 year old who wants to be a part of the adult conversation. What data? What data have you read regarding this issue? Quite frankly it’s an insult to my training when you say “we don’t really do that in _____ patients in my experience” because you have worked at 1 center for a year and read a guideline that I wrote. You are not on the same level as the attending physician because your badge says provider. And you don’t know more than someone who’s “just a pharmacist” because the state gave you a license to prescribe. Downvote me if you want I know I’m not a physician. Just had to get it off my chest.",

      "content_preview": "I have a sister who is a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, she recently graduated from DNP school and our family took her out. She wore her white coat as it was directly after her graduation. The waitress asked her what the coat was for and my sister responded with “I’m a Pediatrician”. I understand people sometimes mix up words but pediatrician sounds completely different from pediatric nurse practitioner, those aren’t two words that you just mix up on accident. So I said “You aren’t a doctor” then I laughed afterwards. “Yes I am a doctor, a doctor of nursing” all I did was laugh when she said this and she laughed too. After dinner when I got home my sister texts me “You know it’s very disrespectful how you confronted me at dinner tonight “ “I just don’t like how you lied about your career why can’t you be proud of yourself “ Then she says “You’re not even a real doctor, I am proud of myself Pediatrician is just easier to say and it’s basically the same thing “. After she said that I just let her have the argument because first of all being a pediatrician is not close to being a pediatric NP. I’m a General Practice Dental resident currently and the pediatric residents I know are presenting independent research projects, treating the most medically complex patients, and taking difficult science courses all while making difficult life changing decisions. These are all things I know for a fact no pediatric nurse practitioner student has done. It’s also incredibly more difficult to become a pediatrician than any kind of nurse practitioner, I find the fact she lied disrespectful. Along with that saying that a dentist isn’t a real doctor is outrageous considering it’s probably more difficult to become a dentist than a NP. Along with that I’m sure my sister would be quick to go see a dentist as soon as she has tooth or jaw pain. Even though it was a stupid small lie I still don’t regret confronting her at all, just want to see other people’s opinion.",

Meanwhile, CRNAs swarm posts and comments that so much as question their ability to practice independently and vote-brigade them into oblivion. But if you go on r/CRNA or r/SRNA , Mickey Mouse and his crew have no problem trashing physicians and acting like egotistical narcissists. What I don’t understand is why so many physicians live in this delusional bubble where they think if they just play nice, they’ll somehow be immune from the political currents shaping our profession. How the hell can a field full of intelligent, driven, capable people be so pathetically flaccid when it comes to standing up for our own interests--and by extension, the best interests of patients? I get it, political advocacy is boring. But fucking hell, it is absolutely critical to the practice of medicine whether we like it or not. Midlevels figured that out a long time ago, and they’ve been winning that battle ever since. Meanwhile the AMA, ASA, and the rest sit around with their thumbs up their asses, pretending everything is status quo and will work itself out if we just show “professional courtesy.” Well I’m here to say unequivocally: FUCK that cowardly, milquetoast bullshit approach. The cat is already out of the bag, but something needs to happen before this gets even worse. And yes, this shit pisses me off. Obviously.",

I believe that was before the degree mills began. She told me how she had to see the APRN at her PCPs office because the doctor had no availability. She went in for extreme neck pain. She bays the APRN told her to DO YOGA. She then made an appointment with her orthopedic doctor  because she’s had two hip replacements and a shoulder as well. The doc did an X-ray and she was told she has SEVERE osteoarthritis in her neck. Her vertebral discs are basically gone, she’s pretty much bone on bone. I worked as an RN on an orthopedic surgery floor for several years before becoming an APRN and my advice to her was to avoid neck surgery or any back surgery because from what I saw many times surgery just made things worse. So she got sent to PT and  she says it has helped her greatly. I am appalled at the APRN’s advice to her. I had to explain to my mom about the current state of NP degree mills. She said she cannot believe the experience she had. It’s disgusting what the profession has become. I’ve been out of the field for many years. But what bullshit.",

She is a wonderful charge nurse, an incredible person and genuinely recognizes that nurses should be nurses and providers. I genuinely look up to her. Because her nursing knowledge, bedside manner with patients is incredible. At the same time, if she were to be an NP, I think it is a bad idea. She is excellent at her job as a nurse. it just makes me realize that administration of medicine is what they are taught, not what the medicine is used for or how it works. But if you ask even a second year med student, they would know what octreotide is used for. Anyways, just another example of nursing experience is not enough to be an NP.",

      "content_preview": "I’m a first year family medicine resident. I just finished my first OBGYN block, so I spent a lot of time with the L&D nurses. I had to explain to them multiple times how residency works. “So you’re going to be an OB?” “No, I’m going to be a family doctor, but we do training in OB because a lot of family doctors do women’s health, and some do prenatal care and deliveries, especially in rural areas.” “So you’re not a doctor yet?” “I am, I finished medical school [literally says PHYSICIAN on my badge and coat btw], now I’m doing training in my specialty.” The thing is, they work with residents frequently. We’re an unopposed program so they don’t have OB residents over there all the time, but someone from our program is with them over half the year. Then we had a patient who is a PA, and one of them said (not in front of the patient), “Well isn’t a physician assistant basically a doctor?” And I said, “No, it’s a master’s degree, they typically function in similar roles as NPs” And another was like “Yeah so almost a doctor.” Another one thought that CRNAs go to medical school (I wasn’t part of that discussion, just overheard it, which to the CRNA’s credit he made a point to clarify that he did not go to medical school and is not a doctor). I just…I don’t understand how you work in healthcare and don’t understand how any of this works. I’ve never been a nurse, but I’m at least familiar with the different training pathways, LPN vs RN, the fact that you can get an RN via an associate’s or a bachelor’s degree program, the different types of MSN/DNP/PhD programs. I know how PA school works. I know what CRNAs and AAs do and how those training pathways differ. Even other positions in the hospital - rad techs, ultrasound, RTs, etc - I have a general idea of their level of education. It kind of bothers me that they were so uninformed. They weren’t rude to me, really nice actually, just seemed kind of clueless about other people’s roles and training in a way that baffles me. They were all smart and good at their jobs, so it’s not like they’re dumb people, just…incurious, I guess, in a way that I don’t get. You’re working with these people every day in high-acuity situations. Wouldn’t you want to know if/how they’re qualified? And if the nurses are this uninformed, no wonder a lot of the general public has no idea what’s going on.",

I am a young adult with leukemia, and I went through a few oncologists before settling on my primary, who I adore and inherently trust. She’s at a top tier hospital so you can imagine her caseload. I saw her at every visit in the beginning, but after the acute stage she passes off patients to her NP. Clinically, I find the NP to be arrogant and dismissive of my symptoms. I can tell when the clinic’s nurses are giving me instructions that came from the NP vs. those that came from my doctor, because the NP’s usually don’t make sense and I don’t agree with them. I also do not see my oncologist for fairly regular check-ups, I always see the NP, unless I explicitly ask for my doctor. I am not interested in receiving my oncologic care from an NP. If I trusted her, it might be different, but I find her recommendations and approach so different from my oncologist’s that it makes me wonder whether she consults my doctor. Do I find a new doctor if every time I communicate with the clinic I need to make sure treatment plans come from my Physician? Thanks.",

      "content_preview": "PA programs are shorter than MD/ DO school + residency. NPs train differently. But we all know this and that’s not the real debate. What matters is this: what’s best for patient outcomes, access, and system survival? The truth is shocking (especially to med school students and MDs operating at the bottom of their licenses) Malpractice and safety From 2005–2014, MDs faced between 11.2 and 19 malpractice claims per 1,000. PAs had between 1.4 and 2.4 per 1,000. And when payouts occur, MDs pay 1.3 to 2.3 times more on average. This is almost 10 year old data, but it should still give pause. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27457425/ A broader look at ~70,000 claims between 2012–2021 finds no difference in overall risk whether provider is MD, PA, or NP. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40456051/ Even Harvard’s data finds claim rates for APPs stayed stable or declined as their numbers grew. https://www.rmf.harvard.edu/Podcasts/2023/APP-Benchmark-Sea-Change Bottom line: If PAs/ NPs were truly unsafe, we’d see it in the data, but we don’t. 2. Quality, cost, satisfaction Meta-analyses show PAs often match or even surpass physician care quality in primary care. Integrated systems like VA and Kaiser routinely deliver comparable outcomes at lower cost when PAs are on the team. In inpatient/ICU settings, PA-led teams equal MD-only teams, and often shorten hospital stays. Patient satisfaction? Comparable or higher—especially on listening and education. 3. The looming physician shortage By 2034, the U.S. faces a projected shortage of 17,800 to 48,000 primary care physicians—and as many as 124,000 total doctors. https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/aamc-report-reinforces-mounting-physician-shortage https://www.aamc.org/news/aging-patients-and-doctors-drive-nation-s-physician-shortage Without PAs and NPs, access collapses. They are not replacing doctors, they’re amplifying them. 4. Not a turf war, a partnership Let’s stop pretending the fight is about midlevels vs MD/DO’s. The real fight is against system collapse—profit-driven erosion of care, hospital deserts, insurance hurdles. Together, MDs/DOs and PAs/NPs can hold the line. PAs and NPs expand access, reduce burnout, preserve quality. This is reality. Should probably lean on midlevels rather than cut them down. ⸻ If you choose to be sick, poor, or uninsured—still waiting six months for an appointment—because you believe calling PAs “assistants” and NPs “unqualified” somehow preserves medicine… fine. But for everyone else there’s a choice. In the end of the day it’s about patients. And they get better with capable hands—PA/NP or MD—making decisions, diagnosing, caring as a team. The evidence is clear: integrated, team-based care wins. Period. And I refuse to elaborate any further.",

      "content_preview": "I had never even known there was such distaste for NPs until seeing this Reddit thread. I’m kind of struggling with seeing all of this hatred. Currently in NP school. I’ve been a nurse since 2014 and this was always my goal, but I’m taking the slower route because I’m a single mother. If I could have, I would have LOVED to become an MD. Absolutely wish I could have and honestly, I researched if there were ways for nurses to go to any type of med school with credit for previous schooling, and I would have entertained it, but alas there is not. But I absolutely had the cards stacked against me. I’ve been a mom since I was 18, no help, and I absolutely can not go to medical school knowing how that would put my little family in a bind if I were to try. I just absolutely can not. I’m so passionate for the healthcare field and caring for patients. I have no desire to be called a “Dr” (even if I do get my DNP) nor will I ever represent myself as such outside of an academic facility if I do obtain that one day. As of now, I’m just pursuing my masters and still unsure on my doctorate. I undoubtedly know I will never have the medical training as a physician and truly will appreciate the fact that I’m in a state where MD collaboration is required (Tennessee). I just want to help alleviate the strain on patients that it takes to be seen for care. I truly have my heart in the right place and want to HELP. Not just push medicine without truly understanding what I’m doing or without doing research.  I struggle with this thread because it makes it seem like there is zero space for NPs, and I can see that for the NPs who believe they are equal and know it all and aren’t capable of harm,  but what about those of us who know and accept our place, actually want to help, and know that MD collaboration is the best practice for safest outcomes? I have always, and will always be, humble enough to admit when I need to research something or ask for help. Will I be faced with this backlash once I am officially licensed and searching for a job? Do any of you physicians on this thread actually like and appreciate NPs at all?",

I see a central line that’s clotted, site is clearly infected (site is red, green/yellow exudate), patient is tachycardic and hypotensive (afebrile, at least now) and neutropenic. Then I have an NP that comes in and tells me it’s fine, and I say no, that is not okay - listen to me.

I know you all probably see posts requesting medical advice but I’m questioning her judgement, not seeking a diagnosis. So I went to my doctor’s NP because he was booked until next week and I was certain I had a UTI.  I didn’t want to go to urgent care because of the high copay and I’d rather just go to my PCP just because.  It was painful to urinate and I couldn’t empty my bladder. The NP prescribed Macrobid 100MG caps 1 bid for 5 days qty 5 10 at the appointment pending test results.  She said to stop the medication if the labs showed I didn’t have a UTI.  I saw the test results online before she did. Test results: LEUKOCYTE ESTERASE, URINE Value 1+ (25 Leu/mcl) Abnormal Bacteria Value Abnormal (I can attach an Imgur link of the results or DM them to those who asks ask if you need a bigger picture of the other values listed on the results.) She told me that the culture did not show an infection and that the bacteria present was normal. MDs/DOs, is this true? I thought you weren’t supposed to have bacteria in your urine but again, I’m not a doctor. Edit: forgot to include I’m F 37.  I have had UTIs in the past.",

      "content_preview": "Guys, I just had a lunch date with my wife. She is a family medicine MD and has a lot of patients on Zepbound and Mounjaro. She told me this story over our lunch... She had a visiting patient come see her today because her normal Nurse Practitioner was on vacation. It was for an IUD replacement. After that was taken care of, my wife said to her: \"Can I ask a question? I see on your history that last October you had an appointment here for weight loss, but I also notice that your weight is about the same as it was then. Can I ask about what's going on?\" The patient, who has a BMI of 50, said that her insurance denied her request for Zepbound because they don't cover it for obesity, and she has just struggled, mentally, emotionally, and physically, to lose weight. My wife then said, \"Ok, that's fairly common to be denied just for obesity, unfortunately. But I don't see any follow up tests here.\" Patient: \"What do you mean?\" Wife: \"Do you know why you were not tested for type 2 diabetes? Or sleep apnea? Or fatty liver? Or cardiovascular risk or heart disease? High cholesterol? Insulin resistance? These are all factors for which some insurance companies will cover these drugs. But the weight loss drug aside, with your BMI it is statistically highly likely that you have some of these, and you need to know.” Patient: \"I wasn't told ANY of that.\" Wife: \"Do you mind if we run some tests and check for these? Some are simple blood and urine test. The sleep apnea will be more involved, but I can put in an order for it to get the process started.\" Patient: \"I am having HUGE mixed feelings right now. WHY didn't my nurse practitioner do all of this for me? I'm really mad about that! But also, YES! Do the tests!\" Wife: \"I can't say why she didn't. But we can still move forward from here. I think you should also be seeing our dietitian, and maybe even a mental health councilor if you feel that you're mentally struggling with your weight. I can also put in a request for both to get those started too.\" At the end of the appointment, the patient started to cry, and she gave my wife a huge hug and said, \"I want you to be my doctor. THANK YOU for caring.”",

The proposed bylaws change is reportedly the result of the departure of anesthesiologists from the facility over recent months. In lieu of promoting the hiring of new anesthesiologists at the facility or utilizing existing VA staffing programs, the facility leadership appears intent upon changing the anesthesia practice model despite patient safety concerns from staff. When: Vote will occur on August 14, 2025, internally among Minneapolis VA Medical Staff; closed to the public and media. What you can do: Call Minneapolis VA leadership to let them know the importance of physician led care and urge them to cancel the vote. Minneapolis VA leadership Director: Patrick Kelly, phone 612-725-2101 Chief of Staff: Michael Armstrong, MD, phone 612-467–2105 Nurse Executive: Teresa Tungseth, DNP, phone 612-467-2103 Associate Director: Sue Rucker, LICSW, phone 612-467-4194 Associate Director: * Amy Archer, MSW, LICSW, phone 612-629-7377",

      "content_preview": "The scope creep from CRNAs is getting out of control. One of the clearest examples? The University of Michigan now allows CRNAs to run cardiac anesthesia. Cardiac anesthesia is one of the most complex and high-risk areas in medicine—these cases demand fellowship-trained anesthesiologists, not nurses with limited training. CRNAs are not doctors. They don’t go to medical school. They don’t complete residency. They don’t manage the full complexity of perioperative medicine. Their clinical hours in a nursing program are not a medical residency, and calling themselves “residents” is misleading at best and dishonest at worst. This isn’t “team-based care.” It’s cost-cutting by hospitals, replacing anesthesiologists with cheaper labor at the expense of safety. We’ve already seen facilities collapse when anesthesiologists were pushed out—like in California—where patient care suffered as a direct result. Hard lines need to be drawn: •\tStop misusing titles like anesthesiologist or resident. •\tNo CRNA-led cardiac, thoracic, or other high-stakes cases. •\tPush back against institutions that cut corners and put patients at risk. Watching nurses try to blur lines and step into physician roles is infuriating. Patients deserve anesthesiologist led care. PERIOD",

I figured we can do something on those lines again rather than make a bunch of posts. Here are some blunders: NP put a patient with IPF on amiodarone Surgery PA walks into patient room and announces she is with surgery as though she is the surgeon. No introducing herself a PA working with the surgeon. She is also the PA who wears a knee length white coat longer than the attending. I personally hate her. Edit: Someone anonymously wants this posted: NP gave a pt IV epi for an allergic reaction. Now the patient is on a pacemaker. Don’t know why the patient didn’t sue.",

One good video was called \"the fake doctor epidemic.\" I believe at the time the creator admitted to being a resident and keeping anonymity due to risk of repercussions. Whatever did happen, I suspect the creator or someone who knows them is on this thread somewhere. I really want a channel like that to get going again. The animated and relatively shorter videos are what is needed for younger generations to keep watching. I would love to know what happened and hopefully help get a channel like that going again! (Or if you at least remember this channel/ these videos help convince me I am remembering correctly and am not crazy!)",

      "content_preview": "I am a third year medical student. I am rotating IM right now. There is this ID doctor who is training an APRN in her late 20s. When we asked him if he can take medical students, straight up said no. So he can train midlevels but not hard working medical students. This is why I think doctors are the real culprits of this midlevel situation especially the older doctors who only care about making the most money over the future of medicine. Edit: let me clarify something. This doctor mocks medical students who are on rotation with other doctors. He thinks his NP is extremely smart and knows more than some IM doctors. Our school had requested this doctor to be an ID preceptor since we currently only have one other ID doctor. He blandly refused because he doesn’t make enough money training students. The school offered more money and he declined which is his choice. But then to train the NP for free and pretend like she is better than medical students and residents is plain disrespectful to the profession. she knows more than medical students but here’s the thing - med students have 7-11 years of training left before they get to the practice scope that she will have in the next 3 months. So with all due respect , this guy is a scum. I said often older doctors because I have seen other doctors who employ NPPs make the same comments. Yes, young doctors hate them but as med students and residents we have no power to speak up or we risk getting kicked out.",

      "content_preview": "I'm prepping for my clinic later this week and it dawns on me, the PA and NPs in the local FM clinics are wasting everyone's time and money. I either get advanced imaging on people who absolutely do not need it. Often without any documenting on why it's needed, or how it'll be used -- (it's always \"please tell patient I've referred out to the MD to go over the MRI I ordered.\") OR 2) No HPI, exam, imaging, etc. Refer out. Either way, they're wasting the patient's time and money since they aren't triaging these issues, they aren't working them up appropriately, and aren't even fulfilling the function of \"reporter\" to the team they are referring to. At what point can we have an AI Redbox type thing take the HPI and then refer out? Take out the middle person that writes \"right elbow pain, refer to ortho\"? I feel this level of laziness could be passed to a computer. Beyond annoyed with the level of incompetence churning out of these degree mills. Edit: swipe text errors",
