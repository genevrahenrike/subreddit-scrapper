I know basic petrology and economic geology. Now im doing my msc in geology in a uni in canada, but the topic is still geophyisics/signal processing. I think geos/mining eng has more stable job than geoph",

      "content_preview": "Hi folks, I’ve been thinking about this topic for a while and would like to hear your perspective. These are my thoughts: China has secured, over the last four decades, the whole supply chain for most metals (from mining to processing) focusing on being strategic rather than solely on commercial/economic perspectives. In the 2000s this was not much of a problem, as China was still focused on low-value industries and thus exported many of these metals to Western economies. However, with China’s rise as a global geopolitical competitor even in high-value products (still behind but catching up), its commercial balance has shifted from exporting to importing. This has become a huge problem for Western economies, especially given that since 2022 China has been banning metals associated with the defense industry. Our companies are facing shortages of supply for many metals, and we lack both the access and the tools to obtain them. We can no longer rely on the free market to access metals like Bi, REE, Co, Ni, etc., because China has been strategic in owning the whole chain. Leaving the industry unprotected is not the solution, as Chinese companies flood the market and then buy properties (as happened in Canada with tungsten). We instead need partnerships between academia, government, and industry to build and grow operations: academia to develop the workforce and the R&D, government to provide financing and fiscal advantages for mining; and industry to invest and operate. However, governments seem more focused on over-regulating and winning elections rather than securing the metals needed to feed industry, while geology departments in schools and universities disaperar and the industry is just trying to earn a profit in this chaos. And let’s not overlook processing, which I consider the real bottleneck of the mining industry. There we lack the machines, the knowledge, and the people + environmental regulations do not really allow at all to use all those toxic chemicals.",

      "content_preview": "Posted some resource extraction developments yesterday which got some upvotes...so wanted to follow up with more from today. Here are movements I'm tracking from non-mainstream news sources about Canadian mining companies focused on resource extraction from the last 24 hours. All original sources below. Cheers! Teck Resources has sanctioned its $2.4 billion Highland Valley copper expansion project in British Columbia, with construction expected to commence this month 4 . This expansion is part of B.C.'s fast-tracking legislation, Bill 15, which has designated 18 projects, including the Highland Valley copper mine expansion. Construction activities at Taseko's Florence Copper project are progressing on schedule, with the project over 90% complete as of the end of June 2025, and first copper cathode production expected before the end of the year 5 . The project has incurred US$239 million in construction costs over the last 18 months, and with 90% of total expected construction costs now incurred, spending is expected to decline as construction activities wind down. Imperial Oil Ltd. has officially commenced production at its renewable diesel production complex at the Strathcona refinery near Edmonton, Alberta, which is expected to reach a full capacity of 20,000 barrels per day, becoming the largest of its kind in Canada 6 . The complex, which began operations in July 2025, is already supplying renewable diesel to customers in western Canada and Imperial’s operations in northern Alberta as of August 5, 2025. LNG Canada successfully completed its first cargo shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on June 30, marking a significant milestone for the project. This achievement underscores the operational capacity of the LNG Canada facility, which is expected to fill an estimated 170 ships annually for export, positioning Canada as a key player in the global LNG market 7 8 . Canadian Natural Resources, Canada's second-largest gas producer, has scaled back its gas-weighted drilling activities in anticipation of higher prices following the commencement of shipments from the Shell-led LNG Canada terminal at Kitimat, British Columbia. The first cargoes from this terminal have been shipped to Japan and South Korea, but industry observers expect that it will take some time for significant price recovery to occur 9 . LNG Canada is considering a second phase expansion of its facility, following the successful commencement of operations in its initial phase. The consortium, which includes Shell, Petronas, Korea Gas, Mitsubishi, and PetroChina, is in discussions about the potential expansion, which would double production capacity and has already been approved by the B.C. government, pending a final investment decision 10 11 . SSR Mining Inc shares surged by as much as 17% following the announcement of a substantial net income of $80.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, a significant increase from $2.46 million in the same quarter of the previous year 12 . This impressive financial performance contributed to SSR Mining Inc. hitting a new 52-week high of $20.78, with the stock rising 16.1% on a trading volume of 460,031 shares 13 . In June 2025, Taseko Mines, the Tŝilhqot’in Nation, and the Province of BC reached the Teẑtan Biny Agreement, which concluded litigation and established a framework for the potential future development of the New Prosperity project, accompanied by a $75 million payment from the Province of BC 14 . This agreement includes Taseko retaining a 77.5% interest in the project, while contributing a 22.5% equity interest to a trust for the Tŝilhqot’in Nation, which will gain full ownership if it consents to future mineral development. Denison Mines' stock surged by 9.3% to $3.07 per share following the provincial environmental assessment approval for its Wheeler River uranium project in Saskatchewan 15 . This approval marks a significant milestone for Denison, as it advances the project towards becoming Canada's first in-situ recovery uranium mine, allowing the company to proceed with final federal regulatory steps later this year, which positively influenced investor sentiment. Suncor Energy Inc. plans to expand its autonomous truck fleet to 150 or more by the end of 2025, up from 20 trucks in operation in the spring of 2024, as part of its strategy to cut costs and improve safety in its oilsands operations in Calgary, Canada 16 . This expansion is expected to enhance productivity and safety while potentially eliminating jobs, although Suncor has committed to minimizing the impact on workers by offering retraining opportunities. Suncor Energy has revised its capital expenditure forecast for 2025, lowering it to a range of $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion from the previous estimate of $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion 17 18 . This adjustment reflects Suncor's strategic focus on capital discipline and strong execution performance. First Quantum Minerals has secured a US$1 billion cash infusion through a gold streaming agreement with Royal Gold, aimed at supporting its Zambian operations and linked to future gold deliveries tied to copper output at its Kansanshi mine 20 . This agreement provides First Quantum with long-term, unsecured capital that does not increase its debt load and is expected to materially lower its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, while allowing the company to maintain exposure to the majority of its gold production. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (T.AEM) reached a new 52-week high of $185.65 on August 6, 2025, showcasing its robust performance in the mining sector 21 . This achievement aligns with Agnico Eagle's recent financial results, which included record adjusted net income and free cash flow, as well as significant gold production, indicating strong operational success and investor confidence 22 .",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys, I think I already posted about this settlement, but since I found an update today I decided to share it again with you all. The court approved the settlement the agreement between Compass Minerals and its investors over the issues with its fire retardants last year. And set the claiming deadline in a month or so: October 7. So here's some details I found about the agreement: Who is eligible? All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Compass Minerals International, Inc. common stock between February 8, 2023, and March 22, 2024, inclusive, and were damaged thereby. Do you have to sell securities to be eligible? No, if you have purchased securities within the class period, you are eligible to participate. You can participate in the settlement and retain (or sell) your securities. How much can you recover? The final payout amount depends on your specific trades and the number of investors participating in the settlement. If 100% of investors file their claims - the average payout will be $0.39 per share. Although typically only 25% of investors file claims, in this case, the average recovery will be $1.56 per share. How long will it take to receive your payout? The entire process usually takes 4 to 9 months after the claim deadline. But the exact timing depends on the court and settlement administration. So, if you were hit by this you can check more details and file a claim here or through the setllement admin. Hope it helps!",

I’m interested in areas like environmental management or HSE (SSOMA), but I don’t know how to start or what positions to look for. Also, there’s little industry in Peru, so manufacturing/smelting doesn’t pay much. I’d love advice on career paths with good demand and growth. Thanks",

I should’ve gone & been a sparky when I turned 18, but I didn’t and here I am - no use complaining about it. I’m simply looking for a way in, so that I can build a better career & life for myself and family. I’ve got a drivers license, as well as my forklift license. Outside of that - I’m an office worker but I’m happy to make the shift to work with my hands if that’s what affords me the chance to make some serious money. Does anyone have any advice, positions to look out for, etc?

If I close my eyes, I can hear my grandfather speaking: \"Aussie mining veteran Gerry Noonan went viral with his expletive-heavy response to a question on electrification in mining operations. \"We have coal, because we have the biggest coal deposits in the world, but we're not allowed to burn the f***ing stuff, so the world's rooted, really.\" He went on to say, “It’s alright to be idealistic, but you have to be realistic. And until the lights go out, the idiots that want to be green on everything and not do mining and not do coal, not do anything, they’re going to have to go back and use candles and live in tents.” The viral interview was shared by Travis Ricciardo, a co-host of the Money of Mine podcast, which then elicited a response from Elon Musk, \"If he looks up, he will see something called 'The Sun'.

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I’ve just graduated in Mining and Mineral Processing Engineering, and during my final year I built a low-cost automated mine dewatering system prototype. Problem: Water buildup in mines slows operations and raises safety risks. Existing dewatering systems are often expensive, energy-intensive, and not easily scalable for small to mid-size operations. My Prototype: Built on a budget of ~80 USD Uses Arduino-based automation for pump control Focused on efficient water removal only (no filtration stage) Designed to be scalable and adaptable for larger setups Now that I’ve completed the project and graduated, I’m looking for insights: From an engineering perspective, what improvements would you suggest (energy efficiency, automation, materials)? Are there better control systems I could explore beyond Arduino? How can I best present or build on this project for industry adoption, research, or even entrepreneurship? Would really value any feedback or resources. Thanks!",

Set in either California/Arizona during 1972-1973 - My character finds that gold still exists in an abandoned mine in a rock basin in a desert. -He decides to buy the site and secretly mine the gold (as I'm guessing a Gold mining licence or similar is expensive and he would come under scrutiny and taxes when he sells the gold). - Over almost a year ('72-'73), he and his men secretly mine the gold, separate the gold from the rock, smelt it into bars and store it to sell later in one go, they make cornflake gold or small ingots to pay his men during this period. The small 'gold town' he's created are all equally corrupt as they are promised a small cut of the final sale for their loyalty. - The whole site is isolated and protected by an armed perimeter gate preventing access to public - I've read that Gold Ownership (not incl jewellery, etc) was illegal until 1974 in the US. Questions: Is it correct that to own a Gold Mine would require special licences, huge cost and also high taxation of the Gold making it tempting to do it all illegally? Is it plausible that a tiny, isolated mine could be mined secretly by corrupt people? How could they sell the Gold Bars without drawing the attention of the Law? What kind of equipment would they need to extract and process the Gold in that period? Pick axes? Jack Hammers? Dynamite? Jaw/Hammer crushers? Spiral classifier? Ball Mill? Centrifugal isolator? Shaking table? Smelting furnace? Gold Bar molds? Many thanks",

      "content_preview": "I posted a while ago about working at an iron ore mine in Labrador City, Labrador. My employment has been finalized but the company has changed their mind about a couple of things, especially when it comes to accomodations. In the correspondence with the HR department I was told I would be provided housing for 3 months and after that I could live there on a month to month basis until I found permanent housing. Today I received an email stating that the housing situation has changed and that I don't have any guarantee after 90 days. I've looked at rental listings and even called a few companies there but it's just been absolutely disappointing. Full 3 bedroom houses are being rented there currently for $3500-$4000/month, not including utilities. A room in a shared house with strangers is $1000/month. There's no rental vacancy and no properties for sale that would be in my budget range. I also asked about career progression and if I could get introduced to the automation part of the mine, but apparently that's not in the job scope, so I guess I'll just be a generic maintenance electrician. It's a kick in the face to be honest. I thought I was going for something life changing and progressive, because I really don't want to be doing physical labor when I'm 60 (41 now). It seems like even though the job itself wasn't competitive and the location so remote and isolating, they won't assist any further with finding an apartment or other assistance. I guess they would be perfectly fine with me sleeping in my car when it's -40C over the winter. I spent a lot of time preparing for this position and getting ready to relocate, now there's just too much uncertainty, housing being the most crucial. My unemployment assistance ends in December and at that point in time I'll be completely broke. I've applied for other FIFO roles across the country and haven't received a reply back from any. I currently live in Newfoundland where the chances of work locally are very slim. I thought about going back to school as being an electrician doesn't provide as many opportunities as an engineering technologist for example. I just needed to vent/rant as this devastates my mood today.",

How can I get back into the industry? I never really worked a mine engineering internship while I was in school, so I feel like that's holding me back. I feel that my degree qualifies me for mine engineering roles but the lack of experience is holding me back. Thus, I'm open to taking a different role to get my foot in the door and work from there. It seems that no matter what I apply for, I get ghosted. Does anyone have advice on what I have a chance to get hired in? I'm totally fine to relocate as that no longer bothers me at all. Thanks for any responses. :)",

I’m just curious as to how you get into the industry, what licenses I would need, if I would need a citizenship in another country (I’m a US citizen), and what’s the best approach to it over all. Any advice would be appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I’m a recent graduate in Mining and Energy Resources Engineering from Portugal and I’ve just arrived in Australia on a Work and Holiday Visa. I decided to take a gap year before starting my Master’s to gain practical experience and hopefully work within the mining industry here. My main concern right now is figuring out how realistic it is to secure a short-term role (up to 6 months max, as WHV conditions require) in mining. I understand that most graduate/entry-level programs are long-term and FIFO roles usually require prior experience and I only have completed a summer internship back home. Do you think companies, especially in WA, would consider WHV holders for entry-level or temporary technical positions? Or would it be smarter to look for mining-adjacent work (like lab tech, geology assistant, or field services) first? Any advice on where/how to apply or whether anyone has gone through a similar path on a WHV would be hugely appreciated. Thanks!",

In Australia, will an Earth and Environmental Science degree be enough to become a Geologist, or do I need a Geology degree? Cheers guys, you rock",
