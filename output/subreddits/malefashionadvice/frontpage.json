That or a \"casual businessman who on his freetime goes to beachclubs and also goes to the gym\" look. It all feels very classy and \"american\" in a single dad way, which is not bad, but it's not what i look for.This said, do you know any fashion advice subreddit for younger/not-so-masculine/genZ men?",

      "content_preview": "So the way I would describe my everyday style is busines casual. I have multiple leather shoes (loafers, oxfords, doublemonks). I wear shirts every day top two button unbuttoned, mostly white and have 1 light blue, all of them form T.M Lewin some oxford, some poplin. Dress trousers. This is my outfitt in the summer since the weather is killing me so I wear this with rolled up shirt sleeves. When the weather gets colder I wear sportjackets in top of all the listed, also have a beige trenchcoat, and a camel overcoat for the winter.I'm turning 29, been dressing this way for a while now. I started upgrading my wardrobe since I wore mostly fast fashion pieces until this point, but as I said I already changed all my shirt for T.M Lewin (and the quality of the shirt compared to the ones I used to wear is can't even be compared), I just got a new sportjacket from suitsupply and actually want to buy two more and change all my jackets, same with the pants. So I will spend a lot of money in the near future in this upgrade and hopefully all the pieces will last for a while since all the fast fashion ones usually barelly last 2 years and fall apart.But I feel a little conflicted with this. Sometimes I feel so out of place. At work even my boss and C.E.O wear plean tshirts and jeans and sneakers (if they have an important meeting they may change the t-shirt with a white shirt). A few week ago one of my colleague wore a short sleeve shirt with jeans and some of my other colleague asked him what is the important ocasion that he \"dressed up\". So even my workpleace is very casual, not to mention everybody else on the streets. (I'm from east europe btw for context).I like to dress this way, I feel like this is me. But I just don't know, I often feel like I was born in wrong time, back in the days more poeple dressed like this. I know here are many of you that dress this way. Do you also feel out of place sometimes? How do you handle this? Or you just try to downgrade the formality of the outfitt to fitt in this very very very casual environment where most people wear t-shirts and jeans with a hoodie? (and don't get me wrong nothing wrong with it, but it's jsut not for me)p.s.: I had to double t all the fitt word because reddit wouldn't alove me to post this otherwise.p.s.: Also may I add that a few people already commented on it like. \"You dress better than your boss\" asked \"Why you dress like this every day.\" One of my female colleague complimented me and said \"others that role may be higher than you should also dress like this compared to the way they do because they are sloppy\" (her words try to translate it). Went on a casual ocasion after work a few week ago and one guy asked me if I'm and insurance agent, ect...",

      "content_preview": "When I first found this sub years ago, I noticed that so many guys recommended tailoring. Never knowing anything about that, I googled for solid tailors in my area. I landed on a tiny little shop that had been around forever. It had passed between father and son over the decades and had great reviews. I went, pretty nervously as I had no real idea what to even ask for.The gentleman was more than I could have ever wanted in a tailor. So kind, soft spoken, and I found out through our chats that I went to high school with his son, and he went to high school with my F-I-L. Small world. He took sincere interest in my hobbies and interests, and going to see him was like seeing an old friend or a father-figure. Most of the time he never even charged me and would tailor me on the spot, just working through our conversations.He developed cancer, and passed away quickly. I never had a chance to see him, and in fact, I still had some pants there that he needed a little more time to work on. I wrote his son,and told him how fantastic his father was, and how unexpectedly hard his passing hit me.I went to go see another highly rated tailor in my area, and while the experience was pleasant - he just didn’t get it quite as right as my guy.I’m not sure why I’m posting this. I figured this sub was where my journey to find a tailor began, so maybe it was the right crowd.Anyway, if you have a good connection with your tailor, don’t take it for granted. I don’t think you need one to have good tailoring done, but it definitely makes a difference when you do.",

As much as I love Italian fashion, I am in no way going to wear a tailored suit every day when there's two toddlers in the mix.

Is there anything that genuinely never made it back into rotation?Not talking codpieces or powdered wigs, just trends from the last 100 years that seem to have stayed buried.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, i recently got these expensive Japanese Selvedge chinos from Todd Snyder. This was their very first wash after wearing them 4 times. They went into the wash clean, as i only washed them because i got sweaty. I washed them in a clean washing machine, on their own, according to the care label and very carefully, on a cold gentle cycle, leaving them to air dry hung up. When they came out, there were orangey/pink fading around the pocket and thigh area and also just spotted around the pants.https://imgur.com/a/sn5ZZjRI have no idea how this happened, and i’m very pedantic and obsessive about my clothes, so this bugs me massively. I did actually manage to get a refund and be able to keep the pants, but i would prefer not to get a new pair and maybe fix this, but i fear these stains are now there forever and may get worse. The ONLY thing i can thing about is maybe the detergent, which permanently faded the colour on them, but this has never happened with any of my other dark clothes before.Any help is appreciated!",

I tried going the custom route here in Atlanta, but every tailor I visited said there isn’t enough time for a proper custom suit.So now I’m down to off-the-rack options (with alterations). The problem is my body shape makes it tricky:Option 1:A suit where the jacket is slightly too long (think to the end of my thumb or mid-section of my finger in the first third). The shoulders on this one sit perfectly.Option 2:A suit with the perfect jacket length, but the shoulders have noticeable divots.I’ll be altering everything else — sleeve length, collar, etc. — but I can’t get away from this tradeoff.For those of you who’ve been in the same boat, what would you prioritize: slightly long jacket with clean shoulders, or great length with imperfect shoulders?Would love to hear your thoughts before I commit.",

      "content_preview": "Some people absolutely swear by designer clothing like they’ll say the fabric feels better on their skin or the stitching is different compared to default and that once you wear expensive clothing you can't wear any other type. My friends call bullshit saying it’s all the same material with a different label printed on it and you’re paying for the brand instead of comfort calling it status symbol. I’ve had a couple of jackets which are cheaper that honestly still look and feels amazing today. But I bought a more premium called moncler which I got from some cash I won at rolling riches and it started fraying or fading after just a few months which made me wonder if I got fucked over by the branding. I also think it has to do with luck and what kind of items you buy for example shoes and outerwear seem to hold up better if you spend more but stuff like shirts and hoodies don't make much difference. What do you guys think? Is it brand or comfort you're looking for when shopping for a new item?",

Boxy T-shirts, white trainers, wide-leg trousers, neutral palettes, small variations on the same look, repeated endlessly. Scroll through Instagram or TikTok and you see the same thing: outfits circulated, replicated, and produced at speed, often at the cheapest possible cost.It makes me wonder: has social media actually flattened style into a kind of monoculture, where everyone is drawing from the same references and wearing the same pieces. Or has this always been the case? After all, subcultures in the past also dressed alike, and trends have always created conformity.The difference now, maybe, is scale and speed. Instead of style being shaped locally or subculturally, it’s dictated globally in real time. Which leaves less space for variation. Or at least makes it feel that way.Curious to hear other perspectives: do you think social media has homogenised the way we dress, or are we just seeing a faster version of what’s always been true?Or is it just all Uniqlo's fault?",

I'm moving to the UK in a few days and was short on time, so I made the huge mistake of taking them to a local tailor who wasn't a denim specialist.The good news: The size is perfectThe catastrophically bad news: I'm 99% sure they cut off the entire selvedge edge when they took in the outer seam. The iconic selvedge identity is just gone.I'm going to be based in the UK (Cambridge, but willing to travel/mail). Can a specialist somehow add a new selvedge to the outseam? Maybe even a faux-selvedge will do?Has anyone had a \"selvedge rebuild\" done?Thanks in advance. Feeling pretty gutted.",
