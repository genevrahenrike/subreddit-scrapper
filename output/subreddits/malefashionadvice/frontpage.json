      "content_preview": "Hey everyone,I’m in a bit of a time crunch. I have two back-to-back weddings coming up in three weeks, and I’m late to the game on suit shopping. I tried going the custom route here in Atlanta, but every tailor I visited said there isn’t enough time for a proper custom suit.So now I’m down to off-the-rack options (with alterations). The problem is my body shape makes it tricky:Option 1:A suit where the jacket is slightly too long (think to the end of my thumb or mid-section of my finger in the first third). The shoulders on this one sit perfectly.Option 2:A suit with the perfect jacket length, but the shoulders have noticeable divots.I’ll be altering everything else — sleeve length, collar, etc. — but I can’t get away from this tradeoff.For those of you who’ve been in the same boat, what would you prioritize: slightly long jacket with clean shoulders, or great length with imperfect shoulders?Would love to hear your thoughts before I commit.",

Customer service responded with confusing replies about a different item, closed my case, and ignored follow-ups.

I’d like to branch out more while keeping a sense of my original style. but I need some direction please. Thank you.Edit: I appreciate the help so far. I live in a small mountain town.

They are sometimes made out of leather and in other instances aout of fabric. They are used for layering for warmth or to give a retro look. They have been modernized recently and made out of suede or wool.They are unique and I like the niche character vibe of these because some of the other items are stocking are also pretty niche. They could also be purchased for cosplay or history enthusiasts or people who are interested in medieval or renaissance fairs. They may have less demand but if i have a clear audience targeting strategy I think they could be something that buyers would be wanting to buy. I am sourcing from overseas (Alibaba), where I can get a good price for leather and suede.I wanted opinions on if there would b a steady demand for this kind of fashion piece and should I go for real leather or just synthetic versions that would be cheaper and offer higher margins probably.",

      "content_preview": "So the way I would describe my everyday style is busines casual. I have multiple leather shoes (loafers, oxfords, doublemonks). I wear shirts every day top two button unbuttoned, mostly white and have 1 light blue, all of them form T.M Lewin some oxford, some poplin. Dress trousers. This is my outfitt in the summer since the weather is killing me so I wear this with rolled up shirt sleeves. When the weather gets colder I wear sportjackets in top of all the listed, also have a beige trenchcoat, and a camel overcoat for the winter.I'm turning 29, been dressing this way for a while now. I started upgrading my wardrobe since I wore mostly fast fashion pieces until this point, but as I said I already changed all my shirt for T.M Lewin (and the quality of the shirt compared to the ones I used to wear is can't even be compared), I just got a new sportjacket from suitsupply and actually want to buy two more and change all my jackets, same with the pants. So I will spend a lot of money in the near future in this upgrade and hopefully all the pieces will last for a while since all the fast fashion ones usually barelly last 2 years and fall apart.But I feel a little conflicted with this. Sometimes I feel so out of place. At work even my boss and C.E.O wear plean tshirts and jeans and sneakers (if they have an important meeting they may change the t-shirt with a white shirt). A few week ago one of my colleague wore a short sleeve shirt with jeans and some of my other colleague asked him what is the important ocasion that he \"dressed up\". So even my workpleace is very casual, not to mention everybody else on the streets. (I'm from east europe btw for context).I like to dress this way, I feel like this is me. But I just don't know, I often feel like I was born in wrong time, back in the days more poeple dressed like this. I know here are many of you that dress this way. Do you also feel out of place sometimes? How do you handle this? Or you just try to downgrade the formality of the outfitt to fitt in this very very very casual environment where most people wear t-shirts and jeans with a hoodie? (and don't get me wrong nothing wrong with it, but it's jsut not for me)p.s.: I had to double t all the fitt word because reddit wouldn't alove me to post this otherwise.p.s.: Also may I add that a few people already commented on it like. \"You dress better than your boss\" asked \"Why you dress like this every day.\" One of my female colleague complimented me and said \"others that role may be higher than you should also dress like this compared to the way they do because they are sloppy\" (her words try to translate it). Went on a casual ocasion after work a few week ago and one guy asked me if I'm and insurance agent, ect...",

I own a pair of Jack Erwin’s ghat have a great shape, but they’re just not comfortable and don’t last more than a year and a half.Just as an example, I love the look of the Carlos loafers by Santoni (link at bottom). It’s clean, it’s sleek, it’s perfect for me. It’s just out of my budget!I wear loafers twice weekly at minimum, when I wear my suits over the weekend. Budget is around 300 USD, but I would go a little bit over. Thanks for the help!https://imgur.com/a/fNDysGp",

I want the comfort of wearing a button-down while subtly masking it with something like a sweater or jacket, but I’m not sure what to choose or what type of layer that I do choose.As for trousers, I typically wear tech pants with my button-down shirts, but I’ve also heard of blue jeans being an option, so I’d maybe like to try that out, since I also do love wearing jeans.In my closet I don’t have much… just some flannels, a quarter-zipper over shirt, maybe like one crew neck sweater, I think somewhere I have a fleece jacket, some hoodies, a leather jacket that’s way too big for me, and some waistcoats. Button-downs I’m working with include a white, a gray, a black, a blue, a blue-and-white checkered-pattern shirt, and a patterned black/white/hint of blue-striped. If there’s anything you suggest that I don’t own, don’t worry—I can buy it, I guess 😔 I’m open to any and all suggestions. Thanks.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, i recently got these expensive Japanese Selvedge chinos from Todd Snyder. This was their very first wash after wearing them 4 times. They went into the wash clean, as i only washed them because i got sweaty. I washed them in a clean washing machine, on their own, according to the care label and very carefully, on a cold gentle cycle, leaving them to air dry hung up. When they came out, there were orangey/pink fading around the pocket and thigh area and also just spotted around the pants.https://imgur.com/a/sn5ZZjRI have no idea how this happened, and i’m very pedantic and obsessive about my clothes, so this bugs me massively. I did actually manage to get a refund and be able to keep the pants, but i would prefer not to get a new pair and maybe fix this, but i fear these stains are now there forever and may get worse. The ONLY thing i can thing about is maybe the detergent, which permanently faded the colour on them, but this has never happened with any of my other dark clothes before.Any help is appreciated!",

I have some flat brim hats (not the mid 2000's rap artist style, I have those too) but these are a smaller bill more of a retro flat brim style. Has anyone DIY'd or bought a brim curver? A lot of my Richardson 112 hats are out of whack too from being used and abused daily. These aren't easily replaceable due to limited runs, team logos, etc. but the bill curve is off center or no longer uniform. I would like to fix these up too.Unsure if this is the right group for this but I did not find a hat specific group to join. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "Hello! I’m looking to purchase my first suit. I’m looking for something versatile and quirky, but nothing too outlandish. I just want something that I can wear in multiple scenarios, such as going out for dinner, and in more professional settings. My main colour preference is black but if it’s really nice I’d go with grey, blue, or brown.I have a budget of around $3,000 USD but could stretch a little higher. I know absolutely nothing about suits, I’ve never even been to a tailor before. I have heard Suitsupply is a good brand. I know you get measured up and stuff for buying suits, so I don’t know if I should mention that I’m 5’10 and 175lbs. What would you guys recommend? Thanks 🙏",

But since they don't have a store in London I can try on, I'm hesitant to buy it.I'm also willing to consider bespoke/tailored, if the price is reasonable. Where are other places I can find the kind of coat I'm looking for?Budget: £2,000Looking for: Single-breasted, wool, warm enough for London winter. Quality/durability over brand (I don't care about \"luxury\" brands). \"Buy it for life\" kinda thing.Bonus: Made in UK.",
