That or a \"casual businessman who on his freetime goes to beachclubs and also goes to the gym\" look. It all feels very classy and \"american\" in a single dad way, which is not bad, but it's not what i look for. This said, do you know any fashion advice subreddit for younger/not-so-masculine/genZ men?",

I’m looking at Brooks Brothers vs Spier & Mackay vs Charles Tyrwhitt Budget: $140/shirt I will be wearing them daily in the office + client meetings (want solid value + decent longevity) Contenders (my current take): •\tBrooks Brothers (Thomas Mason line): Heard quality dipped after their pandemic bankruptcy but I heard it may be improving. Even with promos, they’re still pricey—are they worth it again?\n\n•\tSpier & Mackay: Great prices, but reviews make me worry about durability. Sizing and cuts feel confusing and the 14-day return window is rough.\n\n•\tCharles Tyrwhitt: Seems like a middle ground, but I keep seeing complaints about flimsy buttons. I have “you get what you pay for” vibes with them. What brands am I missing and are there any MTM options below $140 I should be considering?",

      "content_preview": "Walking down the street these days, it often feels like everyone is dressed in near-identical uniforms. Boxy T-shirts, white trainers, wide-leg trousers, neutral palettes, small variations on the same look, repeated endlessly. Scroll through Instagram or TikTok and you see the same thing: outfits circulated, replicated, and produced at speed, often at the cheapest possible cost. It makes me wonder: has social media actually flattened style into a kind of monoculture, where everyone is drawing from the same references and wearing the same pieces. Or has this always been the case? After all, subcultures in the past also dressed alike, and trends have always created conformity. The difference now, maybe, is scale and speed. Instead of style being shaped locally or subculturally, it’s dictated globally in real time. Which leaves less space for variation. Or at least makes it feel that way. Curious to hear other perspectives: do you think social media has homogenised the way we dress, or are we just seeing a faster version of what’s always been true? Or is it just all Uniqlo's fault?",

My friends call bullshit saying it’s all the same material with a different label printed on it and you’re paying for the brand instead of comfort calling it status symbol. I’ve had a couple of jackets which are cheaper that honestly still look and feels amazing today. But I bought a more premium called moncler which I got from some cash I won at rolling riches and it started fraying or fading after just a few months which made me wonder if I got fucked over by the branding. I also think it has to do with luck and what kind of items you buy for example shoes and outerwear seem to hold up better if you spend more but stuff like shirts and hoodies don't make much difference. What do you guys think? Is it brand or comfort you're looking for when shopping for a new item?",

My main thing with any shirt I wear is the length. I find a lot of shirts stop right at the waist and I prefer my shirts to be a bit longer. I'm also looking for shirts that aren't a particularly thick material or will make my overall figure look more boxy. As an example, I purchased a couple oversized t-shirts from Barbour - found their length to be too short and they ended up being quite boxy and made my figure look less flattering in the process - and this was after sizing up as well. I was looking at Allsaints oversized t-shirts - actually have two shirts ready to go in checkout, but I have a sneaking suspicion this brand may be similar to Barbour and was hoping to see if anyone has experience purchasing these oversized shirts from Allsaints and how they are? Honestly, any help identifying some brands or specific elements I should look out for, for a comfortable fitting oversized look would be greatly appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "Ended up gathering a decent collection of camp/Cuban collar shirts over the spring/summer and don't want to quite retire them fully for 6 months. What's the best way to wear them in the fall and winter? I've seen it paired with a sport jacket but that isn't quite an everyday sorta use/feel. I've tried it with a bomber jacket and similar but it does seem like the collar gets somewhat buried or hidden. Haven't tried it with an overshirt/shirt jacket/shacket or underneath a piece of flannel though. Also the boxy and loose f-i-t (the admin bot auto-blocks any posts with this word in it) can be tough to make work as the first layer. Anyone have a way they like to style them?",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys! I was looking for a ~30L backpack that doesn't feel/look too bulky and allows me to bring my laptop/tablet/powerbanks etc to campus, while also allowing me to bring some clothes for gym/work, and allowing me to bring food/drinks etc. So I need a big central pocket, a separate pocket for my devices, and then a pocket for powerbanks, bluetooth mouse etc. My budget isn't super high, i'd estimate around 150. The reason for my post is because I had a question regarding a specific backpack I was looking at, the Nineyard - ALL IN. Backpack 30L . I didn't see this backpack posted on the mega thread and didn't see a ton of backpacks that matched the exact criteria. Does anyone know if this backpack is a scam? It has quite a lot of features for the price it has (169 euro), so I wasn't sure. Thanks so much for your answers in advance!",
