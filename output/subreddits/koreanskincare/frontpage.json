I went through the ingredient lists and reviews and made a simple guide so it is easier to understand what each one is for. Here is the quick version: Snail Mucin Essence → still the go-to for hydration and repairing skin Peptide 132 Hair Treatment and Shampoo → made to strengthen weak or damaged hair 6X Peptide Booster Serum → for firmness and glow Hydrogel Masks → two options, one for plumping (Peptide Collagen) and one for brightening (Alpha-Arbutin) Sunscreens → Vitamin E Daily Sunscreen and a clear stick that is easy to reapply during the day I wrote a full article with more details and reviews if you want to check it: GO HERE Hope this helps anyone who was curious about the new launches.",

I want to purchase him a Christmas gift of skincare products since he has been thinking about starting a skincare routine but doesnt knows where to start. I have a pretty set in stone skincare routine of mostly Cera Ve products, but I dont know a thing about Korean skincare lol, and would like to get him some fancier products than what I get myself. What I know about his skin is that he has some facial hair, prominent sebaceous filements, blackheads, and a moderate amount of pimples. If I were to guess, I think he's an oily skin type. Does anyone have any recommendations on what I should get him? I am thinking the basic cleanser, moisturiser, and sunscreen collection, but I do want him to have a try of exfoliant and a brightening and/or skin evening product as well.",

      "content_preview": "Hey, guys! Has anyone else had issues with orders coming from Moida for the past few weeks? I’ve used them for a year or two and have never had trouble until now. Last month my order took almost two weeks to arrive, when it’s always been only 3-4 days in the past. Not a huge deal, so I hit them with another order last week and they sent me an email saying my order was marked as risky and they needed identification to proceed with the order? I thought it was a scam email at first so I messaged their official customer service email from their website and they confirmed it. Has anyone else experienced anything like this recently? Any possibility it’s to do with tariffs or changes in the community? TIA!",

I know many people are looking for Korea beauty products, but I'm curious - are you feeling any extra costs or burdens because of these tariffs? Since I'm based in Korea, I don't really feel the impact directly, but I imagine people involved in importing/exporting might be experiencing it more!",

I struggle with acne and want to find products or routines that can actually help calm breakouts while keeping my skin balanced and looking good long term. The tricky part is that my skin doesn’t seem to fit neatly into one category—it gets oily in some areas but can also get weirdly dry in others, so I’m not even sure what type it technically is. On top of that, I live in a tropical climate where it’s hot and humid pretty much year-round, which makes skincare feel even more confusing. Does anyone have recommendations for products, ingredients, or routines that might actually work for combination skin in this kind of climate? I’d love to hear what’s worked for others.",
