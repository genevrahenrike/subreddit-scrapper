Last Updated Sep 1, 2025 11:47 am. Canmore RCMP say an impaired Calgary driver crashed into several vehicles along the Trans-Canada Highway, injuring 14 people on Sunday. It happened at around 1:30 p.m. on the westbound lanes of the Trans-Canada Highway near Highway 1a in Canmore, west of Calgary. RCMp Cpl. Troy Savinkoff tells 660 NewsRadio that the male driver lost control of his vehicle and went through the centre median and into oncoming traffic. That’s where he collided with several other vehicles–leaving 14 people injured. Two of them were sent to hospital in critical condition. Savinkoff says impaired driving charges are pending against the driver. The crash led to significant delays for those going westbound. RCMP were on site investigating for several hours before reopening lanes at around 9 p.m. Savinkoff says about 250 Albertans lose their lives each year on the roads they police, of those, 30 per cent involve impaired drivers.

      "content_preview": "What can I do in Calgary? Hi I’m currently visiting my boyfriend in Calgary, from Australia. My flight back to Australia is booked for 5 months from now, as that’s what my visa allows. (6 months) So a-bit about my situation, Unfortunately my bf is creating something “major” for his job. So for the past couple of weeks his been working as soon as he wakes up, to, the time he goes to sleep. He says… it will only be for a couple more weeks…. he works from home, but I can’t talk to him much while he is working. When I do interrupt him more than a couple times, he gets quite annoyed as it deviates from his focus and says he might lose his job if he doesn’t finish this “project” on time . It is something pretty extraordinary, so I’m trying really hard to be patient and keep my self occupied. But I’m starting to feel like I’m going a little crazy from loneliness haha, I know no one else in the country. Just stuck in the house with no one to talk to, too scared to drive on the other side of the road. (We drive on the left in Aus) Would love some ideas on what I could do in Calgary by my self as a tourist, or just like places I can visit etc.. any ideas would be much appreciated, thank-you",

Two guys sitting behind us were shouting racist and homophobic slurs throughout the show. •\tWhen Kam Patterson was on, they were yelling the N-word. •\tWhen a joke mentioned Jewish people, they yelled “f*** Arabs, f*** Muslims, f*** Palestine.” •\tWhen a joke touched on gay people, they started yelling “f*** f*ggots” I told them multiple times to shut up and stop with the racist remarks. Their response was, “You’re in Calgary,” as if this city is supposed to be racist. What disappointed me just as much was that nobody else in the crowd spoke up. These guys were way louder than the show itself, and I know the 20+ people around us could hear it. But everyone just sat there. Lesson learned: I’m never going to a show like this again if it makes people feel comfortable enough to openly scream that kind of hate in public.",

We also have a fundraiser store that tried to bridge the gap for folks who can’t afford the big box thrift store prices. each week we cook 200 hot meals a day and distribute 1000-2000 clothing items PER Day! We also collect and distribute toiletries. Our clients are low income Calgarians and the unhoused and try to be a resource for ppl who live downtown. Some of our regulars include seniors on fixed income, the unhoused, ppl living with mental illness and ppl on AISH, newcomers. We have days when other non profits pop up to help ppl apply for housing or connect with a social worker. We are open 4 days a week but have recently had to shorten our hours due to growing demand. The number one and best solution is more housing fast. Especially housing that is combined with social services or don’t have a sober living requirement. We don’t try to serve everyone, we are volunteer run and rely on donors to have stuff to give away, but the problem is increasing. We have a long wishlist of what we want to happen systemically but in the interim we always need donations of adult clothing and shoes, bedding, towels, reusable bags, luggage, backpacks, clean socks, new undies. You can check out our website goodneighbourcalgary.com/donate Anyways if you have questions about how things work pls comment below and I will try to answer! Sorry for typos!",

      "content_preview": "Today I witnessed something that shook me deeply. I saw a girl sitting on the edge of the 10th St Memorial Drive bridge, seemingly ready to jump into the Bow River. We called the police immediately. While waiting, a small group of us stayed with her, we talked to her, one lady offered cookies, and just tried to be present. Thankfully, the police arrived soon after and took over. I left once they were there, but I can’t stop thinking about it. Please hug your loved ones, check in on your family and friends, and do what you can to bring positive energy into your environment. Sometimes just being there makes a world of difference. EDIT - You Calgarians are so kind and generous. There were other strangers helping too — a lady offered cookies from her bag, another tried to give her cookies, a young girl, and another biker. Everyone was doing what they could to help her off the flat part of the bridge where she was sitting. She may or may not have jumped,it all happened so fast. Just wanted to share this, as many of you can probably relate to moments like this in your own lives. I am not a hero, all we need to do is to take an action/small step and life has a way of falling into place just as it meant to. Love you all, stay blessed.",

I initially wanted to redshirt her after all the discussions and positives I've seen, especially in June 2021 mom groups - as a collective, majority of moms are choosing to start kinder at 6 rather then starting as a fresh 5 year old, for maturity sense, for graduation at 18, for being one of the oldest in class instead of the youngest, and just because school is a whole new ballgame, but I've done some more research and it seems like in alberta/calgary that they don't have that option,  if a child is 6 by dec of that school year then they skip kinder and go straight to grade 1.. so I guess my kiddo will start her academic journey in sept of next year (2026). Anyways, I have been looking up schools to figure out what is the best option for my child - catholic, public, charter, etc. We also have a flexible home address for both SE (Erin Woods/dover/southview) and for the nw (thorncliff, highwood).. somepriorities are smaller class sizes/school size, a friendly, safe, easy going place that is exclusive and welcoming, option to stay with the same peers for many years...) Any advice on programs or locations?",

I’m a 32F and would really love to start building a social circle here! I’m not necessarily looking for dating (though open to it if it happens naturally), more so friendships and connections with people who share similar interests. For context, I’m into wellness, exploring new restaurants and coffee shops, thrift shopping, Drag, spirituality, Tarot, paddle boarding and getting outside when the weather’s good. For those of you who live here, what have been the best ways you’ve found to actually meet people in Calgary? Whether it’s groups, events, hobbies, or apps, I’d love to hear what’s worked for you.
