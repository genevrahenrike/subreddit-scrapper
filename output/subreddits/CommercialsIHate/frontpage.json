All you have to do is to go through my post/comment history to see how long I've tried to lose weight and how hard it's been. I don't take weight-loss medication, but I think it's an amazing tool. I also believe anybody who loses weight (especially those who have struggled for a long time) should celebrate. But the behaviour of at least some of these people in the new Wegovy commercial for losing 35-46lbs makes me go, \"That's not exactly what happens.\" I've lost 61lbs thus far, I'm happier, and have more energy, but I'm also not an adult acting like I'm seeing my friends for the first time after getting home from camping all summer (I'm looking at you football guy). By the way, does anybody else think the mom looks like Abigail Breslin?",

I CANNOT stand the Blue Buffalo, Farmer's Dog, and other $$$ brand commercials where the message is \"Feed your pet our food or you're a bad pet owner and you're harming your pet and they hate you.\" I'm not gonna sit here and pretend there's absolutely zero things wrong with cheaper brands of pet food, but as they say on the subject of formula vs. breastfeeding babies: fed is best . Your pet's relatively healthy? Not throwing up after meals or having allergic reactions? No deficiencies you're aware of? Not starving? You're doing fine. Ignore these brands and influencers and their manipulation and guilt-tripping. If you like the brands that's totally fine! I have nothing against these brands at all. But their marketing bugs me. \"Cheap food is BAD, your dog wants to live with ME now because I feed them GOOD food! 🥰\" Yeah shut the fuck up.",

My mom saw this and freaked out, saying that if it’s being used on us, we should have the right to sue. She doesn’t want tailor made ads. What I’m wondering, could this really be in use by them or a similar company? Because, really, a lot of ads spring up for each of out problems and play these relentlessly. Me, antidepressants/brain fog. Dad, psoriasis. Mom, migraine. I’ve probably got a common problem, ok, but is the well of psoriasis sufferers really all that big? At any given time there’s at least a couple of drugs that relieve it that’s played consistently. Worst one is my mom and the over and over repetition of Botox ads. She’s literally shouting at the tv about it. She’s also got a fear of needles so I’m guessing the thought is traumatic for her. An even freakier part is they air the most during Resident Alien, which has a subplot of a murder done with botulism. It could be the reason for the ads, but either way it’s definitely not convincing any of us to try it 😂 But really, this stuff feels predatory. Technically we can’t complain too much because it’s a smart tv and there’s also a few Alexa devices here, so the likelihood of something listening is entirely possible.",
