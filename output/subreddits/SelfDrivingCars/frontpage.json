NOPE.... It ILLEGALLY moved  into the middle lane after realising (oops, I'm not in the right lane). Seriously, this is basic stuff. The red lights are bright red. This is a very easy and clear situation. Red = stop. Green = go. The lane markings are clear. To be clear this is not an isolated case and I've heard of many owners with FSD having to take over due to dodgy AI/decisions. This is pretty much an alpha release now, not a beta release. With something like cars, it should be reliable and safe.",

      "content_preview": "This is just theoretical discussion to gain intuition about the engineering challenge of FSD. I was wondering of the practicality of skipping the human/FSD hybrid scenario which seems like the toughest challenge as well as temporary one assuming we are going towards 100 % autonomous drivers future. It looks like hardest part of self-driving isn‚Äôt the tech in the car, it‚Äôs dealing with unpredictable human drivers. If every vehicle on the road were autonomous and speaking the same ‚Äúlanguage,‚Äù things would get a lot simpler. ‚Ä¢\tA car slowing down could instantly alert the ones behind it, making phantom braking a non-issue.\n\n‚Ä¢\tTraffic lights could just send ‚Äústop‚Äù or ‚Äúgo‚Äù commands directly to cars, keeping pedestrians safe (though surprises like jaywalkers or animals would still require quick reactions).\n\n‚Ä¢\tCars could pool their data so each one already ‚Äúknows‚Äù what‚Äôs ahead before it even gets there.\n\n‚Ä¢\tExtra sensors, like overhead cameras at intersections, could add another layer of safety. Even long staying drones with wide sensors. The real challenge is the messy transition where human and autonomous drivers share the road. A world with only self-driving cars would actually be much easier to engineer. If we are going towards 100% autonomous anyway the transition stage is temporary so any cost is not needed in the long run. Of course, the big question is whether you can ever just remove human-driven cars overnight. But if a new city were built from scratch (say in China or the Gulf) it‚Äôs not hard to imagine them skipping the hybrid phase and going fully autonomous from day one. Let‚Äôs put it another way. If the amazon warehouse  robots had to operate on a hybrid environment where humans and forklifts are operating they would have taken a lot longer to complete(maybe not even be there yet). (In this scenario even Tesla‚Äôs flawed vision only approach can do the trick) I would love to hear ideas on: Practical geofencing strategies (it could be done at certain times of day, create a procedure to give human drivers the right of way, a dictator forcing all the citizens to comply etc). How easier it would make the FSD problem from technical POV. Will the FSD tech will still need to cope with the complexity of hybrid roads?",

      "content_preview": "[Edit: I am highly skeptical this will ever happen and tesla is wasting their time] I think Tesla‚Äôs vision-only Full Self-Driving strategy is inherently flawed and to accomplish it they need to  achieve a leap in AI to a point the AI will be more valuable than Tesla‚Äôs car business itself making it a pipe dream. Also any competitor will beat them to the punch by definition. A lot of ambitious startups confuse the side effect with the core product. For example, AR contact lenses to improve weapon accuracy. The real breakthrough would be the AR platform, not the weapons. Or a ‚Äúcat psychologist AI.‚Äù The underlying tech is what matters, not the niche use. For Tesla, the real question is: can vision alone match or beat human perception on the road? If yes, the technology has uses far beyond cars: robotics, defense, AR, and more. If no, then years of collecting only camera data may have been wasted. And worse, that data has a shelf life because camera hardware keeps improving. Where This Could Go: 1.\tTesla adds LiDAR later. They might roll it out to the robotaxi fleet. But then, what happens to all the cars sold with the ‚ÄúFSD promise‚Äù?\n2.\tIt‚Äôs smoke and mirrors. FSD hype keeps the stock and permits alive, but failure would trigger lawsuits and collapse.\n3.\tVision-only works. Maybe it can be done. It is not as crazy as I make it to be. But even then, companies using both LiDAR and cameras may still have the edge. Ppl who think so I would love to hear your take. From an engineering POV I was amazed by Musks‚Äôs claim ‚Äúhuman use vision only‚Äù as an reason. Leaving out our unprecedented processing of sensor data and the amount of context we extract/integrate. This is an insult to our amazing capabilities. The human eye alone is a marble (Granted sensors and computers have other advantages that can compensate but what about the supercomputer that process the data). Maybe I am sceptic and true advancement requires ambitious, crazy ppl. I had conversations with engineers who supported Elon on this but I remain unconvinced (I was surprised they exist tbh)",
