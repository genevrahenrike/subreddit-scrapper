      "content_preview": "I don’t know if I am looking for a unicorn here. I am pregnant with baby #2. First will have just turned 2 when second is born, so I am anticipating needing an actually double buggy for a while (rather than just adding a buggy board / toddler seat to existing pram). I personally don’t like the doubles that have the babies in front or on top of each other, especially as it seems impossible to find one with the carrycot in front of the parent rather than at the front of the pram behind/underneath the toddler. However, I think I am being fussy, but I really don’t want a super wide side-by-side. We currently have a Joie Versatrax which I do really like, but the back wheels are quite wide and can sometimes be a pain in tight shops, so I’m not keen to go much wider. I’ve found plenty of double pushchairs which are quite narrow, but I would really rather baby be parent facing for at least the first few months, but don’t want to also force my toddler to parent face when he is keen to look around. Do I have any options that match this or I’m I going to have to sacrifice one of my wants: side by side not too wide one parent facing, one world facing lays fully flat for newborn Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "i see lots of posts (not here but across the many parenting subreddits) asking and stressing about how to drop the bottle with kids way younger than mine (2.5yo). I give them the bottle, i put some books and toys in their bed, and I have about 30 minutes of peace to have my breakfast and get ready for the day. I go get them when they call for me, but it's usually a while. This routine works for both of us and I'm clinging onto it with both hands haha. I know it won't be forever, and I'll have to incorporate toilet in there once they're potty trained, and it might ruin the whole thing, but it's bliss just now. for background, i had was given a bottle of milk (eventually two) till i was about 8 years old ( i know, that is kinda mad) because my mum also likes a routine and it was working i guess. no my teeth are not fucked (because of that).",

      "content_preview": "There's a new play cafe opening up in my town that's aimed at 0-4 that everyone is very excited about. I have no children of this age anymore so won't be visiting, but I'm pleased that there's somewhere designed specifically for younger children to play and allowing parents to meet other parents. The owners have been very clear that it they are only for 4 and unders and older siblings are permitted in the cafe but not in the play area. There's lots of talk about it on local Facebook pages with many people excited about the opening saying they love the idea of a space only for younger children. Other parents are furious that older siblings are banned from playing there and refusing to attend as it's discrimination against older children. The cafe have replied saying they're opening hours are mostly during school hours anyway so older siblings will be at school which won't be an issue. This hasn't placated the angry parents as  it's now penalising working parents who can't attend during a weekday and wouldn't be able to attend on a Saturday as they have older children!! As I say I have no horse in this race with only having older children, but I think it's a great idea personally! Anytime I have been to a soft play or play centre there's always been older children in the  baby/toddler areas so having a place where just younger children can play sounds like heaven. What is the Reddit opinion on this?",

He is 22 months old, he will be 2yrs in November. Our monthly bills were roughly £400 from nursery. I would do £400 - 20% and then add that amount into the tax free childcare account online, and pay the nursery that way. Our last bill was a lot less (I think I only had to pay about £170 into the childcare account!) but will it get even lower? Or is this likely to be the new amount? And will it change again once he's 2yrs old? Thank you!",

My daughter, on the other hand, is the source of constant friction in our family. I know it’s not the truth, but it feels like she doesn’t want any of us to know a moment’s peace. Any outing, any time we’re together, everything is difficult. A nonstop string of whining, complaint and difficulty that never ends. She whines about being hungry, we serve her a meal, she turns her nose up saying she doesn’t want it and then carries on complaining of hunger. Ask her to get dressed, go for a wee, brush her teeth, put on shoes (all things she’s perfectly capable of doing)? All we get back is NO - we have to cajole/wrestle/threaten her into doing every basic thing. All the while her brother is like, why is she always so upset and crying all the time? We love her, and she has many wonderful qualities and charming moments. And I know a lot of this behaviour is her trying to get our time and attention, and get some connection with her. I’ve read Big Little Feelings, Dr Becky, etc, and we do everything we can to stay calm, validate her feelings, redirect, give options, etc, but it’s like she wants us to lose our patience and just keeps pushing and pushing and pushing. It gets to the point where I think, why do we have to take her with us for a nice outing? The three of us could have a nice time, or we bring her and all suffer. Obviously we would never actually exclude her, but it just feels like we are being forever punished. I know I sound like a terrible parent, and I know kids in general can be difficult and annoying, but what can I do to survive? Does anyone else have a kid like this? What do you do?",

When my wife told her friends and family she wanted to stay at home she was met by quite a bit of hostility, specifically around how it will affect our babies social development and \"you will give him learning difficulties\". My wife still plans to take him to groups and on play dates to mix with other children. I don't know how much of this is some form of jealousy or legitimate concerns.

      "content_preview": "My son is now 9 and he starts year 5 in a couple of days. In two years he'll be starting secondary school. While at 9 things are certainly easier than when he was younger, sometimes I'm still looking forward to bedtime or after 6 weeks of school holidays, looking forward to him going back to school. However, once he's in bed and I go to check on him and I feel sad that I've not been as patient as I could have been or spent as much time with him as I should have. We've had a fun summer I hope, he has had to do some holiday clubs, but we've been to a music festival, done day trips, been on holiday and just spent the last full week of the holidays with my parents in North Wales with some beach days and mini days out. I know that time is slipping away, but when I'm in thick it of and I'm being bombard with questions or facts (during one walk last week he spent an hour talking about what he'd do in a game he's never even played or can remember the name of). Now the memory of it makes me smile, but at the time it was driving me a bit mad. I know in a year or two when he's a proper pre-teen he'll not want to spend time with me and I'll be even more sad about it than I am now. Every night when I see him sleeping I think tomorrow I'll do better. It's just so hard in the moment. I don't know if it is because we've barely had a break in the last near 10 years. We have no family near by, no \"village\". My MiL has always been occupied by my nephews who live just down the road from her and my Mum's health issues mean my parents can't really visit us so it has been pretty much full on from day 1 with just a yearly night away for our anniversary when we stay with my parents. Limited chance to step back and really appreciate it.",

Husband is spotty and tired. I have blisters all over the back of my throat and want to cry every time I swallow. Even breathing hurts. We have no village, so have spent almost all day today watching TV. Toddler is thrilled as we’re (read: I’m ) usually quite strict with telly. She’s been happily binging Peppa Pig all day (yuck, couldn’t even have been Bluey, had to be bloody Peppa) and allowing us both some much-needed ‘staring into middle distance in silence’ time. Feel immensely guilty for relying on TV to childmind my two-year-old but I can’t find the energy to commit to her highly physically demanding games. I don’t want to frog hop around the living room making ‘ribbit’ noises and pretending to eat bugs. I want to eat ice cream in the kitchen where no one can hear me. Tell me I’m not a shitty parent for relinquishing my responsibilities this weekend!",

      "content_preview": "I’m writing this for anyone else who’s in similar boat. My son who’s 3 yrs 3 months has only just started his ‘language explosion’. Even 1 month ago, he was using 1 word at a time and 2 word phrases but not pairing words. He had a vocabulary of less than 50 words. He’s now saying new words all day long, copying what we say, and frequently making 2-3 word sentences. We’ve always known he understands everything, he would make us speak for him, and he would keep us guessing until we got the right word he wanted. He was also really good at communicating with us via signs, pointing, charades, and random sounds, but he just wasn’t really talking. He was also able to follow complex instructions, and when given a choice sometimes he’d choose a third thing not being offered! (These are all the things considered when they look at a child’s speech and language). He’s exactly what a late talker is. Although we were always confident in him, when faced with him not meeting criteria for his age, I was sometimes scared we were missing things. He had hearing screen completed And he had a short (disastrous) course of at home speech and language guidance. No one gave a reassurance that with all the above he’ll likely be a late talker. A lot more information was shared about how he may be delayed socially, or have trouble at schools etc. As a parent who thinks their child is completely okay, it’s difficult to go up against these types of assumptions. My husband and I always thought it was a confidence thing, because he was quite shy with talking, i could sense that he didn’t want to get the words wrong. So we started to really encourage him to try and say a word. This is completely opposite to speech and language advice but we had a hunch. With every attempt came loads and loads of praise. We also directed him to watch our mouth when we used simple words. That’s when everything switched gears. Our instincts were right - he just needed the confidence to try. His confidence has grown in every area of his 3 year old life. Watching him these last couple of weeks has been really emotional for us. He’s become more cheeky, not shy, and very adventurous and engaging. I’m writing this because I often see posts about delayed speech / late talker with signs of Autism, but when I went looking I couldn’t find a similar example as our son. I hope it will help people who have a similar 2 year old not talking or even a 2 year old who may be showing signs of autism for comparison to a late talker. I’m also writing this because you know your child best and actually not all the academic advice is going to work for your child. Trust your gut (as always) and SOME KIDS ARE JUST LATE TALKERS !!!

      "content_preview": "(I tried posting this on the Parenting sub and it was removed immediately. I have no idea why…) At the risk of being downvoted into the depths of Hell… I think it should be illegal to post pictures of a child to any (public) social media platform. I’m not talking about private Instagram accounts, used to share pictures with friends and family (although I personally wouldn’t do this either, as it only takes one irresponsible person to thoughtlessly share something, or for one of these people to be a creep). I’m talking about public profiles of parents who want to be influencers and are exploiting their children to try and access money, fame, praise, validation… whatever it is they’re after. Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of these ‘Mommy Blogger’ types online criticising other content creators for sharing videos or images of their children when they are particularly vulnerable, i.e. having a tantrum. And while I agree that sharing this type of content is particularly horrible, the Mommies doing the finger-waggling are neglecting to recognise that children are always vulnerable. Only posting pictures of your baby, toddler or small child when they’re happy and smiling doesn’t make you a better or more responsible parent than those who are posting their kids crying or whining. The differentiation isn’t as big as these parents want to believe. Your child cannot consent to having their image shared with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of strangers online. You don’t even need to share your children online, in order to have a profile based on your experience of parenthood. There are plenty of creators with enormous platforms who make content about parenthood without ever posting their children. Gwenna Laithland (although she does share her older teenager), Tori Phantom (who doesn’t even share her kids’ names or ages) and Trey Kennedy have millions of followers and they either play the role of their own children in skit re-enactments or just talk to the camera about their own experiences. Wannabe “Mommy influencers” with online platforms featuring their children’s names and images are exploitative, gross and potentially dangerous. I immediately lose respect for parents when I see them doing this and I look forward to the day that we finally put some protection in place for these poor kids whose parents probably only had them so that they could try to become TikTok famous.",

      "content_preview": "So, I'm a bit miffed at my childminder, but my partner isn't and I don't think my view is unreasonable through the sheer principle. Childminder does invoices after each month, gives them out usually in the first week of the next month but can be done on a 4 weekly basis. Childminder has been on holiday since last Thursday and came back to work yesterday. This has been during school holidays as you'd know. So We have to pay out childminder, even when shes on holiday. Which to me doesn't make sense, as she isn't providing the service we pay for as shes not there. I was told it's to keep our kid's place, but to me that only makes sense if there's a place to take, which there isn't as the childminder isn't open. And, I was told its due to being self employed, as usual workers like me get holiday pay. Not being funny, but its her choice to be self employed. 2) she has no children, but takes the holiday during school holidays. 3) This holiday time, has fallen within the last month's invoice which was entirely school holidays. Which we don't get any funding for, so pay full rate. So, I'm paying even though im not getting service, paying while shes on holiday, but actually paying extra to her whiles shes on holiday due to school holidays. It feels cheeky, to get clients to pay you while you're not open, but more cheeky when you're purposefully taking it at a time which will cost us more. I would understand it, if i had to pay while we took our kid on holiday to keep a place paid while it wasn't being used. But not when the place cant be used as the childminder has closed. Is my way of thinking unreasonable? I've spoken to older people in my family and they've said this never used to be a thing for childminders but my partner says its fine. Costing us double what it would normally, and shes not even there to look after our child for that double monthly cost",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I am trying to make sense of the 30 hours free childcare system. My partner is in fulltime work earning under 100k. I am currently working only 10 hours per week but aiming to push it up to 16hours per week in order to be eligible for 30 hours free. Basically I am wondering how the system works and how eligibility changes if weekly working hours fluctuate between 16 hours and below on a monthly basis. Appreciate any advice on this. Hope it makes sense! thank you",

      "content_preview": "Wife (Bulgarian only speaks to him in this language), Me (Brit only speaks in English, maybe the odd bit of Bulgarian), have a 2yo (well, 23 months) and he can only say 'Mumma'. We are actively trying to encourage him to speak and he can make some sort of noises, i.e. a dog is 'Ra ra' and Water is 'du du' but most of the time he just sort of nods and goes a bit shy. Now, we know he can understand very well, his comprehension is fantastic. We have picture books and ill say 'find the cat, dog, hat, bike, car, hat, bag' etc and he'll open the book up, go to the right page and point with a good degree of confidence. My wife will do the same but in Bulgarian and it's pretty 1:1. I am also trying to teach him the e-drums which he loves. When I say 'hit the snare, hit the hi-hat' I can see him thinking about it and then he'll hit the right one usually. I would say he knows around 75+ objects in both languages so we're not worried about that, but when I ask him 'what sound does this animal make' I can see him trying to speak, but he just can't do it. You see his thought process and moving his lips, but he'll either whisper, or just babble (which is great). When he babbles and we actively let him do this and try to steer him in the right direction, but he just can't seem to get it out. This is highly frustrating because he is constantly trying to tell us stuff by pointing, making noises and doing signs. When he needs a wee, he will point to his nappy, when he wants the cat in, he'll make the cat sound and point at the door and when he needs water he'll make the 'du du' sound. Even when I asked him what sound does a cow make, and he did the sign language for cow (something I think they encourage in nursery) but did not do any noise. Any idea or advice which we could do to help encourage him more? His best friend is 2.5yo and he vocabulary and speech is phenomenal and they spend alot of time together, I was hoping it would rub off (we don't compare, we're very proud of his friend!) Thanks!

My daughter has a code she was given when she initially started nursery (June) I reconfirmed her code a while ago & just went online to check and it doesn't give me an option to reconfirm it as it states this is still valid & it's not time to reconfirm yet.

So far we planned; 1- lots of snacks for the older one 2- sling for the younger one 3- mess free colouring books for the older one 4- earplugs for anyone who complains if one of them cries a lot 5- a few aisle walks with the older one when the lights are on 6- a few favourite books 7- a few episodes of peppa pig and dancing fruit in a tablet Is anything else you can recommend? They are normally behaving kids but I am nervous about the older one kicking off. I see some paid games to play in a tablet, are there any magical ones that will keep a 21 month entertained on a plane if she is unhappy? Or any other tricks/tips you can recommend? Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "Hi. My 2yo likes having Heinz baby porridge each morning, but they seem to have changed from a 220g tin to a 125g box, and charging 2/3s of the cost. We already went through more than a tin a week for him, so now we'll be going through 2-3 boxes of it. Has anyone got a decent alternative that isn't as expensive? He won't each Reddy Brek just yet (gonna jeep trying to get him into it). Thanks.",

      "content_preview": "I’ve just got back from a week away down in Devon with my daughter (and my mum) and I am seriously down, like near to tears. We had such a fun time together and I’m going to miss her like hell this week (I’m sure I’ll be fine thereafter…). She goes to nursery 4 days a week so it’s obviously rare we spend so much time together - and I LOVE what she gets out of going there and she absolutely adores it so it’s not really about me wishing I was a SAHM. I dunno. Time goes so fast and she’ll be at school from next September - I adore her and I guess I know my days are numbered where I’m the centre of her world and she’ll get such joy out of going on a steam train or wanting an ice cream. Ever since I brought her home from the hospital I’ve mourned the time that hasn’t passed yet. I try really hard to be in the moment - and I am - but sometimes it’s so overwhelming the insane highs and lows of being a parent.",

      "content_preview": "I have a 2 year old that’s in nursery full time. She loves her current nursery (the staff mostly!) but is an outdoorsy kid so we’re now introducing 2 days at an outdoor nursery. We’ve talked about it a lot and done her settling in sessions and are really happy with the outdoor nursery. However I’m finding the settling much harder at this age as opposed to when she started at 1. She’s obviously much more aware of what is going on and the changes. I really believe in the benefits the outdoor nursery will bring her and also having some variety in her week but I’m worried about disrupting her routine. Has anyone else settled into a new nursery / have dual settings at toddler stage and have any tips / positive stories? Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "Okay so. I have a 18 month old and a 4.5 year old and breakfast is currently driving me nuts every morning, especially since the older one is starting school tomorrow! So for background, the older one has always been fussy with food. He will eat decent amounts of the foods he likes but usually won’t try or will try the smallest lick and then say he doesn’t like it of any new food. He also doesn’t like mess, on himself or anyone else (eg he hates it when the baby is eating a yoghurt and gets some down her face, or if he gets butter or something on his hands he will flap until I clean it off) Anyway, current breakfast set up is me and older on stools at the breakfast bar (we don’t have a table) and baby in her highchair next to us. The issue is that it doesn’t matter if she watches me put the food on both plates; eg this morning I cut up half a banana and half a bagel on each and gave them both a yoghurt, she will want his. And will scream and thrash in the highchair until I get her out and she can climb up on the sofa to reach the bar and eat from his plate. Which he will then refuse to eat as it’s ‘yucky’ once she’s touched it. In the holidays this hasn’t been so much of an issue as I’ve been able to do decent morning snacks to make up for not much breakfast but with school looming I can’t do this. My current option seem to be, get the older one to speed eat before the screaming in the highchair gets too loud, which is unpleasant for everyone. Any better suggestions greatly appreciated!",

I just have a feeling I’ve got it, or going to get it. I rehearse being told, what I will say, how I will feel. I see images of myself having treatment and having to tell my young children I’m going to die 😭 I’m checking my body daily for lumps. I don’t know how much longer I can live this way because it’s making me feel so miserable. The statistics of cancer are terrifying and I’ve accepted I will get it, I just don’t want to spend every day worrying when it’s going to appear. Is this just coincidence that the obsession / fear started after I had my son or is it linked to post partum hormones somehow?",
