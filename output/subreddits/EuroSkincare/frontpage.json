While I acknowledge the importance of SPF for me, and know that UVB also plays a role in aging, I have realised after reviewing the P20 sunscreens, that in the urban defence one, the first two filter high up on the ingredient list are UVB filters, which may be contributing to the high SPF value. Wondering if to increase cosmetic elegancy while maintaining ppd protection, I can find a sunscreen with high UVA/PF but low SPF?",

I started taking isotretinoin and it became my favourite moisturiser, but of course Eucerin had to repackage and reformulate it. Now it comes in a 40 ml tube instead of a 50 ml airless pump container which I loved and I noticed that they changed ingredients a bit. Now I'm worried it will be worse and I'm contemplating stocking on the older version while it's still available, but I wanted to ask, if the reformulation is noticeable.",

I shower regularly, I clean my armpits well and I apply deodorant straight out of the shower and still find myself smelling as soon as I sweat. I've tried: Wild, Mitchum spray on, Dove roll on, Dove spray on, Sure spray to name a few. Any recommendations for products to help? thank you :)",

      "content_preview": "I'm going to talk about my experiences with the Transparent lab Cica repairing balm and the Cica repairing gel. For reference, my skin is normal leaning dry most times of the year, but it's just dry in the winter. I'm also dehydration prone and acne-prone. About 2 weeks ago when I finished the balm I had been using, I tried Transparent's, thinking it would be a good alternative to LRP cicaplast baume. Consistency wise, it's actually a lot stiffer then cicaplast and harder to rub in, which I don't necessarily mind. The problem was, it was just irritating for me. It burned each time I put it on, pretty badly. Mind you, my skin normally isn't prone to irritation. Sometimes certain sunscreens burn my eyes, but that's about it. My skin barrier was in good condition when I tried it aswell. Not sure what about this set my skin off, but I can't say it's a bad product or anything. Irritation is very personal, but I didn't expect it from a balm. I used it twice before stopping because the burning was that bad. I gave my skin a few days rest before moving on to try the gel. Now, the gel. Surprisingly, the gel is more similar in texture to cicaplast baume then the actual balm was, so I ended up using it like a balm, at the end of my skincare routine. At first, I really liked it because of the similar feel, not to mention it rubbed in much more easily that cicaplast. It was going really well, it felt nice, calmed my skin and was in a decent size package. But guess what just started happening in the last few days? It began to irritate my skin just like the balm! I feel like I've been really unlucky with this brand so far, lol. I know it's probably just my skin, but I was curious to if anyone else was getting irritation with these products? I know a lot of people swear by the ordinary's barrier support serum, but there's a lot of people that find it irritating, so I'm wondering if these two products are similarly hit or miss with people in that regard too.",

I am looking for something high spf and high pa + rating. good acne prone oily skin Must be water and sweat proof. Suitable for a swimming and an overall active outdoor lifestyle.

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/beiersforf-s-dna-methylation-shenanigans-are-now-available-v0-bk7sevue95kf1.png Earlier this year Beiersdorf introduced Epicelline (INCI: dihydromyricetin), a flavonoid that is sourced from the Vine Tea( Nekemias grossedentata ) plant. It supposedly inhibits the DNA methylation processess of the skin cells in a way that causes them to behave younger than they actually are. Here ist the Patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2022096195A1/en Note that it doesn¬¥t disclose the stabilisation and delivery systems they used to get it to work, if it does. Here is some of the research that Beiersdorf published to explain their science: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2023.1258183/full https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2023.1258184/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exd.70005 The active was first launched trough Eucerin, and is to be found in their Hyaluron Filler Epigenetic Serum. In that fomula its combined with Licorice root and Soy extracts to supplement its HA and collagen boosting properties. it also shared the strong scent with the Hyaluron Filler + Elasticity range. I used it and would have really liked it if it wasn¬¥t for the strong fragrance and the odd, filmy way it dried down. Personally, I¬¥ve seen results after ca. 3 weeks, one of the few that visibly reduced my mimic lines around my eyes. I can¬¥t say if it was the serum that did that though, it¬¥s far from the only anti-age treatment I used. So it could be just a placebo effect or a combination of multiple, unrelated, factors. The Nivea version is simpler by comparison, having only Epicelline as the active. I¬¥m using it for 2 weeks now and I actually like it more then the Eucerin one. The Parfum is much subtler(and I get what they were trying to cover up, the product has a sligtly sulfury scent - i¬¥m kinda into it but I can see people being put off by it). It spreads more nicely, has a more comfortable and hydrating skin feel and the packaging seems to also be higher quality. Has anyone else tried it? They had a huge marketing push for it (at least here in Germany), and I was wondering If anyone else has experiences to share.",
