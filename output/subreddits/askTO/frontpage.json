Every transitional housing program I have tried to contact has a months if not years long waitlist, and I am unable to make phone calls, so I do not know what I can do to survive here. If anyone is aware of and can share (queer-friendly) resources that would urgently help me, I would be so grateful. I know beggars can‚Äôt be choosers, but I also would particularly appreciate any resources that would give me a private space to sleep/live so that I could have some privacy, especially with my health issues and for work calls.

Someone asked me \"how do you fall asleep with all those gun shots?\" I feel like crime happens everywhere in the GTA but in my experience, Scarborough is seen as some rough place to live in.

      "content_preview": "For some context, I'm [30 F] a new immigrant in Toronto. Came here from a Middle Eastern country around a year ago. I've gone out with quite a few men of different backgrounds, maybe 15 in total. This includes both non-Canadian newcomers and Canadians who were born and raised here. I had mostly positive experiences with all of these men but didn't see any potential there, so our dates remained casual... in my perspective, at least. Every single Canadian I went out with has told me they \"like me\" by the second or third date. Conversely, only one immigrant did that. Rationally, I don't think every single of of these men genuinely had a crush on me. The number of times this has happened makes me take the expression \"I like you\" with a grain of salt, and I'm starting to think there might be a cultural difference in how we understand this expression Back home, it would be odd for someone to tell you they like you so quickly. When you \"like someone\", you're basically open to the idea of eventually falling for them. It's a precursor to potential commitment. People tend to think twice before declaring this to a person they are dating. All of my friends from back home agree that they would have felt just as awkward if they heard it on the 2nd/3rd date. So, my question is, what connotation does the expression \"I like you\" have here in Canada/Toronto? When would you usually tell someone you like them? Does it carry the same weight I described above?  I appreciate your perspectives!",

Short walk from station to work (5 mins). Total all in: 1 hour. Of course if I miss the bus or there is one of the 1000 delays on the subway, it‚Äôs closer to an 1:15.

My monthly cost is $350 - $400 / month for electricity, water, and heating and cooling. I asked several neighbours to share their bills to find out if my meter is broken and it seems that I am the only one who‚Äôs paying this amount despite how small my condo unit is. I brought this to my property manager‚Äôs attention to look into it, however, they are not very helpful. I have also taken the initiative to call the submetering company Carma billing to take a deep dive into the bill. They sent a technician to check my meters and then claimed my meters were working fine within 15min, and charge me a flat rate of $350. Which is wildly frustrating and ridiculous. My total utility bill this month is $800‚Ä¶. Meanwhile, the bill shows my kwh usage is upwards to 2200 per month, which makes no sense for a small unit. Especially when I am comparing all my neighbor‚Äôs bills no one‚Äôs kwh usage is this high. I have contacted OEB, and they are not able to provide any support on this issue. I feel completely helpless and have no idea where else I can go to bring this to. I am a single female in my early 30s struggling to put bread on the table and now I have have to deal with this ridiculous monthly bill. Temperature sits at 72 / fan on Low‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm looking to seek advice on what I can do to escalate this issue as I felt like I‚Äôve reached a point where I feel like I‚Äôve hit a wall. I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs ethical to charge such a high bill on such a small unit. I am pleading to get some eyes on this and bring this case to bring awareness. As I‚Äôve been told that Hydro billing is not governed properly in condos.",

Symptoms started Saturday evening and have been very COVID or flu-like (fatigue, body aches, mild headache, chills, runny nose, sore throat, and now a new one is dry cough) but I tested negative on antigen tests twice now. I do repeated tests because last time I had COVID, it didn't show up till the 3rd test and by then I was very sick. I'll do a third and final test later today even though I'm feeling so much better (so it's unlikely to show positive, I would think). At this point I don't think it's COVID also because it moved much quicker than COVID did, based on the 2x I've had it. Just wondering if the flu or some sort of other virus is actually going around right now because it's so rare to get the flu in summer. I don't know anyone else who was/is sick so no idea where I caught it. This one really knocked me out!",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I'm planning to move from the Los Angeles area to the Toronto area in October. I currently live in Pasadena, just to the northeast of Los Angeles itself. I love it here (reasons detailed below) and would love to find a similar situation in the GTA, but I don't know enough about the city, so I'm hoping y'all can offer some perspective (maybe someone has done a similar move)! Things that don't matter to me: I'm not really an outdoor activities kind of person, so while I do love some nice scenery, \"access to nature\" isn't that important to me. I'm definitely not a sports person. I work from home, so commute time isn't a concern. I'd rather live farther from downtown Toronto and have more space and quiet for my dollar. I'm not afraid of the cold. I live in southern California now, but I grew up in the US Midwest with winter temperatures regularly in the single digits F and honestly I miss the seasons. I'm not looking to purchase a home anytime in the next several years. Things that do matter to me (aka what I like about where I currently live): Access to the city by public transit. I don't go to downtown Los Angeles itself often, but I love that when I do go downtown for a concert or something, I have just a 5 minute drive to the light rail park and ride. The train ride itself takes 35 minutes to an hour, but I don't mind that at all since I don't do it every day. Local food options that aren't large chains. One of my favorite things about Pasadena is that it's a small city in its own right, so I have plenty of interesting single or local-chain restaurants serving all sorts of food from different parts of the world within a 10-20 minute drive. Housing/neighborhood quality. When I'm not visiting friends or attending a concert/arts event of some kind, I'm home the vast majority of the time, so space, quiet, and comfort are priorities over proximity to activities. I don't care much about luxury , but I love that my current place (700sqft/65m 2 , 2 bedroom ADU) has no shared walls, space for a friend to stay, simple but up-to-date kitchen, in unit laundry, those kinds of things. If that sort of arrangement simply isn't practical in the GTA, I'm not dead set against an apartment, but I do play musical instruments and like being able to practice without disturbing neighbors. Price. I'm looking at a CAD $2,000 - $2,500 budget for rent. Obligatory I do understand that compromises have to be made. I'd appreciate whatever thoughts you have on general areas I might want to focus my search. (Also, I apologize for whatever obvious American blind spot is on full display here, but I suppose I won't know what that is until the comments point it out.)",

Reason is I don't like touristy things, not that they are bad but I like to experience places based on what locals do, to try to capture the essence of the city. So I don't want to go the CN tower, Ripley's aquarium, distillery district, etc. When googling what to do, I only get these recommendations. I rather go to a local coffee shop/restaurant and walk around the neighborhood. So walking tours are my favorite thing as someone is explaining the history and cool facts of the area. I've been to Toronto before and I stayed mostly downtown, so I'm open to going to different places. I'll also be driving so can go anywhere. I love comedy and went to the Second City last time, and it was my favorite thing from the trip, so I'm definetely going back. I'm wondering if there are other comedy clubs that I should go? So what would you say is a must do activity in Toronto? TIA, love from Montreal!",

I just had something happen to me that has me a bit frazzled also as I'm getting older and as someone who, unfortunately, has always been non-confrontational, I just freeze. Earlier today, around 1pm, I was walking west on Wellesley to go meet someone for coffee. As I'm walking three people come up from behind and pouring water all over me and then circle me and begin cussing me out. They had me circled so I had no way to escape. I'm not tough by any mean; even though I'm not that old I have limited mobility; plus, again, I freeze in situations like this - that's a story in itself. (Feel free to judge me, it's just the way I am and I wish I wasn't.) Thankfully they eventually just walked away. I went back to the closest major intersection and called my friend to come get me. Again, thankfully I haven't encountered situations like this. I did call the non-emergency line to report what happen after my friend came and got me. I'm curious as to what you would all do/recommend doing in these types of situations.",

      "content_preview": "I'm in the middle of a really bizarre and stressful fraud situation with TD Bank and I'm hoping someone here might have some insight or similar experiences. I'm out $1,260 and I'm worried TD will deny my claim. I checked my banking app around 8 PM on the same day, and saw three fraudulent transactions: two ATM withdrawals ($450 and $550) and a Shoppers Drug Mart purchase ($261.25). I called TD immediately. Here's where it gets weird. When the rep asked me to read my card number for verification, he told me the card I had in my wallet wasn't mine. It was registered to a \"Mr. Ming.\" It appears that my card had been physically swapped without me knowing. The fraud department confirmed my stolen card was used with chip-and-PIN for all transactions. The next day, I went to a TD branch to get a new card as instructed. The teller, on the phone with the fraud department, was told to dispose of the swapped card. I objected, saying it was physical evidence, but she said she had to follow instructions and threw it in the bin. A day later, TD's fraud team gave me the locations and times of the fraud. The ATM withdrawals were at 4:22 PM at 50 Provost Drive, and the Shoppers purchase was at 4:40 PM at 4865 Leslie Street. My heart sank when I realized I was at the IKEA at 15 Provost Drive around that time. I have a receipt from IKEA at 4:01 PM and left the store around 4:30 PM. The proximity is undeniable. I already filed a police report with all this info. I suspect that my card was swapped/stolen while I was at IKEA. Here's the part I can't wrap my head around and where I need your help: I didn't use my TD card or enter my PIN at all while at IKEA. I paid with a different card using tap. My PIN is secure, not written down anywhere, not a birthdate, etc. The only other times (this month) I used my debit card and PIN was a week ago at Rexall (in galleria mall) and then 3 weeks ago at Yip's fruit market. How on earth did they get my PIN??? I'm worried TD will deny my claim because it was a chip-and-PIN transaction which seems to be in line other redditors' experience, often having to escalate or involve media/public attention. Has anyone experienced a physical card swap scam like this? Any theories on how the PIN could have been compromised before¬†the card was stolen (maybe shimming at a terminal I used previously, or an internal issue at the bank)? Any advice on how to handle the claim with TD would be hugely appreciated. TL;DR: My TD debit card was physically swapped for a stranger's card while I was at IKEA. Fraudsters immediately used my real card with my secure PIN at a nearby ATM and store, even though I never entered my PIN that day. TD then had the branch dispose of the swapped card (the evidence). Looking for advice on how this is possible and how to ensure TD refunds me.",

How much did you pay out of pocket vs. anything a private drug plan might‚Äôve covered? Shoppers is quoting me $204 per dose (need 2) plus $20 each time to administer the shots. My private insurer denied coverage. Tired of watching my Gen X and Millennial friends under 50 get painful shingles infections one by one, as the last generations to have chickenpox infections as kids (before the introduction of the varicella vaccine in 1998).",
