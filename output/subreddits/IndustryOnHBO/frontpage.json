      "content_preview": "Hello everyone! We've become a very big sub. We're at 37K readers, and I expect it to rise even more once Season 4 drops. I am currently the only active mod here, and I’m trying my best. I have a full-time job outside of this, and it's hard. Today I decided to catch up and check reports, and my word, some of this behavior is unacceptable! I am cleaning houset today. Permanent bans have been issued to repeat offenders. I thought between seasons it would be pretty quiet, but I was wrong. I also expect things to ramp back up sometime next year, and I will be proactive about keeping the negativity out. Closer to the season start, I may start recruiting more mods because this is a large sub and I need help. For now, I’m okay with managing it. Also, please use this post to let me know what you would like to see in this sub going forward: flair requests, grievances/complaints,and any constructive feedback is very much appreciated. Below are the new rules going forward. Let me know your thoughts, concerns, and opinions. Rules going forward: Any low-effort “I hate Harper” posts will be removed automatically. At this point, it’s beating a dead horse, and most of those posts reek of thinly veiled dog whistles. People are here to discuss a show they enjoy, and no one wants to see that crap. Especially now with what's happening in the world. Racist posts of any kind will NOT be tolerated. Automatic ban. Mark posts that contain spoilers, especially if your spoiler is in the title. This will get you banned, and repeat offenders will be permanently banned.",

I have watched the episode twice and have gone back and forth with ChatGPT over and over and I am still without clarity. Maybe show experts and/or finance experts can help me. My questions are: When Eric says “I executed for you before the close”, does that mean when Harper clicked sell for the 140k loss, it had to be “fully” executed later by Eric, and by that time the currency values had shifted to a favorable position to make money instead of lose money on the trade? Did Nicole Craig later make the trade that Harper pitched to her at her niece’s play? Is that what turned the 140k loss into profit? Or did that not actually happen and when Eric said “what did you do?” It was just to show the lengths Harper went to to save her ass? Or was the show ambiguous and actually did not show the viewer what happened? I say this because if Eric “saved” her, why did he say “I would have never known [if you didn’t tell me you made a mistake]”? If someone could have explain how the loss turned to profit and if it was just by luck or something that Eric, or Nicole did, I’d be grateful!",

I’m sure many more people caught this but this is what makes this so so genius.",

Yas again Why on earth did Yas tell her husband-to-be she just slept with another man. If she announces a pregnancy soon his first thought will be, 'whose is it?' Was it a moment of weakness as she thought she was suspected anyway as she could have been spied on, or was there some context I missed like her husband can't have kids or something.",

      "content_preview": "It's so interesting how first-time watchers of Industry are always laser-focused on how much Harper \"sucks\" as a character during their initial watch. Like, it's almost predictable at this point. But what's wild is that no one ever directs that same level of scrutiny toward the rest of the cast, and this is a show literally built on the backs of deeply flawed people. The entire series is a pressure cooker of addiction, coked with fragile egos, but somehow Harper becomes the lightning rod for all the criticism. Why? Like I really want to know why????? It's beyond misogynoir at this point. Like, could it be a projection of your inadequacy? Like, I don't get why people don't switch it up and critique someone like Rob for a change. Honestly, if we're being real, Rob in season 1, and even more glaringly in season 2, felt like one of the most one-dimensional characters in the bunch. He was by far the least driven, skating by on whiteness and proximity. The only reason he stayed afloat was because of his background and how others constantly insulated him from the consequences of his own passivity. He's the quintessential \"soft chaos\" character, never really pushing the narrative forward, mostly just reacting, spiraling, and leaning into his vices without any clear arc of growth or purpose. But people seem to give him a pass. Why? Because he's good-looking? Because his pain is presented as more palatable? Because he doesn't threaten the dynamics in the same way Harper does? Or maybe because he mirrors your own inadequacy??? And don't get me wrong, Harper makes plenty of reckless, frustrating decisions. But she's constantly moving. She drives the story. She takes risks. She's ambitious to a fault, sure, but at least she wants something, which is more than you can say for half the characters in that office. And if I am being honest, I won't miss him ...Sorry, stone me if you have to, but that is my truth and I am sticking to it!!!",
