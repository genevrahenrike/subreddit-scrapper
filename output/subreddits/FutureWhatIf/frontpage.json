The new media ecosystem only exacerbates the problem; former Trump loyalists now descend into an echo chamber of likeminded ideas.

That being said, they intend to ‚Äúsubmit the United States to Christ‚Äôs lordship‚Äù but insist that Trump and MAGA ‚Äúpervert‚Äù Christ‚Äôs teachings.

He promises to continue Trump's legacy. Spontaneous celebrations erupt across the nation's major cities, particularly in blue states. However, the next day, Eric Trump releases a statement purportedly written by Trump on TruthSocial. In it, Trump claims that he is being attacked by the Deep State and has had to go into hiding, but promises his supporters that he will return. Large swathes of his supporters, left despondent from the news of his death, latch on to this claim. Many take to calling President Vance \"Acting President\". A few claim to have received secret messages from Trump. President Vance, of course, dismisses the statement as a fabrication, leading to a significant loss of support from Trump's most ardent supporters. Where do the Republicans go from here? Will the party splinter between mainstream conservatives and Trump believers? Does the \"Trump Lives\" movement eventually die out, or could it become a new religion?",

      "content_preview": "A MAGA member of Congress starts to become more popular in the party and quickly becomes seen as a worthy successor to Trump. Trump, unable to handle anyone being more liked than him, stages his assassination. While a normal person is revealed as the one who pulled the trigger, Trump then leverages the situation to enact a revenge campaign and target potential co-conspirators. It quickly devolves into targeting all Democrat politicians, then people who support leftist ideologies on social media, before eventually going after all minority groups. These people are soon all rounded up, tortured into giving false confessions, and then executed. For historical context, this is something that Stalin did from 1936 to 1938. Known as the ‚ÄúGreat Purge‚Äù, it resulted in the deaths of over 700,000 people. And considering we all just saw (again) who Trump idolizes‚Ä¶",

If they invade (say by the end of the year to keep it simple) how does the world respond? Does trump hammer Venezuela into a pancake, does Lula in Brazil support Venezuela?

Those people, include: Kamala Harris Mike Pence Elon Musk Mitt Romney Nikki Haley John Bolton Liz Cheney Those mentioned in the list (and a few others) will likely be threatened with deportation, and if they resist, Trump will either send the National Guard or encourage his supporters to hunt them down and murder them, and will ignore the constitution by doing so. He even does so without a congress or senate vote. Yep, such a move will result in major outcry, so much that it sets the ground for a THIRD impeachment.",

In other words, we‚Äôre looking at rogue American military personnel continuing to fight their own war in Afghanistan without Congressional approval.

      "content_preview": "Sometime between now and December, photos and videos emerge on social media, showing Russian speaking mercenaries landing on US soil and conducting patrols and military operations in various parts of the United States alongside law enforcement officers in various states. Horrified Independent internet sleuths conclude that these are members of Wagner Group, a Russian PMC. But no, this isn‚Äôt an invasion of the United States by Russia. At least, not according to the Trump Administration. Turns out, the US formally AUTHORIZED the deployment; apparently Wagner had been ‚Äúrecruited‚Äù by someone in Trump‚Äôs cabinet formed a task force to ‚Äúpermanently deal with‚Äù enemies of the state on American soil in the wake of the ‚ÄúTrump died‚Äù rumors. The narrative is that ‚Äútraitors in the US‚Äù were behind Trump‚Äôs disappearance and that Russia had been called to help ‚Äúfind‚Äù Donald Trump, in addition to locating and arresting and/or eliminating anyone who might have been ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdisappearance.‚Äù The deployment of the PMCs to America is part of this do-called joint op. The stage is set for a Second American Revolution (if not a Second American Civil War).",
