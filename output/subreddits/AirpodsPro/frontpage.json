      "content_preview": "Had original AirPod pros for a few years. Recently the right AirPod plays  fuzzy noise whenever on transparent or noise cancelation mode. It happens 90% of the time and the other 10% it works fine then the fuzzy noise eventually plays. I’ve tried cleaning the right AirPod with no luck at fixing it. I believe this issue is coming from the mic on the right AirPod bc I don’t think it functions well. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",

I’d be on a call, and the microphone will unexpectedly stop working, then when I’m listening to music, they will just disconnect from my phone. It’ll show that it’s connected, but nothing plays and there is no option to reroute audio to the AirPods. Now, they have developed a REALLY annoying static that is driving me insane. Is anyone else experiencing these problems?",

While this morning i realized my airpod (the left one) just stopped working and i couldn't get the case to activate when i pulled it out. So i messed with it by taking it in and out trying to get the amber light to come on and it just wouldn't budge. I came home after a long day of only using my right one, which was annoying to say the least, and i decided ill check the case maybe the wire got disconnected on the left side. So i opened it and everything seemed normal. Then i remembered that the left one fell out the other day while i was walking my dogs so i opened it and low and behold, the magnet in the top of the earpiece was loose on the speaker and the battery looking like the small chews for gum. They are usually a nice little square so i compared it to my right and confirmed that it indeed was inflated. So im just wondering what can i do about this whole situation?",

      "content_preview": "I know I’m not the only one. I’ve had a long-term issue with my AirPods Pro 2nd generation. I’ve experienced persistent and severe audio drifting (panning) between the left and right AirPods, along with random boosts in volume and frequencies. It can last anywhere from 5 seconds to a minute at a time; however, it can continuously re-occur throughout the entire day, in bursts. This has seriously made using my AirPods nearly impossible to use for everyday listening - regardless of what content I’m listening to, music, tv shows, movies, YouTube videos, FaceTime, or phone calls. It continues to happen regardless of the listening mode engaged (Off, Transparency, Adaptive Audio, or Noise Cancelling). It also persists even if the output of audio is set to mono within the accessibility settings. I’ve tried enabling mono audio (and in other instances, Spatial Audio with head tracking to manually physically adjust the panning) while the AirPods were drifting, but it continued to shift. Over the past two years, I’ve: Had 4 separate pairs of AirPods Pro 2 units replaced, all with the same issue. Upgraded my iPhone twice, got a new MacBook Pro (set up all the new devices from scratch, not logging in to iCloud) - No improvement. Updated all my devices to the latest software versions, including AirPods. Turned OFF Spatial Audio, Head tracking, automatic switching, conversation awareness, personalized volume, ear detection, and deleted any personalized audio profiles, alongside accessibility audio options. Tried factory resetting my AirPods over 100s of times, forgetting them from my iCloud account, and re-pairing from scratch. Changed tips, cleaned AirPods thoroughly, and tested across multiple locations (indoors, outdoors, in loud and quiet environments, standing still, walking, lying down, etc.). Verified that the issue only happens on my Apple devices (iPhone, Mac, my now ex Apple Watch) - but the AirPods work perfectly fine and don’t have any drifting issues when paired to my Nintendo Switch 2, or any other Android devices or TV/PC. I’ve even tried using one apple device at a time by fully shutting off all other devices along with their bluetooth, to no avail. None of this worked and just added to my frustration. Despite all of this troubleshooting, Apple Support and Genius Bar specialists have only offered basic troubleshooting, including cleaning guides, restarting the AirPods, performing OTA/in person diagnostic tests, or suggesting that I buy yet another replacement. This is not a solution when the issue goes far beyond isolated hardware. At one point, I strongly suspected it was a firmware-related issue or a deep software or cloud-based problem, related to how Apple devices are handling the AirPods Pro 2. I thought that it’s maybe an audio profile somewhere that is potentially corrupted or not working as expected, that is applied to my Apple account/iCloud, which is causing all of this. However, I could be wrong. No one at Apple has been able to offer further insight or escalate the case, and I’m fed up and exhausted. No one seems to know what the issue is or offer even a temporary fix - how will I know these issues won’t carry over to another set of devices? Like the next generation of AirPods Pro?! I’ve been in contact with top specialists at Apple whom I’ve supplied timestamps to when the issue occured, and provided iPhone system diagnostics to apple. They referred my info to apple’s AirPods Pro engineering team. They have no clue. As per our last conversation, They just recommended that I keep my iOS and AirPods software up to date… I was about to rip my hair out. I’ve had enough. Im just gonna go to a different brand instead. This is ridiculous.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I’ve got a question for people using AirPods Pro 2 with an iPhone 15 Pro Max . I’ve had the phone for over a year now, and since the beginning I’ve been dealing with a really annoying issue during calls – the audio keeps jumping from one earbud to the other. It sounds like some kind of weird spatial effect with crackling. It happens both in quiet and noisy environments. I’ve tried using other headphones as well, and the exact same thing happens, so it seems to be an issue with the phone itself. I already tried resetting, restoring the phone, and following all the guides I could find, but nothing helped. Interestingly, it doesn’t happen when listening to music. It mostly occurs during calls (regular phone calls, Messenger, WhatsApp, FaceTime), and I also noticed it recently when listening to a podcast on YouTube. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any ideas on how to fix it?",
