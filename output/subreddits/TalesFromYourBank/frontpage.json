I have been on the fence about leaving and taking a business development position position with my old company I worked at before this and leaving banking altogether. Any advice? Forgot to add: they initially asked me to transfer and I said no then they basically said I have to go because it is a business need and in my contract that I can be moved to any branch within 30 miles at anytime.",

Pay is $23/hour, and the role includes orientation, mentor days at the Broad Ripple Banking Center, and a 3-day training at the Daleville Data Center.I’ve never worked in a bank before, but I have customer service experience, and this seems like a good way to learn banking basics and potentially grow. For anyone with banking experience or who’s worked at First Merchants Bank: What’s the day-to-day like? How is the training and mentorship? Are there chances to move to full-time or advance? How’s the work-life balance for part-time hours? Would love any advice or insights — thanks!",

The CD was renewed by another banker at 8:30am (before business hours) the next day.  Wrong.....everything.  This does not even seem legal.  I have absolutely no beef with this random and I feel like escalation might end up in termination.  I asked management for guidance and was told \"oh well, next time\".  Next time what?  My only recourse is a formal complaint on behalf of the client who is mad at me for some reason.  I mean....damn wtf is wrong with bankers.  What would you do? EDIT: Thank you to every one who responded.  The comments were really helpful and I know what I have to do.  The CD would have to be closed and the penalty waived to \"cover up\" the unethical action of my colleague, but I will go through the proper procedure of submitting a formal complaint per client request. It's the right thing to do and I'm going to find out how ethical my institution is depending on how it's handled.",

      "content_preview": "I work at a large national bank as a business loan specialist, and I have to rant because the influence of social media just keeps making this role more unbearable. Regulation B is the biggest reason why. I get why it’s a thing, but honestly it causes more harm than good in my situation. We take inbound calls in my department.  We service the nation so I talk to small business owners across the US. While they’re the backbone of our economy, some small business owners are as dumb as rocks. I get multiple calls on a daily basis that can be shut down easily, but having to follow Reg B is what makes it brutal. Having to listen to some of these people talk and think they’re smarter than me is so frustrating that it’s hilarious. Multiple times a day I hear things like “I was told I can get $150k with no credit check or financial check”, “Why do you have to run my credit, it’s under my business’s name”, and “Trump said you have to give me this money since I’m a small business”. All of our calls are recorded and monitored, so I can’t hang up on them as much as I would love to. Most of our calls come from people who see false marketing on social media and fall for it. All the TikTok finance “gurus” and “business consultants” (course sellers) love saying that the bank I work for gives easy approvals to all businesses. Even when explaining to clients that it’s not the case at all, some even try to say that I am hiding the information from them so they don’t benefit from it. Start ups are the most annoying. Most national banks don’t lend to businesses under 2 years, but the fact that we can’t just say that baffles me. Yes we have guidelines that we read to them where we say VERY CLEARLY that in order to get an approval, you have to be up and running for 2 years or more. It’s like it goes one ear and out the other. In most cases, they choose to apply anyways. I just have to sit there with this misinformed person and help them submit their application knowing that they’ll get declined, and that they will probably be worse off now that they have an unnecessary inquiry on their credit report. They ask me so many times for advice and what I think they’re should do when on the phone, I just can’t say anything because I’d be breaking federal regulations. Not being able to guide a client is stupid as well. I get that a lot of people in this industry are terrible people but at the end of the day not everyone is. My goal is not to leach off a client and just make a sale but to make sure they get the solution they need. I have a lot of cases where people apply and get approved for a line of credit… to purchase a vehicle for their business. It is a terrible feeling watching people be so happy before they get into financial trouble from not being careful with their funds. Yes you can argue that they need to do their own research and know this to be successful, but that simply just isn’t the case always. There’s a reason why about 50% of small businesses don’t make it past the 5th year. We should be able to help and advise when help is needed.",

I’m wanting to know if other banks offer similar pay ranges for less work. I’m also the only full time teller at my branch right now with one part time teller who works for 3 hours a day. So , they are expecting these goals to be hit daily while also giving chick fil a customer service so that we get a good client experience rating. Our rates for HYSA SUCK and so do our CD rates.

From what I can describe here, it has nothing but boot camp. They want you to be smiling at all times, asking them how your day is going, asking them if they use their mobile app or atm, ask them if they spoke to a banker, while also being fast, while also being accurate and efficient, while also taking your time to not mess up, with every.single. customer. If you dont do this once, you will get a check in and told your not making a memorable experience for the customer and your not being consistant. Most of our customers are eldery people, who do not want and do not like using the app, and I see them all the time every day, I know them, they do not like being asked. But if I ask I risk annoying them, but if I dont ask everytime im not doing my job. My numbers are all extremely high also, but because Im not grinning ear to ear at all times or introduce my name extremely loud, Ive gotten threatened with corrective action. So yeah. Really wanna hear how yall experiences are.",

I’m so often in trouble for not getting all my calls made, when the reality is that I’m covering a minimum of 3 hours on the teller line every day, and sometimes the entire day, while lobby clients (new accounts, loans, safe box crap etc) are backed up at least 50% of the time. It’s hard to get anything done when you really need a clone of yourself. And people get pissy when they have to wait. I hate to say it but it’s mostly retired people, too. You could have made an appointment! Can you guys imagine a world where, for example, Tuesdays & Thursdays were appointment only (with drive through open for teller transactions)? To allow us to catch up on shit? Or to make a call where your only job at that moment is focusing on that call…not getting 12 IMs about how backed up the lobby is. I didn’t work here during early Covid but I know it was the drive through open, and lobby was appointment only — and that’s literally my dream lol.

      "content_preview": "Fees are dependent on account type. Certain account types waive fees for Money Orders and Official Checks, and some don't. You cannot come into a branch and demand that a banker waives a fee just because you \"know they can do it\". I've been told to use discretion when waiving fees and also been told to not waive fees. The only time I waive a fee is if there was an error with the computer/printer forcing me to attempt to make the check all over again, if  the wait time  was ridiculous and/or if management says to. To assume that things can just be waived on demand does not get me to waive it, and if I'm educating a customer on current (not grandfathered) account types that waive fees, that means the customer can upgrade to that (upgrading doesnt take long & it also doesn't give me points for any goals since it's not a new account & account number remains the same). To add more commentary the customer says I use to work at a bank, I know you can do it, where's  your manager (it was bumped up & management did not say waive it/they told the customer the same things i told them). they also said I don't mean to give you a hard time I'm just all about customer service and also said I'll just move my money elsewhere. Ma'am you've been with the bank since last century I'm sure people told you countless times what your account type entails, also if you were going to move your money due to fees that applies to official checks you would of been done so this century. You use to work at a bank but forget that things change constantly at banks, if official checks were to always be free, no fee for it would be in the system to begin with. Lastly, customer service isn't about a customer getting everything they want when they want and how they want, it's about acknowledging customers, working to help them with services that benefit them, & educating customers while following policy and procedures. The only person to protect my job at the end of the day is me, what other branches you step into that waive every fee for you is that branches problem but on my login? No I'm not doing anything without confirmation that I can do it.",

I plan on going back to my old job, due to not really liking the company and honestly not loving the role. There are clear signs of dysfunction within management and truly have only had 2 short conversations with my manager as she is never around. Now she is out for surgery for months and I am not sure when she will return. I plan on doing it Monday (tomorrow) morning for a few reasons. My teller supervisor was on vacation last week so I had no direct supervisor there besides senior teller. I figured I would directly tell her, then emailing the acting manager my two weeks notice after would be best route? I have only met the acting manager once and although she is nice, it would be awkward to talk to her about this. I’m also worried that doing it Monday morning while my supervisor is trying to count night drop would be annoying for her.",

      "content_preview": "I like my job honestly, but the incessant push to sale wrapped as”life priorities” is so tiring. Full stop, most people’s goals and financial needs don’t change every three months. They don’t need an update or checkpoint every two months. Retirement planning is one thing and ongoing. Business needs are ever fluctuating. But personal banking, no, they don’t need constant consultations. And just to add to this, even if someone does have a goal of buying a home in five years that conversation is simple. How is your credit? Can you save? I can give advice on those things and how to get there, but they don’t need to talk to me beyond a quick conversation on the phone maybe every six months. Nothing is accomplished by having an in person follow up to ask “are you still saving?” Also, when did we become expected to become financial planners? I’m sorry. I’m single. I am by no means qualified to help people set budgets for a family, determine what expenses are necessary or not, and frankly if someone is dropping 250 dollars a month on doordash it is not my place to tell them they need to stop that unless it specifically revolves a savings goal…but like grocery budget for a family of four? No clue at all what is appropriate. Just lay off. Banking needs are there when someone needs us. We shouldn’t be trying to convince someone to buy a car or home, they should be asking us.",

      "content_preview": "Recently, I applied for a Retail Banker position at TD Bank. I’ve been through two rounds of interviews, with the last one taking place at the end of last month. After the interview, I reached out to the hiring manager to thank them and also ask some follow-up questions as requested. They responded positively, answered my questions, and told me to reach out again if I had any additional ones. About a week later, I followed up again to check on the status of my application and asked if they could provide a timeframe for a final decision. I didn’t hear back, so a few days later I contacted the recruiter. They told me the hiring manager had positive feedback but that interviews were still ongoing and would likely take another two weeks. Here’s where it gets a bit confusing: a day before that two-week period was up, I noticed the posting was removed from TD’s website. Then, just a couple of days later, it was reposted. Meanwhile, my application status still shows “In Progress.” I’m curious to hear from others: what’s your take on this? Does this mean they’re still searching for the right candidate, re-opening the pool, or could it just be a technical system update? 🤷🤔",

This has lead to: getting yelled at because the customer swears hes never had a hold before my manager removing holds that I put because she knows the customer getting told that I should have put a hold on the check even though we didnt last time the same customer came in with a similar check So I was just wondering: is this normal or are check holds other places are more consistent?",

That being said, I’ve been here for over a year and the job is easy for the most part and I mostly enjoy my coworkers. My end goal is to get into back of office. I enjoy working alone, focusing on my tasks, and like the spreadsheet and data aspect of work. I recently got offered a position at a local Credit Union as a call center representative. They mentioned that the job is doing everything a teller can do minus the cash, helping with online banking issues, etc. Work from home two days a week, a .70 cent hourly pay increase, no sales goals. They mentioned the goal was 40-50 calls per day. I’m so torn. Do I stay with the devil I know, or try something that I may not like? I’m 26 years old, my resume currently has supervisor experience for three year, manager experience for four, and most recently banking for a year. If I end up hating it and needing to quit, I worry my current bank won’t hire me back, and a new company would see two short stints and disregard me all together. I have no idea what I want in life, but banking seems decent. The credit union said there was room for growth, my current bank is multi state and there never seems to be back office positions available, but also said there was room for growth when I was hired. Looking for advice, wisdom, or experience with call centers in a credit union environment.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everybody, I need some perspective on something that happened at work. I sent this message to my manager after going home tonight. Like, 30 minutes after clocking out: “Hey (my manager’s name)! I was thinking on my drive home just now and I realized my drawer may not have been counted correctly earlier. My drawer was showing I was over by $100 and then I recounted and restrapped/clipped all my money and then I balanced, but I’m not sure if I still miscounted in that time and still have an overage. I’d just feel better if someone could audit me on Monday just to make sure it’s all correct and if I need to do any necessary forms, I can get it filled out. I just wanted to let you know now.” Here’s the thing: I routinely balance all day ‘cause I’m at the drive thru; so I’m at the busiest part of my bank. So, I try to make sure my drawer is fine and I’m not having any hiccups and if I do, I can track down where I went wrong easier. I did two W/Ds, know EXACTLY how I gave the money back and all of a sudden, I’m over $100 from the last time I balanced, and in that time, I only have 4-5 transactions. Those two W/Ds are the only time I gave money out. I’m so confused on what happened and I’m not sure if it’s due to me getting a clip from a coworker and not counting it and that’s where my extra $100 is coming from or what. (I realize she would’ve shown a shortage either today or another time, but I didn’t check in with her about it bc I just thought of this on my drive home.) I just know I recounted and restrapped/clipped all my money and then I balanced. Because we were in the last ten minutes of the day, admittedly, I was rushing and I don’t know if I put the $100 into a strap that didn’t need it or if I fucked up my totals while entering them in. There’s a great chance I still have the $100 and I thought I possibly fixed the problem when I really didn’t. I feel really stupid about it. Do y’all consider this “force balancing”? And how bad is this likely to look from a manager’s perspective? I’m really anxious about Monday. I feel super bad that I could’ve done something wrong as I try to work my bank job with pride and honor since I really like what I do and want to move up soon in my company or just overall. I just don’t want to come across as dishonest or like I’m trying to move shady. I like to be honest with my work and my bosses. Any advice? What do you think of my text? Thanks for reading! UPDATES: It’s Monday now and I am indeed over $100 lol so I am going to have to post it and show it at EOD. my manager texted me back and told me he appreciated me telling him and to just have someone audit me. lol, I think I let my feelings get so big over the situation as this is the first time this has happened to me in awhile. I appreciate everyone who commented and read! Thanks for all the advice and your time 💕",

Earlier this year, one of my coworkers was promoted who only works part-time. No internal interviews no job posting nothing we just got the next day the update. Come around the time for performance reviews I bring up my concerns about promotions. I’m gaslit into thinking that I haven’t made enough sales to warrant a promotion. Of course, that was never an assessment for my coworker who got the job. Anyway, I’ve been applying and received an offer from a different bank off the bat. They offered four dollars less than I’m currently making, but I would move on to a banker position. Well, let’s see how it ultimately goes, but do you guys think this is a smart idea if I’m able to negotiate to at least match my current rate?

      "content_preview": "I work at a universal branch where bankers are also tellers. I was hired as a part-time teller so I could focus on school, but I often work 32–35 hours a week and end up being the only one running the teller line. On top of that, I handle safe deposit boxes, schedule appointments, and basically do everything when customers walk in. The branch is very busy and the customers are demanding. I’ve made a few mistakes here and there, and recently I was short $199 because I forgot to withdraw the cash after pulling it from the vault. My manager commented that I’ve been making a lot of mistakes lately and even said I was “unethical” for not being more worried about the shortage. The truth is, I know I work hard — I rarely call out, I get great customer feedback, and even my manager has said I’m one of her hardest workers. But I’m stressed, burnt out, and trying to balance this job with school. When I make a mistake, I don’t beat myself up over it because I know I’m giving my best while being overloaded. Is it really unethical that I’m not more “worried” about being short when I know I’m stretched too thin?",

      "content_preview": "So I started a new job as a banker, first time in banking. I applied to all big banks and none responded or didn't make past the first interview but this regional bank, so I went ahead did the interview with the Branch Manager and then the Regional Manager the next day. Company is great, nice culture and they provide 3 months of training. However, after those 3 months my manager once told me \"So you finished your training, huh? Now I can be mean to you. Haha, I'm joking... or maybe not.\" And that's pretty much when hell raised, my head taller gets mad over questions that are NOT even directed to HIM, just by the fact he hears the question somewhere in the branch he will take it as a personal attack, everything is a fight even in front of customers, he will fight anyone, assistant branch manager, branch manager, me and the other banker. If you ask a question that he already answered like a week ago then oh boy. Branch Manager is also pushing very hard on sales goals which is my main stress fuel, he wants results DAILY but then tells you that it's something that takes time to achieve those goals and now since we were far to achieve those goals he raised our own goals by a quarter (head teller is 2x). I'm at the verge of quitting, had a talk with the previous regional manager (he moved to another position after a month I started) and he in only minutes of conversation he noticed that I will quit even though I didn't explicitly say it and he texted the manager saying to slow it down, his response was \"this is none of your business anymore\" and laughed it off. Even small things like double checking documents, if I say \"wow nice, I didn't find any mistakes in X's work\" his response is \"That's because you are not doing it right\", I proceed to tell him how I do it, he sees it is right and hits the most dry \"Ok.\" You will ever hear. Not sure what I can do, stopped eating, sleeping and can only think of those damn sales goals and trying my best to ask ANY question in general so I don't get the head teller mad or called to the BM's office. Can't move to another location because you have to remain in the same position/location for 1 year and I still need 6 months more to go.",

M28, No college degree (one class short of Associates Degree, taking that class this fall) Long story short, i worked for a top 20 bank as a Universal Banker, then Relationship Banker. I was in the top for production in my area, but then shot my shot and applied for a licensed RB job at the biggest bank in the country. I passed my SIE, then Series 6, but i failed 3 times on series 63, and thus disqualified from the licensing program, and essentially out of a job. (I have 30 days to find a job within that same branch, but all the jobs below are pay cuts or hours cuts). I’m slowly realizing that customer facing isn’t for me. How do people find back office jobs? I’ve looked at every bank, credit Union, etc around me and there’s virtually nothing posted, or it’s posted so long ago i assume they just didn’t remove the listing (i applied anyways). What qualifications or certifications are they looking for? I want to get into BSA/AML or Fraud. I have no problem taking a customer facing role and getting any certifications i need, but i don’t want to get stuck. Any advice is appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "I recently jumped ship from JPM to WF, and got a nice promotion to “Senior Premier Banker” in the process. I was assured in the interview that I would be assigned a book of clients, and would exclusively be working with that book, calling them and meeting with them, with other affluent clients being referred to me. After a training process that included absolutely zero pieces on book management, referrals, or the perks that the affluent segment receives, I have been on platform for about three weeks, and I’m already set to quit. I have still not been assigned a book of clients, reason being a “technical issue” with no fix date set. I was not told that my branch would not have any place for me to privately make calls; I sit I a cubicle (no door) right by the front entrance, helping every random person that walks in because the branch is so understaffed (since I started, a teller quit and a 25 year tenured associate banker got fired over a cash difference). We rely so heavily on “roving bankers” and there’s no semblance of communication as to who is going to be supporting and when. Behind the scenes tasks such as ATMs are done during business hours, which only further cripples us. Of the people that are available, bankers and the branch manager, there is a total lack of professionalism; it’s common to hear them refer to the customer as “buddy”, and to call them before their scheduled appointment to let them know that “they should be prepared to wait at least an hour” because of OUR incompetence. Possibly biggest problem of all, the branch in the next town over (mostly Spanish speaking) closed, so now all of those clients come to us; I would say about 65% of our clients do not speak English/are ESL, yet we have ONE Spanish speaking banker. This branch is an absolute dump, and is not conducive to assisting Affluent clients in the least. I’m extremely frustrated at all times, and instead of listening to my suggestions to fix the problems, I’m written up for my “attitude and body language” despite having absolutely ZERO negative customer feedback (in fact, I’ve had the opposite, with many stating I’m the first person to help them at this branch in years!) I seemingly just started, and I don’t want to come off as whining, but I feel I am 100% not working the job I was hired to do, and my talents are being wasted here. Would it be even worth it to ask for a transfer? Should I just quit?",

One question that I get rather often is “How do I know you’re really from the bank?” Or “there is so many scams, how do I know this is legit?” To this day, I have yet to come up with a solid answer that can help the customer feel assured that I am who I say I am… Any thoughts or suggestions that could help?",

We had 42 for the whole month of July but this month we already have 48! We are doing great!”… Then she says “so my question is, why is it that we are capable of having 48 for only the first 2 weeks and we only had 42 for July? Why did we let July slip past us like that?? It was because we weren’t having conversations were we!? Well going forward I don’t want anymore excuses and I expect you ALL to be having conversations is that clear?” -.-",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been at my branch for four years, and I suppose I could say I take pride in how much I’ve improved at my teller skills. One thing that’s unfortunate is that the way I treated customers wasn’t the best at the start (I had symptoms of undiagnosed BPD at the time so I was struggling and had gotten written up a couple times, one time being not too long ago but I’ve been working my butt off to make sure it doesn’t happen again; but I’m a lot better and getting treatment). One of our regulars came in about a week ago, a guy who’s got a name that’s “small-town-famous” or something like that. The “I’m who I am so you should bend over backwards for me” type. Anyways, while I was starting, this guy would bring in TUBS of loose quarters to deposit, and ask that WE roll them. For obvious reasons, you all probably know this is NOT allowed. However, my old manager at the time was the type to do favors for people. We told him why we didn’t want to keep doing this, one of them being it took up on our time and if it wasn’t finished by the end of the day, that was unaccounted money for sitting around. But he said “ [Insert customer] is one of our biggest. We wanna keep him happy.”  Thankfully, the higher ups put a cap on it and we were finally allowed to turn this guy away for the loose quarters. Fast forward to now. We have a new manager who’s far more efficient and sharp about following the rules and policies. Perfect. So recently, this guy came back in with that famous tub and I got nervous. So he asked “Who wants quarters?” I jokingly asked “Are they rolled?”  And his tone changes and he goes: “Do they have to be?”  At this point I was a little shocked. I thought we’d been over this.  And I said. “Well yes. We can take any coin you bring us as long as it’s rolled.” “Who says?”  Now I’m floored. Are we really doing this? I point at myself and say “I do. The bank does. That’s our policy that the coin has to be rolled.”  Now he’s getting agitated. “Well I was told I could bring it in loose.” “Who told you that?”  I asked this because if someone RECENTLY told him this, I wanted to know so I could alert my manager. “ [Insert old manager’s name]” “Well, he doesn’t work here anymore. The new manager is in his place.”  At this point he turned to go to her office, I guess to say something, but she was in a meeting. And I told him “If your coin is rolled it’s no problem, I can absolutely take it for you.”  And it WAS rolled so what’s the issue?  I had asked him if it was loose because of his past, pushy history. One of my other tellers witnessed this and we relayed it to our manager so we could let her know in case he tried to push the loose coin on us again. She thanked us and told us she’d be reaching out to the right people in case it came up again. Cue to yesterday. I’m called into the manager’s office and told he COMPLAINED about me. I wasn’t given specifics, but I knew that’s what he complained about. She told me it wasn’t officially put down as a write up, and that it was smoothed over, but warned me because I was still on the bounds from my last, most recent write up, and that I could be fired if something happened again and it was officially put down. So, you’re telling me, because I refused to be bullied by a customer who has a HISTORY of doing this, I could get in trouble?  My other teller confirmed I wasn’t rude to him, just asking questions but firmly pushing back to now allow it.  So now I’m even more paranoid as ever, because why am I being punished for not going against policy and just giving back that energy?  To say I’m pissed is an understatement. My boss was on my side, but she had to let me know the consequences, obviously. It just devastated me, because I’d been working so hard to be an overall better customer service rep, and I really have been improving. I just took a blow to my self esteem and now I have to worry about losing my job if I screw up again, all because ONE asshole decided he didn’t like being told no.",

      "content_preview": "I work at a CU call center and over the past month or so I have seen a large influx of merchants (mostly Amazon but there are others) telling people they can contact their FI and provide them with this magical little code so they can cancel the pending charge on their card if there is something that went wrong with an order (i.e. it was cancelled, processing error, etc.). Then I get to be the one to tell them that is incorrect information and that we cannot do anything about a pending charge, and we can only file a dispute if the merchant completes the transaction (it is posted and no longer pending). It sounds to me like merchants are just saying this to shift the blame to us so they don’t have to deal with the customer anymore, but that could also just be the story I tell myself after the member proceeds to escalate claiming that I am incompetent at my job. I am curious if anyone else is seeing this trend?",

The first day i walked in my manager said he has “high expectations” and never once in the past 6 months has told me good job, they just always have something to say and micromanage me, its not even bad things about my performance but silly alternatives and suggestions, I have to follow a script when I talk or send emails or anything. The sales pressure is awful and my manager even told me to smile more even if i don’t feel like it in order to sell because “sometimes you seem unapproachable” what a joke. He literally does nothing but judge and like address Karen’s, we do more than him and get treated like trash by the customers. This job takes away sm of my energy that I dont have time for my loved ones, to see my family, because when i get home i just sleep from the tiredness, idk what to do next.",
