Do you think this is possible, or the right thing to do? Are stick insects even viable? I've seen people with turkeys and giant snakes, surely an unmoving insect would do no harm?",

My RD never saw a problem with him seeing as he didn’t leave the tank and had zero smell. He still doesn’t. He’s a Map turtle, small, male, and very friendly. I messaged my doctor to see if he would write me a letter for him to be an ESA, but I feel like my DAR offices are just going to deny him because he’s aquatic. I need advice. I am shattered thinking that he might have to go home and go through the stress of another move. I was also suggested to take him to a rehab center that takes rescues?! And I can’t bear to part with him. He really is true emotional support for me. I love seeing him thrive, having something to care for. Anyone. Please help me out here.",

      "content_preview": "Chaz Stevens here. Former CEO of ESADoggy (yep, I used to run one of the largest ESA telehealth platforms). Now I’m a whistleblower, suing the letter mills that wrecked the system. A federal judge in Louisiana just ruled that HUD’s “no ESA fees ever” guidance is not binding. That’s huge. What happened: Tenant wanted a $400 animal fee waived with a cookie-cutter ESA letter from a nurse practitioner. Judge said: the letter shows she has a disability, but it doesn’t prove the fee waiver is necessary. Because she admitted she could’ve paid on a payment plan, the court said the landlord was fine to charge the fee. HUD’s “you can’t charge fees for ESAs” policy? The judge tossed it. After Chevron deference died, HUD’s guidance is just opinion. Why this matters for you: You can enforce reasonable animal fees, as long as they apply across the board and don’t single out disabled tenants. Courts are requiring individualized, fact-specific proof — boilerplate ESA letters won’t cut it. This undercuts the online mills that crank out \\$150 notes to dodge fees. For context: I’ve got two active lawsuits in Florida state court against ESA letter mills. A federal RICO/class action is about to roll out. And I’m waiting approval on a CLE course for attorneys (co-sponsored by a Harvard-educated lawyer) teaching how to push back on ESA fraud. Translation: landlords now have solid legal footing to demand real documentation and refuse flimsy ESA letters. The mills are running out of road. If you're a landlord and want the inside scoop, drop me a DM, happy to chat.",

Just some brief context I'm going to get a formal diagnosis for PTSD through a Psychiatrist but in the mean time I am in therapy and do have medication prescribed to me by a GP.  My therapist has recommended me to get an ESA to help me at home. I do realise that they do not have the proper training nor the same legal rights as assistance dogs. Although an ESA would be useful to have at home and keep me company, I am concerned about what am I going to do about hospital trips as the need to go, even if it is to drop someone off triggers me and gives me panic attacks. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be allowed to bring an ESA in with me because of the legalities but I could be wrong.  I'm just very unsure about everything and I would be very appreciative if someone who is more knowledgeable could please help me out. Thank you :)",

While I'm all for them, my dad believes that there should be no reason other than blindness to own a ESA. I can sometimes see where he comes from, various articles he sends me share moments where ESAs aren't properly trained and act up, particularly in public spaces like restaurants or grocery stores due to how attainable getting an ESA really is. He's convinced the concept of an emotional support animal is a loophole to undermined private authority amongst other things(understandably so, as he is a realtor and deals with people vouching for their untrained pets all the time.) I'm making this post for those with ESAs who are willing to share their stories who've had their lives altered or drastically changed for the better or worse (yes I know not everyone is satisfied). I would really appreciate it if you would take the time to write even a little about how the seemingly unconventional style of pet therapy has helped you guys so I can share it with him and the rest of this community.

From what I’ve seen, the big providers people mention are Certapet, Pettable, US Service Animals, and ESA Doctors. Are those the best options, or are there others I should look into?

      "content_preview": "Hi! I (21f) am a college student in Arkansas. I recently got approved for my ESA to live with me in my on campus apartment. The problem is that they have in their ESA guidelines that she would need to be crated when I am not there. It is possible for me to do, but I worry about my cat being locked up for so long. I am in nursing school, so I have really long days (8-4:30) so she would be in a crate for over 4 hours at times. I feel like it is not fair to her, but I don’t want to leave her at home because she really helps with my anxiety symptoms. Does anyone have any advice? My cat is spayed, litter box trained, used to being inside, and fully vaccinated. Any help is appreciated.",

      "content_preview": "Hey I need some help figuring out what to do in my situation. I’m going into my sophomore year at college and will be dorming. I have a huge amount of general anxiety, I’ve struggled with homesickness, and I’m dealing with coping with trauma right now. I’m not used to living without pets and my cats always make me feel calmer. I would love to have a cat as an ESA at school and know it would help tremendously with my mental health but I don’t know how it would work. I tend to visit home over weekends or sometimes if I have extra time on a weekday. I don’t want to leave a cat alone for too long or overnight if I leave, but I don’t want to stress it out by bringing it back and forth from home with me, especially since my family’s house has four cats and a dog already. I also don’t know how it would handle school breaks. Any suggestions? I know a cat would help so much but could this even work? If it sounds like a bad idea does anyone have any alternatives I could try to help with comfort when I’m struggling? I just don’t want to get a cat just for the environment to be unfair with the back and forth",

I remember when i got those previous forms signed, the appointment was EXPENSIVE… I’m wondering if there’s a reputable website that will allow insurance to cover the cost? TIA!! Edit to add: i don’t currently see a psychiatrist, and my therapist isn’t qualified to write an ESA letter. so just going through a psychiatrist is probably not an option for me rn",

I contacted the apartment complex I'll be moving into, and they sent me an ESA letter that I need to get signed by a doctor. I don't have a primary care physician, as I don't have insurance right now. I was thinking about getting it taken care of online, but I noticed they email you a PDF and I'm not sure if they'd be willing to sign what the apartment complex already sent to me. I'm not sure what to do and at this point I'm really worried I won't be able to bring LJ with me. She showed up on my doorstep right when I decided seek help for recovery from addiction and she's been such a big part of my journey, and I don't want to lose her. Any advice would be super helpful, thank you.",

I think i understand the limits of an ESA registration (i would not be using it to try to get access to places where pets aren't allowed, nor would I be trying to pass them off as trained service animals. it would just be solely for housing purposes). trying to find information online has lead me to some... sketchy sites that seem more than likely to be scams. so, as the title states, where do I begin? im able to get a letter from my therapist, but beyond that I'm very overwhelmed trying to find information on how to go about this that isnt just straight up incorrect or a scam.

Step 2: Schedule a Consultation with a Licensed Provider To ensure the ESA letter is valid: The LMHP must be licensed in the same state as the patient There must be a legitimate therapeutic relationship The provider must conduct a clinical assessment , which can be via telehealth (as permitted in most states) Step 3: Receive the ESA Letter A valid ESA letter must include: Provider’s full name, license number, and contact information Confirmation of the patient’s mental/emotional disability Statement that the ESA is essential to the patient’s mental health or well-being Issuance date (typically valid for 1 year) 3. Red Flags and What to Avoid Research and regulatory guidance highlight risks associated with commercial ESA services that: Guarantee instant or automatic approval Bundle letters with unnecessary extras (e.g., vests, ID cards, registration numbers) Skip the clinical evaluation process These practices are not recognized by HUD or the Department of Transportation and may result in rejection by landlords or legal challenges. 4. Conclusion: Ethical Access to an ESA Letter To obtain a real, legally valid ESA letter only, you must: Undergo an evaluation by a licensed mental health provider Ensure the provider is legally permitted to practice in your state Receive a signed letter that aligns with HUD guidelines Avoid websites offering “lifetime registrations,” “instant approvals,” or skipping clinical evaluations—these are not compliant with federal law and can invalidate your rights under the Fair Housing Act . Some telehealth platforms, such as RealESALetter.com, claim to provide ESA letters through legitimate evaluations with licensed professionals. If considering such a service, it’s essential to ensure that the process includes a valid therapeutic assessment, and that the letter meets all legal standards set by HUD. As long as these conditions are met, obtaining an ESA letter online can be a lawful and ethical option.",

As that is not allowed according to HUD. My letter states that I have a physical and mental disability) A brief explanation of how the condition limits a major life activity And how the animal helps alleviate or mitigate those limitations I’ve given them ways I believe I can revise the letter without giving out my confidential medical information (and how the HUD document states what the letter should include), but they don’t want to accept any of that. Im very wary of giving too much information as the last time I caved and gave the info, I was discriminated against. But at the same time I do just need the housing. Any help would be appreciated.",

I don't currently have an established relationship with a therapist. I've been working remotely for four years now because of my PTSD, anxiety disorder, and major depression. I've been dealing with these conditions clinically for over 20 years. I relocated to a new housing complex last fall. My previous rental was being renovated, so I had to find new housing. I've been living here for about eight months without any issues. During the move-in process, I informed the leasing representative about my German Shepherd, showed her my dog, and presented an online medical letter I had obtained from a physician in Tennessee. She approved this arrangement but mentioned she would email me registration information for my dog. I never received that email and didn't follow up. She mentioned that registering him would waive a $300 charge, which I assumed was a standard pet fee. About six weeks ago, when maintenance staff came to replace my air filters, an office representative accompanied them. A week afterward, she emailed me stating that my dog violates breed restrictions and that I need to find him a new home. When I explained that he performs assistance tasks for me, she said I needed to register him properly. I contacted the registration service she directed me to, and they referred me to OurPetPolicy. OurPetPolicy rejected my application because they said I obtained the letter online, which is accurate, and I understand their position, though I think it's unreasonable. I scheduled an appointment with my primary doctor, whom I typically see annually. I also booked a consultation with a local mental health professional who can conduct an ESA evaluation. I exchanged multiple communications with OurPetPolicy over several days. They insisted I must provide proper documentation to keep my dog. I informed them I had an appointment scheduled for the second week of April. I believed we were waiting for that appointment. This morning, I received a letter stating they've denied my request entirely.",

We are starting with just my cat and then after getting that approved, I might look into getting documentation for other pets in the future. The next step would be making sure the letter holds up with my landlord. After that I want to make sure I have proper coverage for any potential housing changes. I need a reliable ESA letter service and want to know the best companies for legitimate documentation and complex housing situations. I have been reading ESA letter service reviews but would love to know what reddit's experience with different companies is. I've heard about this \"guaranteed approval\" type of service which does seem to make sense especially for a situation that could save thousands in pet deposits and fees. Any companies I should avoid? Any that you recommend for getting legitimate letters? Who is best if landlords challenge the documentation? I have heard of ESA Doctors, CertaPet, Pettable, Wellness Wag, My ESA Doctor, Support Pets, and RealESALetter. I am open to whatever is the best, I am more concerned with having a legitimate service with real licensed professionals than the overall cheapest option. But I of course like to save wherever I can.

I also have to transfer to uni in two years, and I need to take my cat with me. Without saying too much, I have severe anxiety and depression and my cat is my reason for trying to get better. I also have horrible separation anxiety when I am away from him. Can I speak to my primary care provider about getting an esa letter or do I have to talk to a therapist, or are there any legit websites where I can get one?",

This letter was given to me by a licensed therapist that I see regularly. The apartment management just sent an email saying that my letter is similar in format to letters that can be bought online, so they’re rejecting it. They even acknowledged that my therapist is fully licensed. I don’t know what I should do now. I emailed them back stating that my letter is not from one of these websites. I don’t feel like I can prove my need without revealing disability information to strangers. Which I absolutely do not want to do. What should I do now? Should I just find a different apartment?",
