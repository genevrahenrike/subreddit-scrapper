      "content_preview": "A few folks here might enjoy Mistwatch . It's a relatively traditional fantasy story without many rational/ist elements, but you might like it if you think you'd enjoy fantasy written by someone who lurks here and on lesswrong. Reasons you might NOT enjoy it: it's not heavily rational or rationalist, it doesn't have heavy progression elements, it's slow, and it doesn't have the focus on tricky uses of powers that characterizes a lot of the works that people here enjoy. Reasons you might enjoy it: it's a fun read (according to my beta readers) that explores a unique fantasy setting with some influence from rational and rationalist works. Blurb : Every child of the lower branches knows the rules for Mist Storms: Stay together. Don't trust your own mind. Millenia ago, the world was covered by a Mist that warps everything it touches. Madness and monsters follow in its wake. What is left of civilization survives on the branches of the mountain-sized Eternal Tree, relying on the Thornguard to fend off the Mist and maintain the wards. But not even the Thornguard can protect the Tree from the Mist Storms that wrack the lower branches—and the Mist is rising. Reg Burlbush spends his days herding goats on the lower branches, where the grazing is best. He is no stranger to predators or Mist Storms, defending his goats with the help of his plucky herding spider, Ankie. He dreams of winning the herding trials and earning enough to afford his own metal pot. Instead, Reg finds himself pulled into the world of the Thornguard, where his talents might help save the Tree—or his mistakes might doom them all. Mistwatch definitely isn't the sort of work that folks here normally recommend, but if it sounds like something that might tickle your fancy, give it a try! nb: I'll be stubbing and publishing on Amazon on September 10th.",

      "content_preview": "Hey all, I haven't posted here in a few months, so I'm popping in to say hi again. My rational business-building / epic progression fantasy series, Two-Worlds Traders , is now a quarter of the way through book two—with another quarter being dropped in quick succession starting this Monday. In other words, it's a good time to jump in! Like my other story some of you read, Trial of the Alchemist , there are no strictly good or bad characters, though people are realistically flawed. While there is adventure and action and even a currency-based cultivation system, clever problem solving is the real main mechanic of Two-World Traders . Honestly, I kind of hate pitching my own story, and I think my readers do a better job than I ever could, so I'll just copy and paste a review below that covers a lot of bases (which you may or may not agree with, but we can all agree it is flattering). And if you're interested—or if you just want to check that I'm not cherry picking reviews— check out the story here ! Review: \"This is a fantastic web serial that stands out across nearly every dimension of storytelling. Plot and Pacing *: The storyline is dynamic, with well-timed developments and unexpected turns that keep it feeling fresh. It’s not a predictable, linear progression, but rather a plot shaped by the broader world and its inhabitants, making events feel organic and alive.* Characterization *: Every character is deeply fleshed out. They have believable motivations, internal conflicts, and unique voices. The interactions between characters feel genuine—full of nuance and emotional realism. No one is a caricature; everyone feels like a real person navigating their own challenges.* Prose and Style *: The writing is polished without being overwrought. The prose flows naturally, drawing the reader in without excessive exposition or clunky phrasing. It's immersive, concise, and effective at evoking tone and emotion.* Setting and World-Building *: The world is rich and well-realized, with enough detail to feel fully formed but not so much as to overwhelm. Characters don’t exist in a vacuum—they live among others with their own agendas, and this influences the narrative.* Overall *: Triumphs are earned, not handed out. While the main cast experiences more success than failure, these victories never feel unearned or like plot armor. Highly recommended—unless you're seeking a straightforward power fantasy.\"*",

Is there something that you want to talk about with r/rational , but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with r/rational instead of going over to r/japanesegameshows , but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing. So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation?

      "content_preview": "“Sataniel, Sataniel, Sataniel,” I chanted. My rhythm was professional, precise, which of course it was. I’d practiced for hours in front of my bathroom mirror. “By thy name, I conjure thee. By this blood, I call on thee. By my will, I beseech thee. Appear before me!” I pierced the tip of my thumb with the ritual athame and dabbed a drop of blood on the pentagram I’d prepared, then sat back and waited. If I’d done everything right– and according to the copy of Drakeleaf’s Guide to Devilry I’d plucked from the Clearance rack at Barnes & Noble, I had– the Devil would now be bound to appear before me. And then, at last, I could make my desires manifest. Nothing happened. The circle of salt I’d so lovingly poured out sat inertly on the yellowed linoleum of my kitchen floor, red smeared in its center. What a mess. And expensive, too; Kosher salt was all I’d had, and I’d paid extra for the imported kind. Of course, that had been critical for my Backup Plan, should it have proven necessary, though it seemed I’d have to start again– A colorless flame, unnaturally still, ignited in midair over the circle. It swelled, blooming into an androgynous figure, tall and slim. There was a suggestion of wings, blazing feathers curling in brief flickers, before they burned out with the faint scent of woodsmoke and incense. Then the flame colored itself in, transubstantiating into flesh and blood, and before me stood… Someone bent, hands on their knees, panting slightly. I noticed, with some displeasure, a distinct lack of horns and red skin. Instead they were tan, with eyes of molten gold, hair as black as coal, and a robe that was either yellow and gold or black and blue, depending on which angle I looked at it from. “You’re late,” I accused the Devil. The figure straightened up and scowled at me. “Well, I was on my lunch break, wasn’t I? Really, you’re lucky I came at all.” “Lucky?” I said incredulously. “I’m offering you a prime soul, here. You’re getting the better end of the deal.” “No one who offers a deal believes they’re getting the worse end of it,” said the Devil. “Well, I’m the first,” I said. “Now, on to my demands.” They held up their hands. “Hold your horses there, mate. Don’t you want to, you know, chat a little? Bask in the realization that if the Devil exists, so too must God and your immortal soul, etcetera, etcetera?” “No,” I said. “I want a billion dollars in an offshore account, another billion in a diversified stock portfolio, and perfect health in perpetuity. And a Bugatti.” “Absolutely not,” said the Devil. I shook my copy of Drakeleaf’s Guide to Devilry at them. “You are bound by my call, Sataniel. And my offer is real. You have no choice but to accept my deal: one immortal soul, in exchange for riches and power beyond mortal reckoning.” The Devil peered at me and made a face. “For that soul? It’s looking a little grimy, friend. Not exactly an appetizing meal. And that’s coming from someone who didn’t finish their lunch.” “My soul is not grimy, you sulphurous sleazebag wretch–” They held up their hands. “Hold it. Just– think about what you’re offering, here,” said the Devil. “You’re offering your immortal soul. That means I get you forever, once you punch your ticket, understand? You’re not just giving up your shot at Heaven, you’re signing up to be tortured forever. Forever! Do you have any idea how long that is?” “I understand the concept, thank you,” I said. “I’m a masochist. This is a win-win.” The Devil stared at me, mouth slightly open, then plucked a book from thin air. Its leather cover just said The Book , inscribed with golden fire rather than ink. They started rifling through the pages, hands blurring faster than humanly possible. “This can’t be allowed.” “Don’t hate the player, hate the game,” I said. “Don’t try to teach me about hate, we invented it,” said the Devil. They snapped the book closed. “Look, I’m not doing this. You can’t make a bargain for perfect health ‘in perpetuity’, anyway. The point is that I get your soul when you die. That means you have to be able to die.” “Perfect health for eighty years, then. I’m a reasonable person,” I lied. “You don’t have a driver’s license. What are you going to do with a Bugatti?” “It’s really more about the status symbol.” “No,” said the Devil. “Now let me out of this circle. I didn’t clock back in to come here and my lunch break is only so long.” I shook my head sadly. “I didn’t want to do this, but you’ve left me no choice.” I pulled the cylinder of Kosher salt from behind my back and tossed a spray of white crystals onto the Devil’s face. “Burn, creature! Bound in my circle, you will suffer until you accede to my demands; for I am your jailer and your warden both, and you my bondsman ere the circle of my will be sundered.” I’d taken that bit from Drakeleaf , Chapter Eleven. I was fond of Chapter Eleven, which was mostly a selection of recommended dramatic speeches. The Devil shook salt out of their hair, started to speak, stopped, and blew out a puff of air. More salt sprayed from where it had adhered to their mouth. “This is just insulting. You know that stuff’s called Kosher salt because it’s the kind they use for kashering, right? It doesn’t actually go through the Kosher process. It’s not blessed by a rabbi or shochet or anything.” I glared at the cylinder in my hand, betrayed. “I’m not Jewish,” I admitted. “Obviously. Are we done here?” “Absolutely not.” I palmed a second secret weapon, this one guaranteed to work. “I didn’t want to do this–” “That’s what you said last time. You clearly want to do this.” “--but you’ve left me no choice,” I finished. Then I uncorked the vial of holy water and splashed it at the Devil. They wiped the water from their face slowly, with one hand and an infinitely aggrieved look. “First you salt me, and now water. Going to toss a carrot next? Looking to turn me into a stew?” “I call bullshit,” I said. A horrible suspicion was forming. “You’re telling me holy water doesn’t burn the Devil?” They shrugged. “Where’d you get the vial, Temu?” “Hilarious. It’s genuine Vatican holy water. From the Pope. One hundred percent guaranteed to burn all devils and demons.” They scratched the back of their head. “I’m not really sure what you want me to say here.” “Are you even Sataniel? Be honest.” They raised a finger. “That, I would argue, is a matter of some scholarly interest. Arguably the position is an occupational one–” I pointed at the circle inscribed at their feet. The Pope water had smudged it slightly. “That prevents you from letting a direct lie pass your lips, you know. Are you the Devil, yes or no?” The finger lowered slightly. “No.” “Are you even a demon?” “No, I’m not a demon,” they said. “If you know the circle prevents lies, why did you argue about your soul being gri–” “Who are you?” I interrupted. “Mendaciel, Sixth Order Angel.” The figure swept into an ironic bow. “At your service. So to speak.” I rubbed at my eyes. “You’re telling me that I performed an infernal rite to summon a being of demonic power… and got an angel?” God, mother had been right after all. I really had turned out to be a failure as an occultist. “Looks like,” Mendaciel said agreeably. “ Why ?” “Well, it’s about return on investment, isn’t it?” said the angel. “Back in the eleventh century a few of us ran the numbers and realized that demons appearing before desperate sinners looking for a quick fix was actually bolstering our figures, not,” a finger pointed straight down, “You know, theirs. It’s a matter of faith, you see. Turns out quite a few of you mortals become considerably more devout once you call up incontrovertible proof of the soul, afterlife, Heaven and Hell, etcetera. The Big Fire below was getting a few of you, sure. But most petitioners backed out of their deals and devoted their lives to getting into Heaven instead.” They shrugged. “Which, in my opinion, is quite sensible. You get as many Bugattis as you want in Heaven.” “I don’t actually care about the Bugatti,” I said. “Are you telling me Satan doesn’t offer deals anymore?” “Hasn’t for centuries, excepting that one Georgian fiddle player, which was a total bust,” Mendaciel said cheerfully. “The numbers just weren’t working out for him. Course, once we realized that, we started our own department to answer Infernal Pact Inquiries. We’ve gotten hundreds of mortals to turn their lives around and ascend into Heaven.” “But I want to go to Hell,” I said. “Look, can’t you just patch me through to the fellows down below? Surely they’re still taking calls.” “No,” said the angel. “Go to therapy. Please. You’re creeping me out.” They disappeared in a flash of holy fire, and I was alone again. Several million miles and one layer of reality over, two angels peered down at a mortal apartment. “That Kosher salt trick was pretty good,” said the first. “Bite me,” said the other, and sprinkled a little of the salt onto their half-eaten capellini.",

      "content_preview": "This review consists of two parts: an overview with mild spoilers to help potential readers decide if this work is right for them, and a more in-depth analysis with moderate unmarked spoilers and marked heavy spoilers. Overview Oh boy, how do I even begin? Project Lawful Mad Investor Chaos and the Woman of Asmodeus planecrash 1 ( ~1.7 million words ) is a… book Glowfic visual novel forum-based roleplay story by Eliezer Yudkowsky/Iarwain ( u/EliezerYudkowsky ) and lintamande. Let’s get the elephant in the room out of the way. This story is a Glowfic , which means it’s not just your regular press-the-next-chapter-button-for-the-next-chapter webfic. Previous reviews of this story have had to devote entire sections just to explain the story’s format. Luckily for me, the authors have since added a small introductory section which I think does a great job explaining how to navigate the unconventional layout, and if you still have additional questions, there’s an official Glowfic explainer doc . I swear it sounds more difficult to read than it really is, and the story does play with and utilize its unique medium, so it’s not like it’s a completely pointless gimmick. But what is the story actually about? In a nutshell , it’s an isekai set in Golarion, the world of Paizo’s tabletop RPG Pathfinder . There are two major variations on the standard premise. First, the protagonist, Keltham, comes not from Earth, but from dath ilan , 2 Yudkowsky’s invented setting whose gimmick is ‘what if humans were smarter, better coordinated, and didn’t do all the stupid things people do in real life’. Secondly, after the titular planecrash strands him in Golarion, the first person Keltham meets (and, as per genre convention, falls in love with) is Carissa, who’s been raised in and is totally loyal to Cheliax, a kingdom run by the forces of Hell. A timely divine negotiation between Asmodeus, Lord of Hell, and Abadar, god of fair trade, prevents the Asmodeans from simply torturing an industrial revolution out of Keltham. Hijinks and shenanigans ensue as Cheliax tries to masquerade as a totally normal country with absolutely no torture whatsoever to Keltham. Along the way, he acquires a bona fide harem of hot barely legal teen wizards for him to teach the Methods of Rationality to. And practice his previously latent sadistic tendencies on. Yes, it’s that kind of story. Good thing Carissa’s into that. One aspect of the story I want to highlight is its depiction of the gods, who- what’s that? Go back to the BDSM? I suppose it’s hard to just brush aside. Yes, planecrash does feature explicit BDSM scenes, though they’re more like Game of Thrones and less like Backdoor Sluts 9 - it never gets explicitly detailed as gorefics like Cupcakes . At any rate, I’d reckon planecrash has at least three times as many math lectures as sex scenes, so don’t get any misconceptions about what kind of story this is. The authors, aware that these sections are not to everyone’s taste, have helpfully included links to skip both the most explicit sex scenes and the driest lectures, giving concise summaries where needed. I didn’t use them, but I do appreciate the option. Anyway, where was I? Right, gods . Planecrash features the most unique depiction of gods I’ve ever seen. The thing is, gods in other stories, all the way from ancient myths, to mainstream fantasy like canon Pathfinder , to modern genre pieces trying to subvert the usual portrayal of gods like Percy Jackson or Lord of Light , are basically humans writ large. Their goals might be grander, their desires stranger, their thinking faster or wiser, but they’re still fundamentally, recognisably, human at their core. In contrast, gods in planecrash feel like truly alien entities. If any real-life religious text depicted its gods the way planecrash does, I’d probably believe it had genuine influence from an inhuman deity. Planecrash’s gods are vast distributed minds built around concepts that might, to humans, seem bizarre to focus an entire existence on: the practice of free trade, the pursuit of self-improvement, or tricking mortals into selling their souls to be tortured for eternity. Given Yudkowsky’s background of writing about the possibility of inhuman AIs with divergent utility functions, this is not a coincidence. Despite their sheer inhumanity, they still manage to be the funniest characters in the cast; their scenes are some of the most memorable in the entire story. Another memorable facet of planecrash is its portrayal of Hell . One of rational fiction’s greatest strengths is its antagonists, and planecrash does not disappoint. The genre usually stays away from having pure evil antagonists, villains who are evil for the sake of being evil. This is because it’s not very realistic (in real life, most bad things are done by people who don’t think of themselves as Evil), and usually provides less interesting possibilities than the alternative of opposing nuanced viewpoints and genuinely difficult moral dilemmas. (Keltham’s language doesn’t even have a word for evil; Carissa tells him Evil is about prioritizing one’s personal preferences over altruistic tendencies.) In this setting, however, there’s an external force present to change this dynamic. Asmodeus- god of tyranny, slavery, compacts, and law and all-round Bad Guy- throws his considerable weight around to create and maintain a fully realized rational Evil Empire. Applying the genre’s trademark optimization to pain and misery is fascinatingly unnerving and chillingly unforgettable. Tired: effective altruism. Wired: effective evil. That’s not to say the rest of the setting is lacking, though. It’s just great to see a proper rational take on a classic Heroic Fantasy Dungeons & Dragons setting. Planecrash does not take the coward’s way out of treating RPG elements like will saves, stat-boosting jewelry, and spell slots as mere abstractions that help structure a gaming experience. No, this Golarion is populated with characters who have always lived in a world with these mechanics and act as if they are perfectly normal ways of arranging a universe. Special note goes to the depiction of wizardry as the (vaguely defined) manipulation of higher-dimensional kinks 3 and ribbons of energy, a creative flair I particularly enjoyed. Keltham’s utterly baffled reactions to the absurd fantasy tropes he encounters never fail to crack a laugh, although the moments when the narration clearly critiques real-world dysfunction can hit a little too close to home. 1 [Surprisingly difficult question: what is the name of this story? It might be planecrash , it might be Project Lawful, or it could be Mad Investor Chaos and the Woman of Asmodeus . All three have points for and against. Personally, I like the distinctive Mad Investor Chaos, but looking at the completed work it seems to be merely the first chapter’s title. I think planecrash is a bit on the dull/ambiguous side, but there’s a (weak?) argument to be made with the double meaning of the planes of Golarion and dath ilan crashing together. Project Lawful comes a distant third; the only thing it has going for it is the existence of the official-ish projectlawful.com .] 2 [dath ilan first appeared in this April Fool’s tumblr post , in which Yudkowsky ‘confessed’ to being a dath ilani isekai’d to Earth. Sometimes I think this being true makes more sense than the alternative.] 3 [The other kind.] Summary Here’s a hot take for you, I recommend planecrash and think everyone more people should give it a go. Every time I see discourse about it, it goes along the lines of ‘there were some pretty interesting parts, but I just couldn’t continue reading because of X’, where X was typically one of: the pacing, the format, or just the way the characters talked. Now I won’t pretend it’s perfect, but I submit that the payoff is worth pushing through whatever problems you might have with it. General prose quality: 8/10 Yudkowsky’s writing can be polarizing, and he certainly hasn’t changed his voice for planecrash , so your mileage may vary on this front. Personally speaking, I don’t have any problems with it, so I say give it a try if you’re unsure. Characters: 9/10 A top-tier cast with distinctive leads and memorable side characters. Plot: 7/10 The surprisingly ambitious plot evolves and expands in scope multiple times across the saga, although whether it sticks the landing is up for debate. Pacing: 6/10 In my opinion planecrash’s weakest aspect; this is a very experimental story and it shows. Worldbuilding: 9/10 The gods alone make planecrash worth reading, to say nothing of the cheeky rationalist take on a classic DnD-based fantasy setting. Overall: 8/10 i read it for the plot, i swear In a Nutshell BDSM decision theory Pathfinder isekai Related Works Also by the same authors: It is vanishingly unlikely that anyone reading this has not already heard of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/HPMOR , but I’m still listing it here for completeness. One common criticism of HPMOR is that rational Harry was an insufferable know-it-all who thought and spoke entirely unlike any real 12-year-old child. While there was an in-universe explanation for this, it came so late in the story that many would-be readers were long gone. Planecrash gets around this problem by making the protagonist an actual alien from a planet of insufferable know-it-alls. And aging him up so he can have a proper research harem. Three Worlds Collide is Yudkowsky’s other first-contact story between civilizations with vastly different moralities. You can clearly see the bones of dath ilan in this story, with the character of the Confessor being an obvious prototype of an ilani Keeper. lintamande hasn’t really done much fiction apart from this cool little short story on ao3… Oh, and a considerable amount of other Glowfic. About that… Side Note: Other Glowfic Pseudo-Recommendations There are some really interesting threads on this site which I just can’t in good conscience recommend because while they’re really good, they’ve also all been abandoned by their authors shortly after finishing (the rough narrative equivalent of) their first chapters. That said, if they were to be completed while maintaining the quality already displayed, quite a few of these stories would number among my all-time favorites; that’s how good some of these concepts are. Like this rational No Game No Life fanfic which, as it is now, is already by far the best fiction I’ve ever seen that incorporates game theory and strategy (as applied to actual games like poker). If it were ever completed this would be one of my top 5 recommended ratfics ever. It’s so good there are prediction markets on whether its obscure anonymous author is another of Eliezer’s alternate accounts. (I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this were true.) Its only flaw is that it cuts off in the middle of a scene which to the best of my reckoning takes place in the equivalent of the anime’s second episode. Absolutely infuriating. Sometimes I dream of finding this Syzygy and persuading them to write NGNL fanfiction fulltime, but realistically speaking somebody this talented probably has genuinely better things to do with their time. Or this massive Scholomance Academy shared universe , where dozens of authors each write 1-3 characters and plonk them in Naomi Novik’s Scholomance setting at the same time. For an example of its potential, this one subplot , set over the course of a single in-universe weekend and co-authored by more than ten authors, each writing multiple characters in the drama, was a better geopolitical thriller than anything I’ve seen on film. This could have been an amazing collaborative fiction project with a hundred unique characters, each the protagonist of their own story, weaving a grand tale unprecedented in scale … but of course that’s not how Glowfic works. What actually happened: the project fizzled out over a few months as people lost interest, by which time the narrative had progressed only two weeks (out of a four-year term). Possibly the most recommendable unfinished story I’ve seen is this isekai in which two Golarion teenagers, a paladin and a wizard, are transported to our world and end up in the U.S. foster care system, where they have to learn English and navigate a strange world with a much higher technological level but no magic. The premise, character work, and plot developments here have so much potential- I can almost see the world where this was adapted as a slick five-season HBO drama series. As per usual for Glowfic, this promising start cuts off in the middle of a random scene somewhere in the back half of ‘season one’, abandoned as the authors grew bored… …but unlike all the other cases, they at least skipped ahead to do the equivalent of the epic final season , where they return to Golarion for a tech uplift arc. It’s hardly the ideal way to do storytelling, but I suppose it’s a step up from not doing it. This barely scratches the surface of Glowfic threads- I could write another section on the short stories alone , and haven’t even mentioned Yudkowsky’s (really quite intriguing) attempts at original worldbuilding 4- but the links above should provide a good example of what to expect from delving into the endless labyrinth of Glowfic’s interconnected characters and continuities. 4 [Kink warning for this particular one, which makes planecrash look like Hemingway. I feel weird even discussing this; it’s bordering on personal erotic roleplay… which also happens to feature some pretty noteworthy worldbuilding. I’m just here for the ratfic, don’t shoot the archivist.] Spoilers Heavier spoilers (and criticism) below. The first thing I want to discuss here is the ending . In my opinion, it was adequate, but I didn’t leave fully satisfied. Given all the constraints placed upon the characters and narrative, I’m more inclined to let it pass, but it still doesn’t change my initial reaction. Most of this dissatisfaction comes from Asmodeus’ fate , which fits the criteria for an acceptable solution from a technical standpoint but not a narrative one. Yes I know the entire narrative’s premise hinges on the given solution being valid, but all that means is that when it’s revealed, the reaction of ‘Oh, so that’s what you were cooking. Was that all?’ is that much stronger. It reminds me of HPMOR’s climax, whose resolution is also clever, deducible for the attentive reader, and not quite as epic as one might hope for in the immediate leadup. The other gripe I have with planecrash is one that might actually be fixable: it could really use an editor. I seriously wonder how much better/more popular this weird sprawling Glowfic could be if it had a serious editing pass to tidy it up, guided by the benefit of hindsight. The authors do their best, but they’re only mortal, and it’s clear they didn’t map the whole thing out from start to end. Loose plot threads are left dangling ( Broom, Korva ), and while I admire the in-universe lampshade of this in the very last chapter, ultimately it’s still just a fig leaf. Other side plots are resolved, but in a suboptimal/unclear way ( Fe-Anar ), or shoved in awkwardly at an inconvenient point in the narrative ( Abrogail ). It’s just that there’s so much potential here. There are sections of planecrash I’ve reread a dozen times, masterclasses of tension and layered subterfuges that will stay with me forever, but they’re interspersed with sections I could barely skim on my first read-through. Someone to cut the chaff, tighten the dialogue, trim the sprawl- and we could have a classic. A proper text edition- no, a visual novel, that’s planecrash’s true medium. That’s what I want, what we could have one day. It’s a long shot, given the authors have better things to do. Right now, Eliezer’s got a new serious nonfiction book to promote, and seeing how he’s updated his Twitter profile pic from a cool AI portrait to a Serious Person’s real-life headshot (a downgrade, let’s be real), he probably doesn’t have time for a second look at his 1.7 million word BDSM Pathfinder fanfic. But still, I can dream.",

It may be original or may be from an already realised story. The power to be munchkined can not be something \"broken\" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

After reading a lot of works here, I thought it was my turn of posting something so, even if it had take me many months, I can finally start to publish my own fanfic. It's clearly based on Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and I'll try to publish on 1st and 16th of the month. Jojo, after the early death of his mother in an accident, believes he is leading a relatively quiet life until Dio appears. Dio will completely change his story, starting a plot that will last for decades. Also, a word of caution: maybe you've realised already, but English is not my first language. The fic is both in English and Spanish, so if you're fluent, I'd recommend you the last one. AO3 English AO3 Spanish FF.net English FF.net Spanish I hope you like it!",

Is there something that you want to talk about with r/rational , but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with r/rational instead of going over to r/japanesegameshows , but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing. So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation?

Therefore, the only way for someone to avert their own fate or destiny is to take responsibility for their actions and go through character development towards becoming a better person.

      "content_preview": "Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! Guidelines: Ideally any power to be munchkined should have consistent and clearly defined rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story. The power to be munchkined can not be something \"broken\" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human. Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something powerful . We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same. Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin. Good Luck and Have Fun!",
