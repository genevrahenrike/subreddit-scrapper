Auth: Built-in MFA (TOTP apps + email codes). Resources: Nested resources and better organization. Forms: New TipTap rich editor, slider, code editor, table repeater, partial rendering, and JS hooks to reduce network requests. Tables: Custom data sources (no DB required), better bulk actions, reorderable columns. Actions: Unified actions across tables/forms/infolists with rate limiting and better testing. Panels: Strict authorization mode, local Inter font, improved error notifications. Theming: CSS improvements have made theming significantly easier. There are great themes available at https://filamentthemes.com/ and https://filafly.com/ as well as many other community options being released on Discord or the Filament Plugin page. What feature are you most excited to try first? Are you planning to upgrade right away or wait for a while post launch?",

      "content_preview": "TL;DR : Rebuilt the field type architecture from scratch to eliminate boilerplate, add intelligent automation, and provide graceful error handling. Went from 10+ required methods to a fluent configurator API that generates working code in 30 seconds. The Problem That Started It All After maintaining 30+ field types for Custom Fields V1, I kept running into the same issues: Massive boilerplate : Every field type required implementing 10+ interface methods Manual option handling : Choice fields needed custom logic for user-defined vs built-in options Fragile system : Deleting a field type class would crash any page displaying those fields Poor DX : Creating new field types took hours of copy-paste-modify cycles The breaking point came when I realized I was spending more time maintaining the field type system than building actual features. Design Principles I established four core principles for the v2 rewrite: 1. Convention over Configuration Smart defaults with clear escape hatches. The system should work perfectly out-of-the-box but allow customization when needed. 2. Composition over Inheritance Instead of rigid abstract classes, use fluent configurators that compose behaviors. This prevents the \"deep inheritance hell\" problem. 3. Fail Gracefully Production systems can't crash because a developer deleted a field type class. The system must degrade gracefully and continue functioning. 4. Generate Working Code, Not TODOs Commands should create immediately functional code, not skeleton files full of placeholder comments. The Architecture Configurator Pattern The biggest change was moving from interface-based to configurator-based field types: https://preview.redd.it/building-a-robust-field-type-system-for-custom-fields-v2-v0-plv16lxa25mf1.png The configurator approach: Encodes best practices : You can't accidentally create invalid configurations Reduces cognitive load : Method chaining makes relationships clear Prevents mistakes : Type-safe configuration with IDE support Enables intelligent defaults : Each configurator knows what makes sense for its data type Intelligent Feature Application The real breakthrough was solving the closure component problem. In v1, closure-based components were \"dumb\" - they only did what you explicitly coded. Class-based components got automatic option handling, validation, etc., but closures missed out. V2's ClosureFormAdapter changed this https://preview.redd.it/building-a-robust-field-type-system-for-custom-fields-v2-v0-tozdx0r935mf1.png Now developers can write simple closures and get all the advanced features automatically applied. Graceful Degradation One of the biggest production issues was fields becoming \"orphaned\" when their field type classes were deleted or moved. The entire admin panel would crash with \"Class not found\" errors. The solution was defensive filtering at the BaseBuilder level https://preview.redd.it/building-a-robust-field-type-system-for-custom-fields-v2-v0-jr5h0lp235mf1.png This single change made the entire system bulletproof against field type deletion. The withoutUserOptions() Design This was the trickiest design decision. Initially, I thought: Single choice = built-in options Multi choice = user-defined options But real-world usage broke this assumption. Users needed: Single choice with user-defined options (custom status fields) Multi choice with built-in options (skill level checkboxes) Both types with database-driven options (country selectors, tag systems) The solution was making withoutUserOptions() orthogonal to choice type. It controls WHO manages the options, not HOW MANY can be selected: https://preview.redd.it/building-a-robust-field-type-system-for-custom-fields-v2-v0-wix7obsl25mf1.png This single flag unlocked infinite flexibility while keeping the API simple. Interactive Generation The generation command showcases the philosophy: https://preview.redd.it/building-a-robust-field-type-system-for-custom-fields-v2-v0-nxlq3r2o25mf1.png The interactive prompt shows data type descriptions: String - Short text, identifiers, URLs (max 255 chars) Single Choice - Select dropdown, radio buttons Multi Choice - Multiple selections, checkboxes, tags etc. Each selection generates the appropriate: Configurator method ( text() , singleChoice() , numeric() ) Form component ( TextInput , Select , CheckboxList ) Smart defaults (validation rules, capabilities) Real-World Impact For Package Maintainers 90% less boilerplate : field types went from ~200 lines each to ~50 lines Consistent behavior : Shared configurators eliminated behavioral drift between field types Bulletproof error handling : No more production crashes from missing field types For Package Users 30-second field type creation : Generate ‚Üí customize ‚Üí register ‚Üí done Automatic feature application : Write simple closures, get advanced features Clear extension patterns : The configurator API guides you toward best practices The Philosophy The best APIs are the ones that get out of your way. They should: Make easy things trivial (basic field types) Make complex things possible (dynamic database options) Make wrong things difficult (invalid configurations) Make debugging obvious (clear error messages and graceful degradation) This field type system achieves all four by being opinionated about structure while flexible about implementation. Key Takeaways Fluent APIs reduce cognitive load - Method chaining makes relationships obvious Automatic feature application - Systems should be smart enough to apply features without explicit configuration Defensive programming pays off - Always assume things will be deleted, moved, or broken Generation > Templates - Create working code, not skeletons Orthogonal design decisions - withoutUserOptions() works with any choice type because it solves a different problem Building developer tools is about eliminating friction while maintaining power. This field type system does both. Built with Laravel, Filament PHP, and way too much coffee ‚òï",

Check out the implementation here ( https://gist.github.com/Horlerdipo/d6350fe97b19754bb5bcee9c87739b14 ) and roast me (jk jk). What do you think? What would you do differently? I plan to attempt adding type annotations for generated array types as PHPstan would start screaming at the classes that would be generated with this.",

Everything worked fine initially, but after a couple of months, the Filament Resource table page has become noticeably slower . The issue seems to be due to the underlying database table growing to millions of records (2millions right now)(specifically for one of the resources). Pagination is enabled, but even loading the first page takes a few seconds or more (default is 25 records per page), which is not ideal for the end-user experience. Here‚Äôs some additional context: The table is using Eloquent queries (no custom query builder yet). I‚Äôm using the default Filament Table component inside a Resource . The table has searchable and sortable columns. Some columns display related model data (via relationships). The database is MySQL running on a managed VPS (decent specs). No caching, indexes, or chunking optimizations applied yet. Has anyone faced similar performance issues with large datasets in Filament? What are your tips for improving table performance ‚Äî such as query optimizations, indexes, or custom table builders? Would it be better to use raw queries or offload the heavy logic?",

I have been posting about its updates here as well before. I was thinking of posting here when it is 0.9.7 but I just saw the video in youtube. Its the first time someone has made a youtube video of the project so i got kinda excited and thought of sharing here. The video walks through the installation process and gives a nice overview of what the project is about. Always amazing to see when people in the community take time to create content around open source projects. For those interested: GitHub: https://github.com/oitcode/samarium YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD4Wr8cT1CU As the author, I know there are many bugs and lacking features in the project maybe, and also many part of the code needs refactor. But seeing a video someone else has made - that really gives added motivation. Also, thanks to all the comment and feedback I had got here when i had posted before. I have implemented some of those, and it has been helpful. Thanks and have a good time all.",
