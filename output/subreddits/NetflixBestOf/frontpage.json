Anywho, season 3 i feel is going to be so much more difficult, instead of having a villain or a big bad, they may just revolve it all around finding enid and saving her or whatever, with Tyler and his “hyde group” as  a subtle background thing. Im imaging them doing a werewolf vs hide matchup in the finale or some predictable thing like that, I wont lie though, most of season 2 i was not predicting but its mainly because i feel like they pieced things together and slapped characters together like Isaac (slurp) and the thing backstory which may be a source material thing but I’m not sure. All in all I’m excited for season 3 and hope that it doesn’t turn out horrible for some reason",

I felt like I could see bits of myself in her, and it was such a fun ride.I’d love to watch more series or movies with female leads like this—real, flawed, and complex women who don’t fit the usual “perfect” mold.

Also, it’s mind blowing how the daughter forgave her… it’s like she forgave and forgot about it, or so she says because when she mentioned how she “forgave her and didn’t care anymore” she started tearing up.

I’m working on a small project to solve that problem, and I’d love your HONEST input.I've created a super quick (2–3 min) survey to understand how people choose shows/movies and what frustrates them most. It’s completely anonymous.👉https://forms.gle/3MJ2V7tg2H8fyfyU8If you’ve ever felt like you spend more time browsing than watching, your feedback would help a lot. I’ll also share the results later if people are interested!Would mean a lot 🙏",

I've seen snowfall, queen of the south, outer banks, breaking bad, prison break, bmf. I'm looking for another show similar to animal kingdom or any of the shows I named above. I've tried getting into sons of anarchy but couldn't make it past the first episode, l've heard ozark is similar and good as well? Feel free to recommend other shows not on Netflix (if that's allowed) I have nearly every streaming platform.",

Whether it’s a stripped-back folk duet, an aching ballad, or a chaotic singalong, the music can carve itself into your brain in ways the plot alone never could.What’s an indie musical (or music-heavy indie film) where the soundtrack stayed with youlongafter the credits rolled?",

      "content_preview": "I just watched this and it marks the third documentary I've seen on the subject. While it was the only to include Jussie himself as a talking head, it did not do a great job of providing any additional logical explanations of what happened. I am very curious in hearing what other people have to say about this one, because I went into it with the idea that he was obviously guilty and left watching this doc with the feeling that he was obviously guilty.Rather than spend the time since this occurred repenting or anything positive, it seems he has taken the time to come up with more excuses and nonsensical explanations that have never come up before, such as that he was an addict buying drugs on the night he was attacked, that Subway was just a cover. Except he really did go to Subway that night and there was no mention of any drugs besides how one of the Osundairo brother's job was to source illegal Nigerian \"herbal steroids\" for him, which that in itself is dubious and confusing.I'm not sure about this one, folks. I am of the belief that \"Anatomy of a Hoax\" is a better film on the topic. To me, this really just comes across as another sad attempt from the Smollett camp to try and act like there are two sides to the story. I found that bringing up Laquan McDonald and comparing Jussie's situation to his was in extremely poor taste and not an accurate comparison at all. You'd be hard pressed to find someone who disliked and distrusted police more than me, but I really struggle to see how the situation could be this grand conspiracy to bring down Jussie, Much more likely, it is an example of how a guy who was given everything still was not satisfied with his lot in life, took it into his own hands to try to improve it, and then that failed, doubled and tripled and quadrupled down and, despite his constantly-changing story, will never admit that it was a hoax.",
