Anywho, season 3 i feel is going to be so much more difficult, instead of having a villain or a big bad, they may just revolve it all around finding enid and saving her or whatever, with Tyler and his “hyde group” as  a subtle background thing. Im imaging them doing a werewolf vs hide matchup in the finale or some predictable thing like that, I wont lie though, most of season 2 i was not predicting but its mainly because i feel like they pieced things together and slapped characters together like Isaac (slurp) and the thing backstory which may be a source material thing but I’m not sure. All in all I’m excited for season 3 and hope that it doesn’t turn out horrible for some reason",

      "content_preview": "false[DISCUSSION] HS Catfish - police completely botched this moment (Spoiler)One of the hardest parts to watch, there were many, was how horribly the police botched the search warrant.The police make massive unforced error so bad that I’ve not seen anyone point out the repercussions of — not separating victim/offender when revealing major facts about the case.Police should have separated everyone, questioned strategically to either RULE OUT or REVEAL involvement through questioning about brand new facts.—The error happens the moment we see cops tell Lauryn that her mom has just confessed - where police are revealing major bombshell BRAND NEW pieces of information while also… being as vague as they can possibly be.Firstly, this moment never should have happened in front of Kendra. Second, revealing major new facts is supposed to be intentional and made useful to the investigation in order to gauge reactions and compare facts/stories.Lauryn essentially has no reaction when she hears this, but we can’t tell if this is because:Lauryn isn’t even sure what they’re really trying to say, had no involvement, and is staying silent bc she’s confusedLauryn understands what they’re implying, had no involvement, but is unsure how to react (important also because it’s being revealed to her in front of her abuser)Lauryn is fully aware of what they’re saying, is involved, and stays silent because no one is asking her questions directly and she easily gets away without being pressed furtherAll of these things are equally possible based on how poorly the police handled this information. These possibilities don’t even cover how proper questioning could have indicated OR absolved Shawn.—Repercussions 1:Let’s just say it - There is discourse going around about whether or not Lauryn / Shawn are involved.And the truth is, we don’t know if they were involved or not and it’s because of how police handled the search warrant reveal.When you drop a bomb on someone like “your mom is the one who has been telling you to kill yourself,” you’re gonna want to see how they react to that bombshell piece of information. But instead, from the moment they go in and get an implied confession from Kendra - they basically stop investigating. This does the victims a huge disservice.—Repercussions 2:Let’s say the whole family is involved for instance, which has not been ruled out at the time of the search warrant. Police reveal major facts, no one is detained or questioned, now the involved parties have more than enough opportunity to come up with a cohesive story that only indicates Kendra.Now let’s say no one else was involved, that Kendra acted alone. Police still question everyone strategically. Lauryn (at the very least) gets an opportunity away from her abuser to fully understand the role her mother played in her torment. Police get an opportunity to gauge her reaction, press further, and ideally get more information to assist with proving additional charges.—Repercussions #3If police investigated correctly, we don’t know WHAT would have come out. BUT the search warrant error likely also resulted in lesser charges than what they could have gotten had they handled the investigation correctly. Taking their approach, it’s possible that they made it more difficult for themselves to prove in a court of law that Kendra is 100% responsible (based on additional evidence they didn’t pursue) to have been the one to send every single text message.Not having rock solid proof leads to plea deals and lesser charges. Which leads to pedophiles getting sentenced for merely stalking instead of the full extent of the horrible and sexual nature of these crimes.—TLDR: if you want to know why Kendra didn’t get charged with more, it’s because the police effed up.",

While it was the only to include Jussie himself as a talking head, it did not do a great job of providing any additional logical explanations of what happened. I am very curious in hearing what other people have to say about this one, because I went into it with the idea that he was obviously guilty and left watching this doc with the feeling that he was obviously guilty.Rather than spend the time since this occurred repenting or anything positive, it seems he has taken the time to come up with more excuses and nonsensical explanations that have never come up before, such as that he was an addict buying drugs on the night he was attacked, that Subway was just a cover. Except he really did go to Subway that night and there was no mention of any drugs besides how one of the Osundairo brother's job was to source illegal Nigerian \"herbal steroids\" for him, which that in itself is dubious and confusing.I'm not sure about this one, folks. I am of the belief that \"Anatomy of a Hoax\" is a better film on the topic. To me, this really just comes across as another sad attempt from the Smollett camp to try and act like there are two sides to the story. I found that bringing up Laquan McDonald and comparing Jussie's situation to his was in extremely poor taste and not an accurate comparison at all. You'd be hard pressed to find someone who disliked and distrusted police more than me, but I really struggle to see how the situation could be this grand conspiracy to bring down Jussie, Much more likely, it is an example of how a guy who was given everything still was not satisfied with his lot in life, took it into his own hands to try to improve it, and then that failed, doubled and tripled and quadrupled down and, despite his constantly-changing story, will never admit that it was a hoax.",

It digs into that whole messy teenage vibe sneaking around, trying to figure yourself out, dealing with parents and friends who don't always get it. The characters aren't perfect, and that's what makes it so good. You see them make dumb choices, have big wins, take losses, and it just hits different because it feels relatable. All three seasons keep you hooked without feeling repetitive. It's got drama, secrets, and a little bit of chaos, but it's never boring. The vibe is stylish too music, scenes, emotions, everything just clicks. It's not just a teen show; it's more like a ride through real situations that some people actually live. Definitely worth the binge if you want something juicy but still grounded.",

      "content_preview": "false[discussion] Several Reasons Why I wasn’t upset or even surprised that FUBAR was cancelledSeason One’s cliffhanger had no barring on the plot. Luke and the team’s information was sold to dangerous criminals and terrorists. I would’ve expected the main villain or secondary antagonist to be one of those criminals or terrorists. Instead we get a completely different villain. Plus the cliffhanger barely added much tension to the overall narrative.Carter and Donnie added nothing to the story. The show should’ve found some way to make them relevant to the plot or useful to any of the missions. Instead they just sat at the side and spewed out random unfunny humour. Also, they did nothing with the subplot of Carter and Emma still having feelings for each other. Plus i was a little upset to how insensitive the show was to Donnie being dumped by Talia and her carelessly sleeping with Luke knowing Donnie is in ear shot. The only interesting thing they did was that altercation with the biker gang which only served to have them shipped out of the story as quickly as possible.The cliffhanger was resolved so quickly and lazily. It probably should’ve still effected the team into Season Three but we get this anticlimactic conclusion where Greta uses her new fortune to assassinate all the criminals who bought Luke’s information.Season Two’s cliffhanger had little tension compared to its predecessor or relevance to the leads. We find out Tina secretly steered away her Russian superiors from Barry and now he has to rescue her cause the Russians know she turned. This hardly effects Luke cause he fully retired. I have no doubt they’ll shoehorn him into this plot but odds are it would’ve been forced.",

You have men and women (not just Korean, also western) making decisions on who joins these K-pop groups based on the sex appeal of minors.I feel as though the entire show was mask off as to how the producers treat kids.There are a few other things I wanted to highlight:Producers choosing terrible takes to manipulate who got into the finals. And saying how they’d discount the audience vote so they can get the contestants they want if they could get away with it.Turning a documentary about KPop school into an elimination survival reality show (that the contestants didn’t sign up for) to increase the popularity of the show. (One of the producers said in the show “We did this to increase hype”.) At least one contestant left because of this change, but several others went through emotional trauma.One of the contestants got an injury after dancing too hard (Doctor said to rest to avoid further injury, but due to the nature of the show she had to perform or risk elimination). Producers knew about this and decided a 17 year old’s decision to risk her heath was fine.The lower income contestants seemed to go through a lot of psychological torment. One of the eliminated contestants discussed how she was going to have to couch surf as she was now homeless without any savings.One of the producers is standing in front of a child labor law poster. The contestants at the same time discuss the grueling schedule to train, learn choreography, and shit the videos. It feels like there might have been labor laws disregarded, but it’s just a feeling.I am not sure if I’m missing more context. But even if there is I recommend watching it if you don’t believe me.",

      "content_preview": "Hey folks!I just watched Savages movie, professor marston and the wonder women I really liked how these showed a polyamorous relationship in a way that felt pretty real and down-to-earth. Now I’m curious to find more movies or shows that touch on polyamory or even a throuple relationship— whether it’s the main story or just part of the characters’ lives. I’m cool with anything: live-action, animated, old classics from the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s, or something brand new. Doesn’t have to be super serious it can be either fun, dramatic, messy, or whatever as long as the relationships feel somewhat genuine. If you’ve got any movies or shows recommendations with polyamorous vibes or throuple vibes (even as a side plot), send them my way. I’d love to see how different movies or shows handle it!Thanks!",
