      "content_preview": "Absolute newbie, please put me in my place: My family uses some $25 blisterpack FRS Midlands and they're OK but the voice quality is really bad. I honestly cannot understand what I'm hearing half the time. So I'm looking to get some better handsets, but don't really like the idea of spending $100+ for the limited capabilities of FRS. I've read that GMRS can be on FRS bands, and this makes me think maybe I'll just get the 10-year license and cover my family, and get radios with better receivers/speakers and can tx/rx at higher power. But here's what I need: When we're out with friends, nobody else is going to have GMRS, they're going to have various FRS Cobras/Talkabouts that all work on the same 22 channels and same 30-something CTCSS codes, so it's super easy for the kids to say \"let's jump to channel 8, privacy code 6\" and off they go. 99% of the time all the radios just talk to each other and use the same frequencies for their code numbers. Are there GMRS radios that have modes that make this easy, like a menu that has the 22 channels and 38 privacy codes easily selectable? Ideally I'd like to be able to play with more \"fun\" radios without carrying a frequency table around needing to help my kids keep up as other kids freq-hop.",

I can't wait to see the disappointed looks on their faces when I show them THE CALLSIGN and they have to dejectedly trudge back to their swat car. But I'm sure as they will, they'll get some priority alert that some unlicensed HAM has started whistling or playing music on a restricted channel and they'll burn rubber rushing to the target while the \"signal is still hot.\" Please tell me this is really what happens, right?",

I've been using my radios pretty much only when cell service is spotty or not available, like off-roading or hiking, and sometimes have used it when car convoying down the highway. We have only used simplex. I keep seeing the rage about repeaters, so I spent a weekend scanning the local repeaters. Outside of radio checks and people checking in to listen and monitor, some short conversations, there is not much going on. No one was really using it to talk to others. I was expecting groups or individuals use the repeater to relay messages and get extra distance, but then I realized I'm in a suburban area with great access to cell phones and most people would use that instead. So in real world scenarios (aside from emergency or when cell towers are down) what do people use repeaters for? Genuinely curious.",

      "content_preview": "Everybody Wants a Handheld (and why they shouldn't) This is an essay from my website blog, and I'll repeat it here. I wrote it as a blog because I found myself making the same post over and over on GMRS and 'new ham' forums on Reddit and Facebook, so I wanted one place to link to instead of doing that. Then David W0DHG and I made it an episode of our YouTube show/podcast. It startes with me mostly just reading the blog post, and then we add comments about our experience. I'm not linking to that - that seems to be a problem - but you can do a google search or check my profile. Here's the essay: On the Facebook and Reddit forums for new hams and GMRS ops, one thing is clear: everybody wants a handheld. Often as their first and only radio. I get it. I have collected a couple or three dozen myself since the 1970s (6 or so in ‘active’ use today). They can be inexpensive - sometimes ridiculously so, though they can also cost well over $500. They are convenient - no installation, goes anywhere. And they don’t work very well. Even the $500+ models 😯 I mean, they do what they’re supposed to do. They just probably won’t do what you bought them for. If you bought them to chat on your local repeater, you’ve probably found out that you have to be pretty close to the repeater for people to hear you reliably, while you can hear everyone else just fine. No, I can’t define ‘pretty close’. That depends on all those things like antenna height and terrain. So it could be 3 miles or 30 (please ignore the inevitable “I talk through a repeater 100 miles away with my HT” comments. That takes a LOT of explanation that you never get). But compared to a 25 to 50 watt mobile with an antenna on the roof or trunk, the range is much shorter. Plenty of ‘nobody can hear me’ comments on those forums. And even if you are in comfortable handheld range of your local repeater, inevitably there are going to be repeaters farther away that you want to talk through now and then. A fair compromise is connecting the handheld to that external antenna. That will give you a big boost compared to using the ‘rubber duck’ inside the car. But now you’re treading into installation territory. Add power from the vehicle, and a mic (often a speaker/mic), and you’ve got a lot of connecting and disconnecting to do. And you’re still at 5 watts or so. Which works surprisingly well, but you’ll still be hearing things when you’re out of transmit range. I know I’m not going to talk you out of it . I wouldn’t be without a handheld myself. I’m saying that once you decide you like this radio stuff enough, and before frustration sets in with the limits of that handheld, get a mobile (and/or base) radio and install it. That installation is kind of a pain. There are some fair options for ‘no holes’ antenna mounts, though I used to have a radio shop drill some holes, mount some antennas and run the coax to where I specify in the car. And I have them run power. Because taking down the headliner (with airbags), pulling up carpet and getting through the firewall isn’t my idea of fun. I’ve done it. But you may love that stuff, so do it. I just traded cars, and I’m about to do that with the new one. (And I say used to because I just got a new (to me) car, and checked with some local two-way shops. They don't want to do it any more unless I can bring them a fleet. So I stopped by a local body shop, and while it's not their usual business, they do know how to take a car apart, so I'm getting a quote. But I digress...) With a mobile, your radio operation will be much more satisfying , and even more convenient , at least after that initial effort to get things installed. And the handheld will become a listening device mostly, or usable for its intended purpose - short range simplex out in the woods or at a hamfest, or talking through a repeater when you’re close enough and out on foot.

Both saw big upticks but the GMRS surge was huge. GMRS in October 2024 had the largest number of applications submitted in history and especially for affected states. GMRS applications Year-over-Year in October 2024 were up 450% in North Carolina, 205% in Tennessee, 158% in Florida and 100% nationwide. Granted early 2024 also saw a 100% increase YoY for applications (I am not sure why). The effect was done by January of 2025. A lot of people saw the need for emergency preparedness so I hope you repeater owners are ready for the flood of applications :) GMRS license applications YoY 2024-25",

Most likely will never use repeaters unless I go to some extreme trip, which I would then ensure everyone is licensed. I just want 2-way communication. Maybe 4-way in the future if the 2-way goes well I’ve seen this question asked before, and I think I understand. But I have a slight twist to the question. Obviously, the general consensus is to get everyone licensed. Nobody can encourage doing something illegal and transmitting with no license. The scenario I’m envisioning: I’m licensed for GMRS and my girlfriend is not. We go camping in the woods and use the radios minimally - just while we are apart from each other and checking in. No repeater channels, just Channel 1-7 on 5watt power. In the slight chance we interfere with somebody, can we both just use my call sign? I see that direct family shares 1 call sign, and although she is not my legal spouse, at what point does the FCC look into that. I seriously can’t imagine doing anything to get reported.",

      "content_preview": "Ok so....title pretty obvious, post long as heck. Apologies! I haven't used a radio in years and that was the old poop set at work where everyone sounded like static no matter how close they were or if there was anything between you. Here's the deal: In the near future I will need to stay with my parents for some time between a couple days and the rest of my parents' natural life. It took close to a decade of me insisting they get radios before this most recent health scare. I don't want to be crossing 5 acres multiple times a day to ask which shed someone moved the chicken wire to and I want my mom to have a fast way to yell I need you STAT. There is NO cell service unless you drive 3 miles to the top of the hill. Not fantastic for old parents.  And mom is always traipsing to the neighbors for a chat, so she's not always in eyesight. I weighed my options and figured if I'm in the barn and she's in the house or the neighbors FRS isn't going to be fantastic through multiple walls, trees, and distance. GMRS might be overkill but I'd rather that than not figuring out that someone has fallen. So that leaves me with what to actually get. I need something tough enough to withstand getting smashed into by goats, pecked by geese and ducks, and dunked in the creek or dropped in mud, but also simple enough. Mom was an ace CB user back in her hey dey, but I don't think dad has touched a radio since Vietnam. He is also in a class of his own when it comes to messing with settings then declaring something broken and is experiencing early dementia symptoms so him + buttons + dials/knobs = daily settings reset. Thanks to algorithms, my entire feed and search results are nothing but Midland now. If Midland is the answer, awesome. But if anyone has a different more bestest rugged suggestion or maybe a get this and match it with that bright orange Jitterbug style handset combo, please let me know!! I'm open to different cost ranges. I'm footing the bill for this so no worries about fixed income. By the way, Mom's only request was that her handle be Muckin Mama.",

I just applied for my GRMS license in the US and I'm looking for an inexpensive pair of handheld radios to get me started.  trying to keep the price down to $100 for 2 radios I was initially considering a pair of Midland GXT1000VP4 but after doing a bit of research on this subreddit it seems that there are much better options for not much more money. I'm now considering the BTECH GMRS-V2.  Looks like there is a deal right now where they are 50 each so that is just within my budget. Is this a good place to start or should I be considering any other options? UPDATE: I ended up getting 3 TIDRADIO TD-H3 radios. I got two in Black, one for home and one for my car and I got a third in green for my wife because that's the color she wanted for her car. Thanks everyone for the recommendations and insight. I wouldn't have known about this model if no one had mentioned it.",

      "content_preview": "New member here, I have a Radioddity GM-30Pro. My radio doesn't seem to have a \"preset offset\" option for GMRS, it just has me set the tx/rx frequency manually. And first thing I did was wipe the channel memory, because...I dunno. Is the following correct for connecting to a repeater (which is listed as 462..650/91.5)? In VFO mode, set receive frequency to 462.6500Mhz Set transmit frequency to 467.6500 (manual +5mhz offset) Set transmit CTCSS to 91.5 Leave receive CTCSS to Off for now Is there anything I'm missing? Also, I think I'm fundamentally misunderstanding how CTCSS works. In step 4 above, leaving rx CTCSS Off is supposed to let me hear everything on the channel, INCLUDING the repeater output that has a CTCSS set? So the idea is CTCSS lets me squelch out others who are not using the tone I set, but it doesn't by default stop someone who is on the same frequency (with CTCSS off) from hearing everything that is being said by everyone on whatever CTCSS tone the transmitter is using? Do any radios detect CTCSS tones and squelch them out if you have CTCSS off (self-censoring the receive signal to only \"clean\" transmissions)?",

I am aware of the CTCSS codes for various reasons (easily Google-able, for one). Occasionally, my brother and I use these repeaters to contact each other— we don’t do anything nefarious, usually just check and see if it actually works. Sometimes we talk about where we’re hiking, etc. The “President” of the non-profit that funds the repeaters recognized that our call signs weren’t part of their group, and told us to stop using their repeaters if we don’t join the organization ($50 per year). $50 wouldn’t break my bank, but just curious here… Can these frequencies really be private like that? I understand being polite, and I’m not interested in a debate on whether it’s right or wrong to use the frequencies without joining. Thoughts?? Edit: to add, this group essentially has repeaters on every available repeater channel in the area. My brother and I have our own mini repeater that is essentially unusable because it gets squashed by this group’s massive towers.",

      "content_preview": "The family portion of the rules says this: (2) Any individual who holds an individual license may allow his or her immediate family members to operate his or her GMRS station or stations. Immediate family members are the licensee's spouse, children, grandchildren, stepchildren, parents, grandparents, stepparents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and in-laws. This could read to say everyone can operate their own equipment, but I can also read to say that everyone can only operate the licensee's equipment. Does anyone have any clarity on this? EDIT: This seems to have sparked some debate in the comments, which I'd recommend everyone read despite some of the combative nature, as there is some good insight buried down there. I've come to these conclusions as to the letter of the law (so to speak) as it relates to my question: I am the licensee. The equipment must be at least partially owned or leased by the licensee (f.1), and must be under \"control\" of the licensee (f.2). The licensee is responsible for deciding who can use the equipment (d.1), within the limited list of family members from the rules (c.2). There are other rules of course, but these seem to be what's related to my question. I am not a lawyer, everyone please actually read the rules at eCFR :: 47 CFR Part 95 Subpart E -- General Mobile Radio Service It's not that long, and I'm getting the impression that a not-insignificant portion of people who have gotten GMRS licenses have actually read them, at least as they are currently written. I understand the state of enforcement was inconsistent before, and possibly near non-existent now, but I still want to understand what the rules actually say, not what people think is okay to get away with. Thanks to everyone participating in this discussion.",
