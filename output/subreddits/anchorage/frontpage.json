However there was on Incident that left me very frustrated, and similar issues seem to happen a few times per year. We were coming up on a bend in the trail, and this was a heavily forested area with low visibility. A large breed dog came running around the corner at full speed, then charged straight for us. My wife picked up our 30lb corgi and this lab mix charged up and jumped up on my wife. I shoved it off and it ran away. When I went around the corner 3 people were up the trail probably 300 feet away calling the dog. I told the lady who obviously was the owner of the dog that it should probably be on a leash. She held up something in her hand and made a \"duh\" face at me. I said, \"ok, well you need to put him on it.\" She said \"its an E collar dude.\" I left it at that, but I should have challenged here more. She need to know its not ok. Dogs should be on leashes, every other dog was on a leash. Another couple warned us about them, so I know we were not alone in being frustrated. We love our dog, but we would never be so entitled as to let ours run uncontrollably 500ft ahead of us. Anyway, she was a bitch and it frustrated me on what was truly and awesome little hike. I had a similar experience last year at a different trail. Please read this and do better.",

So I'll go first, 1087 W 27th Ave, Anchorage, AK 99503 Doesn't have a name, but it's 100% a drug and betting operation. Random passersby have been offered drugs out of this place, crazy traffic all day and night, stolen cars abandoned in a shared parking lot, people so intoxicated they're passed out in cars in said parking lot, increase in traffic during sports seasons, women running into nearby businesses to escape attackers, loud arguments and threats late at night if people complain about the loud noise, known gang members in and out of this place, beat to shit box trucks backing up to this place. It's got the exact same kind of traffic as the Chelsea. APD is in the area all the time as it's a known problem area even for Spenard. Hell, this place is only a mile from the Chelsea. I know for a fact APD has been getting tips about this place for years and years from nearby residents and business owners. Yet they don't do anything. If they put an undercover across the street for a couple days they could absolutely get a warrant to hit this place. I'd love to hear anything any of you know about this address cause it's a bit mysterious. Or if you know of any others please name and shame. I think we should all want to root these places out of Anchorage. Oh and for Fairbanks you can buy meth from behind the bar at The Oasis.",
