The love affair with Gold has run its course... Lets get something fresh? The last time we had a 3rd, I was just graduating HS, and it was arguably our best jersey ever. Meanwhile, I am 33 now. And our current home jerseys are basically giant yellow towels with a logo slapped on. Zero striping, zero design, just flat and boring. I have emailed the team multiple times over the years about this. If you feel the same, I encourage you to do the same. The more voices they hear, the harder it is to ignore. A good 3rd jersey could bring back some real style, sell like crazy, and give us another identity beyond “that yellow gold piss team.” The fact we haven’t had one in well over a decade is beyond absurd. Bring back a 3rd. Bring back some design.",

Is there  a rough predetermined time and amount/pick. Ex. In a future consideration, it will be at least a sixth/seventh round pick or  rfa ? It last for 3 years? Has any team ever gotten the Fc? And had it materialized into a player. Question mark if so who and whenHas? Any team ever gotten the Fc and had it materialized into an actual player? if so, who and when?",

      "content_preview": "Good Morning Everyone. As some of you may know, my children were in the Covenant School shooting. Hockey became central to my personal healing. Games were a place where I could bring my family and we could try and heal and feel \"normal\". The organization and the fans were amazing to my family and I want to share with Minnesota what this community shared with me. From today until September 6, I would like to do a sticker fundraiser to support these students. Every dollar spent on stickers will go directly to the families (minus $1 per order to help me cover shipping cost). If you would like to just make a donation in the name of our preds community, I can also accept those and make sure the donation gets into the hands of an actual fund that will be set up for those families and administer it with integrity. Something important to know.... Shootings at private schools do not have access to certain federal funding available to state schools. This includes things like therapy, security, repairs. It is an expensive and long road ahead for all of these kids. Personally, we had to cancel our season tickets after the shooting because the cost of therapy was significant and necessary. For new folks in this reddit.... I have been doing stickers here for a while and this is a legitimate thing. For those who have purchased stickers and jerseys from me in the past, I hope you can give me your trust in knowing that this money will be collected and given to the right people. I will post how much we raised, and the organization it will go to. For any mod that sees this, could we pin it for a week to raise visibility of it? Thank you for your consideration and empathy. Regardless of politics, religion, team affiliation, race, pineapple preference on pizza....... Y'all means all. Hockey is for everyone. https://preview.redd.it/sticker-fundraiser-for-annunication-catholic-school-students-v0-62ys5vv9dzlf1.jpg",

      "content_preview": "Hey folks! My buddies and I are travelling down to Nashville from Montreal in November and want to catch the COL vs NSH game on 11/22. My understanding for purchasing tickets is as follows: Per my email exchange with the Preds ticket office, single-game tickets will only go on sale early September Per previous seasons, games against regional rivals such as COL, especially on Saturdays, would be considered \"Gold Games\" and ticket sales would be reserved to those living in NSH TV region. Our only option would therefore be resale tickets, which could only be transferred to us 24 hours before puck drop. With this information in mind, I am trying to understand if resale tickets I am seeing on some sites are legit. For example, I am seeing some tickets around $50 in the 300s, which off the bat seems too good to be true. I am right in holding off purchase? What are those tickets? Thanks in advance for any help, I'm a little lost here!",

I'm from PA and I'm going with my friend from Philly who is a Flyers fan to the home game against Philly on 11/6. Hold the hate for now lol, he's also a Titans fan so we're going to a Titans game too. Anyway, I can't find tickets listed anywhere for regular season games yet and I'm trying to get a loose budget together so I'm wondering how much decent seats usually go for? I don't need exact numbers, just a general range would super helpful. Also, any tips on where to sit, potentially getting pics with the boys, what merch is worth buying at the team store vs elsewhere in town, etc would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",

We all followed the real-life important hockey events in the offseason, essentially having Reddit users take over as GMs, making (for the most part) realistic changes to the lineup through the NHL entry draft, free agency, and trades. The end goal of the sim was to create a 23-man roster that fans of the team would judge and see how the GM did in comparison to IRL. If you have any questions about the moves made here, please ask your GMs in the comments. Please remember that with 31 other simulated teams, prices could vary from real life especially when trades happened earlier in the sim than in real life Please also check out the r/hockey recap post for shoutouts to our UFA agents, RFA agents, and media team!
