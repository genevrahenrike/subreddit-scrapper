      "content_preview": "Watchmen was a really different comic for me. I started reading comics maybe end of May, with x men Claremont being my first run. Anyway I heard a lot of good things about watchmen, and I had already finished Alan moore‚Äôs swamp thing, so I bought the compact edition, and went in 100% blind. And to be honest? It was something else. I don‚Äôt know how to really describe it but as a realistic take on superheroes? At times it felt like it was being super edgy, and dark and all that, and also being kinda satire of what comics are. And tbh I didn‚Äôt understand 100% of it. I still enjoyed it though. The ending was really good and kinda made you think. The reveal that (spoiler) Veidt was the villain and his motives were super well planned and interesting. I also liked the documents between the issues, like the under the hood book. It gave more depth and story to the characters. But, I‚Äôve been kinda stumped on the pirate story. Why? I guess I somehow just completely missed its purpose. Maybe because it was split up between the pages and issues. If anyone could explain, I‚Äôd appreciate it alot. Thanks. Also, is the movie and show any good?",

Ok, fair plan. Now, how about a \"cleaner\" solution? Why didn't that blondie super genius think to make an agreement with the godly blue balls guy to simple remove the real threat? Instead killing millions of innocents, why not just simple kill the USA and USSR politicians/leaders and top rank military responsible to the nukes launch? I'm sure without paranoid world leaders the world tension would lower quick. What y'all think?",

      "content_preview": "Alan Moore has said that an early idea for Watchmen involved The Mighty Crusaders. The Mighty Crusaders were a group of superheroes, in books published by Archie Comics in the 1960s. Though most of the chatacters predate the '60s, it was then that they became a team, partially in response to reader suggestions. Moore has said that this early idea was nothing like what Watchmen turned out to be. I read somewhere that Moore thought The Mighty Crusaders might have been in the public domain. Might have even been an interview with the man himself. So, while this never happened, I've often wondered what it might have been like if it had. Some members of the Crusaders were: -The Shield. The first patriotic super hero, predating Captain America, though just barely. Super strong,  nigh invulnerable,  and able to leap great distances. It should be noted that the original Shield was the first of 6 Archie Comics characters to bear that name. Their costumes and powers varied. The original Shield, real name Joe Higgins, would have been around the same age as The Comedian from Watchmen. In the 1960s, the persona of The Shield was used at various times by his sons,  Bill and Joe Jr. The Shield, according to Moore, would have fulfilled the role played by The Comedian. -The Comet. I see The Comet as the Rorschach of the group. Mainly because he had no qualms about killing criminals. He could disintegrate people and objects with beams from his eyes. He could also fly. The Comet was also at odds with the police (due to having been hypnotized into committing crimes), even saying \"I hate cops!\" when pursued by them. This was during the 1940s, when the majority of Crusaders characters were created. The Comet was also the first super hero to be killed in the comics. His death led his brother to become The Hangman ( who I've mentioned here previously as a possible inspiration for Hooded Justice), another brutal costumed hero. Despite his death decades earlier, Archie brought The Comet back in the 1960s, when The Crusaders became a team. He was a bit less murdery, however, as the Crusaders of the 1960s were heavy on the camp. -The Web. Would be my pick to occupy the role of Nite Owl II. Mainly because his powers were all gadget-based, much like Nite Owl. There were other heroes,  such as The Black Hood and The Fly. But while many of the Crusaders were more powerful than the street-level Minutemen or Watchmen, there were none on par with Dr. Manhattan. As far a female heroes, there were two: -Darkling, who appeared in the '80s, would be the right age for a Sally Jupiter type. There was also Flygirl, who originally appeared during the '60s. The timelines were jumbled, stories and characters were changed and retconned. Moore said that his original idea was a murder mystery,  that would have begun with the body of The Shield being pulled out of a river. I know it's pointless to speculate, but I still find it interesting to wonder what this version of the story might have looked like.",

Do you think that that change is a way to seriously begin to engage with Moore's central criticism of the genre which is that the original superhero film was Birth of A Nation meaning that the cape genre's origins are rooted in imperialist and bigoted genetic supremacist sentiment? Or am I too Watchmen pilled?",

      "content_preview": "The present.  1959.  1966.  1971  1985.  Now.  Doctor Manhattan ponders his origins deeper than we first knew, obscurely bothered by the why of his creation in the intrinsic field removal chamber.  Slipping along timestreams to do more than merely watch and remember, he observes the moment of his accident and finds it has not happened.  Now a quantum observer, time splinters around him, every point of inflection splintering into new realities, all piled atop one another, all doomed.  How can a man who may do anything and yet chooses nothing possibly set the universe back on its proper course? In contrast to Rorschach, Doctor Manhattan proves a conceptual nightmare for prequelization.  His simultaneous perception and experience of all moments along his personal timeline means any chosen past moment effectively delivers the same character as present in Watchmen proper, locked along the exact written path we saw therein.  You could exit his perspective and explore how others react to him, but Jon's solo chapter and the techniques used to communicate his mindset are so iconic that to avoid them on principle would seem a waste.  He's not suited to typical superheroic exploits due to his singularly powerful nature in the setting, and his highlight moments are so introspective as to make the possibility of fending off some alien or alternate dimensional threat seem silly.  To properly dig at Manhattan's past as a comic of any potential value, one must tackle the problem from an alternate angle, dig at concerns novel to the source material yet workable as a proper narrative all the same. J. Michael Straczynski and Adam Hughes ssssssorta get there?  Maybe?  God, is this a conflicting outing... So, as compliment to Moore's musings over relativity with Jon, Straczynski centers his mini around the concept of Schr√∂dinger's box, right?  A pop culture understanding Schr√∂dinger's box, one which misses the intent to point out the absurdity of what it describes and which posits a box acted on by a separate outside observer might spontaneously contain something different when acted upon by a separate outside observer, utter spaghetti logic nonsense if you treat the thought experiment with any kind of intellectual seriousness - but a fair-ish starting point all the same.  Jon believes the universe is set and fixed, nothing he can do to alter its contents nor direction, except the simple act of watching an event can change its outcome, so we introduce a moment's curiosity, surprise him with an unexpected result, and see how far we might push the scenario before it shatters entirely.  A bit too neat and linear in presentation for the potential of what Jon's perspective might allow, and certainly heavy-handed about the, \"What's in the box?\" metaphor, but the dialogue and story flow match well enough to what's familiar about Jon in the driver's seat from \"Watchmaker,\" so no harm no foul on premise at least. Except... it's already a Herculean feat of will to make Doctor Manhattan even remotely curious about his origin.  The man who freely admits he spent his thirty years as an ordinary man allowing others decide his fate, who had the whole of his history and future opened in a simultaneous bloom and gradually lost all interest in concerns beyond the pure microscopic mechanics of the cosmos, who required a revelation like the Comedian being Laurie's father to see any value in human life.  Detached from clothing, detached from the world, detached from himself.  One accepts there cannot be a story without some deviation from the inactive, impotent character as depicted.  One also feels great misgivings at the allowance of one step away from the thematic center, for with its acceptance, others become possible, others that can readily carry us miles afield from recognizable territory and best practice. And carried we are on Straczynski's true intent.  Neat though it is to watch Doctor Manhattan experience a cavalcade of miniature What If: Watchmen Edition vignettes, every further narrative and personal detail revealed brings us further and further astray from a character I would call recognizably Jon.  Confirming the nukes drop in every timeline which fails to match the letter of Watchmen's narrative to a T defangs any tension around whether Adrian's actions were truly necessary.  Revealing Jon opened the possibility for deviations from the pure timeline by manipulating probability so he met with Laurie instead of Rorschach on the rooftop torpedoes his stated passivity and depletes the potency of his grand tragedy originating with the common foibles of a mediocre middle-aged man.  Intensifying his background by revealing his father became a watchmaker in an effort to make a little part of the world make sense again after his mother was gunned down while escaping the Nazis amplifies the moment into pitchy melodrama, more about itself than the impact of the atomic bombings.  And as to deciding Jon will fix his mistake by robbing himself of choices in the future so everyone else in the world can have a chance, in deliberate and called-out mirror of his mother's sacrifice to ensure he would live on? I've absolutely, positively no patience for it.  The secret origins of Jon Osterman's fatalistic determinism, his share of nihilistic philosophy that marks him as the kind of broken person who will always seek or fall into power, the sort who would realistically become a superhero and prove the whole concept deeply neurotic and unhealthy!  Turns out, it was born from a selfless sacrifice inspired by love for a mother who gave her life, a grand noble gesture in which he actually chooses himself to create a deterministic universe by closing off all other avenues of probability, locking himself into the very cage we found in the pages of Watchmen!  Why, it makes a body come near to weeping, for this big blue nudist, this emblem of how awesome power paralyzes the mind and detaches one from earthly concerns to the point they'll sleep with a teenager and leave the world to hang in favor of private pursuits, he's secretly the greatest hero of all!  Giving up everything he might be so we the people can survive by his grace!  Hail!  Hail the savior, hail the martyr, hail the superhero! .-. It's wrong.  It's the polar opposite of what Moore did with Manhattan, to no decent constructive end.  Straczynski has a somewhat neat idea for the finale by literally flipping the pages upside down during a fourth issue meeting with Ozymandias to show the origin of how Adrian tricked Jon into playing his part in the giant squid scheme from the other character's perspective, but, \"The superhero who can move mountains with his mind and reshape atomic grids with his fingertips yet fails to make any actual difference because he is so terribly inadequate as a person was in fact a being of boundless altruism and self-abnegation,\" just plain burns my interest to the ground.  The Rorschach mini, I can at least understand how Azzarello tailored it to match the expectations of the worst stripe've Rorschach fan.  I cannot conceive how Straczynski convinced himself this direction was a worthwhile idea, beyond a sneaking suspicion he just wanted to play with branching timelines and pop quantum physics, and didn't much care for how the ideas would link up with Manhattan's brand of self-defeating nihilism.  Hughes' obsessively clean work DOES deliver some impressive page layouts and tweaks on the medium's methods of communicating message worthy Gibbons' own efforts at the same.  Unless you're only interested in the pretty pictures and care not a whit for what they're communicating, however, there is no reason to give this installment of Before Watchmen a serious read. Shan't say skip outright like I did for Rorschach.  Merely don't get yourself invested on an intellectual or emotional level.  Regard it as an object of no intrinsic worth for some passing moments, and then promptly remove it from your life.",
