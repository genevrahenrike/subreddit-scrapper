If you call them and press 1 for customer service, it just rings a few times and a message comes on that they are busy and to call back later. This has been the case for weeks of attempts. We need some investigation to start on this. Who knows how many RMAs are just sitting in their warehouse. They've had my monitor for 6 weeks with no way to contact them.",

I got a response that there was a change to the shipping date, and it was supposed to tell me the 25th.  I thought \"cool, that's fine\".  But then I got another email saying that the shipping date will be delayed an additional 2-3 days, due \"to make sure systems are shipped at the highest quality\".  But I was willing to wait the few more days. It is now the 29th, and still the order does not show any updates.  The status is still \"We've received your order.\"  I've reached out via email again yesterday - no response. When is this going to ship out?  Even on the website , it still shows an estimated ship date of August 25th.

Many owners are still experiencing: Black screens and signal loss Faulty KVM functions Endless waiting for firmware updates that never arrive The last firmware release in 2024 failed to resolve these issues, and there has been no follow-up in over a year. It is clear Cooler Master has left customers with monitors that do not function reliably. Here is the proposal: Gamers Nexus has recently highlighted how Razer is neglecting its customers. They have shown they are willing to hold companies accountable when products fall short. We should comment on their most recent video and call attention to the unresolved problems with these monitors. If enough users speak up, it will be harder to ignore and more likely that Gamers Nexus investigates. The Razer video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhfqhCxqpQ8&lc=UgycVWMVPESIcTpYgTt4AaABAg If you have experienced issues with your GP27U/GP27Q, please take a moment to comment. The more voices there are, the stronger the case will be.",

The Psu finally gave in to it's age... case has some scars of time but still holds finely together, going to see if it's big enough for some more modern components and rebuild it anew.

      "content_preview": "My original computer required 3 x 6+2 pin for rtx 3080 Evga ftw3 and purchased MWE Gold V2 850. I started to have some issue with the power this year thus reached out for the warranty. Thankfully, they replaced it and was fairly quick but with MWE V3 model. With all the gpu change, they no longer have 3 x 6+2 pci cables any more but only 2 with   a 12v pci cable. Even the instructions states to avoid using daisy connector. I had emailed them numerous times requesting an additional 6+2 pci cables. They replied purchase it from cablemod.com (they DO NOT have compatible cables for V3 850w) they dont believe V2 850w has 3 x 6+2 pci cables and telling me I am wrong, but its clearly stated on their website and I had them. they refused to either sell me or provide me the 3rd cable but only claimed not mix pci cables from V2 that i had owned. So I only have an option to either change my gpu because they could not replace the psu with the same compatibility OR just don't use their replacement due to the compatibility issue. I would not support the cooler master in a long run as they will refuse to provide warranty when there is an issue with compatibility. I just wanted to share my honest experience and how poorly they support their warranty related to compatibility problem.",

My only concern is that I'm considering using a 360mm liquid cooler (Arctic Liquid Freezer III) and a 304mm GPU (Asus PRIME RTX 5080), and am unsure whether I'll be able to get these to fit in the case. I'm okay with downgrading to a 280mm cooler (or even spending more on an SFX PSU) if it means it'll fit, but before biting the bullet and changing my current build, I wanted to see what you all had to say. I only ask because I've read anecdotal reports of people having luck fitting in larger components than recommended. I'm also a little concerned about cooling and airflow in general, if I'm being entirely honest. Any input is greatly appreciated. Current Build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VXqfzP Thanks!",

I also have 7 Deepcool CF120 Plus fans installed (3 at top+ 3 at front+ 1 rear). I was thinking of installing the AIO on top replacing the Deepcool fans, I haven't got my hands on the AIO yet but ChatGPT tells me that it won't fit on top. Is there any chance it could fit in front? On the box it says the radiator is 398mm in length. I wanted to install it in the push configuration on front. Is it possible? The thing is I don't wanna get rid of those Deepcool fans so I was thinking of installing the Arctic fans behind the radiator (The oreintation will be like : Mesh - 3 Deepcool Fans - Radiator - Arctic fans) pulling in air inside for better airflow and the top 3 deepcool fans and 1 rear fan for exhaust",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I just bought this fan Cooler Master SickleFlow Edge 120 ARGB (MFX-B2DN-25NP2-R2, Black) , and in the product description it says: \"The package also includes an ARGB Gen 2 mini controller, which connects to a USB header on the motherboard and allows lighting control via Cooler Master MasterCTRL and MasterPlus+ software. Whether you want subtle effects or vibrant light shows, it’s all within reach.\" Does this mean I can connect other ARGB fans to this controller as well? I don’t have an ARGB header on my motherboard, so I’m wondering if this would let me control multiple ARGB fans through the software. Thanks!",
