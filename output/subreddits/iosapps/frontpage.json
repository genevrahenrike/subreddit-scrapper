The idea came from those small, sweet moments you share with someone you love (like eating kulfi together). I wanted to create a simple space that captures that feeling. Right now, Kulfi has three main things: üì∏ Snaps : Send a snap to your partner, but you can only unlock theirs by replying with your own. It feels like a little exchange instead of just ‚Äúsending a photo.‚Äù ‚ùì Questions : Daily and themed questions to answer, compare, and spark conversations. üéÆ Never Have I Ever : A fun game to play with your partner and laugh over each other‚Äôs answers. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs live today. But I‚Äôm already building more - chat, widgets, and more couple games are on the way soon. It‚Äôs early, it‚Äôs not perfect, but I‚Äôd love for you to try it and share your thoughts. Your feedback will really help shape what Kulfi becomes. üëâ App Store link- https://apps.apple.com/in/app/kulfi-the-couples-app/id6740579527",

It‚Äôs taken months of work (and a large amount of caffeine) just to get to this point, and now that it‚Äôs about to go live, I‚Äôm realizing how much I still don‚Äôt know about launching the right way. My goal with this project has always been to create something of real substance, not just another app, but something that people can genuinely benefit from. That‚Äôs why I want to go into this launch with open eyes and learn from those of you who have already been through the fire. I‚Äôd be really grateful if you could share: What mistakes did you make during your first launch that I should try to avoid? If you could go back to your first launch, what would you do differently? I want to make sure I‚Äôm not just blindly pushing this out there without learning from those who‚Äôve already walked this path. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I deeply appreciate any advice you‚Äôre willing to share with me.",

What this does Instead of sending \"My name is Sarah and I work at Microsoft making $120k\" to Claude/GPT, these models detect PII and replace it with semantically similar alternatives: \"My name is Jessica and I work at TechCorp making $112k\". Query intent stays the same, but your real info stays private. Most \"privacy\" solutions either: Send your data to be anonymized (defeating the purpose) Use simple regex replacement (breaks context) Are way too heavy for real-time use IOS APP Enchanted by Freysa Blog post with more technical details",

After 8 months of evenings and weekends, my food scanner app is finally on the App Store. Started this whole thing because I got tired of standing in grocery aisles trying to decode ingredient lists (seriously, what the hell is E621?). Some friends has serious food sensitivities and shopping was becoming this whole research project every single time. So yeah, I thought \"how hard can it be to build an app?\" Spoiler: Pretty fucking hard lol Lost count of how many times I almost gave up. The barcode scanning alone took me 3 weeks to get right - turns out scanning crumpled packages in bad supermarket lighting is a whole science. And don't get me started on parsing nutritional data from different countries... that was a rabbit hole I wasn't prepared for. But here we are! The app basically scans products and gives you a simple score based on what's actually in them. No BS health claims, just data. You can set it up for different dietary needs (kids, fitness, allergies, whatever) and it adjusts the scoring accordingly. Edit: The app is called Grano btw (means grain in Italian, sounded cooler than \"FoodChecker\" lol)",

      "content_preview": "How DailyTaskr turned my weekend brainstorming into daily productivity wins Every weekend, I'd sit on my couch and reflect on my week - complex tasks completed, fitness progress, new programming languages learned, or technical skills that could boost my software engineering career. I'd sketch all these thoughts and ideas in my notebook, but honestly? Sometimes I'd miss these crucial reflection sessions. Missing these weekend planning moments was incredibly frustrating. I needed a way to stay on track with both my short-term and long-term goals without constantly feeling like I was falling behind. Enter DailyTaskr - the game-changer that transformed everything. This isn't just another todo app. It's a super lightweight, easy-to-use productivity tool that does exactly what I needed: Key Features That Changed My Life: - Smart Task Creation: Plan tasks for upcoming days/weeks with ease - Gentle Reminders: Customizable notifications (15 min, 30 min, or even a day ahead) - Check-in/Check-out System: Weekly/daily reminders to review and plan - Deadline Management: Never rush or panic about missing deadlines again My Weekly Routine Now: - Monday & Friday mornings: Check-in reminders to plan my week - Every evening: Check-out reminders to mark completed tasks - Weekend reflection: Actually happens consistently now The Results After One Month: My daily routine went from chaotic to laser-focused. Instead of moving randomly through my day, I now have a clear plan and just follow the reminders. My productivity skyrocketed because everything was already planned - I just needed to execute. Why This App is Special: It's not just about checking off tasks. It's about building a sustainable system that keeps you organized and productive. The check-in/check-out reminders create accountability, and the custom notifications ensure you never miss important deadlines.
