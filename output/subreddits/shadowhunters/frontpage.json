A mature, stylized vibe like Castlevania or Arcane would capture the gothic/romantic feel so much better than live action, which always risks looking cheap or rushed. Then you could time jump into TMI and TDA, with Magnus tying it all together. I’d like 3 seasons (one per book) 8-10 episodes for both series so 6 seasons in total.

It's not that I don't want to , I really do , I've thought about it often and The Last Hours is my favourite series in the whole of the chronicles ; but I just can't bring myself to. I don't know if it's because I'm not ready to say goodbye to the world , or because I saw a spoiler as to who died and I'm scared , or because I started annotating it and I want to annotate when I get back to it but I don't feel I'm not up for it , or if I'm just in a long reading slump but for whatever reason I just can't seem to bring myself to finish it :/ Does anyone have any advice or any words of encouragement to get me to go back to it and finish the last book in what is literally my fav series in TSC world ?",

      "content_preview": "and no I don't mean the same old  \"Christopher shouldn't have died \" , \" Alec deserved to have more of a spotlight \" or the die hard debates about clary , I mean some truly niche and unheard opinions that you know are unpopular, nitpicky or just straight up weird. Possibly about minor side or one time characters. I'll go first I wish ke yi tian was actually a person who became a villain instead of being a double double agent. He would've made a fantastic villain that actually showed the repercussions of what becomes to good people when something as hard as the cold peace passes and actively screws over a select group of people and others affiliated with them. How even the best of people can become willing to fall to despicable lows because they feel like they have no choice. Cassie struggles with creating villains with depth and while some do have sympathetic pasts most just feel shallow, overreactive and over the top cartoonish. While she does have a lot of good points in her series I don't think  her villains are one of them. Out of all of her current villains the only one who a valid crash out was mortmain and he was a gross bum willing to groom and rape a teenager. We shouldn't have gotten a PoV of Julian while he was under the spell in the queen of air and darkness. This one is honestly more of a personal nit pick than anything I have against the series but I think when we don't know what's going on behind Julian after the spell , what makes him tick , what makes him act the way he does, it makes him much more scarier and interesting , especially when read from a 3rd person pov about him. We now lack the familiarity we had with him in the first 2 books so is Julian still the same person ? how much of his emotions made him who he is? what makes him different now?  would've been an interesting question to ponder while reading about this character with possibly unknown motives. Making Lily Chen a turn coat would make me upset. I mean don't get me wrong , having a longtime possibly beloved side character switch sides  would make for an excellent narrative decision , I just wouldn't like it because I'm attached to her lol. Edit: My bad the best villain was clearly Malcolm Fade, I can't believe I forgot the one villain who was done right and perfectly  and replaced  him with Axel . 10/10 goated evil  character and the best plot twist in the entire franchise. Whoops",

Even more interesting than Shadowhunters if I'm being honest. Like, the rune thing is cool, but that's kind of all Shadowhunters got going for them. They seem underpowered in comparison to other Downworlders. Angel totally fucked up initially and should've boosted their powers a bit or something. Now that I'm almost through the first three books, I'm pretty confident that Warlocks kick ass.",

I know everyone loves Ty, so please don't kill me for saying this. On the other hand, I think that with the whole prophecy thing we see in BiB + the Darkened Ones + the Seelie Queen, that's enough for a villain, but please don't turn Ash into Sebastian 2.0.",

If you combine Nazism with a dictatorship, you basically get the Clave. There’s no democracy within it—how can the Downworlders ever feel like part of a political body like that? A governing body that only defends the interests of Shadowhunters will never achieve peace. Most of the representatives in the Council are former members of the Circle, which is simply unacceptable. The Clave places Shadowhunters on a level of superiority very similar to how Hitler exalted the so-called Aryan race during World War II, not to mention the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust. This scene is mirrored when a political body that promises peace allows the massacre of Downworlders to happen without proper recognition or justice. It’s outrageous that there are no real laws or democracy. Decisions should never be based on interests, but on fair rules!  #Shadowhunters  #TheClave  #Downworlders #ShadowhuntersFandom #Saveshadowhunters",

With the amount of tattoos I've seen people get and artists in the fandom, just feels like the right thing to do. Could even do an addendum for Clary's runes. I've seen posters and the wiki tries to keep up to date, but... I want more. Lol (Sorry if this has been mentioned before, I don't have Tumblr and Reddit isn't a fan of searching on my phone. Lol)",

      "content_preview": "Update from here . I can now kind of see why people said the author's writing was one of her more weaker points having gone through the first two books and am now 76% through the third. She makes some odd grammar, syntax, and vocabulary choices throughout the books. Her descriptions remain beautiful and are still high above than what I am capable of crafting right now. But some of the things she's written has had me scratching my head multiple times and sometimes took me rereading it to figure it out. Not that it's a widespread problem, of course, just what I noticed. She'll also be using third-person limited when talking about someone else, then suddenly throw in dialogue in the same paragraph so I'm thinking it's the person she was talking about previously that's speaking, when in reality it was someone entirely different. So I've also been confused a few times in that respect. But maybe I'm just a bad reader? I don't know. Overall, still loving the series! Definitely going to be finishing all of The Mortal Instruments Books for sure!",

When Tessa is captured the only person she dreamed of was Will, that made me a little upset, heck, she was Jem's fiancée. The only time she dreamed about Jem was actually Will. I know that Tessa also loved Jem in unimaginable ways but it's clear that it was always her and Will, I haven't read the other books yet, I know that Jem returns, but I think he deserved someone who really loved him (not that Tessa doesn't love him, but it was always Will for her). In the scene where Will and Tessa sleep because they thought it was their last night alive, it made me feel sick to my stomach. I know they thought Jem was dead but that feeling was inevitable, damn your parabatai died the day before, and you just found out that your fiancé died. And then they sleep together??? I understand that the two of them loved each other (all three of them actually) and they thought it was their last chance to express that love, but I can't help but feel bad reading that. That scene in another context would be perfect, but for me, it wasn't something cool to read at the time it happened. So much so that after they find out about her brother Jeremiah, Tessa tries to explain herself, even though she doesn't need explanations because James understood them, and knew that they loved each other.",

SPOILERS FOR CLOCKWORK ANGEL !! #teamjem SORRY NOT SORRY i think will is really funny with his one liners (so THATS where jace gets it from) but i just love how gentle and dorky jem is! really love the different perspectives of how addiction effects people and the story e.g. the difference between jem’s addiction and nate's gambling addiction the nate twist CAME OUT OF NOWHERE was literally jumping around my living room when it happened really intrigued by jessamine’s storyline with not wanting to be a shadowhunter… i feel like all shadowhunters are always like its nerf or nothin when it comes to shadowhuntering and its interesting to see a different side of it the lightwood family bloodline is lucky they have alec, izzy and maryse cause if they didn’t i would HATE THEM #fuckgabrielandgideon tessa is all the parts of clary that i like but is wayyy more mature. i know she’s the same age but i think the time period causes her to be much more mature and THINK BEFORE SHE ACTS unlike clary… i love her love for literature and how she carries herself as a character. sooo excited to spend more time with her throughout the series i’m just writing this to get this thought down but i feel like there’s going to be a storyline with henry losing his memory??? he seems to always forget what he’s going to say and be a bit spacey all in all... i absolutely LOVED starting this series i'm falling in love with CC's writing all over again since i started TMI like 7 years ago and i'm so excited to embark on this journey of TSC!! also i'm working on my shadowhunter's shelves now that i have all of the books! i'm really wanting to display them in a pretty way cause it's just my special interest atm LOL thank you for reading ! let me know what you think and if you have anymore thoughts on clockwork angel (NOT THE OTHER BOOKS PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD) <333",

      "content_preview": "I'm going to be so real right now, Cordelia Carstairs is one of those characters that just means everything to me. I'm probably one of her earliest original fans. I fell in love with her initial portrait back in 2014 when I was 17, and was ecstatic a few months later when she had her glow-up and Cassie made her a woc. In 2016, 4 years before we even met her, she became the 4th character EVER that I scraped together money to buy a custom Funko pop of. I have a fanart I drew in 2018 of her and James running through a garden (which makes me highkey think the last line of ChoT came to me in a vision.) I'm 29 now and Cordelia is, quite simply, my daughter. After almost a week of stewing, I'm still pretty devastated we didn't get to spend more time with her and James. I know that this objectively isn't a huge deal in the grand scheme of life, but I thought I'd be getting a happy send-off for two of my favourite-ever characters for TWO YEARS. And now... what, I just never get to see them again? That's IT? James' final romantic speech to my best girl is written by his sister? I genuinely don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a piece of media- book, series, TV show, movie, music album, anything - as I am with The Beautiful Ajatara. I love Cordelia and James so much, they deserved better, and WE deserved better. Also I can't believe that she used James and Cordelia as mouthpiece to air out her beef with the fandom. I'm a diehard ChoT fan/defender, but it's really fucked up that she (unprofessionally) made an entire exchange essentially scolding people who criticized it. This especially pisses me off because 90% of Herondaisy fans were perfectly happy with ChoT, her beef is entirely with a section of loud, obnoxious Kit/Gracetopher stans who don't even like Herondaisy. Who is she scolding???? The fans who didn't complain about it to her and in part pledged the Kickstarter to see Herondaisy again???? Screw that. \"It's just a story????\" That's a quote from JAMES? I can think of no character more OOC to say that. #notmyjames",

      "content_preview": "Okay, so I just re-sparkled my childhood love of the Mortal Instruments series by finally reading The Infernal Devices (I tried reading them as a kid too, but I think the setting + language made it difficult. Absolutely ADORED it as an adult though!) Anyway, I happen to own the entire TMI series, and the first book of the Dark Artifices, and I’m kind of at a crossroads of which to read now! (Ideally it’d be the Last Hours, I know, but I unfortunately don’t own them at the moment.) Which series do you love more, and why? Also, if it matters, I did finish the Mortal Instruments series as a kid (of course don’t fully remember all the intricacies) but haven’t read more than 100 pages of Lady Midnight and that was years ago, too.",

      "content_preview": "I’m rereading the Shadowhunters series in its entirety, and I’m reminded of how frustrating Alec’s portrayal is in the original Mortal Instruments trilogy compared to later books. Alec and Jace’s Parabatai Bond Alec is introduced as Jace’s parabatai, supposedly “closer than brothers.” But much of their relationship is undermined to emphasize Jace’s romance with Clary. Instead of showing a strong platonic bond alongside Alec’s unrequited feelings, the narrative often reduces Alec’s role to highlight how much more important Clary is to Jace. That’s disappointing because I love reading about strong friendships between queer and straight characters, and the trilogy rarely gives us that. We hardly ever see Jace and Alec fighting together or spending time alone in meaningful ways. The first time I thought Jace truly cared about Alec was when Alec was badly injured by a demon—only for Jace to emphasize he was focused on Clary leading up to that moment. 2. Alec’s Characterization Alec often feels like a punching bag. He’s the oldest and the responsible one, but younger characters constantly disrespect him. He’s portrayed as cold, grumpy, or even an “asshole,” without the balance of redeeming qualities we see later. His actual skills as a Shadowhunter—especially as a talented archer and strategist—are rarely highlighted. A major reason for this is that the trilogy builds Jace up at Alec’s expense. Jace is framed as handsome, witty, and gifted. Max even likes Jace more than Alec. 3. Alec’s Queer Storyline in TMI This is where Alec’s writing suffers the most. Not only is his characterization weak, but his queer representation is also mishandled. Clary tells Isabelle that she thinks Alec is gay behind his back. Luckily Isabelle already knew and was supportive, but if she hadn’t been, that could have been devastating. (Tip: if you suspect someone is queer, don’t gossip about it behind their back.) Jace later tells a room full of people that his “friend” is dating Magnus. He doesn’t say Alec’s name outright, but it’s a strong clue. Alec panics, and Jace effectively manipulates him into outing himself. This can be just as harmful as direct outing. (Tip: don’t drop hints about someone else’s secret—it’s not your place.) When Alec almost outs himself under the fearless rune’s influence, it reads less like meaningful character development and more like the story mocking him for staying closeted. One moment that particularly bothered me was Magnus getting angry that Alec wouldn’t introduce him to his parents. On one hand, Magnus was justified in feeling hurt by Alec’s coldness in the moment. On the other, pressuring Alec to come out in a homophobic culture is manipulative. Coming out should always be on someone’s own terms. A preferred dynamic would have been Magnus asking what Alec needed to feel comfortable and ready before coming out. 4. Malec as a Couple in TMI Honestly, there isn’t much of them in the trilogy, and I don’t entirely blame Cassandra Clare—publishers were less supportive of queer storylines back then. But what we do get isn’t that compelling. The age gap also makes things uncomfortable: Magnus is centuries old with lots of romantic and sexual experience, while Alec is an inexperienced eighteen-year-old. According to The Bane Chronicles, Magnus wouldn’t have pursued Alec if he were younger, which helps a bit, but it’s still frustrating that the only gay couple pairs a teen with an immortal, while the M/F couples are age-matched peers. 5. Later Books Thankfully, everything improves for Alec in the last three books of TMI and beyond. His characterization deepens, his skills are highlighted, and his relationship with Magnus becomes far more enjoyable to read. Later Shadowhunter books also offer a wider range of queer characters and relationships, most of which avoid the pitfalls of Alec’s early storyline. In Summary Alec’s writing in the original trilogy is weak, both as a character and as queer representation. But his later development shows just how much Clare grew as a writer. His arc may have started poorly, but it paved the way for much stronger and more diverse queer representation in the Shadowhunters universe.",
