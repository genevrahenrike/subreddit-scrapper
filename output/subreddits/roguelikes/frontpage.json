      "content_preview": "Salutations, adventurers! 👋 This week on The Proving Grounds Podcast , we check into the gothic halls of Golden Krone Hotel , a roguelike where light and shadow, humans and vampires, and quick 20–30 minute runs keep you on your toes. We talk about what makes its mechanics unique, why it’s such a great entry point for new roguelike fans, and how even veterans will find plenty of bite here. 🦇 We also read a bunch of listener answers to our Question of the Week: Do you prefer turn-based combat or real-time with pause, and why? Some really great community perspectives came out of this one. To wrap things up, we take a quick detour into Star Wars: The Old Republic — looking at why it’s still alive and kicking today, and how its storytelling DNA makes it a true CRPG-adjacent experience worth exploring. 🎧 Listen here: Episode 17 – Golden Krone Hotel 💬 And come hang out with us on Discord: https://discord.gg/nSSTqzfKmz Next Question of the Week: What’s the single most memorable dungeon or area you’ve explored in a blobber, CRPG, or roguelike—and why did it stick with you? Answers below may be read on the next podcast!",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I am Yannick, I’ve been working on Blood & Chaos for over two years now, but I waited to post here until I had something playable. B&C is a party-based roguelike, inspired by Ultima IV and my old tabletop sessions (I won’t tell you my age, but let’s just say I was around before Rogue was created ;-) ). One of the biggest challenges (and where a lot of my time went!) has been trying to find the right commands so controlling the whole party doesn't feel too cumbersome. I’m a regular participant in the roguelikedev Sharing Saturday hosted by u/Kyzrati , so some of you may have seen some of my updates there. I am posting today because I finally started the first alpha demo playtest (quite a milestone for me!). For now it’s focused on the dungeon-crawling part, still a bit rough, but most of the core systems are working. The complete game will also feature party creation and levelling up, an overworld with towns, NPCs with dialogues, a main story & quests, etc. It would really help me if you’d try this demo and share your feedback! Here is the playtest link with instructions (+ short survey): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiMCieju_88UWCsbkicAWS1gvJCM4R_FUKlziJDG0y7k8Puw/viewform?usp=dialog And here’s the Steam page if you’d like to wishlist it: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628880/Blood__Chaos/ Thanks a lot!

It’s definitely a great game, but I miss the feeling of being part of a truly dynamic world, with events that can shape it. Is there a roguelike where the world is alive, with a functioning economy, \"conquerable\" cities, or at least a genuinely dynamic ecosystem? I also tried the demo of Soulash 2 , but in its current state it didn’t completely win me over. EDIT: I won't buy it because I don't want to fund some crazy guy. Is there anything else out there that matches what I’m looking for? Thanks!",

We put special emphasis on permadeath, procedural generation, and turn-based combat. While it may not fulfill every aspect of a traditional roguelike, we aimed to stay true to the spirit of the genre while making it more approachable for mobile players. Unfortunately, not many people have played it yet… 😅 But the game supports multiple languages (English, Chinese, Korean, French, and more), so I’d love for players around the world to give it a try! https://preview.redd.it/monorogue-a-classic-style-roguelike-with-permadeath-v0-q2a3cnrttjjf1.png ⸻ 🧩 Key Features: •\tOver 100 monsters and 200 unique items** •\tRandomly generated dungeon maps every time you play •\tSimple tap-based controls •\tDesigned for smartphones, but fully playable on PC too •\tFree to play on itch.io , iOS and Android! 🎮 Play here: 👉 https://toihaus.itch.io/monorogue 📱 Also available for iOS and Android! https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/monorogue/id6748881120 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asobuild.monorogue ⸻ Any feedback (game balance, UI, pacing, etc.) would be incredibly appreciated.

      "content_preview": "Hey everybody Some time ago I asked whether this community has any experience with running roguelikes on Windows ARM devices. There was only some feedback, maybe because these devices are still a bit rare. So since I finally got my own new device (Surface Pro 12\"), I wanted to share my findings in case anyone is interested… In short, all roguelikes I tested (see below) run without any issues. It’s probably because the typical roguelike needs basically no resources hence Windows has no problems translating x86/x64 roguelikes on the fly. Some further details: The physical keyboard has no numpad so arrow or VI keys are needed. The two stock on-screen keyboards shipped with Windows are … okay-ish. They do their job but have very limited customization options. I didn’t test third-party on-screen keyboards. With the physical keyboard being detachable, the Surface Pro can be used as a tablet. Meaning on-screen keyboards are really needed. Also, roguelikes with mouse support are easier to play and using fingers or the pen on the touch screen works well. I played each of the following games for at least five minutes or so, creating a new character and running around, fighting at least once: Angband Brogue CE Cogmind Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Gnollhack Golden Krone Hotel Jupiter Hell Classic Tangledeep Sil-Q Zorbus Cogmind, Jupiter Hell Classic, Tangledeep, and Zorbus work extremely well and have excellent mouse support. I played those a bit longer :) ps: If you \"stream\" a game and play online (e.g., Angband live, DCSS web, ...) you won't have any issues. But you need to be online of course.",

      "content_preview": "Hey r/roguelikes , glad to have a reason to post again :) We've just hit the big button - Jupiter Hell Classic is live in Early Access! If you remember DRL, this carries that same core spirit, rebuilt on its original engine but with upgraded graphics, UX, FX, and most importantly new content. It isn't just DRL with polish - while integrating some Jupiter Hell ideas (more advanced traits, itemization, class skills), it blends them with DRL's mechanics, playing to its strenghts of environmental interaction and destruction. Compared to Jupiter Hell? Clean 2D tiles, full environmental destruction, fluids with gameplay effects, faster pacing, 8-directional movement with DRL's dodge mechanics and other DRL mechanical idiosyncrasies, and a much easier platform for visually modding the game. ( more info in FAQ - https://steamcommunity.com/app/3126530/discussions/0/532101388398787747/ ) This is the start of our Early Access journey - regular updates, new things to discover, and a growing identity that's distinct from both Jupiter Hell and its venerable predecessor. It's also a quicker testbed for potential ideas for the future :). https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126530/Jupiter_Hell_Classic/ As with all our releases, the success of this launch really depends on you - yes, you. Traditional roguelikes are a niche, mostly overlooked by mainstream press and big content creators. If you enjoy what we're doing (and trust me, we have a lot more planned!), help us spread the word. Tell your friends, leave a review, share it in your communities, and let us know what you think! Questions about mechanics, design, EA plans, or the future of ChaosForge? Ask away. I'll be glad to answer here! Thanks for letting me make roguelikes all these years <3 Yours truly, Kornel Kisielewicz",

      "content_preview": "I thought I might share my thoughts here, who knows, I might get something out of it. \"How coherent is it going to be?\" you might ask, \"Not very.\" is the answer. I *really* want to get into more of the older school roguelikes like Brogue and DCSS, but I think Caves of Qud has spoiled me too much. I adore the exploration, learning, and absolute insanity that comes from playing roguelikes, but damn, there are a few things that really get in the way of rogue-ing out. I'm going to compare everything to CoQ, so fair warning on that front, since I think it's probably the best game in this genre. First I want to talk about a few of the newer titles I'm having trouble getting into. Cogmind is up first, since its likely going to be the one I actually continue playing the most, just to prove to myself I can (and keep in mind I only have maybe 10 hours in it). Cogmind is *very* cool, and I've had a decent amount of fun just scrambling around, but I have complaints about the color scheme. The old-school coding aesthetic is very aesthetic, but it really hurts my eyes after a while. I think my biggest complaint about it (compared to CoQ) is the limited starting options. Most of my attempted runs feel the same, with very little variety until you really get going, whereas starting in CoQ can be interesting just to check out new methods and strategies of playing the early-game, and seeing how it evolves. Another minor gripe is that I have no idea what I'm doing, or what my end-goal is. In CoQ you wanna get to the spindle and follow the main quest, but idk if I haven't gotten that far (furthest level is the factory), or if I've missed it, or what, but a major driving force behind my desire to beat a game is the end-goal I'm trying to achieve, which Cogmind currently lacks for me. Elin is up next. I've played Elin for about 8-ish hours at this point. I love the design and color-scheme of Elin a lot, no complaints there. Elin doesn't feel very roguelike to me, even in the permadeath mode. Elin feels much more like an RPG focused entirely on base-building. That's fine of course, but I wanted an actually pretty dungeon diving plot-driven experience with optional base-building mechanics to engage with as needed. The base-building feels like the core of the game, not dungeon diving, which feels very odd to me. I'm still probably going to play it, but I'm skeptical on if it's going to be the roguelike experience I'm looking for, since It doesn't seem designed for that type of play. I have The Doors of Trithius and Stoneshard, as well as Tuoni on my list for current-gen roguelikes that look like a lot of fun, but I want to wait until they are fully released so that I can play them as they are fully meant to be. They look mostly like what I want, with a plot, in-depth gameplay, exploration, the works, I just don't want to play them before they are done cooking. Jupiter Hell is on my to-try list, though I'm not in love with the general vibes. We shall see on that front. Old School™ titles are next, which I seem to have the most difficulty getting into, starting with Brogue and DCSS. I really want to play Brogue, it looks fantastic for an ASCII-based experience, and I've heard nothing but good things about it overall. I want to play DCSS, since I've heard its wildly complex and expansive, with crazy amounts of content to have fun with. My problem with both of these titles is as simple as it is soul-crushing for me: I can't stand that these games have no audio. I open up Brogue and walk around and my will to play is consumed with every step I make without sound. I don't know why its such a big thing for me, but it is, and I hate that it locks me out of what I think would be a pretty cool experience. ADOM and TOME are in the same category, where I think they might be fun, but honestly my graphical gripes show themselves when I look at their steam page. They just look *sooo* dated, and I'm not sure quite yet how much it bothers me, but I know that it does. I'm able to handle DCSS's graphics, kinda, but I'll need to investigate these some more to see if I can stomach them. I think that's kinda it, honestly. TLDR: I need Caves of Qud 2 through 9 to satisfy me, and they are so slow on making new stuff. Please.... work on new content faster, I require more things to do, more 70 hour runs to lose because I totally forgot that my head could be dismembered and a phase cat caught me lacking. I need more I tell you, MORE. I'm tweaking over here licking the walls for a taste of sentient fungi and teleportitis. Anyways, thats my thoughts on the matter. Emphasis on the low coherency. I lost my reality anchor and the birds are calling.",

The controls are simple and the gameplay is fun with your model changing with what weapon/armor they put on and the whole UI seems good. I'm looking for any recommendations that are similar in terms of good graphics, UI and easy of control. I've tried CDDA but found that game overwhelming",

      "content_preview": "Version 3.3.1 of BOSS is now available for Windows, Linux, and macOS from the BOSS home page: https://80.style/#/plunderbunny/boss/introduction . This is a minor update. The only significant change is that the game now uses more colours (256 instead of 16). Important notes: Save games from all previous versions are not compatible with version 3.3 - if you have a 3.0, 3.1, or 3.2 game in progress, you should finish it before installing version 3.3.1. The High-score file and settings file from older versions are compatible with the new version. Filters from previous versions are not compatible with version 3.3.x onwards. You can download updated pre-defined filters from the Boss home page. On macOS 15 (Sequoia), the administrator is now required to approve the execution of BOSS the first time it is run. Please refer to the instructions on the macOS BOSS download page. On Windows, the Windows Defender SmartScreen may prevent BOSS from executing the first time it is run. Please refer to the instructions on the Windows BOSS download page.",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys, For the last month or so, I’ve been working on a preservation project called restoHack, a modern restoration of the original Hack (the predecessor to NetHack). This isn’t a fork or a clone. It’s a clean rebuild of the original BSD version, now playable on modern systems via CMake. I’m announcing that it is now fully playable and buildable, with all original functionality restored. The core philosophy of the project was restoration and preservation. That meant preserving not just the gameplay, but also the source code structure, quirks, and system behavior, even where it’s weird and archaic by today’s standards. Highlights: ⚙️ Modern CMake build system 🧠 Systematic K&R → ANSI C99 conversion (230+ functions modernized) 💾 Save system and record file behavior preserved (warts and all) 🕹️ 100% authentic 1984 gameplay 🧪 AUR package: restohack 📦 GitHub: https://github.com/Critlist/restoHack If you’ve ever wanted to experience the game that bridges the gap between Rogue and NetHack, I invite you to check it out. Update! Hey guys, it's me, Critlist, the restoHack guy. Just wanted to let you all know that static binaries for restoHack are now officially live on my GitHub! No need to build from source No external libraries needed Just download, extract, and run Static Binary Download (Linux x86_64) GitHub Repo If you run into any issues, please file them on GitHub, or honestly, just DM me here and I’ll file them for you so nothing slips through the cracks. Thank y’all so much for all the support. Seeing new players discover Hack for the first time in decades has been surreal. More updates coming soon. Let me know what you think, and good luck in the dungeon! -- Critlist 🖤🧙‍♂️",

      "content_preview": "Being honest from the get-go here, I've always felt somewhat intimidated by the genre. I don't know if it's the permadeath (and permaloss of progress), the projected complexity that triples in my mind when I'm watching a review of one that catches my eye, or something else completely. Suffice to say that I've always oscillated in this limbo of games that are not strictly speaking, traditional roguelikes but not quite roguelites either. You know the ones, Darkest Dungeon (the first game, I actually hated the second BECAUSE of how much it became \"just another roguelite\") and some tactics RPGs that have a heavy roguelike aspect to them. Battle Brothers being my hands down favorite, and some others here and there, the latest one being the Lost in the Open demo which has that same low fantasy grit and RNG mercilessness that I loved in both previous games I mentioned. But, and to my own surprise too actually, I realized I never played a true-true roguelike if that appellation makes sense now when so many people are confusing all these genre labels. I did get interested in Caves of Qud after watching Sseth's review of it but I just never got it. One of those cases where it was so interesting to hear about it that I was... almost a bit frightened off by how steep the difficulty curve looked at the time. It's in my bucket list for this autumn though. But the main point now - I played the original Rogue today, some devil made me buy it on Steam for like 2 bucks, and I admit I did it partly for the meme. Put some hours in and yeah... The game is dated but I wouldn't say outdated. It's tough -- it's plain that it's meant to be tough by design -- but what surprised me was how much it hearkens back to old D&D runs as they were played several decades ago. The non modular aspect in how you can use any ability at any time and there are no separate \"battle encounters\" as I learned to view them. It actually gives even such an old game a kind of flow that would otherwise feel stuttery. Some aspects even made me recall my favorite games in unrelated genres (the absolute NEED to identify items, like in OG Diablo 1, that just spontaneously occured to me mentally)... I feel almost at risk of just listing out generic stuff that has been done to death in most RPGs from then to now, but it's also the thing that stood out most sharply. How in each of the discrete systems I can see some aspect I grew to love in another game. The game, ultimately, is not outdated. It's just way too far back in time to be assessed in comparison with any modern game (which likely wouldn't exist without it). But most importantly, I think Rogue made me completely shed that fear I had, that intimidation I felt in the face of these systems. Now that I finally get that core and I guess the almost wellspring that inspired a whole genre. Feel more confident to finally try out Qud, and maybe get back into Dwarf Fortress one of these days. So thanks Rogue - probably won't be coming back to it, but you made the scales fall down from my eyes so I can finally see the genre a bit more clearly now.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all! I’m a longtime fan of tactics games and roguelikes (Unreal World, Nethack, ADOM, Dwarf Fortress), and I’ve been working solo on a project called Chains on Sand . The idea is a brutal, fantasy arena where you create a gladiator, fight for survival, and everything is lost on death—except your legacy. Key features: Turn-based, tile-based combat with hit locations and injury (every move matters) Procedural generation for enemies and loot Permadeath—each run is unique, and if you die, that’s it No meta-progression between runs Inspired by classic roguelikes and tabletop combat I’d love any feedback from fellow fans—especially around combat feel and tactical depth. If you try the demo, let me know what you think or what would make it better! https://preview.redd.it/demo-chains-on-sand-turn-based-tile-based-arena-tactics-v0-qtwlyippnhgf1.png https://preview.redd.it/demo-chains-on-sand-turn-based-tile-based-arena-tactics-v0-0onwgi0rnhgf1.png Thanks for checking it out, and thanks to the community here for all the inspiration over the years!",

      "content_preview": "So I've had several wins now but they've been pretty sorcery dependent except for an eye build and a death roulette build. I want to do a conjuration-centric run but the closest I've gotten used Moon Speaker and arcane damage - basically I just used Angelic Chorus and Archons to boost the damage from magic missile/void beam/void lantern. I can't seem to get a build going using minions as the primary source of damage. I biffed a run where I got the swamp shrine (the one that gives a minion a poison aura equal in damage and radius to its level) on Spider Queen, which made me very sad. A void frog pulled me through a wall and I got blasted with 100+damage in a single turn. Anyway, any tips? Are conjuration builds dependent on getting good shrines?",

Essentially, what I think would be fun is to control multiple heroes, each of which gets a turn per round to do their thing. I have seen this in iOS games but haven't seen it in a traditional ascii-first roguelike. I like to serve games up via a telnet BBS so ascii-first is crucial :)",
