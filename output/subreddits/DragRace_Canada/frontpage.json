      "content_preview": "I love Canada's Drag Race. But, I do have some issues with the show. And here they are Lack of storytelling- For some reason, Canada does a terrible job with storytelling, and season 2 is a prime example of that. In episode 1 The Brat Pack are painted as kina cliquey mean girls as told by Stephanie is her confessional, and Beth mentions being intimidated by them. And at the reunion it's mentioned that Kendall, Gia and Synthia kept to themselves at one point. However, none of that is ever shown it's just told to us as an audience. Show don't tell And speaking of Synthia, she apparently had quit doing drag for a few years before getting on season 2.  Which explains Kendall & Gia's reactions when she walks into the werkroom on the first episode 2. Not Highlighting the cast- I think seasons 4 & 5 both have really strong casts. However, production does a terrible job highligting them as a whole. Whether it be challenges that don't play to their strengths or too many repetitive challenges Which is why so many people still haven't taken to Venus as a winner. There was never a moment where she stood out in the competiton. She was good for the most part, but she didn't have any stand out moments like Priynanka, Icesis and Giselle 3. Trying things that don't work- I applaud Canada for trying new things to shake up Drag Race. The Golden Beaver is such a great twist. However season 4 also introduce 2 things that I hate. Which is queens walking out after their entrances and the roses and thorns. I love seeing queens interacting with each other once they walk into the werkroom for the first time, and I would've loved to see Virgo and Sanjina's interactions on the first episode And the roses and thorns is just an excuse to play early favoritism 4. Get rid of the lipsync smackdown- I loved it back in season 4, both Nearah and Aurora slayed. However with season 5, I've come to realize that it basically disrupts the flow of the season up until that point.  And, it's just an excuse to get rid of whomever they want. Cuz if it was based on the lipsync itself, then Minhi would've been eliminated",

      "content_preview": "I just finished watching episode 3 of the current series and I must say that I am so in love with Perla and The Virgo Queen. I didn't expect myself to like both so much just 3 episodes in. Perla is such a vibe and her response to her being in the bottom cracks me up. Her pleading to Virgo about saving her with the Beaver, keeping in mind the hair cost was so funny to me. And her perfomance in the slayoffs was so shocking, totally didn't expect her to be that little firecracker on stage. So glad Virgo didn't save her that we were able to witness her doing a ballad song. Now, the Virgo queen - she is so motherly to the queens, she looks young but she radiates so much wisdom and that motherly vibes. Her refusing to be a bottom cause she eats too many burritos is wild 🤣 So charismatic and has that IT factor. Love her!!! Who do you like the most in this season? Please be kind and don't spoil in the comments too much. I still have to catch up with the rest of the series but I just can't keep these thoughts to myself, I need to let it outtttt 😭",

The queens were left to disclose their snatch game choices to EACH OTHER??? Where was Brooklyn’s guidance? Could’ve been Brad or to a lesser extent Tracey. It really feels like Brooklyn, Brad and Tracey are on set for maybe 2 hours. During the snatch game Brooklyn gave the queens NOTHING to work with. She’s ask leading questions like “So you’re a judge?” There was a bus passing by that day and she tossed each queen underneath it one at a time. The queens are all subpar. We have a part time drag queen, a queen with 2 years experience and a queen who is just the worst plain Jane cover band. They’re all incredibly insecure. Usually there’s a clear front runner by episode 3. But I truly don’t think any of these queens deserve the title. The crew doesn’t seem to give a shit either. Either that or they just don’t have any experience in lighting or maybe just haven’t seen the show before. Brooklyn was right to address the poor quality of the show but to take zero responsibility for it was laughable. Basically I’m saying that I feel there’s a clear lack of commitment and respect for the audience and if this continues I don’t see this version of the series going on much longer.",

She nails the energy, voice, and over-the-top enthusiasm while turning it into hilarious, campy gold. It’s the perfect example of how to take an icon and make them larger than life—the way Snatch Game impersonations should be! Her sketches are pure genius and the blueprint for an unforgettable Oprah performance.",

      "content_preview": "Canadà makes me realise how fun grandma RuPaul really is. Brooke is gorgeous and I love her fashion and silly hosting, but her taste in drag makes the competition far less fun to watch. Ru really appreciates humour. When he finds a truly hilarious queen, he will forgive cheap robot suits, same sillouette, and being from an entirely different country. Ru rarely crowns a queen that did poorly in Snatch Game. Looks are looks, but being funny can't be bought! In Canada, Brooke favors young dancer queens (a ballerina herself after all!) who are gorgeous and move well but are rather dull. Ru will occasionally have herself a Jorgeous, but she will crown someone with personality and humour. In Canada, most winners have bombed Snapchat game. In fact, most people cast are not super strong at comedy. That makes for unexciting finales and some shit challenges. Even more than that - this past episode Perla was funny as fuck. Brooke just didn't see it. Ru would put Perla in the top. And in the end the three-way Lipsync was orchestrated just to keep both Virgo and Makayla, because Brooke likes them. Honestly, Uma should not have been in the bottom, and Virgo or Makayla should have gone home. But seemingly Canada wants to crown Virgo - another young, tall, skinny, gorgeous fashion dancing queen who is rather dull. I personally think this Snatch Game should have disqualified Virgo from winning the season - and I think on a Ru judged gig it would have. RuPaul Charles is an icon for a reason, and I think his judging criteria makes for a better show, better competition and better winners",
