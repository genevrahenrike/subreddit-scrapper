There are no scratches, no fungus, and I can't see any dust inside the lens. It comes with a Ricoh lens hood. I am selling this camera for 600 euros (negotiable). PM me for purchase, dw if you aren't in Europe. I honestly don't know what else to say. It's a camera with a few scratches on the bottom and works just fine.",

The 500T was a short end purchased from a third party and was manufactured in 2022. Has been freezer stored since mid 2024. I’ve been shooting with both stocks with no problem and developing them myself with C41 cross process. Please note the last frame and a half ish will be blank due to the bulk rolling process. To compensate, each of these rolls should have 38-42 exposures in them (variance due to manual winding). Pricing: 8 dollars a roll for either stock, flat fee of $5 for shipping to CONUS. I accept PayPal or Venmo. Please comment before PM",

Also willing to answer any questions, give more pictures, sample pictures, videos, whatever. Pictures and Timestamp I'm a relatively new, budget hobbyist. I went through 3-4 cameras buying/selling along the way until I got to where I'm pretty happy with my current setup (5D Mk III) and now just have a 5D Mk II that's not going to get used. The other lenses (and Extender) I do use, but I'm more interested in shorter focal lengths/street photography suited stuff than I am long lenses. 5D Mk II - This has been very well used. I checked the shutter count with some software right before I switched over to my MK3 and it's around 150k. It's, to put it bluntly, beat to shit cosmetically. It's missing one of the covers on the side for the shutter and microphone area and I believe the cover for the port on the bottom. I'm unsure if that bottom port works, but everything else on the camera works to my knowledge. The screen is fine, the viewfinder is fine as well. Altogether this camera works great, just that cosmetically it's beat up. I have a battery and charger for it that I'll ship out with it. $175 Shipped , if you're local to Chicagoland/MKE I'm willing to meet for $150 EF 2x Extender II - Bought this not long ago from a shop in Wisconsin, in great condition and works super well. This lived on the 200mm lens as I don't have anything else it's compatible with. Doesn't lost nearly as much image quality as I expected. $150 Shipped EF 200MM f/2.8 II L - Really incredible lens. I'm hoping to sell this for enough to really pay for most of a replacement L lens ~85mm or something. Open to trades for this stuff in that range as well. Lens itself is in great condition IMO. Light use on the rubber because it's been used, but the glass itself seems very good to me. I just recently bought this from the same shop as the Extender. $400 Shipped I will ship both the Extender and the 200mm $500 if you buy them together EF 75-300MM f/4-5.6 III - Another recent purchase that I like but don't need. If this one doesn't sell I'm not too chuffed but I have a second Tamron lens in this exact length and speed, this one is in better condition though. $100 Shipped Willing to work on pricing for locals and people who want multiple things. Prefer Paypal. EDITED: Imgur link was broken, fixed. EDIT: Both deals fell through, so these are still available despite below comments.",

      "content_preview": "Timestamp - I will add more photos but this shows everything + the mamiya stuff for now. Just a bunch of random stuff that has been sitting unused for a while now. Better to pass it on to someone who will enjoy it. All the Mamiya stuff is from my 645 Super, which I sold about a month ago. I think it should also work with the 645 Pro, but I don't know for sure. I'm less sure about the power winder especially. Item Description Price Mamiya 645 Super Power Winder N Side-mounted Grip N. The rod that holds the batteries in place got busted at some point, but it still works just fine if you tape it up, and I imagine it's fixable. I think it's priced accordingly, but make me an offer. $35 Mamiya 645 Focusing Screen (Type E) Rangefinder Spot + Prism $25 Mamiya 120/220 Film Back Will include the 120 insert. Happy to include a 220 insert for an additional $20 if you're into that. From everything I've read, it's really easy to adapt the 220 to a 120 if you just remove a little metal piece. I did that on mine and it worked out just fine. Includes the dark slide. $60 TTArtisans 35mm ƒ/1.4 for Fuji X Mount Works well. Good condition. Just don't really dig the focal distance. $30 Canon FD 135mm ƒ/2.5 Great lens, great condition. Just falls into a range I don't use very often. Will include the caps. $60 Canon TX SLR It's fine. Slow shutter speeds are out of whack, light meter doesn't work, but hey... new light seals. FREE (just pay shipping or combine with something else) Zenza Bronica Zenzanon MC 200mm ƒ/3.5 Seems to be a very difficult lens to find. I only see a single copy on eBay in the US. Really clean condition, smooth operation. I used this with my Bronica EC- I believe it should work with every model up through the EC TL, after which they changed the lens mount. $100 Zenza Bronica TTL Chimney Viewfinder Same story, one copy on eBay in the US. Meter works and is accurate. I know it fits the EC, and I think it will fit earlier models. It would fit the EC TL as well but that seems a bit redundant. $60 I'll cover all the paypal fees if you'll cover shipping. I will be happy to add more pictures or answer any questions, just message me. Please respond in the thread here before PM'ing.",

Both were purchased on here, and they’ve been great, but they’re not quite for me. The F2 has a slight wrinkle on the shutter curtain, but works perfectly at all speeds. This camera has been film tested. The viewfinder is free of any haze or large dust, and the DP-11’s meter is spot on. Asking $225. The 105mm f1.8 is free of haze or fungus, but does have ‘some tiny dusts.’ The focus ring is a little bit stiff from about 1.5m to the close focus limit, but it’s still easy to turn. The aperture blades are snappy and free of oil. Asking $200. Or, buy them both for $375. Both prices are OBO and include shipping in the US. I’d be happy to work out international shipping, but that’d likely cost a little extra. Pictures/Timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/f2-105mm-f1-8-YbERfRS",

Come with leather case and front cap. 2 x e12 (e16 typo) 6x6 Backs - backs work great and are in great condition. Polaroid 100 Back - never used but it takes, but takes peel apart film if you can find any. Vinstax Back - Just purchased this in late 2024. Shoots instax and it works with both lens. I have lens attachments that you can see are labeled in the pictures and a viewfinder attachment. No black lines around the image like other brands! Works great. Instax film included.

Comes with: Lens, Box, Carry Case, Strap, Hood and a little bonus B+H lens filter w/ 67mm thread so the glass has not been exposed at all. The unit is clean and looks like its right out of the box. This was originally purchased from Glazer's in Seattle. Yes they are an authorized Sony dealer and this is an OEM US packaged product. Retail is $1,399 KEH has it for $1,081 MPB has it for $1,129 My Price is $999 , shipping is included and of course NO TAX . So this is one of the better deals going for this monster GM lens if not the best you will find on the net. Thanks for looking. Location - Raleigh, NC",
