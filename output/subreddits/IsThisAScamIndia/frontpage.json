I think he even knew what the products that I had ordered, said it was a Lakme lipstick etc. Said to me that it will take another 10 days to get that warehouse issue cleared and delivered again. So instead they will send a new shipment that will get dispatched today. Tells me that the payment will get refunded to the same upi that I had paid from. And to receive the new shipment, they will send me a whatsapp link where I can pay. When I asked him why can't I just pay through the Myntra app, he said no ma'am the WhatsApp link payment is enough and that the order will get dispatched right after. I thankfully had no hurry to receive the order so could think straight. Told him I will deal with cancellation on the Myntra app and I don't use whatsapp on the number. Called Myntra right after and they said the product was out for delivery and that i should ignore the previous call. My delivery then was dropped off in the next couple of hours itself!",

      "content_preview": "Even I was introduced to this LgIndia-Job.com Platform by a very close and trusted relative, and felt for it. I am currently in the LG1 - (Level-1) This is a very new Scam in the Indian Market, and no one suspects it as they target and promote it within close circles LGIndia-Job.com What‚Äôs happening: The scam site you were given (lgindia-job.com) is not connected to LG Electronics or Lucky Generals at all. They are misusing the name ‚ÄúLG India‚Äù and pretending to be linked with Lucky Generals ( https://luckygenerals.com ), which is a legitimate UK/US creative agency. Lucky Generals themselves have issued a Scam Alert notice ( https://luckygenerals.com/scam-alert/ ) warning that their brand name is being used in fraudulent job/part-time earning schemes. They clearly say: ‚ÄúWe will never ask individuals seeking employment or opportunities with us for money.‚Äù This means the so-called ‚ÄúLG India Digital Media Advertising‚Äù platform is a fake identity, built on two layers of impersonation: They took the name ‚ÄúLG‚Äù to make it sound like LG Electronics India or Lucky Generals India. They also tied themselves to ‚ÄúLucky Generals‚Äù (a real agency), but in reality, Lucky Generals has publicly disowned these scams. Why this matters: Legal proof: The UK Companies House file shows the company (LG INDIA DIGITAL MEDIA ADVERTISING LTD) is dissolved. Brand proof: Lucky Generals themselves warned of impersonation scams. Employer proof: Real LG Electronics India jobs are only on lg.com. This makes it crystal clear: lgindia-job.com is a fraudulent platform with no connection to LG or Lucky¬†Generals. Here is a summary of the key points regarding LG INDIA DIGITAL MEDIA ADVERTISING LTD: Company Name: LG INDIA DIGITAL MEDIA ADVERTISING LTD Company Number: 16059742 Legal Status: The company is dissolved as of July 22, 2025. This means it has been officially closed and struck off the company register, so it no longer legally exists. Company Lifespan: It had a very short existence, having been incorporated on November 4, 2024, and dissolved less than nine months later. Nature of Business: Its registered activities were in IT services, public relations, advertising, and media representation. Registered Address: The address listed is a Companies House default address. This is typically used when a company fails to provide a valid registered office address to the authorities. In short, this was a UK-registered private limited company with a name suggesting a connection to India, which was active for a very brief period before being dissolved.

My maid mentioned that she invested ‚Çπ1 lakh with them, and in return they are paying her ‚Çπ9,500 every month for 20 months. She has already been receiving the payments for 6 months. They seem to be operating mainly through WhatsApp groups and hosting seminars. To me, this sounds like a clear scam/Ponzi scheme, but I wanted to ask here if anyone has more information or experience with them.",

      "content_preview": "Witnessed this in Mohali and Chandigarh, where proper agencies in proper offices ask for a membership fees instead of a borkerage to show you rental properties around the city. They claim that they take brokerage from the owner instead. And that we have to pay them only 2500-3000 one time fee. After taking the fee they send you a few locations, and owner numbers - which lead to nothing, owners dont pickup call or properties dont match what you were promised. And then they dont pickup call your call, dont answer messages. If you ask for refund they will say fees is non refundable and they have done their work. If you insist they will keep delaying it. The amount is so low that you might feel not going to police and lack of paperwork makes consumer court listing also suck. My friend was stuck with this scam some time ago and i was a local so i could go and physically abuse these people to give the refund. They threatened to call the police but never did. So i guess they are more afraid of police than us. (Leaving this here so that if you come across this after being scammed- grab a whole lot of your friends and go ballistic on these people) thats the only way to get money back. Leaving the adress here where i found their offices- F361, Phase 8B, Industrial Area, Sector 74, Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar, Punjab 140307",

      "content_preview": "My father fell for a courier scam earlier this morning. He somehow ended up on a fishy website while trying to track his delivery. They ended up video calling him on Whatsapp, telling him that there is a extra charge to speed up the delivery if he wants it today. They somehow convinced him to install this customer support app (.apk). They even asked him for his bank info (account number), home address, which he provided. However, when they asked him for an OTP, he declined and realized what he was falling for. He called him right away and I made sure that he put his phone in airplane mode till I got home. He hasn't provided them with any OTP's. I deactivated and blocked all his banking services. I uninstalled the customer support app I could spot on his phone (Samsung S22). I fear his phone is compromised. Is there anything I need to do with his mobile to make sure it's safe to use? How bad is the situation atm? Anything else you guys recommend I should immediately, he has all his UPI payment apps, social media stuff on his phone. Is it safe to believe those are compromised? Any help would appreciated. I know how gullible he may sound. I've warned him and my mom about this scam multiple times. Asked him to never install anything, never share any bank info, OTP's etc., yet he ended up falling for it today. He's not been keeping well health wise, so I don't want to be harsh on him. Mistakes happen. But any help from this community would really help. Cheers :)",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm furious and need to warn you about Care Health Insurance ‚Äì their cheap premiums are a total scam! I signed up for their policy (No. 52488282) with OPD cover. Submitted a ‚Çπ350 claim for a consultation and pharmacy bill (obviously part of OPD). They rejected it, first blaming ‚Äúnon-registration‚Äù nonsense, then after a month of me chasing, an agent admitted ‚Äúpharmacy bills aren‚Äôt covered.‚Äù That‚Äôs absurd ‚Äì pharmacy bills are clearly OPD! I asked them to process the consultation bill; they said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll call back.‚Äù Spoiler: no call, no email response, nothing. Customer care is a joke ‚Äì 20 minutes of ‚Äúchecking emails‚Äù for empty promises. Imagine a hospitalization claim for thousands! Tried canceling due to their broken website and shady system, but they refused, saying, ‚ÄúYou raised a claim, so you can‚Äôt cancel.‚Äù Total trap! Sent a cancellation request on June 25, 2025, got automated replies, and escalated to the Ombudsman (No. ONL-PUN-H-037-2526-00421), mailing documents on July 29, 2025 ‚Äì still no resolution. I‚Äôve also complained to IRDAI, but it‚Äôs a waiting game now. Reviews on MouthShut and X show the same: claims denied for ‚Äúmissing documents‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-covered items‚Äù despite everything being in order. They‚Äôre just pocketing premiums! ProTip: Test your insurance with a small claim to see if they‚Äôre reliable. Care Health will find 100 reasons to reject it, leaving you screwed in an emergency.",

Scammers are threatening to spam businesses with thousands of false one star reviews unless they are paid large sums of money - usually through a Google Play Card It really stuck with me because I know how vital the review systems are to customers and small businesses and have seen how damaging a low rating can be. I've spoken to a few different people and am discovering how vulnerable restaurants can be to this extortion but I get the sense I'm only seeing the tip of the iceberg of the damage that can be done.

      "content_preview": "On 30th July, my father who is a senior citizen decided to apply for an HDFC Regalia credit card through the HDFC Bank app on his iPhone. Just five minutes after initiating the process, he received a call from someone claiming to be from HDFC. Since he had just applied, he believed the call was genuine. Like any trusting customer, especially someone his age he followed their instructions. What happened next was a nightmare. The caller was a fraudster who, under the pretext of helping with the application, managed to extract sensitive details from my father and wiped out over ‚Çπ4 lakhs from his account. My father and mother, both elderly, were left shocked, shaken, and helpless. As his daughter and a long-standing Imperia customer myself I am beyond disgusted and heartbroken. I wasn‚Äôt physically with them at the time, and someone used that vulnerability to exploit them. That‚Äôs what hurts the most. I placed my trust in HDFC when I encouraged my elderly parents to open accounts with your bank, believing it to be safe, secure, and customer-centric. That trust is now shattered. But today, I feel utterly let down. How did someone know my father had just applied for a credit card? How was this information leaked so quickly and so easily? How could such a massive fraud happen under HDFC‚Äôs watch, without a single red flag being raised? This is not just about money. This is about trust, about safety, about the responsibility you owe your customers, especially senior citizens who rely on your systems and expect protection, not exposure. I hold HDFC fully accountable for: The breach of privacy that led to this incident. The failure to detect or prevent fraudulent activity on a senior citizen‚Äôs account. The emotional and financial trauma caused to my parents because of your systems‚Äô lapses.",
