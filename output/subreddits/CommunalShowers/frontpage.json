I went to High School in the 90's and we weren't necessarily \"required\" to shower after gym class so to say, however it was just kinda the expectation that you did.  If you didn't it would've probably been more weird because others would've been saying \"oh he's afraid everyone is gonna see how little his wee wee is\" and of course they would have been saying you smell bad.  So when the coach would say \"Alright boys hit the showers\" we just did.  So I'm curious when those talk about \"mandatory showering\" what would happen if you didn't?  Would you fail the class?  Would you be given detention?  Would you be expelled?  How was this enforced?",

      "content_preview": "I was reflexing why. Personally, I like communal showers because they feel practical and even liberating. You don’t have to wait for a private bathroom, the environment is usually quick and functional. On top of that, there’s a sense of normality and naturalness in sharing the space with others—everyone is there for the same reason, and no one is judging anyone. I also think they help to break down insecurities: in the end, we are all just normal people, and it’s reassuring to see that nobody has to feel weird about their body. In a way, it’s even a social experience; even if you don’t talk to anyone, you still get that sense of community. What I especially like is the implicit trust among strangers: we are all naked there, seeing each other as we really are, and yet there is a silent respect. What happens in the showers stays in the showers; nobody goes out talking about how someone else’s body looks, and that creates a valuable feeling of trust and discretion. I will read your opinions",

      "content_preview": "Introduction Imagine being completely vulnerable—changing clothes, your body exposed, your guard down. For women, that vulnerability isn’t just about modesty—it’s about safety. That’s why women should be allowed in men’s locker rooms, but men should not be allowed in women’s locker rooms. This isn’t a double standard—it’s common sense. ⸻ Safety and Vulnerability Women face risks that men do not: harassment, assault, and violation of privacy. Allowing men into women’s locker rooms introduces danger; women entering men’s locker rooms does not. Men’s discomfort is temporary. Women’s fear is life-altering. Rebuttal: Some say this is sexist or unfair. It’s not. Women’s access levels the playing field in professional and public spaces, while men aren’t harmed by being excluded. Equality doesn’t mean sameness—it means protecting the vulnerable. ⸻ Correcting Inequality Women have been excluded from male-dominated spaces for centuries. Granting them access breaks down barriers, from sports reporting to professional opportunities. Men face no equivalent barriers that justify access to women’s locker rooms. ⸻ Human Dignity and Social Norms Many men are indifferent to women entering their locker rooms. Women, however, would feel violated if men were allowed in theirs. Society already accepts asymmetry when it protects women—female reporters can enter male locker rooms, male reporters cannot enter female locker rooms—and we recognize the wisdom of that instinct. Rebuttal: Some may argue men deserve privacy or might feel uncomfortable. Discomfort is not the same as danger. Safety must come first. Some women feel the need to accompany their sons into the men’s locker room to protect them. Men should honor the mother’s wishes. Female gym employees also have valid reasons to enter. ⸻ Conclusion This policy is one-sided because women’s safety, dignity, and professional opportunity demand it. Allowing women in men’s locker rooms while keeping men out of women’s is not unfair—it is just, protective, and compassionate.",

It is not awkward to me,  cause I used to swim, but, here is the main point, I am not at that level of self comfort and confidence. I can walk to the showers just using a hand to cover up my penis and a little towel dance to change myself, but no go fully naked. They go hanging all their stuff everywhere ,also when the change, bathrooms and suana, everywhere!!, I also noticed that they don't use any clothe at sauna or vapor room. The question is, how could I push myself to this level, they look soy comfy, so confident and so masculine. I have a little issue cause when I am fully naked mi pennies looks like being little erected, but no, it's just it's form, is not hanging at all It is just like \"straight\", also when I wear swimsuit it looks like that. Could you give some tips?",

What I’ve observed so far is a little surprising. While open nudity is allowed, I’d say 7 out of 10 guys opt to private shower. While everyone is nude, most are modest and walk around with a towel around their waist and take off when entering the whirlpool. The same ratio of guys use the steam room with towels around them. Some are naked sitting on a towel (like me), but it’s def a minority. I’m frankly shocked at the modesty level and wonder if that’s the norm. I honestly expected the opposite, most being nude with some more modest.",
