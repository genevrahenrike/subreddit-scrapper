      "content_preview": "Hey all - long story short, my thyroid levels have been out of whack for a few years. They stabilized for a little on Levo, but now they're out of whack again. Every time I see my doctors, they do nothing but increase the dosage and tell me to come back in 3-6 months to retest. To the shock of absolutely no one, my numbers are still not normal. My TSH is at a 9.4 and I'm on 88mcg of Levo. The side effects are out of control: I'm SO fatigued that it‚Äôs interrupting daily life, anxiety/depression, and major hair loss. Is there ANYTHING else that this could be or could help this? My sister in law had a similar situation last year and it ended up being a pituitary gland tumor. I mentioned this to my doctor and she dismissed me. Please help. I have yet another follow up coming up next week and I need to know if there is anything else I can mention to my doctor. I refuse to increase dosage again and again for the rest of my life with no improvements.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share my journey because when I was first diagnosed with Hashimoto‚Äôs, I felt hopeless. I thought I would always struggle with my weight, my energy, and my body. I was scared and honestly very negative about the future. But things changed. Over the past 3‚Äì4 months, I‚Äôve lost over 11.5 kg (from 72.4 ‚Üí ~60.7) and I feel happier and more confident in my body than ever before. I still have Hashimoto‚Äôs, of course ‚Äî that doesn‚Äôt go away ‚Äî but I realized I can live well with it. Here‚Äôs what worked for me: ‚Ä¢ Consistency over restriction. I didn‚Äôt starve myself or cut out foods I love. I just stayed consistent with calorie tracking and exercise. ‚Ä¢ Volume eating. I focused on filling, delicious meals instead of just thinking about what to cut out. ‚Ä¢ Adding instead of removing. My mindset changed: instead of ‚Äúwhat do I have to avoid?‚Äù, I asked ‚Äúwhat can I add to make this better?‚Äù For example, if I eat chocolate cake, I‚Äôll add Skyr or Greek yogurt for protein and some fruit for fiber and satiety. It‚Äôs satisfying, and it keeps me full. This shift not only helped me lose weight, but also turned into something I now share with others, I even made some money with itü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, I‚Äôve started helping people with weight loss counseling. !!! My message for anyone here who feels stuck: Keep your thyroid levels checked regularly. Don‚Äôt despair ‚Äî weight loss is possible with Hashimoto‚Äôs. Focus on what you can add to your meals to make them balanced and filling. ATTENTION: My story is not one of those ‚Äúoh, you did it because you could have always done it.‚Äù No. I‚Äôve struggled with my weight since I was about 16‚Äì17, and I believe that‚Äôs exactly when my Hashimoto‚Äôs started ‚Äî but no one knew it back then, not even me. I only got my diagnosis about two years ago. Finally, after that and with consistent calorie tracking, buying myself a food scale, and exercising regularly, I was able to lose weight and actually feel proud of myself. So this didn‚Äôt just happen out of the blue ‚Äî it took patience, consistency, and finally understanding my body. I still have a goal of reaching ~55 kg, but I‚Äôm already so proud of how far I‚Äôve come. If you‚Äôre struggling, please know you‚Äôre not alone ‚Äî and yes, it‚Äôs possible üíô Drop your questions, I'm ready to help you as much as I can ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú® Edit: I‚Äôve realized that my lifestyle changes aren‚Äôt just about exercising more or trying to be more active during the day‚Äîthey‚Äôre also about the little things. For example, reducing eating out. Cooking at home might feel like extra work, but it actually adds movement throughout the day. Going to the supermarket, carrying groceries, preparing meals‚Äîall of that counts as activity. Even basic movements like carrying groceries train your body in ways that traditional exercises do, such as squats or lifting. And small adjustments, like walking to the next bus or tram stop instead of waiting, also add up. It‚Äôs all about layering these small changes into your day. Over time, they make a huge difference. If you have other examples of ways you‚Äôve added movement or activity naturally, those are worth sharing too, so leave them below ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®",

And it's so sad, I feel like the person I loved is gone, and I'm left with some crappy version of it. How do you cope with that? I'm in therapy and it gets better, but...I'm still mourning. And at the same time I hope that someday that version of me will be back, how can it not if it was so good. I want HER, not me.",

      "content_preview": "TL;DR: Do you experiance any of these symptoms with Hashi's alone or with a secondary autoimmune. Hello everyone, I'm a 32(M) living in the UK and i've been lurking this thread for a while whilst i've been having my 'issues'. It has really helped me not feel insane and less like im not just being a hypcondriac with a trapped nerve, Ive felt more validated reading your posts so I thank you all. I have a consultation tomorrow after getting bloods back after several years of turning up with issues. High tsh 5.6 on intial bloods during flare and second bloods 6 weeks later I had dropped down to 3.8 with antibodies found. They also came back with liver details of ALT 103 and Serum Albumin 51, these where the only ones out of range. Before these bloods they reffered me to phsyio twice based on my complaints with tingling in my hands and leg with sleep issues. My head is saying it's hashi with an overlapping condition but I wanted to find out if any of you experianced any of these with Hashi alone or if you have hashi but have a secondary auto-immune. Of course im not looking for a diagnosis and trying to break the rules asking for medical advice. Just im absolutely baffled how it can ALL be explained by hashi as I believe they will just say its that and be done with it. Neurologic/ Autonomic Fasciculations / muscle twitches (legs, feet, hands, arms, chest, back, stomach) Paresthesia (tingling, vibrating, numbness in feet, legs, hands, face) ‚Äì Comes and goes., Trembling, internal and external Intermittent dry cough Intermittent chest pain Myoclonic jerks Heart palpitations Fluctuating Bradycardia and Tachycardia when I‚Äôm not doing anything. Apple Watch thinks I‚Äôm asleep when it goes low Feeling faint Nystagmus (vibrating eyesight) Brain fog and memory issues Intermittent headaches at back of head Sharp fleeting pain under lower ribs or around belly button Severe stomach cramping like food poisioning, usually happens for half a day. Sudden loss of stability in left leg, resulting in two falls Sleep-Related Insomnia Restless Leg Syndrome Exploding head syndrome Hypnic jerks with electric-shock sensation at sleep onset Non-restorative sleep (normal to long duration) Trouble waking up Sleep apnoea Vertigo (‚Äúsee-saw‚Äù sensation when trying to sleep) ENT / Sensory Intermittent tinnitus / brief hearing loss in left ear Dry eyes (foreign-body sensation, discharge on waking next day) Musculoskeletal Joint aches (elbows, knees) Muscle ache in legs and arm Shoulder, neck, and upper back tension Psychiatric / Autonomic Sudden surges of anxiety with no trigger Immune / Allergy Lifelong Hay fever (Disappeared last year), Post Nasal Drip - Dairy Allergy (Disappeared this year, appeared in 2023), Additional notes: Most symptoms are worse in hot weather, Caffeine makes symptoms worse. Diagnosed with inattentive ADHD in 2023 when I thought undiagnosed adhd was getting worse (tiredness and motivation). As you can see I have an extensive list built up over 3 years haha. Alot of them happen during my 'flares' but not all flares are the same as the last. Some symptoms linger around for a month or two. Your help would be appreciated as I dont want to get sent to physio again haha.",

      "content_preview": "(Banning not banding) Edit #2) as most people have learned by now our voice made a difference in less than one week. One the other head honchos at the FDA  publicly announced that they are currently in the works of the first FDA ever approval of desiccated pork thyroid. They are probably talking about armor since they‚Äôve been trying to do this for years already. The  only quote I remember was that ‚ÄúAmerica will not be without access‚Äù. But what they don‚Äôt mention is the possibility of the FDA approved, pig thyroid, being extremely expensive.  You can find out more from that matter googling ‚ÄúMary Shomon  ndt reclassification biologic‚Äù Edit #1) we can have petitions here after all: https://www.change.org/p/we-as-thyroid-patients-do-not-agree-with-the-fda-false-claims-against-desiccated-thyroid As of Saturday evening they‚Äôve reached 3000 signatures.  That‚Äôs still not much but this petition is not even one day old. Those who use and feel better on dedicated pork thyroid should already be somewhat familiar with ‚Äústop the thyroid madness‚Äù website, which has been around for decades. The petition was apparently started there and that‚Äôs where you can also find it. Some people just feel better on desiccated thyroid and do not respond well to synthetic thyroid medicine: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10801060/ The FDA has catered to synthetics for a long time, even though desiccated pork thyroid was first used successfully since the late 1800s. For the last 30 years, they‚Äôve been trying to remove it from the market. If you didn‚Äôt know this, well now you do. It‚Äôs partially due to individual activist that this remains on the market today. America is founded on your ability to make choices for yourself. Forcing us to do things is not the American way. I really mis the days when there were  multiple generic NDT ‚Äòs available in American pharmacies for as low as $10 a month cash price. The armor brand was the expensive one at $15 a month lol. Then the FDA tried to make it illegal in 2009. They were defeated. Now they are trying again, hoping that most of the people who used it are in nursing homes or dead. Fact is it‚Äôs gotten somewhat more popular again,‚Ä¶more popular now than it was 10 years ago. (NOTE: For those thinking about making negative comments on this post about pork thyroid , or those who prefer this treatment option- We are not interested in your opinions)",

Biotin does not affect levothyroxine itself but can significantly interfere with thyroid function tests (TFTs), leading to inaccurate results that mimic hyperthyroidism. This is because biotin is used in the chemical assays that measure thyroid hormones and can disrupt the process, causing falsely elevated levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and falsely low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). If you are taking levothyroxine and biotin, you must inform your doctor and stop taking biotin for at least 2-3 days before having your thyroid levels tested to ensure accurate results.  -American Thyroid Association",

My issues only got worse. I have terrible muscle and joint pain, sometimes it is difficult to keep my hands raised while I am washing my hair. I am either sweating buckets or freezing cold. I'm always exhausted, but I also suffer from insomnia at night, then i am either half asleep or asleep during the day. My bf is worried because me and the couch has become one. I can't think straight and I'm depressed and forgetful. Feels like I'm slowly dying, basically. Somehow, through strict 1400 kcal diet i managed to drop from 78 to 65 kg, but it will not budge any further. So, I got another test today. This time TSH is 24 and my ALT and AST are mildly elevated.

They said my lymph nodes look normal and there were no nodules to be found in or near my thyroid area. I have heard stories of women who have had swollen lymph nodes, and that was the only sign that they had thyroid cancer. I a very anxious. I have high anxiety and depression. I just hope that I don‚Äôt have thyroid cancer. Can anyone give me examples that they got thyroid cancer from just swollen lymph nodes?",

      "content_preview": "I was diagnosed with Hashi's about a year and a half ago. I've struggled with weight my entire life despite being a much healthier person than the \"average\" person. I've been lifting weights for close to a decade (thoroughly enjoy it to the point I was even a PT pre-COVID). I've been a runner since I was a teenager (though I go in and out of phases where I run a lot, then zero haha). Love SoulCycle, boxing, hiking, you name it, I enjoy moving my body! I've also been a clean eater (Paleo) for close to a decade, tracking macros and micros most of that time as well. To say, I'm not new to any of this and absolutely love all things health and fitness. Here's what happened to me recently..I started a deficit end of April. It's been 4 months, I've lost 12lbs. This is WITH diet breaks. About one a month or so. I got so overzealous I decided back in May to go for a bikini comp. I hired a coach. Comp prep amped things up. I crashed harder than I ever have in my entire life. Weight loss stalled, then spiked (inflammation, cortisol, fatigue). Binged for 2 weeks. Stopped exercising entirely for the last 2 weeks, but have been back on my deficit. The last week especiallty, eating VERY clean. This is the home stretch, I have aout 5-8lbs left i want to lose and then I want to be DONE with dieting for...ever haha. Back to maitenance. The last week in my deficit plus NO working out, no tracking (exercise, I mean, macros and calories yes), and eating SUPER clean (for me personally, no seeds, oils of ANY kind even oil or avo, no grains, no dairy as I am lactose intolerant, NOTHING processed), with two days of 16+ hr fasts (NOT back to back, and still hit my calories prior to) my weight dropped 3lbs. And it's stayed there and trending down 4 days in a row. THAT IS--until yesterday, for the first time in two weeks I re-introuduced the gym. Yesterday? Fatigue back to comp prep levels even though I BARELY did anything (I mean 3 lift variations and 40min walk, that's nothing)...I slept 9hrs and am still exhausted, and the scale? Up a pound this morning (water, recovery, glycogen, inflammation, cortisol, whatever). For me? LESS. IS. MORE. The finaly 8 weeks of my deficit I'm going to stick to clean eating, occasinal fasting, and NO tracked exercises. I've never felt so burnt out of the gym in my entire life to be honest. So this is a welcome change. The fatigue from the deficit is way more preditcable and manageable WITHOUT exercise (duh haha). But it's still shocking to me to learn how my body does/doesn't tolerate things. I may fast a few times a week now, seeing how it helped me even on a deficit. What's your experience been? I love seeing everyone's stories. We're all different, but there's so much commonality too. Hope you hear from you, please chime in :)",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone. I‚Äôm hoping for some feedback/thoughts on a weird symptom timing thing going on. On a work day, I almost forget I have Hashimoto‚Äôs. I‚Äôm a police officer so my day is random. I drive around a lot and then will suddenly have to jump out on a call or whatever. Basically I go from 0 to 100 and back to 0 and then to 50 and then 0, etc. I feel fine doing that. Just the other day I helped carry a guy out of the woods on a backboard up a huge hill and the physical exertion felt fine. I also feel fine sitting still in the car and driving. The problem is on days off. I feel completely different. I‚Äôm a busy bee anyway so I‚Äôm almost always doing a home improvement project or yard maintenance. If my mind is not 100% engaged on a task, I start to feel like crap. I used to think it was hypo feeling, but I really don‚Äôt know. My only thought is my wake up procedure. I usually sleep in an hour extra on days off u til 6am instead of 5am. Bedtime is usually the same 9:30 or 10. I do a cold plunge first thing on work days and days off. I will occasionally lay in bed for a snooze or two on days off, but never work days. Currently on NP and Cytomel. Does anyone have any thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, my blood tests came back as shown in the attached photo. I've been having the following symptoms: depression (lost of interest in things, no motivation, no joy) major irritability and mood swings hair loss and thinning weight gain inflammation and poor wound healing anxiety fatigue Can anyone relate? If so, what steps did you and your doctor take next? From what I gather this is early stage readings but the symptoms are drastically impacting my quality of life so I'd like to know what to push for if my doctor says she won't do anything. Thanks :) Edit: I had my appointment with my doctor and she was hesitant to make any moves because my labs were \"in range\" so she called an endocrinologist who advised that since I had all these symptoms they could put me on 25mg of Synthroid!! I feel like I got lucky with doctors who actually listened to me - but it helped to really advocate for myself. Here's to hoping it works! https://preview.redd.it/elevated-antibodies-and-normal-tsh-v0-liz9wlpfm7lf1.png",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, 2 times over the past 3 weeks I‚Äôve had spotty and blurred vision. Yesterday was the second time, and it was accompanied with a headache and lightheadedness. I ended up going to urgent care because I was so scared of what was happening. I was scared it was something neurological but it was concluded it was probably low blood sugar. I have been cutting down on eating as much as I normally do (OMAD) however I always carry snacks with me in case my blood sugar gets low or I feel fatigued. The first instance happened before I started one meal a day, so I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs because of OMAD, or don‚Äôt suspect it is. In hindsight, I do urinate frequently and it does not take me long at all to get ‚Äúhangry‚Äù, which I‚Äôve read are signs of glucose issues. I have read how hashimoto‚Äôs and glucose / diabetes go hand in hand. I do have an appt with my general practitioner Friday. I hope you are all coping with hashi the best that you can, and are healthy, happy and thriving. Thanks for any responses.",

Currently I'm on mexazolam prescribed by my GP, the problem is I moved to Switzerland and here they don't have that specific medication, so my new GP prescribed me oxazepam which I'm terrified to start taking because I always have anxiety about taking new medication, specially when it can mess with my brain and my anxiety. Anyone here ever took oxazepam for the anxiety/panic attacks? Also, I'm obviously trying to seek a psychiatrist to check this question about changing medication so abruptly, but I still couldn't find any available to schedule an appointment..",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone - new here - and I may not even be in the right place but hoping for somewhere to start During routine bloodwork I was flagged with high TSH (5.68), T4 in range at 12.  The \"good cholesterol\" is low and getting lower.  Ferritin has been low for years (I am taking feramax), Vitamin D low (aren't we all low in that), B12 now low Dr ordered a retest of the TSH and T4 - TSH 4.33 10 days after the first draw. I do have an appointment with her to discuss the results but unfortunately in the past she hasn't proven to really seem like she knows what she is doing.  I am not slamming health care workers - I am surrounded by nurses among family and friends.  I just don't have a lot of confidence in this particular Doctor (she once googled the answer to a question I asked on her phone.  Right in front of me). I have a family history of thyroid issues (Dad over active, his brother under active and cousin on that side Graves disease) and I myself had a brush with Rheumatoid Arthritis in the past (in remission no meds yay).  Because of all this I would like to rule out anything like Hashimoto's etc to be on the safe side.  I do have some other random things going on but they could be totally unrelated What I would like to ask is - what questions and test requests should I attend my appointment with so I can make sure we are ruling out any issues?  I am afraid she won't know what to look for to make sure all is well Thank you for your help",

      "content_preview": "TLDR new NP told me iron has significant impact on thyroid function, no Dr ever told me this b4 or tested my ferritin and they don't know about optimal levels. I suggest this should be more discussed in this sub and recommend everyone get ferritin to optimal levels which may get rid of all the ongoing \"mystery\" symptoms we are suffering from. Seeing a new NP. She thinks my iron and / or ferritin is very low. She said ferritin needs to be 100+ng/ml. Mine was 36 a few mo ths ago. She said iron has a direct and significant impact on thyroid function. Going to doctors frequently due to unexplained symptoms feeling like I'm dying for over 20 years and not one doctor ever checked my iron, ferritin, nor ever mentioned it's impact on thyroid function. I'm guessing they never tested it because I ha e only ever had megloblastic anemia but never iron anemia. I've made the best of life but tbh it's been pretty miserable due to unexplained health issues. I've tried every single thing one can do from diets to supplements to gut healing to medications to mental health treatment. But here I am. Still functioning at 50% capacity and just trying to get thru each day and praying I can continue to work so I can support my family. A few years ago we started being able to order our own blood tests in the US. I ordered a lot and did find out some very useful info and get treatment. But again, didn't think about iron cuz it's never come up in conversation or even in my stupid Google searches. Early this year, desperate and having been to er, urgent care, allergist, gastro, primary and various other specialists with \"nothing wrong\" or caused by \"perimenopause\", even tho I've had the same exact symptoms since I was a teenager and I'm on hrt, I decided to test ferritin. It was right on the low end of normal and I wasnt anemic, so I thought I'm fine, iron is not the issue. Fast forward a few months later. Tsh, t3, t4 etc all good but I can't get out of bed. Lifting my arm feels like I'm holding a hundred pound dumb bell. I can't stay awake. I review all my supplements and how they interact with everything and is one depleting another, etc. I'm working with a nutritionist and had atrted with a trainer blah blah blah. Down the ridiculous rabbit hole in which I've been down a million times and never find the answer. Then I see a new NP to review my hrt cuz maybe that's my issue, even tho current specialist says everything is optimized. She tells me I'm obviously iron deficient and explains a lot about irons impact on thyroid and other stuff and optimal levels. Never heard any of this before. Idk if iron is my answer as I'm just in the beginning of exploring, waiting for blood tests. I've many times in the past had the aha moment, if I just treat x that's the answer and it wasn't. Anyway, I'm sure many can relate and I just wanted to bring it to everyone's attention that most our doctors don't talk about or understand irons impact on our body, thyroid or optimal levels and you may want to look into it.",
