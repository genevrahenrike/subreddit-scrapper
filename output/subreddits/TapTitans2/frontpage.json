      "content_preview": "Click here for the GameHive blog version with the pretty images Hey everyone, lemmingllama here. Today we’ll be talking about the new legendary set coming in the 7.14 update. Let’s get into it! The 7.14 update will be introducing the Shadowveil Stalker legendary equipment set, an equipment set themed around Dagger. Shadowveil Stalker will decrease your Dagger Cooldown, allowing you to throw daggers faster than before and building up Blade Cyclones quicker. This will also help non-Dagger builds who invest in the Poison Edge skill, as you’ll be able to poison titans quicker and thus boost your damage against those titans. Additionally, the Shadowveil Stalker will give a Dagger Damage per Day bonus, capping at 1e20 total boost. Thank you for reading! As a reminder, you can view our web store for some free diamonds, raid cards, and good deals on various bundles. Happy Tapping! lemmingllama",

We’re a relaxed group – not overly demanding – but we want to keep pushing forward together. What we offer: currently leaderboad rank 106 top raid level:  master tier zone 13 discord (not mandatory, but for those who wish to use it) friendly, relaxed and respectful environment a few veterans, who can answer your questions active cleansing of inactive members, who are obviously freeloading and let others do the work a clan where you're always welcome back if you want to quit for whatever reason (or you got kicked for being to long away without letting us know) Our requirements: do your dailies be active in raids (min 75% activity) In raids: hit the right marked targets, no minimum damage requirement - but try to do as much as possible (f.e. in terms of respect: we don't want people who have a potential to do 200mil per attack, but only do like 4-5mil per attack) make use of 'mirror force' and 'team tactics' every cycle participate in events as much as possible (f.e. the ~20 prestiges/day like in the 'dove collector' event would be great - but not mandatory) be respectful to fellow clanmates let us know if you’ll be away (sick, vacation, too much work, just a little time off) and we won't kick you, life happens! (We support that, but please, in a healthy amount) What we don’t want: Players who use clans as parking lots just to collect free rewards Players that insult, are racist etc. Players who join and want to be promoted to Master within a short time (earn it while your journey with us :)) If you’re looking for a clan that balances steady progress with a friendly, low-pressure enviroment, Sigma could be the perfect fit. Drop a message if you’re interested in joining or merge!",

      "content_preview": "Click here for the GameHive blog version with the pretty images . Hey everyone, lemmingllama here. Version 7.13.3 will be available now or shortly after this post is live. While this update should resolve most issues that players are facing with the listed bugs below, relogging into your account by going to Options -> Account will also resync your local save file and resolve any issues. If you are experiencing issues logging in, you can contact GameHive support , or you can also directly contact lemmingllama on Reddit or Discord. In addition to the 7.13.3 patch notes, we’ll also start to discuss some new features coming in the 7.14 update. Let’s get into it! 7.13.3 Bug Fixes: Fixed issues with tutorial prompts reappearing for players Fixed issues with Forbidden Research Tree not applying for players Fixed issues where ads would not be correctly vended to players Fixed issues where tabs would not correctly display on the main UI Fixed various additional game crashes Fixed minor localization issues Fixed minor visual issues 7.14 Today we’ll be going over a couple small quality of life improvements coming in the 7.14 update. To start, we’ve had more players playing Gold Gun builds with the recent Transcendence balance changes and reworks to the build. This combined with the new Philosopher’s Flux skill have had people noticing the lack of Snap special titan’s ability to spawn while Magnum Opus is active, which can make it harder to push through stages with Gold Gun builds. To fix this, we’ll be adjusting so all non-Portar special titans will be able to spawn while Magnum Opus is active. Portar will still not appear during Magnum Opus, as the spawn delay when Portar appears would decrease your Magnum Opus uptime and potentially lead to less overall progression. In addition to the above, we’re also making some changes in how we handle Quest rewards. Some Quests such as Hive and Seek have the ability to receive equipment rewards, or they can be purchased via shops. We’re adjusting the back-end code to allow for specific equipment to be available, rather than purely random equipment. This could allow us to take some randomness out of the equation and offer specific equipment and equipment sets in Quests, allowing for easier collection of those equipment sets for players who participate in the Quest. Thank you for reading! As a reminder, you can view our web store for some free diamonds, raid cards, and good deals on various bundles. Happy Tapping! lemmingllama",

      "content_preview": "CS GG HoG Hybrid Hey tappers, I'm curious what you're current prestige times are, especially on hindsight of the 99prestige event. I was playing GG HoG at the beginning of the week, where I had mostly speeds of 1:50-2:10. But I remembered about last trapdoor event, which I've played with a CS build and reached times of 1:14, while all perks were active. During the week I switched back to CS and managed to get 1:30 sometimes. After tinkering more I decided to fuse GG and CS, kicking Golden Missile for Thunder Ship. What did I do? I optimized for CS and copied the skills to another instance of rawrzcookie's SP optimizer and optimized for GG. Didn't really work out that well, as I only achieved times of 1:40+. Well, then I'll stay with CS and just accept that it won't get faster this transcendence, w/o more power. Boy, was I wrong. When I was walking the dogs in the morning I've thought: What if I invert the steps. This time, I optimized for GG and CS simultanously, noted which GG skills differ from what CS is coming up with. I spent almost 4k SP on Chivalric Order, Firesword Skills and GG Skills to balance for an almost equally damage of CS and GG (GG is still around 500e stronger) and gave it another try. Now my time got down to 1:19 at some point. Sadly I still not have accumulate enough power to leave out Lightning Strikes for now, but I'm optimistic to able to achieve 1:10 until Sunday, at least with all perks active. Today I just went with 1x AR and 2xMiR again, because my HoG Cooldown increased by 10s. Also I had to cover 300 stages more because I overpushed by accident. I really didn't do any deep dive into numbers and just stayed at an absolute bottom level of optimizing. What are you're opinions about this hybrid build? Is it even viable? Currently I'm planning to go back to HoG after that season, but for now I've dropped 150ranks on transcendence leaderboard. English is not my native, just ask if there are any unclarities. ETA: I'm using Power of D.O.S with 10% Portar Chance and 0.95 Companion Cooldown.",

I thought the point was to save your power for tourneys (i.e. not discovering relics, not pumping NB) and to push as little as possible so you dont reach your softwall quickly. Since all the newbies follow this advice, it seems a lot of players are stuck at 100k+ which means you will face a lot more players in tournaments as well. I have been comfortably sitting at around 80k for a while now and I have got a 4 tournament streak of undisputed wins without pushing at all. Sitting at this stage is easier for me because I know I can push 20-30k more stages easily to snipe more wins as opposed to being at your softwall.",

      "content_preview": "Jersey Mercs has 3 open slots. Whales are welcome… Be awesome like Birthday pie. Birthday pie should definitely be a thing. Currently ranked 40 something this season. We sorta plan on moving forward, so you should sorta plan on moving forward. Code is 624qx. 100K MS and 1000 RL required. Will lower if warranted. That said, we are not a beginner clan, would need a rather compelling reason to lower. Minimum is most raid attacks and a bunch of morale per week. MINIMUM, didn’t think I would have to explain that as much as I do. Actually no, I don’t explain that. Looking for very active players, obviously. Like telemarketers active. We expect you to move forward. And spend a little money, devs gotta eat too. Not as militant as top clans, so if you’re getting BURNED OUT with top clan strategies, coming here will be a nice break for you. There ain’t no way I want to wake up at 2 am for 2 hours just to get a little more damage from a raid, I like my sleep way too much for that. Pretty simple, do your tickets (morale) and do your raids or get kicked. So, same as other clans. We know what we’re doing... Ok, not really, not at all. Jarhead owned and operated. SFMF Sense of humor helpful, have some fun. Too lazy to put the discord invite, you’ll find it. Oh yeah, and hit the raid correctly. You may or may not get kicked for too much wasted damage. Maybe you’ll be cursed forever and eventually be in a nursing home in a wheelchair yelling about having to do your raiding and how everyone hates Mohaca... And yes, I shamelessly copy and paste this every time. Not sorry.",
