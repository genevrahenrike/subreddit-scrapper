I know Emboar has better stats objectively but I just can’t bring myself to use it, I hate its design. I’m not looking to make Pignite absolutely cracked but just wondering if it’s possible to make him moderately decent? Is it do-able if the rest of my team is solid? If you think I can make it work, please let me know. But if you think it’s not worth it then I appreciate those answers as well. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I played Pokemon Black as a 8 years old kid, and was vividly passionate about it : i had my beloved team consisting in Serperior, Musharna, Garbodor, Zweilous, Stoutland, and Darmanitan, and just finished Elite 4 after a long month of struggling. I battled and captured Reshiram, battled N and got entranced with his theme music. I absolutely loved the music in B&W, very formative experience. Then... comes Ghetsis, a character that I liked a lot and thought was really cool. That's the point where I'll tell you my 2 worst fears as an 8 years old : electronics behaving weirdly ( super scared of glitches and unexpected things ), and mummies. I was TERRIFIED of Cofagrigus, in particular, because I dreamed of it chasing me on all fours, with its face up, multiple times. I was so scared of mummies and sarcophagus that I had panic attacks in museums as a kid. You get the idea that I was an easily scared kid. I already battled against Annette and her Cofagrigus, but I remember closing my eyes and spamming A to kill it without looking at it. Back to the game : the tension is at its high, and the fight against Ghetsis starts. And... there's nothing. His music is...painfully empty. So empty that I got nervous, thinking I fucked up and the game was glitching. I was extremely uneasy, but after a few seconds of confusion, I pressed A, and this PISTACCHIO HAIRED, STROKE HAVING CUNT had the audacity to send first... Cofagrigus. I was so scared I slammed my DS shut, and yanked the cartridge out of it. After that, I didn't touch the game for almost 10 years. Props to Ghetsis for being so oddly terrifying, it felt personal. Like this guy was out there to get ME specifically. I'm glad I only got the B&W2 mangas way later, because he already was the main villains in most of my nightmares. Nowadays I love ghetsis so much i have a card of him in my phonecase. He's my favorite horrible  old man.",
