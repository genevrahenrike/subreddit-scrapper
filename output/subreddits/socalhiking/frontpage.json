Are there any other good car camping spots in Los Angeles area that aren't in ANF? My family has mostly camped in Angeles so we don't have many other spots. Hoping to be able to BBQ and make smores rather than deli meats.",

About 4 or 5 months ago I posted about my newly created subreddit called r/socalbirding that aims to connect birders in southern california of all experience and interest levels. Thank you to everyone who joined and has participated - we are now at 1.3k members :). I figured I'd post this again in case anyone missed the original post but loves to bird or learn about wildlife. It's not just about bird photography (though that is great). We also welcome discussions about birds, location reviews, group birding photos, meet ups, and more. This sub ( r/socalhiking ) is one of my favorites. Always great stuff to see here, so thanks everyone for that. Cheers",

Our plan is to drive up Friday night, camp at the base at midnight, and then hike Saturday / back on Sunday (since we work M-F, and the drive is 5 hours). The wilderness permits and campgrounds seem to be pretty competitive and I'm concerned that, if I get a wilderness permit, I'm not going to be able to find a place to camp on that Friday night. I know at Yosemite they have \"base-camps\" for backpackers to sleep at near the trailheads, but does INF have anything like this? Will I be able to find a place to sleep Friday night, or will I need to coordinate both a campground and a backpacking permit on the same weekend, despite the fact they are both very hard to secure?",

Caltrans has reopened more than 10 miles of Angeles Crest Highway in the Angeles National Forest after the completion of emergency repairs, reestablishing access for visitors. Relentless storms from the 2022/2023 winter season caused extensive damage, prompting the closure of Angeles Crest Highway between Islip Saddle (post mile 64.1) and Vincent Gulch (post mile 74.7). Runoff and slides from severe storms created large washouts and undermined the roadway at postmiles 65.29 and 66.34 and created a series of small erosion gullies at postmile 65.80, leaving the guardrail system without support from the side slopes. The areas of reconstruction were reinforced and stabilized to prevent future highway, slope, and embankment failures in the same locations and to provide a safe travel route. Repairs included rebuilding slopes, constructing two new retaining walls, replacing a damaged elevated cable-mesh drapery system and installing new guardrail and drainage. Total cost of repairs is approximately $7.9 million. ###",

I did summit all 9 peaks‚Ä¶be prepared to go off trail for a while for all peaks except for Gorgonio, San Bernardino, and San Bernardino East.  I got water at High Creek Camp and then again at High Meadow Springs (which was still flowing as a trickle, but easy enough to gather with my small collapsible dog bowl).  Overall this loop was about 29 miles with 9,200 vertical gain. Beautiful trail and scenery throughout. Challenging hike, but well worth the effort; looking forward to doing this one again! Video recap on my TikTok account @jaspurl Note: The overgrowth coming down the Momyer trail portion looked way more intimidating than it actually was‚Ä¶I wore shorts and my legs made it through with just some minor scratches‚Ä¶not bad at all once you commit to going through.  If I had to do it over again, I would still wear shorts.",

Is it anywhere along the trail or are there designated parts that you have to stay within? Any tips would be helpful. I know there are a lot of good camping spots in Southern California, so while other recommendations are always welcome Palomar MT is the closest to where I live and if I‚Äôm just looking to escape the suburbs for a weekend and not a full on backpacking trip it would be rad to be able to make the trek up there. Anza is great too but I no longer have a 4x4 vehicle which makes back country camping there more limiting. Thanks üôè",
