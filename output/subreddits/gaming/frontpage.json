Before SH2 remake, The Medium was the last game I played and while I was impressed with the game, I didn't think they were anything special, so when I heard they were doing the SH 2 remake I was very very skeptical that they could pull off anything special. Their games were never anything special. Man was I wrong. SH 2 delivered big. Such an amazing release.Today I syaryed playing Cronos. I've played 3 hours of it and for someone who thinks Dead Space Remake is one of the greatest horror games ever made. Cronos hit that perfect note. This is 100% what Callisto Protocol should have been by Deaf Space's team. And while I appreciate that they wanted to do something different. Callisto failed to provide the gameplay that made Dead Space amazing and it ultimately failed.We prayed for another Dead Space game and we got remake. We were ectstaic and it was brilliant, but EA killed any hopes of another game.Props to Bloober for giving us something that feels so similar but stands in its own right. They are killing it right now. Imo, they along with Capcom are at the forefront of great horror games right now.",
