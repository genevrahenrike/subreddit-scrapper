      "content_preview": "So since Monday morning my internet connection has just been dead for unkown reasons and there is no information when it will be up again.Thought I might aswell use that opportunity to continue my Kortor playtrough or play another singleplayer game on my PC. Well as it turns out I can't, because my saves are in the cloud and I can't even start games.So I thought I might instead play something on my Playstation 5 like finishing Ghost of Tsushima or something. Turns out I can't do that either, because licenses can't be checked without a connection...I had experienced worse before (almost 2 weeks without connection), but I used to buy all my games as physical copies back then so that wasn't an issue. Nowadays however most of my games are digital copies.Atleast I am not totally out of options as I do still have physical copies for some games, but I just hope it will be back up when Hollow Knight Silksong releases, because it would really suck to miss the launch after 5 years of waiting.Anyways I am just frustrated right now. Like I knew where the industry is headed with the death of physical copies and what not, but I just kinda realized now how bad it is and will be in the future.That's really it, just felt like sharing my frustration.Edit: damn didn't expect so many replies. Btw it's been a week now without Wifi :(Anyways I have seen a few things that I thought I should adress.First off someone pointed out I should still be able to play games on PS5 completely offline, which was also what I thought, hence I tried to play games on PS5 to begin with. But as I explained before it outright tells me it can't check liscences. Apparently the PS5 has to be set to primary for this to work, which is exactly what I did ages ago. I never manually changed it back, but I will this later if anything has changed.As for Steam I am kinda new to PC gaming, which I forgot to mention. People have pointed out that on Steam the game saves should be saved locally, which is also what I asumed. As far as I remember I never changed any settings , but maybe I did unintentionally. That still doesn't solve the issue that I can't even open games tho, they just get stuck on the starting screen, which I asume can only be related to me not having any access to Wifi as my PC otherwise never had this issue.Someone also pointed out that this isn't really related to the death of physical media and instead the need of companies to make everything connected to the internet somehow, which to me are related. Atleast the death of physical media gives certain companies (cough ...Ubisoft) and excuse to design their games around always online connections and what not.And also it still doesn't change the fact that I just outright can't access games I bought digitally right now. It could be user error, but as of now I don't remember changing anything to result in me not being able to play the games I bought. All I can play are the games I have on a physical disc.",
