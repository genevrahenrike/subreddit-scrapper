It's not perfect, the really powerful tool would be the EU citizen's initiative as we've seen recently with the Stop Killing Games-campaign, as that has proper legal force behind it, instead of just kindly asking them to reverse course. But every bit of pressure counts, I suppose.And it's better to at least try to make your voice heard, than hold your peace and fume about there being no changes to do anything.For *all* people, the most meaningful step you can take, is to leave feedback on EU digital fairness act. Feedback is accepted till October 24thhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14622-Digital-Fairness-Act_enYou can leave feedback with your name, or anonymously. You can also leave feedback if you are not an EU citizenIf you're asking \"why should I? I'm not an EU citizen, this wont help me,\" then the answer is simple:It will help you. Just like with StopKillingGames, If the EU rules that actions of Visa and Mastercard are a breach of EU laws, and/or infringment of rights, they can rule against them in the EU, and that is more pressure to Visa and Mastercard than any number of angry calls, or emails.For EU citizens, spesically game developers who are harmed by these actions, there's also a mechanism to reprot a breach of your rights. One of the rights being artistic freedom, which is enshrined in article 13 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.https://commission.europa.eu/aid-development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-fundamental-rights-eu/how-report-breach-your-rights_enUnfortunately, that only applies to internal EU breaches, mastercard and Visa are neither based in the EU, not even legally to evade taxes. So this will be useful only once an EU-based company, government or group tries to advance this within EU.Here's also some less binding petitions I've found.https://chng.it/b2pMbsLvdg(petition is in french, partly, you might have to translate the site)https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policyFeel free to crosspost this as much as you want to.

      "content_preview": "I reinstalled Left 4 Dead 2 recently, and honestly, it still feels unmatched. The panic when a horde comes rushing, the teamwork it forces, and the chaos when a Tank shows up, pure fun.It made me realize how few co-op games today capture that same mix of tension and replayability.What’s a game you can always come back to, no matter how many years pass?",
