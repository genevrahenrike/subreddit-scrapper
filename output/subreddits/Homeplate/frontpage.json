      "content_preview": "As we head into the 2026 season, please remember that nothing matters on a small diamond other then building your child’s foundation of baseball. There is nothing wrong with playing competitive tournaments, traveling for baseball, and creating good individual, teammate and coach-ability habits within the sport at an early age while doing so. There is also nothing wrong with spending that money on lessons, and extra individualized development instead and letting your kid enjoy their childhood more. Just remember, no college or prep high school coach is going to look at your kids PG or Ripken profile from their small diamond years and recruit them. 13/14U is when it starts to matter a little if you are looking at private High Schools, so don’t extinguish their love and passion for the game by forcing them to miss every weekend with their nonbaseball friends because you are chasing rings or profile stats at 8U-12U! Don’t compare your kid to others on social media or with their profiles. Every kid develops differently and puberty is the biggest divider of success at the small diamond ages. Also, remember that Perfect Game is a marketing company. They are not a baseball company. EVERYTHING they do is to generate revenue. Use them for what they are as your kid makes their way to recruiting years, but please tread lightly as your kid is figuring out who they are in the world, not just the baseball world. Your kid will not remember their wins and losses throughout their small diamond and even early big diamond years, but what they will remember are the rides home if they are always negative, the pressure they feel to play if they don’t want to, and that will lead to the eventually the loss of passion for the sport. They eventually will not want to go to games, if they dread the car rides home. Use the early years of travel baseball as time to enjoy time of life with your kids, enjoy the car rides, the time between games, the plane rides and hotel stays, the time practicing together, eating together, etc…DO NOT make baseball a negative experience by caring more about your kids profile then by being in the moment and actually enjoying being a baseball father or mother and the love of the game. Your kid is not a robot, and no matter how much money you spend to make them as good of a player as they can be, they will have failure. No matter how good they are, baseball is a sport of failure so stop being upset when they have moment of failure. Be there to support them and pick them up and love them. I’ll get off my soapbox now…I just wanted to pass on advice that was given to me that helped with my path with my son and changed my mentality when I was getting caught up.",

His hitting coach mentioned moving to a 33\" to \"gain an extra inch\" but for no other reason. Personally, I'm not sure that's a real reason to go up an inch in size. He covers the plate fine and my concern moving to 33\" is him losing some bat speed. He's a strong kid, has a great lower half, but he's not a beast. I'm debating on getting a cheaper, more balanced 33\" for him to try out (Like a Meta or for $120) but unsure if it's even worth it. Would love to hear some thoughts from other parents that have gone through a similar situation. Thanks in advance!",

The problem, as I’m sure everyone has noticed, Is that the ball doesn’t shrink,  just the gloves. So, the pocket on this glove isn’t really large enough to fit a baseball. Do I rush him  to an 11” or even larger and hope he can squeeze it or let him ride it out with that I think is a too small glove?",

      "content_preview": "Not sure if we fit into the travel ball culture, and it’s making me rethink if we have the mental/social energy for it. My son, 8, recently joined a local travel ball team and while the practices are great and first couple tournaments went well enough, I’m not sure if we’re meant for this kind of environment. My wife and I both work in corporate with her having a senior manager role and I having an exec director role, we are often too mentally burnt out each day/week for extra curriculars beyond attending practices and games. There are now talks of fundraising, girls night, team trips, random team get togethers, GameChanger management, attending the club’s 11U games, etc. and I just don’t want to do any of it except for milestone events. Our family is always booked out 4-6 weeks in advance of friends and family activities and I’m getting the sense our involvement will influence my son’s spot on the team. If they want me to cut a check, fine, that’s no problem, but I don’t want to dedicate my personal time hanging out with the team and parents for the reasons mentioned above plus most are too extroverted for our lame tastes. All we want to do is just attend the games and practices. We’re here to support our son and his team during games but we don’t even like sitting in the bleachers because of the music blasting and constant chatting. We sit by first or third base - we just want to watch the game! I know all that sounds selfish and lame but games/practices are times for my wife and I to decompress. Are we just unreasonable or too uptight for travel ball culture?",

These are usually pretty obvious marketing (spam) communications in physical mail or email. But last week my rising senior son received a text from a college asking him to come to their camp this weekend. He flat out asked if they have seen him play, and the coach cited an all star event that he played in this summer. We paid more than $300 for the camp and travelled to attend, thinking there was legit interest. There wasn’t. Nearly 150 kids were in attendance (about double what we’ve experienced at other D1 college camps). The event was poorly run, the coaches never even introduced themselves to the players, and there was no instruction. It was pretty clear that they had no interest in any of the players, let alone my son. It was a cash grab. While I know that colleges use these camps to help fund operations, do you agree with me that there should be some integrity that you don’t bait kids to come? In particular, using texts or DMs should be off limits unless you have legit interest? I feel like we were scammed and I’m pissed off. Do I have options here to try and hold them accountable or do I need to accept that they’ve got high school players by the balls and there’s nothing to be done?",

It’s insane to me that they are a thing. In a sport where the dirt is red and grass is green and kids are encouraged to support the local snack bar white has to be the dumbest color to wear. I mean how stupid are we?! Let’s put our our 8year olds in white pants then send them out to slide and roll around in the grass, and eat slushees, and all different color candy, and hot dogs and burgers. I coached and had my team wear grey pants. They looked great. Parents were disappointed that they weren’t white…W.T.F!!! Ok that’s enough, you get the point. Now let me have it all you white pant supporters, do your worst. Or at least let me in on the secret, how the hell do you keep them clean. …Last thought.. I had a kid on my son’s team(that I didn’t coach) he refused to slide, or get in a situation where he would have to slide, because he didn’t want to get his pants dirty, he was 12… and to be fair it was summer ball.

      "content_preview": "I like coaching my 6 year old son’s little league teams but doing fall ball this year, the schedule I’ve been given already has a few conflicts that will make it tough for me to actually be at the games because of other conflicts with things outside of his fall sports (tickets to MLB games, stuff my wife and I had already planned back in the winter for example). Does this happen to others? Doesn’t seem reasonable to drop my other responsibilities due to voluntarily coaching a little league team so wonder how other coaches handle it if you have a conflict in your game schedule with things outside of baseball. Edit: thanks for the input everyone, I originally signed up to be an assistant but was contacted because they needed more head coaches. It’s two game dates I was worried about but am going to be able to make it work and still be there for my team.",

      "content_preview": "Posting this after seeing 3 kids in two 9/10 baseball games play catcher. Preface: Former coach and now ump here. I have friends that are high school coaches and have been doing varsity level for about 3 years now. I’m averaging 380 games a year during that time(just ran the report and damn that’s a lot of games) This might be your first kid playing baseball/softball and you’re trying to figure out what’s best for them and looking for advice. Here’s my advice. Do not have them play catcher and if your coach wants them to, have the coach buy the left handed catchers glove. Why? I’ve yet to see a left handed catcher in baseball or softball at the high school level. I know they’re out there somewhere but use your kid’s ability to their advantage. Pitching(less of a plus in softball because you don’t pick runners off), 1B, and outfield. I know your really athletic kid is going to want to play other positions and that’s ok when they start. If they love and live baseball, make the move and discuss with your coach. Some coaches just don’t realize it because they don’t know, I was there once. When you start off as a coach you’re just trying to keep everything together if it’s a rec team. Be an advocate for your child. Edit 1: “Just let the kids play whatever position they want!” Got it great. In basketball if your kid is a foot taller and 100lbs more than every kid but slow, let them play point guard. In football, if they’re overweight and slow, give them a chance to play QB anyways, they have the rest of their life to play guard. Again, some parents don’t know what they don’t know. Kids getting reps at positions they have advantages at will help them in the future. Spending $300 on a left handed catchers glove is not a good investment versus a 1B glove. You guys NEVER disappoint. Edit 2: I suggested my advice as someone that has been around the game a long time and does more games in a week than your kid plays in their season. When they’re young by all means let them do whatever. When you are ready for them to join a competitive team, they’re going to play those positions. If you want to argue about it and that your kid will be the exception in a game that has been played over a hundred years by all means go for it. Blows me away the comments I’m seeing here but since I’m an umpire and hear parents say the craziest things almost every day, I don’t know why I expect anything less.",

Bored outfielders who never see a ball. a parade of kids getting walked or hit by pitch.  Base runners who steal uncontested, only to get stranded at 3rd when no one puts a ball in play.  Catchers trying to find the passed ball. Pitches hitting the backstop. On the positive side, it’s one step closer to real 9 on 9 baseball!  My kid is pumped to finally get here since starting tball at 3.  His positivity is infectious! Go get’’em kid! But it’s going to be a rough first couple of games…",

I had early struggles in junior college with a coach that didn’t necessarily mesh with me very well as well as a school being foreclosed in a middle of a season, but last year I finally had a breakout season batting 355 with 4 home runs and a few awards to go along with it. Now I face the reality of owing $15k in student debt with the option of returning to school to finish my degree and play a final season at the cost of $11k plus interest. To add more context I’m going for a business degree that I unfortunately am unsure if I’ll use. There is a word that I don’t end up using the degree but I understand have the degree may be useful in the workplace. I’m scared that I am closing the door on baseball when I may actually be talented enough to play at the next level. Or I’m putting myself in a bad situation for my future. To be clear I am getting $6k in an athletic scholarship and I’m playing at a NAIA school",

I'm looking for a well organized tutorial on how to field different types of balls for various infield positions. Then how to cover the bag on double plays etc. The free trosky course that comes with a rebounder is great. Does anyone have any recommendations whether it's free or say less than 200.",
