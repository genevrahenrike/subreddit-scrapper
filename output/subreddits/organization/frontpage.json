And small rubber gaskets (that I know go to a cup, a bowl, or a lid, I just don’t remember which one so I want to keep them in one spot so that whenever I come across the item with the missing gasket, I’ll know where to find it). And what about small food items like extra sauce cups from fast food (which we actually use up around here), and the little bottles of water flavoring? Also, once reusable water bottles and cups with lids are dry, do you store them in the cabinet assembled, or do you have the cups in the cabinet and the lids somewhere else? Hoping to get some ideas and love at least one of them. I don’t have a lot of storage or counter space in my kitchen, by the way, and I already have a few frequently used appliances on the counter (microwave, electric kettle, can opener, blender base).",

This extra room has so many possibilities - an office, kids room, or guest area. Why when we live in a home do we devalue our space by filling closets, drawers & sometimes even whole rooms - with items we do not use? Let's imagine a closet filled entirely to the brim making it impossible to find stuff or function in the space. It's almost as if this room has now been downgraded to a room without a closet - I'm sure if you saw a room without a closet when you were first looking at the home you would make a mental note or question if there was enough storage.

I have just about decided that I'd like to pursue organizing and productivity coaching as a career. I am not quite ready to start outlaying cost by taking the plunge and joining NAPO. I thought a softer place to start would be to work my way through their recommended reading list. I'm honestly finding a good bit of it outdated though and not very thorough. I'm a fast reader and can really plow through information that I'm interested in if it's well written. What titles would you all recommend? I'm interested in everything from organizing to mental health and disorganization to project and small business management to habits and productivity. I'm sure that there are topics that I haven't even considered, so please flood me with your own recommended reading list for someone interested in the field.",

We have very tall ceilings and the previous owner of the home installed a rail for jackets at an unbelievable height. I'm 6' and I can't reach the bar. We have to get on a step stool every time we want to put a jacket back. Then on the ground we need a solution for our shoes. They're in a terrible pile. We've tried bins and shoe racks but it just overflows. We need to ditch a bunch of them but still, we're not sure how to organize them. We have a shoe organizer behind the door at least, but the kids can't reach those because it's a very tall door. Any help is greatly appreciated. Edit: Forgot to mention dimensions. It's basically around 3.5 sqft. As wide as a standard door frame and as deep. And about 10' tall.",

Many are sorted in plastic bins (2L, 5L) though there’s also the big bin of un sorted chaos as well. He keeps these bins in his Kallax shelf.  But their sizes and tapered shapes result in a good amount of the cube not being able to be used with more. So I’m looking for options to pack it in better.   I can label things for what is sorted If it helps, I’ve got a 3D printer.    I may wind up custom designing something if I can’t find anything commercially available. Any thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "Trials and tribulations. Its been like a month of me unpacking books and stationaries. We moved into my grandpa's house 7 years ago (maybe more... Im not sure...). We went from a big apartment to an equally big house. The main issue was that all the furniture and items from my grandparents were still there. We didn't fit and it was also an Express Move. Everything was shoved where it could fit, a bunch of furniture is built-in and we ended up with many unfillable empty spots. My mom has been in charge of that room for the last seven years. But she is slowing down because of age, and im sure she was overwhelmed. Like 6 months ago I asked her why was she saving a big ass empty spot on the top of the bookcase, she told me it was the first time she saw that space. So im taking over once a week and she reviewing the process and double checking im not touching anything I shouldn't. This last month I've been moving around books, cooking books and stationaries. Its not pretty but they are out of the fucking box!!!! Im pretty sure I broke a hundred YO book tho 😬😬😬 (shhhh, lets all pretend it was already broken) I opened up like 5 big drawers, that mom quickly filled up again. But at least now she can choose what she is putting in there. I emptied like 3 drawers full of miscellaneous types of paper. (Glossy, papyrus paper, vegetable paper, water color paper, etc.). All on different days. Imagine my surprise putting away the first drawer of paper, then another day finding a new one, rearranging and then on another day finding another one. (I want to clarify like 5 years ago, i organized like other 2 drawers of paper, similar miscellaneousness, no paper has been bought in the last 7 years 🥲) Also last week i organized the place... Today I found a new box that appeared from who knows where. Im 100% sure that wasn't there before, but I recognize those books. I swear if my mom is hiding more book boxes somewhere in this house i will make her make me a fresh pumpkin pie off season. So right now im 5 drawers, 3 cabinet drawers, 5 book boxes and 7 tiny boxes down!!!!!!! And the biggest win is that I haven't thrown anything away. :)",
