While this does not apply to every conference, I really have felt this. MUN conferences have been starting to feel like a social event, rather than an academic one. They have been constantly raising prices, and generally have low level delegates, with maybe 4 to 5 good ones in a committee. If not, the whole committee is ready to kill each other for bd.

He took the two pieces of it, put it on his shoulder and got the certificate,  the point is,  i'm not telling you to tear your pants apart, I'm saying that to handle high levels of stress, do something about it right now, not later. If you do it right now, it would help a TON later, that's why I'm saying, pick UNSC if you're a beginner, and if there's crisis then you've struck gold, it'll help you a lot in future MUNs.

Now, I’m planning to host an interest meeting on September 17 and potentially set the first conference date in mid-November at a city that’s around three hours away. What kind of things and activities should I do during that time? I’m considering canceling going to the conference and just working on teaching, but at the same time my fellow leaders and I would really like to attend an actual conference. We plan on teaching the basics of MUN, how conferences work, the basics of researching and writing position papers, debating and speaking, and bloc/amendment making. We are going to give out assignments (mock research, paper writing, speech preparation) as well as host one-day mock debates and hopefully a two day mock simulation before the conference. We will also set aside time for preparing for the actual conference by spending time researching, writing and peer-editing, and giving feedback as needed. I’m concerned that there may not be enough time to do all of this within two months and that we should just wait until the spring. What do you guys think? Is there anything that I’m missing? Thanks!",

In the description, it was written that it was a two-day session on August 30-31, but it didn't happen. Yesterday, I tried reaching out to them but haven't received any reply yet. I don't know what's happening, as it's my first time using MyMUN. So, if anyone has also signed up for it, can you give me any updates? Or if someone is frequently on the site, can you tell me if these scams are common or if I should just wait longer?",

Top dels have some technique which they use to make insanely good POOs, so anyone feel like giving me a guide on how to get extra marks through POOs I'll give an example Palestine says in gsl that \" Israel's borders are non existent\" This is a violation of customary law, specifically the montevideo convention's article 1( or 3 idr). Given that Palestine acknowledges the statehood of Israel, its not possible from Palestine's pov. This is a logical fallacy, hot to turn into a factual inaccuracy Note: Im saying this is a logical fallacy because its 'technically not possible', its not inconsistent with any legally binding document hence I cant understand how to make it into a factual inaccuracy Gimme tips for POOs as well please",

They're offering me 6k for remuneration which is a good amount to say the least. But here the red flags: They didn't go through my CV or ask me any relevant questions before appointing me. It was just a 20 second phone call where they allotted me this random committee to chair. Another huge problem, their appointment email says I have to bring 10 delegates?? Like why am I doing their job for them? Another thing, it's a private mun with like 200 followers on Instagram. Their communication so far has been incredibly hasty and closed off. But 5k is too good of an amount to let go. So tell me, is this too good to be true? Am I setting myself up for disappointment?

Is it as intimidating as it sounds? How did you all handle your nerves when you started?
