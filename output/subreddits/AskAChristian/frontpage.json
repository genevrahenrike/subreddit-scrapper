      "content_preview": "Important context: I have been a Christian my whole life, Raised non-denominational. Only around high school is when I took my faith more seriously and truly started to learn more about what I believed in. The one thing that I am sure of is that Jesus Christ is the truth, and that he is God in the flesh. My issue has come up more recently. I graduated this year, and before now I haven’t been too worried about denominational differences. Recently, However, I’ve listened to arguments of other Protestant denominations as well as catholics and orthodox. And while I’ll spare you the details, I realized they all have very different views on important concepts, especially salvation. I’ve found myself stuck in the middle, all three of the major sects believe they are the truth, but each one believes the other two are damned to hell. It’s taken me a while to ask anyone at all about this because I feel like everyone would be biased to their own denomination. And they all have compelling evidence for and against each other. This feels like when an atheist says “there are so many religions what if I choose the wrong one and go to hell?” But it’s within my own religion! TL;DR  I believe the trinity is God and that Jesus is the one true way, but all 3 major sects damn each other to hell, how could I possibly choose? This is a crisis of faith. And I don’t know if I’m even saved or ever will be",

Like I have been in a theological battle with women preaching and even women roles finding there are many scriptures that support it but also go against it. Also I thought the whole point to Jesus was to showcase how the law isn't everything and how God comes first? And yet Paul comes in an partially negates that with the church. I'm just saying that currently its feeling a lot more like religion, and not at all God's word. I really don't blame atheists and such for leaving Christianity because we live in an era where churches tend to be run by a bunch of ego filled men (who use scriptures that actually support this with Paul), and others Christians judge others for simply misunderstanding something. Like I have been accused multiple times for putting my own authority over God when I'm simply trying to find out the meaning and context of a verse.",

I still lived with my parents, earned very little, and feared the shame of having a child out of wedlock. I worried about my depression, suicidal thoughts, and even if my antidepressants would harm the baby. The father was my ex. We’d broken up badly, but when I ran into him, he said he was in therapy, had quit drinking, and had a job. I thought maybe he had changed and gave him another chance. But soon he went back to drinking heavily. One night he even got violent when I tried to get emergency contraceptives. I took them the next day, but it was too late. When I found out I was pregnant, I felt trapped. I feared raising a child with someone who was unstable, violent, and still struggling with alcohol despite health issues. I was also depressed and dealing with suicidal ideation. I eventually terminated the pregnancy. At first, I felt relieved — the panic was gone. But soon guilt and regret set in. I began wishing I had waited before making the decision. Now I feel torn. On one hand, I deeply regret the abortion and know I would never do it again. My views have completely changed. On the other hand, I still feel relief that I’m not tied forever to him. And because of that relief, I question myself: is my repentance genuine? Will God still forgive me?",

We know he can show up like the burning bush to Moses, so why can’t he just settle all of this and appear before us? I know some of you will say Jesus, but that’s just earthly flesh and he could still be whipped and beaten. I’m saying, why doesn’t a massive voice boom from the sky and tell everyone he’s God? Why is all the teachings from God done through humans? It’s about trying to live a life without sin right? I feel like so many people would be way more inclined to follow and worship if he was to actually prove his existence, and the fact he doesn’t is actually what keeps me skeptical. The problems in the world stem from this too, we have so much debate around so many different topics, if God was to actually show up to us, he could easily settle it for us and make it easier for us to live without sin. You can say it’s in the Bible, but it’s not, it’s a few small verses and lot of interpretation, that’s why so many Christians think so differently to each other? We don’t have any scripture on trans people for instance. I just can’t wrap my head around why God would choose such a secretive existence if the goal is to get as much people to follow him as he can.",

Wouldn't hearing new information you treat as true be handled like a correction? Being told death is not a consequence means they're only told good will result. So until they ate the fruit, they weren't aware of the disobedience they committed. To argue otherwise would be to claim that they knew they were causing their death.

Out of all the religions in the world, Christianity is the only one that really stirs something in me. I’m honestly confused but also curious what do you think this could mean? And if I want to explore this further, where should I begin? I’d love to hear your thoughts from a Christian perspective.",

Why can't I just...die? As in fade into nothing as is believed in the secular world. I never asked to be part of this spiritual war between God and Satan for the souls of humanity, so why can't I have a say in what happens to me after death? If I just want to fade away and be left alone, why is that not an option? And before anyone asks, no this is not about me not wanting to be held accountable for my actions. I know that I'm not perfect and try my best to be a better moral person every day. This has more to do with the fact that the concept of eternity (both good and bad) quite frankly frightens me. Knowing that it will never end, I'm surprised that doesn't scare more believers, even eternity in heaven. Plus I'm an autistic introvert by nature, so I'm assuming that if God made me that way, my spirit in the afterlife will be the same, just wanting to actually die and be left alone. Why is that not an option?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I’m asking this from a place of genuine curiosity and respect. In reading the Bible, it seems that some verses are embraced as timeless moral truths, while others — even in the same letter — are seen as cultural or outdated. I’m trying to understand how that distinction is made. For example, in 1 Corinthians, many Christians today emphasize: •\t1 Corinthians 6:9–10 — “Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men… will inherit the kingdom of God.” This is often cited in debates around sexuality and morality, and many hold it as an authoritative moral stance. But just a few chapters later, there’s: •\t1 Corinthians 11:5–6 — “But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head… If she does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off…” This is rarely practiced today and is generally seen as culturally bound to the time. So my sincere question is: What framework helps Christians decide that one of these teachings still applies today, while the other doesn’t? Is it historical context, tradition, theology, the Holy Spirit? Or something else entirely? Thank you to anyone willing to share how they personally think about this.",

More specifically, clarity about a guy that I thought felt something, but he ended up not. We no longer speak. Yet, the way he treated me felt as if there was something there, even thought it was for a very short time. He was respectful when he left and I have no bad blood towards him, he simply just did not feel a connection. I won't get into too much detail but that is the foundation of it. Anyways, this is not the first time that I have been in a situation like this. All the guys in my life have left me, and that is leaving me to the uncertain period. Yet, all of the other guys from my past, when they left, they did come back once or twice. So, I leaned to God. I keep asking Hi, \"Why not me? Why can it not be my turn? Why am I never anyones first choice?\". I then started asking Him for signs if this guy was going to come back into my life. I prayed and asked the Lord that if this guy is coming back into my life, show me a pink car. I do not see many pink cars so I thought that was a good sign. I was driving to my sisters house and I was totally disconnected from the world. I was listening to a song, that had significance to him, and there it was, a pink car at the light in front of me. It was also in that moment when I was thinking of the month of October for some reason. In that moment, I did not feel weird, I felt comforted and heard. I went on with my drive. Then, I was scrolling on TikTok and saw a video. There were two calendar dates on this video. The first date was 7/28, which was significant to him, and the second date was 8/17, which was also very significant and connected to him. Again, I felt very comforted in that moment. I was reflecting on these two moments. I couldn't help but think it was just delusion or me thinking to much into it. So, I asked the Lord for another sign. This time, the sign was a purple car. Again, a color of a car that I do not see very often. I was driving some where and I listening to another song with significance to him and I look in my rear view mirror and there was a purple car. I have been getting more little signs here and there. But my question to all out there is, am I looking into this too much or is the Lord trying to communicate with me about this guy?",

So I'll keep it short but basically I haven't gotten a clear answer from God and I believe he's asking me to trust him and to be patient. I'm a 23 year old guy and I haven't been in a relationship for a few years. I met this girl through a mutual friend about 5-6 months ago, and haven't felt this way about someone in a while. I prayed asking for guidance and that if it is God's will to please allow it and if not to help us find the right person when the time comes. I kept saying this prayer over the past months as things unfolded with her. Throughout this time I have had a few ups and downs where things will look really promising and then fall flat. Like just this past week a bunch of us were hanging out and towards the end of the day we finally got some 1 on 1 time to talk. Just as we did something came up with her friend and she had to drive her home. Little things like this have happened about 4-5 times now; just a things are about to be a good moment the get taken away. I really dumbed this down to keep it short, but I hope you can get the gist. This consistently happening has left me confused on if God was saying it was right or wrong, and after some time I believe he is telling me to just trust him on this. My struggle now though is what to do during this time. I have been praying about it lately, but it honestly feels like too much to the point where I'm thinking about it too much and not trusting him. I just don't know what a good prayer to say is I guess.",

However I’ve had this issue lately that has made me feel distant from God, like I’m not as “on fire” as I was just weeks ago. For example– I was reading my Bible, and I read Romans 9:17 (For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”) I had this thought go through my mind that randomly said “I guess by this you could say God is evil.” Even though I know that isn’t what it’s saying, it means at least from my understanding that God used Pharaoh with his hard heart for His plan, which in the end glorified Him. I worry this was blasphemy which I know is unforgivable. As soon as the thought processed, I felt my heart sink. Anxiety rushed through my body. Ever since I’ve been getting random thoughts going through my mind that I don’t like. I worry that it’s my own thoughts or heart, that I’m really thinking those things. All I know is I simply don’t want them, I want things to go back to how they were, and I don’t want to feel the way I do now. It’s made me feel distant and fueled my depression. I don’t want thoughts regardless of origin that doubt, blaspheme, discredit, make me feel like God doesn’t love me anymore or has removed Himself from me, or make me question what comes from my own self or not, or that I’m evil. I don’t want those thoughts or feelings, even if they are my own. Any advice?",

      "content_preview": "I'll prefix by saying I'm an atheist; I'm curious why some bits in the bible get taken more seriously than others. Everyone focused on abortion and gay rights as being against the word of god, which if mentioned are mentioned a handful of times. By contrast the Bible forbids the eating of shrimp, the wearing of clothes of two fabric, eating fat, eating blood, eating pork, planting different seeds in the same field, getting tattoos, trimming your beard. The list goes on. I would respect the opinions of Christian's who don't support lgbtq rights or abortion if they also obeyed and abided by the other rules set out. But it seems they won't follow the word of the Bible on some things but will try to enforce its laws on others. And it's that hypocrisy that bothers me most. Who are you to pick and choose which bits need to be followed.",

However, in 1 Corinthians 14 he says women should veil their heads, and yet almost no one seems to care about that in church service anymore. So what's with the hypocrisy that the veil passage can be cultural, and yet women preachers isn't? Because Paul gives reasons for each of them and yet you hardly ever hear people talk about the veil.",

      "content_preview": "Taking an apologetics class has really shattered my faith in the Bible honestly. It's so ironic. I started asking questions to the college pastor who was leading it, and it just made me more and more confused and doubtful. Now I'm questioning why we treat this book like we do in the first place. (What I wrote below isnt the exact conversation we had, but it was basically mine and his points) \"How do we know for sure which books are NT canon?\" \"By what the early christians were reading and teaching. And if it aligns with the rest of scripture\" \"Okay, but also the NT builds on the OT. How did we decide the canon of the OT? Or that it is from God at all?\" \"By what the Jews decided is and isn't canon\" \"Why are we trusting the word/opinions these random groups of ancient people to tell us what writings are from God?\" \"Because God revealed His word to them, and they passed it down to us.\" \"Okay but how do we actually know that they weren't mistaken? Or that they didn't just make it up?\" \"The word of God tells us so.\" You see my issue here? We say the OT is God's word because... the Jews said so, and passed it down? We say the NT is also God's word because... early christians say so? And because they believed it? Yes, there are other arguments and points to be brought up which I didn't mention. But the thing that concerned me was that when I started asking more questions about those other points, all his arguments started to break down, and the more he started HEAVILY relying on the whole \"well the Jews determined the OT Canon, and we know the NT Canon because that's what the early christians believed were Scripture and were teaching on it,\" and, \"The Bible tells us [ ].\" So we believe ir because others believed it? We believe it because they told us it was true? As a sidenote: please stop using the Bible to prove why the Bible is true. That's just a circular argument that really annoys me. \"How do you know the Bible is true?\" \"Because the Bible says so.\" The Quran also claims that it's the truth/word of God, and I don't see you guys reverting to Islam. It just feels like Christians are bending over backwards to not have to require nearly as much actual reason or justification for their own beliefs as they do other ones. You'll pick apart Islam or Atheism for the smallest little things but will do literally anything reconcile the most glaring contradictions in the Bible because you already assume that it is true, so it must make sense somehow, even when it really doesn't. \"Theres a contradiction in the Bible? Oh, you're obviously just not considering the nuance of things, or it must just be a difference in the authors' writing styles or in context that wasnt mentioned. Or they don't actually mean what they said. The Bible was written under inspiration of the Holy Spirit but the authors still had autonomy (which apparently couldnt avoid confusing contradictions). Duh. But, what's that? There's a contradiction in the Quran? False religion!! No further investigation or consideration of nuance needed!!\" I'm not making a case for Islam. I don't believe in it. But I'm just trying to point out the extreme bias many (not all) Christians have when it comes to this stuff. When your other arguments have had holes poked in them, most fall back on that we can trust the Bible because other people did and/or because the Bible says we can. And I just don't understand that.",

      "content_preview": "Hello! My girlfriend and I have started a relationship, and we are doing — or want to do — things the right way. She is devoted to God, and I follow her lead because I want to be part of God’s path. My story is that years ago I was in a common-law relationship (I didn’t marry in church or civilly), living with a woman, and we had a daughter (whom I love and for whom I fulfill my responsibilities — I am her example). At that time, I was not a believer (far from God) and more connected to Catholicism. Later, due to issues somewhat related to infidelity on the part of my ex-partner (now married), I decided it was best to end that relationship because of problems — she left me, and we finally separated. My current partner is a widow (her husband passed away years ago) and has a son, but she is someone dedicated to God and has given me my place up to now. Her parents and family have accepted me as her partner, but the church pastor mentioned that it is a complex matter and he cannot give a yes or a no — perhaps a no (he said my partner would have to pass away for me to marry, and mentioned that in the time of Jesus, living together without marrying was already considered marriage). He also said that since I was already with another person, I carry something of that person’s DNA (scientifically), which was a very hard blow for both her and me. We have tried to find ways for her and me to be together (she longs to marry) while respecting the Scriptures, but she has many doubts. Now I am seeking other perspectives… Can we be a couple (dating)? Can we marry in the future? Is our relationship possible? We only want to do things right. Personally, I put my daughter first, I don’t drink alcohol or use any substances, I am about to finish my degree, and I am focused on my goals — always putting God’s will first. It is complex from the perspective of Scripture, both in the times when it was written and now, but I have faith in God — it is possible to do everything according to His will. God bless you!",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I just wanted to be real and put this out there. I’m feeling really torn today. Physically, I want to masturbate so badly, it’s frustrating and hard to avoid sometimes. Hormones and desire are real and not bad in themselves, but I grew up in purity culture, and part of me still feels guilty, like if I give in I’m somehow disappointing God. I don’t want to dishonor Him, but at the same time I’m not sure it’s wrong. It’s just so challenging to carry the weight of both desire and guilt together. Right now, I feel like giving in, and I just want to admit how heavy and lonely this feels. Can anyone else relate? How do you personally navigate this? Is it okay to let myself give in once in a while without shame? I’d love to hear from people who wrestle with the same thing. Thanks for listening.",

Last Nov 2024 me and my wife were pregnant and we lost our first child full term caught us both completely off guard. I tried several times trying to read the bible but I don’t understand the wording I need a bible that has common English I want to believe I just don’t know how or where. I was raised up catholic and I think that has a lot to deal with it. I’m now 40 yrs old and I’m so afraid that if I don’t find god that if there really is a heaven and hell that I won’t get to be with my son when i die.",

But the fear of hell made me ask God for forgiveness. \"No one in my family knows about my addiction to pornography and masturbation.\" I have been away from them for a few days, although with some thoughts and impulses, but I have not carried it out.
