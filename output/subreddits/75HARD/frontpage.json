On a long drive I wanted to get a Dunkin energy drink, so I asked Siri if it had sugar in it, to which it responded no. So, I got the drink and had it. Later I was looking at macros for Dunkin, and to my surprise it does have sugar (possibly not a surprise to some, but again I was under the assumption it had no sugar). Does this count as a fail? Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "I don't know what came over me this morning but I just didn't care. I managed to take pics but then no exercise, reading or sticking to my diet. I can't believe just a day or two ago I was thinking this is the new me and that I'd finally cracked the code to losing weight. I wasn't prepared for real life. Two things came up that were super stressful and upsetting and I clearly wasn't prepared for how to work this around this. So yeah... I spent the day at home feeling sorry for myself, doom scrolling and eating ice cream, French toast, etc. I was really tempted to just lie and pretend that today didn't happen as it's hard to go back to day 1 but what's the point in doing this if I don't do it properly? I will keep doing this even if I have to keep restarting until I do it right and see it through. The good thing is that day 1 - 6 were so helpful in terms of getting me back into exercising and reading. I hadn't done either of the two for way too long. I'm finally comfortable with going to the gym and swimming pool by myself which is great. I was doing really well so screw the past, let's go! Mistakes not to repeat - No eating out (even if I think it's healthy they add salt/sugar to it which then sets off my cravings). Start the day with reading and exercise otherwise I go into sloth mode. No energy drinks or coffee.",

Anyways: DON’T PUSH TOO HARD, especially when first starting out. I did drop sets in the gym first 3 days, and my chest and legs hurt so much, just existing was painful. I even had to get a massage for the first time in my life. I’m so proud of my self that I pushed through it, but I still failed, why? Sleep schedule is everything. If you don’t have your sleep schedule right, it will be really difficult to complete the tasks. I woke up very late due to an exhausting previous day, and between getting in the water, reading, and 2 workouts separated by 3 hours, I failed. Good luck to everyone starting, still going, thinking of starting, and me.",

My problem is I’m not 100% sure what diet structure I want to commit to. For example, I was planning to start with a higher-carb approach (2–3 meals per day, clean foods, cutoff time at night) just to get momentum and stay consistent. But later in the challenge, I’d like to transition into something stricter like lower carb or even OMAD once my discipline is stronger and my body has adjusted. Would changing my diet partway through automatically count as failing the challenge? Or is it acceptable as long as I’m clear with myself about the rules and never break them (no cheats, no slip-ups)? I want to do this with full integrity but also set myself up to succeed.",

Managed to get out of work around half 9 and drove straight to the gym, tunes on, feeling good that I’m getting it done. Jumped onto the treadmill for 45 minutes and only when the cool down came on I went to plug it into the app for the second workout when it hit me. Completely forgot one workout was to be outside, understandably annoyed, grabbed my stuff and headed home. Straight out for a 45 walk around the local area.. Felt superb ticking that off afterwards, anticipating many bumps along the road but dealing with that was something I wouldn’t have done before. Never mind heading to the gym after work.

I am on day 60 and an active member of this subreddit, so I must confess my sins. At 10:04 CST today, geared up with 51oz of Great Value, purified water, I headed out for my outdoor run. I am gassier than usual, but a little extra air in the tank has never hurt anyone... or so I thought. About 1.8 miles into my run, racing conditions have seriously changed. That little extra air has turned into full on turtle heading in my pants, my stride is impacted, I can no longer run . I am now 2 miles from my house, and quickly realize that I am not going to make it back home. Luckily, (if you can call it luck), the trail I am on is fairly empty, so I pull down my favorite pair of Old Navy leggings and drop a deuce while being protected by a bush. This isn't a solid BM you guys. It's the type that even if you were at a proper commode you would question taking a shower or at least hitting the back with a wet wipe. None of these options are available to me at this moment. After completing this heinous crime, I scrounge up the courage to pull up my dignity with my drawls and run back to home with the 25 minutes I have left. Fueled by feces fragranced air, I make it home..... WITH 2 MINUTES LEFT ON THE CLOCK. I'm not forgoing ticking this task off today's list due to 2 freaking minutes, so I pace in my driveway with remanence of shit left in my pants. Mind you, I am in Texas, so I quite literally am brewing a turd brownie in 100 degree weather. The timer rings, I hurry in, and even my cat looks at me in disgust. An hour and a shower later... I am now ready to be assigned my recitation of Hail Mary prayers as a form of penance.",

I chose a high protein diet prioritizing I reach my protein goal while being a caloric deficit. I’ve been eating chicken and brown rice with broccoli almost everyday just because I’m confused on what is considered a cheat meal or not? I’ve seen posts saying that fast food isn’t considered a cheat meal if it falls in your diet but I’ve also seen eating milk chocolate is a clear violation. I’m only intaking 2200 calories at the moment however I’ve been burning around 3400 a day and need to fill the gap with something. If someone could clear this up it’d be greatly appreciated.",

My plan for the 75 hard is the following: Exercise: 4X a week go to the gym and walk 45 min outside Once a week: play tennis for 2 hours; Twice a week: do things like yoga, spinning, swimming and walking Diet: I’m thinking of following a pescatarian diet, with no ultra-processed foods except for protein powder.

I was expecting a bigger difference especially in the first week as I usually do with other diets. I know I’m putting in the work, but I’m worried I’m doing something wrong.

I did however manage to get my 10 pages of reading in as I arrived slightly earlier and downed as much water as I could. I was thinking the hearing would be finished around mid day, but it rolled onto 5pm (with only 30min break in that time to eat something before I passed out). I also wore new shoes which completely tore my feet up - I have 12 blisters in total so my feet are screaming. Started to make the journey back home and boom, 3 hours worth of traffic so I decided I’d stop at a service station and at least get my 45 min outdoor workout in - luckily I’d packed trainers in my car but my feet were still so sore - spent 45 mins walking around the rather limited green space they had but still got it done! Despite all the odds, I made it home, took my photo, ate, did some more work, soaked my feet ensuring 3 hours gap before starting my second, zombie like, home weight session and finishing all my water. On days like this although they are hard, it really shows you just what you are capable of. Roll on the next 30 days!",

So I quit the challenge, because I didn't want the constant urge to pee all the time. And that's ok. But I'm gonna continue exercising 2x a day for 45 minutes, one being outdoors, because I need more steps in and some cold morning air is good for mental health. I'm gonna continue reading 10 pages a day because it's a nice reset from the hyper stimulating world we live in. I am probably gonna keep having a cheat meal once a week though. Pretty much continue the existing cut I'm doing. Great respect to you all for doing this challenge and seeing it through, but it's not for me.",

I'm a stay at home mom and I will likely have to do my workouts during nap time or after bedtime. Let's say I'm in the middle of my workout but at the 30 minute mark, my baby needs me for 5 minutes. After that I get back to my workout. Is that too long of a break? Can I just carry on and finish the 45 mins or is there some rule about stopping the workout ans having to start over?",

      "content_preview": "Hey yalll! 4 months postpartum after a really difficult pregnancy that had me gain 80 lbs. currently down 55 lbs and looking for a challenge to shed the remaining 25 lbs. I’m limited to at home workouts and I have a treadmill, some dumbbells, kettlebells and a bench to work with and my outdoor workout will be a stroller walk with the little one wearing a weighted vest since my baby HATES the baby carriers with a fiery passion. As for diet I’m doing an alternate day fasting mixed with a low carb diet. First book is The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk. I’m excited for this challenge! Good luck everyone!",
