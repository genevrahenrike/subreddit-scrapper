So now I’m wondering in which part of this district I should stay. It can be a little quieter but I do like to party so it should also be nearby that area. If someone has AirBnB recommendations feel free to post. Thank you very much",

      "content_preview": "So if you have checked the Warsaw subreddit, the biggest posts, multiple ones this week actually, have been about Pickup Artists and \"Passport Bros\" heading to Poland to do \"daygame\" and practically harass Polish women. One Polish woman talked about being approached 10 times in one day. It's all in the Warsaw subreddit, and you can check it all out. Long story short, a number of people in Warsaw are up in arms over guys from foreign countries going around and practically harassing women in Warsaw. I wanted to describe the history of pickup artists but its so mainstream at this point, started with Neil Strauss and then RSD Nation capitalized on it. I won't waste much time on this as I have a lot to say here. How Poland, Colombia, and other countries figure into all of this. The reality is, a lot of these self-proclaimed \"dating coaches\" and Pickup Guys could not prove that their tactics worked in places like an NYC, London, or World Class cities where women had plenty of options. Some good dating coaches did but most did not. What they found was that it would just be cheaper to have these \"bootcamps\" in Eastern European countries and South America. Problem became that they took the most loser and autistic men with poor social skills, charged them thousands with the promises of getting pretty foreign women, and had them flood up the streets with \"daygame\". Some it this turned into spamming women and just harassing them when they have made it clear they are not interested. How not to be like these creeps or get put in the same category as them. Now that I have given you the background, here is how not to be like these creeps or get thrown in the same boat as them. The reason I tell you guys this is because it is about to get real bad out there because of bums like these dudes. Work on yourself. No seriously: Get to a healthy weight and don't be fat Learn how to dress well Fix your hygiene Work overtime to get a decent enough body Get your business or career right enough Learn basic social skills Learn to be a person other people want to be around This is tough and can take time, unfortunately though, its your only real option. Learn BASIC social skills and how to take social cues. Go to networking events and any meetups or events of the sort where you are interacting with people. Talk to both men and women and brush up on your social skills a bit. Learn to take some basic social cues such as: When people are not interested in speaking with you Walking away when people are not interested in speaking with you Realizing when people are just not in a mood to talk so you are not that guy chasing down a girl who is busy and needs to be somewhere NOT harassing women when they have told you they have a boyfriend and instead just walking away rather than seeing it as an \"objection\" You MIGHT want to invest in online dating and some better photos. Hate to break it to you guys but the current Game is in many ways online. Great photos or at least investing in them pays dividends in ways that talking to women you know in person can't. Not that I say you should never talk to them but just being honest with you guys about this part here. A few great photos showing you in the best light won't hurt. Have friends in countries you are visiting. Look, visiting a country JUST for sex and women is a bad move. Visiting because you have friends who can show you around is a good one. If you don't have friends of different nationalities, work on making them. Some expats and foreigners are more open to meeting local friends (you) in a new land. It's a way better look than going in alone as some predatory pickup guy only there to spam approach women. NEVER spam approach during the day. Look, if there is a woman you like who is at a coffee shop or in public and is giving you good signals or seems to be open to interacting with strangers, then talk to her. However, do not be that guy who is running up and down the city talking to every single girl that is just trying to go about her day. This is what beggars and homeless bums or scammers do. It's not wrong to talk to women in public, especially if they have given a lot of clear signals like smiling at you and giving you great eye contact. It is wrong to run around like a chicken with his head cut off and talk to everything that moves. I even tell guys to not even approach in their first day in a city. Just talk a walk around, observe the environment, and get a feel for how people act. Just mindlessly spam approaching is low value behavior. Try to fix your dating life in the biggest city in your own home country before doing spam approaches in a foreign one because.... Look guys, if you cannot meet decent women in an NYC or London, you are the problem. We get it, \"Western Women\" aren't the best but these cities attract new arrivals in the dozens and there are plenty of women to meet there. If any guy cannot have a decent dating life in these places, I have some bad news for when you get to Eastern Europe. It is not all sunshine and rainbows. The truth is, if you suck with women in London or NYC, you will not magically become some Playboy in Warsaw or Prague. In fact, I'd argue that women in the latter are a lot more prudish. Sure, once you have proven yourself to be a guy that decent women in massive cities like NYC or London are okay with spending time with, expand your horizons. There is expanding your horizons because you want to and have curiosity for another culture and then there is having to do so because you are undesirable to most women in your own home country. Tough pill to swallow. Realize when its snake oil in any country, it ALWAYS is when any guy is advertising women there. Look guys, I get it. Your dating life sucks in your current country because women are picky or whatever. Maybe in some cases if you are in a small city or town, you have a legit reason for your failure. However, move to the biggest city in your own country instead first. The other thing is that whenever some dude brags about how a given city is so great for meeting women and hordes of dudes are pouring in, realize that it is a bad move to go there for the women. Realize that at that point, that place is so overrun by creepy Pickup Artists and sleazeballs that women are on-guard. Eastern Europe for the most part has been overrun by horny British, Italian, and French guys who cannot get women in their own home country so they harass local Slavic women. You'll be the 10th guy to creep her out that week. Real life and reality are far more practical. You have to be the best you and get results in your own home country before you can wander abroad and hope some magic models fall on your lap.",

      "content_preview": "This post has been in the making for quite a while. So, for some context, I'm an American guy, and one of my closest friends, also an American, recently divorced his American wife. They were married for 7 years as well, in fact we married around the same time. Their marital struggles and eventual divorce got me thinking about why their marriage ended in failure but mine is still going stronger than ever. Obviously that's a very complicated question with a lot of answers but...I think a big part of it is gratitude vs entitlement. Without getting too much into my friend's relationship, he was in the military, and had to work a very physically demanding, back breaking job, sometimes pulling 12 hour shifts. Fortunately, that job paid very well, and so he was able to somewhat comfortably support her without her needing to work. Now, all he wanted when he came everyday was a clean house and dinner on the table. That's it, he didn't ask her to do the dishes, or do the laundry, or go grocery shopping, or do anything else. Just keep the house in order and have dinner ready. She could not do that, he would come home and the house would be a complete mess, she wouldn't even make an effort to clean. Furthermore, she didn't know how to cook, and had no interest in learning, so he would have to get home and cook his own dinner. Then there was the issue of sex, the frequency of sex decreased over time until they were doing it like once every 3 months, and the sex was never particularly good, especially once they married. She also emptied out his bank account while he was deployed (despite him specifically telling her not to) and blew 10,000 dollars on weed, booze, lingerie (which she never even wore), handbags, and shoes. That was the final straw that ended up triggering the divorce. She came from a relatively normal, sort of upper middle class American family. Then there's my wife. She's from the Philippines, she grew up in an abusive household in poverty. When I met her she was washing her clothes in the river behind her house, she didn't have hot water, or a stove, or an oven, or a dishwasher, or a washing machine, or an air conditioner, she didn't even have a refrigerator or a flush toilet! Her father was a drunken bum who abandoned her family when she was young, and her mother had to work incredibly hard to keep the family afloat. Her extended family, by the way, were no help either, they were abusive pieces of garbage as well. I could go on and on, suffice it to say, my wife has had a very tough life. Then, when we were both 19, she met me, on Okcupid, that was 11 years ago now, in 2014. In 2016 we got engaged, then in 2017 I was hospitalized and required two brain surgeries, chemotherapy, antibiotics, and hormone therapy to recover. I was hospitalized for close to six months. We were not married yet, she could've walked away, most people would have, regardless of what country they're from, especially at such a young age. She didn't, she stuck with me through it all, she is the reason I'm here today, she remained loyal no matter what. Two years later, in 2019, we married, and it has been a fairy tale romance ever since. As of two weeks ago, my wife started on her Master's degree. She NEVER would have been able to do that without me, I made that possible. She went from washing her clothes in the river in a third world country to pursuing higher education in the United States, traveling all over the world with her husband, and making her dreams come true. She never traveled before she met me, thanks to me she's now been to 10+ countries all over the world, she's been on cruises, on luxury train trips, stayed in 5 star hotels, fancy restaurants, theme parks, all because of me. She has all the nice creature comforts of a typical American house in the suburbs because of me. Thanks to me, she's working on getting her driver's license and her own car (which I will buy for her). We're still working on that, but in the meantime she has me to drive her wherever she wants to go. So why do I bring all this stuff up? Because, she never expected any of this from me, she never felt entitled to ANY of this. When we first met I had a POS car, a tiny ass apartment, and I was just starting out in life. Now, I have my own business, own my own home, and I have a really nice car. She loved me even back when I didn't have shit AND I had one foot on the banana peel! However, she understands and appreciates everything that I have done for her, and the one thing I am struck by is her constant \"attitude of gratitude\". She is so THANKFUL for EVERYTHING I have done for her, and she repays me any way she knows how. Whether it's a home cooked meal, or a thoughtful gift, or mind blowing sex, or even just keeping the house clean, she is always finding ways to show me how thankful she is. Heck, this summer SHE took ME on a trip! She wanted to go on the great American roadtrip, it was her first ever roadtrip, so she offered to pay for all the hotels and everything if I would drive. I've dated a lot of American women, and I have also seen a lot of marriages between two Americans fail, and it does seem to me that a lot of American women, especially nowadays, have....an entitlement problem. They have an attitude problem. My wife is NOT submissive, that is a common misconception, but she is cooperative. She communicates with me, she is open about her needs and wants, and when there's a problem between us we solve it. She's also not above admitting when she's wrong, and she's not above apologizing. She knows which side her bread is buttered on. I've seen SO many American marriages fail because the woman cannot admit when she is wrong, cannot communicate openly and maturely, and will be difficult and cause drama just for the sake of it. Anyway, be careful of the Philippines, there are some real gems there, but you have to be careful. There's a lot of terrible women there too. If you find a good one though, she will change your whole life for the better. TLDR: Friend's wife (American) was lazy, entitled, and stole 10k from him. My wife (Filipina) is loyal, devoted, and GRATEFUL.",

I lived in Costa Rica for a few years and I’m curious how costs compare to Costa Rica? I don’t drink I don’t party, I just prefer to eat healthy and go to the gym. Rents are reasonable, found a place right around $900 for the month. Nice, & newer condo via Vrbo, however I just messaged owner asking if ok to bring back guests. I’m staying in a spot that is walkable to gym so outside female companionship I am trying to gauge why others say expensive? I understand food might be comparable to CR and states but the quality free of all steroids (I know not completely) is what intrigues me about most Lat Am countries. Lastly, recommendations for a long weekend hike? 5-10 miles? I didn’t research the MPs yet, any info on that end is appreciated! Cheers all!!!",

      "content_preview": "After bouncing around different countries and doing internet research, I realized getting a number doesn’t always mean getting a DATE ❤️ High Flakes – Numbers are easy, but expect last-minute cancels or endless “maybe next week” reschedules. Plans shift around depending on mood or friends/ family. Girls often double-book. People say yes in the moment, then ghost when something “better” pops up Brazil (High flakes- Rio, Sao Paulo, Floripa. Medium- Salvador, Recife / Olinda, Belo Horizonte. Low – Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Brasília) Colombia (High flakes- Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena. Medium- Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga. Low – Manizales / Pereira, Santa Marta) Argentina (High flakes- Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario. Medium- Mendoza, Mar del Plata, Salta. Low- Bariloche, San Juan) Mexico (High flakes- Mexico City, Cancún, Guadalajara. Medium- Monterrey, Puerto Vallarta, Tijuana. Low- Mérida, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro) US (High flakes- NYC, LA, Miami, Vegas. Medium- Chicago, SF, Boston, Seattle. Low- Austin, Denver, Minneapolis, Portland, Atlanta) South Europe (Spain, Italy, Greece) Australia (Sydney, Melbourne) South Africa (Cape Town, Johannesburg) 💛 Medium Flakes – Party-centric, tourist-heavy cities show higher flakes. Non-touristy areas have better reliability France – sometimes you get the “test flake” (they cancel once to see if you chase) UK (London) Poland/ Czech/ Hungary (Prague/Budapest) Canada Philippines Thailand India (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore) Turkey Japan (Tokyo, Osaka) China Korea 💚 Low Flakes – Harder to get a number, but once she says yes, she shows up. Culture values punctuality and reliability. Flaking is rare unless there’s a real reason. Less tolerance for wasting time, so a “Yes” actually means \"Yes\" DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) Nordics (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland) Ukraine Russia Baltics (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) Balkans, Romania, Serbia That’s been my experience so far. Curious to compare notes: Where have you had the most flakes? Which country surprised you with reliability? Do you notice any differences by age, blonde vs brunette vs red head, long hair vs short, curvy vs skinny? Note: I have not visited all countries/ cities in list. Remaining I have added from Youtube and blogposts",

She was a year older than me and I ended up living at her place for free. She was on a 500k peso a month salary (about $9000 usd) and used to take me out to the most expensive restaurants in makati and BGC. One time she even took me to that bali themed resort and she got the honeymoon suite at $500/night. Not gonna lie, it was nice to have that for a change cause usually Filipinas are always wanting you to pay for everything. I heard Japan has quite a few sugar mamas but haven’t come across any myself.",

      "content_preview": "Tired from dating apps fatigue, I went out for some day game regularly in Germany last 2 weeks. Perfect conditions: sunny weather, city center, no big distractions or events, between 17:00–21:00. I was dressed decently in polo shirt, denim, white sneakers, clean beard, short hair cut and wearing Dior Sauvage. Approached 30 girls overall with confidence. Basic conversation openers, rather than outright flirts. Here’s how it went: 3 Germans chatted with me for ~10 minutes, gave me Instagram happily… but never accepted the follow request. Flakes despite culture being reliable). 1 German girl was studying to be a police office and said she is busy in exams, 2nd German girl was a guitarist and travelling to another city. 3rd German girl was a waitress at restaurant 13 said they have a boyfriend, few enjoyed conversation, rest not 4 told me they’re married but enjoyed conversation 2 turned out very young 5 didn’t even respond to my “Hi” Breakdown of nationalities: 17 Germans (3 gave Instagram, most had boyfriends, 2 turned out very young, very few ignored) 3 Ukrainians (married, boyfriend, didn’t speak English at all) 1 Moldovan (married) 1 Brazilian (boyfriend) 1 Romanian (boyfriend) 1 Iranian (married) 6 unknown (ignored my Hi) So basically 30 approaches, lot of hard work and courage but not a single date. Question to you guys: What has actually worked for you in day game to get dates? Why do so many girls either have a boyfriend or are married? Any way to better spot the single ones (since most don’t wear rings)? How do you usually figure out a girl’s age before approaching? How to avoid under 18 vs over 40? Which areas in the city do you find best for meeting higher-quality or more open girls? Do you also get the “boyfriend/married” response most of the time, or is it just my experience? Curious if others had similar results. Let’s share experiences here.",

      "content_preview": "As Uncle Bernie used to always say, \"Everyone likes to swim in different ponds. You're still the same size fish no matter the size of the pond you're swimming in.\" For being such a fuck up he really truly was a wise man in his own way. Another one, \"I'm paying them to leave.\" But in all seriousness, having progressed over about a decade or so living abroad as a PPB starting in my early 20's from a broke college student, close to unpaid intern, young working professional, as well as a semi-accomplished working professional, IMO above any other factors out there (language capability, knowledge of local area, friends/family/acquaintances nearby, prior travel experience, etc.), stable income is by far the most important to support this lifestyle. This is an obvious statement and you may wonder why I am even bothering to write this, and it is mainly due to how much I see being spoken about money as it relates to dating and in general living abroad as an expat/ PPB. Yes, we get deep dives on this sub into \"hypergamy\" and \"the collective female psyche as observed by man,\" but the reality is, as a westerner looking to move abroad and live, date, potentially set down more permanent roots, whether you're 25 or 55, you need to have some money. Many are not blessed to come from generational wealth or be provided with financial stability in this regard. Many also have served their country and rely on pension from the military, or their retirement benefits/ social security they worked their lives to build into a nest egg. And, of course, there is what I would assume to be the larger portion of PPB's on this sub, who are in the 20-40 age range, with jobs/ careers in their western country, but that do not have the luxury to work fully remotely. One of the biggest benefits of individuals still actively working is the ability to generate new income, assuming they do not have any passive income, and being paid a western salary in a 2nd or 3rd world country is often quite an attractive premise. Your money stretches further because you match an income level relative to cost of living from a more developed economy. I had someone message me from this sub the other day asking what they thought about x, y, z country/ plan to move abroad with basically no savings and a shaky chance of remote employment, could they find a wife/ make it as basically what you'd call a low value male in the sexual marketplace. Answer, no. If you are not financially stable currently, aside from turning over a new leaf and starting fresh to spark some new opportunities, likely you are not going to be any more financially stable after moving abroad. In fact, having been there done that, I can tell you that you will likely be less financially stable. So, to all the PPB's here I see talking about how much money is needed to move/ live abroad in pursuit of your interests in whatever facet of life it may be, think very honestly with yourself, whether you have the financial muster to make it. If you've set up a budget, triple the costs and halve the amount of expected income. If it still works within an acceptable range to survive, FOMO and go for it. To Uncle Bernie's point, if you are low-value in a big pond, you may be slightly higher-value in a small pond, but regardless you still need to swim with the rest of the fish. Do you agree that financial stability is the most important part of being a PPB, or am I misguided?",

      "content_preview": "I have lived in Russia for about 1 year, and Kazakhstan for about a month. My brother is married to a Russian woman, and because of health issues, they needed help with their family, so I have stayed with them since about August, 2024. Originally, they were living in Kazakhstan because of the war, but it proved to be unsustainable because of visa issues. The most limiting factor is language, everyone \"learns\" English in school, but the majority of people are not skilled enough to hold a conversation beyond something very basic. I don't drink alcohol, I don't go to go clubs or parties, so I exclusively used dating apps. Western apps don't always work, but there are Russian ones that a lot of people use. I used a telegram bot called davinci/leonardo-match It wasn't really THAT hard for me to find dates, I could get 1 a week I would say, sometimes more, sometimes 0. I was not able to find any dates in my 1 month in Kazakhstan, I think likely because the english skills there are even lower (I put it on my profile that I barely speak Russian). The majority of women fully expect you to be what would be considered a \"gentleman\", it's very normal for women here to expect you to pay for every single thing, do all the driving, because why should she drive if she has you (Fortunately the subway system in Moscow & Spb is excellent compared to the USA), buy her flowers, hold open all doors, etc. Buying flowers for her on the first date is also very normal. Nearly every 20-30 year old woman you'd see on the street would be at least a 6/10 back in the USA. I've never ever seen an obese woman around my age, literally. The biggest girl I ever had a date with would be be described as \"average\" in the US. She was maybe 5'8\" 160lbs~. I had two longer term relationships, the first one unfortunately did not work, and the 2nd one I have been in for about 3 months now. Both of their families accepted me pretty easily, invited me over often for dinner, their moms cooked food for me when I was sick, I felt accepted. But, it absolutely a fact that a lot of women here are not going to be interested in you because you are a foreigner, ESPECIALLY if you are not slavic looking. I'm 29, hispanic, American passport, about 5'5\", 130~ lbs, somewhat lean build. I speak A1-A2 Russian depending on the situation. I also made some male friends here too, I used a language learning app and met some cool dudes, there's a lot of people here very eager to learn English and you can easily mingle with them. Also interesting to note is that almost every girl I went on a date with, was taller than me. Only one girl ever commented on my height, ever. With that being said, I'd say there are way easier countries to find love. It's absolutely impossible to do things here related to the government/visas without speaking Russian as well. Absolutely nothing is in english when it comes to that.",

Secondly, the idea of having a big family is more of a luxury than a reality (most people live in shared apartments well into their 40s in the big cities). However, if you want something casual, this place is pretty good imo. What are your thoughts and experiences? I’ve heard Portugal, southern Italy and Croatia are much better if you want a more traditional, feminine, family oriented girl.",

      "content_preview": "Hi All, I want to bring my understanding of the meaning of PPB and why people do it and to debunk a common misconception that PPB is related to \"finding women\". Yes with decisions that men make there will always be a factor of does this get me access to more women and of course any form of traveling and free time will naturally put you in that position to be able to find women but realistically this is a misconception or simply wrong way of looking at it. PPB is a financial decision (mostly) not a sexual/dating decision. To understand where I am coming from we must understand why people travel and why only certain locations. Because if its for women couldn't you travel to the nordic/scandanavian countries or how about Japan? Singapore? or maybe even Europe? Because the reason is its just not realistic for the average man to be successful traveling to another country where you will just be another average man and expect different results. This is because woman around the world are the constant in this dating equation. YOU as the man must change. But how? The answer is finances ( well you can change other things like height, looks and dick size but this is doing too much). The most accurate measure of how wealthy an individual is in a particular country is measured by GDP per Capita. Obviously, its not perfect but this is the most accurate measure, specifically nominal GDP per Capita. PPP GDP per Capita will not be used because the TLDR is simply this is just not accurate because the real world does not take your higher valued currency and adjust it for lower PPP simply because your in a country with cheaper goods. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita If we take a look at the above link we notice that USA is ranked 7th with a GDP per capita of roughly 80k. This reflects earning potential for the average person but skewed higher because there are a lot of wealthy billionaires and of course its a measure not a accurate representation. So with this in mind lets look at the lower class income and middle class income. I won't post any links for this because there are some variances but based on my research I have come to the conclusion that lower class income is around ~50k or less and middle class income to be around 50k to 80k. now lets go back tot he above link on GDP per capita. Remember how I said USA ranks 7th out of 191 countries? look at how many countries have GDP per capita over 30k.  I stopped around #40 roughly. which means a lower income earner is earning more than 80% of the countries in the world. LET ME REPEAT THIS, AS A LOWER INCOME EARNER IN USA MAKING ATLEAST 30K YOU ARE BETTER OFF THAN 80% OF THE WORLD. but....... it doesn't feel like it. why? cost of living. This is why. because what you earn you pay to simply be alive. And that is the system that prevents most people from dating success. If you are spending ~40 hours a week working, stressed about bills, living paycheck to paycheck, can't afford to go on dates. The last thing you want to do is drop 100 on a date or movies or go shopping. The second thing is perception. You earning 30k is lower income salary in USA, but to the rest of the world you are in the top 20%. If there is anything I can stress its that perception is reality. This is why women are attracted to foreigners not because you are foreign. Imagine a Filipino guy working at McDonalds in Bangkok... technically he is a foreigner right? TLDR - as much as we bash western countries and USA in particular for how bad dating is, the truth behind this is that most western countries and USA in particular is not designed to help you date. People come here for 1 purpose and 1 purpose only. TO ACQUIRE WEALTH. I just proved to you the wealth disparity globally and also showed the reason for how people take advantage of that wealth disparity. for people who understand this concept, keep PPBing and for others i hope I showed some insight and put things into perspective. don't hate the country, hate the game.",

      "content_preview": "This sub shows up on my feed a lot since I live outside the US and I've always found this concept quite interesting/weird. However, one of the things I notice is that a lot of people here seem quite sensitive when it comes to spending their money. A couple questions... isn't money one of the main \"privileges\" of being a PPB? I see people going to Thailand but their mindset with money is as if they were a local there. I mean, my parents are immigrants themselves, when I go back to my home country, I know my money goes further, I would not have someone pay for me when they make a fraction of my salary unless it was more so purely for the intent (as in, I let them pay as a gesture of respect) Is PPB against the traditional mindset that the men should take care of the women financially? There seems to be a lot of attention to find a women who \"respects\" men enough to split bills, go Dutch, etc. Although I can see this as \"progressive,\" its almost like an inherent need of mine to treat women. Although I make a good salary, I know also people who don't make a lot and would not feel comfortable letting a woman treat them particularly on a first date, because it just doesn't feel \"manly.\" Not in a toxic masculinity sense of 'manly.' Sometimes it feels like users in this sub are looking to \"deceive\" women into splitting bills, because of 'equality' but the underlying reason seems financial?",

For this post I want to focus on finding a long term relationship with a loving partner. First off there is a lack of clarity on what a passport bro is, there was a recent rebranding of men looking for traditional marriages but when looking at the history it has always been men who want an easier path to marriage, for whatever reason. I dont say this to upset people but to be real. The change of western culture and rise of dating apps have made it way harder for all men and has led to a shift in the dating power dynamics where women have the upper hand. Dating overseas is way easier but is it a realistic path to true love? There are so many opportunistic women overseas that see these relationships as a way to improve their lives if they can tolerate the man. Obviously huge age gaps and huge gaps in attraction are a factor in these relationships. If you doubt you will ever fall in love at home it is at least an option. Thoughts?",

My experience in Lima was much better than Rio: On Tinder, more matches, and more beautiful girls who met me At parties, much easier to talk to girls without being rejected (although the only place I went to party so far in Rio is Lapa, which was full of guys, so there weren't so many options) More attention generally walking around the city - I guess because Rio is diverse and they have lots of fit/handsome guys walking around, whereas Lima doesn't have as much tourism, so they are not as used to seeing gringos. I should also mention that I speak absolutely zero Spanish, but I have a basic level of Portuguese, which should go more in the favour of Rio, but hasn't so far. But then again, I haven't been leveraging it much by approaching girls outside. Part of the problem might be that there's actually a lot of unattractive or fat girls in Rio, so the better looking girls who I'm going for get way more attention, and the competition is high, especially on Tinder. I need to talk to more girls in person in Rio to get a better feel, but I admit I was discouraged by the lack of attention on the streets etc walking around. There was one pretty girl staring at me while I was getting lunch on a Tinder date, but I couldn't exactly get up and go to talk to her. Lima was much more - every day, a large percentage of people were staring at me and my friends. I'm also going to visit some of the better clubs in Rio, maybe that will change things. One good night can change our perspective a lot hahah. I'm also going to travel to other parts of Brazil after Rio. Anyway, this isn't a finished conclusion, as I have more time in Brazil. Just my thoughts so far. Anyone else want to share their experience in either city/country?",

Like bro... this ain't your custom-built fantasy RPG. Most Filipinas are naturally slim or petite,and not everyone here is obsessed with Western body types. You’re not gonna find an army of Instagram models waiting at the airport. Also, if you think you can come here with zero effort, throw a few compliments, and expect women to fall at your feet — good luck. Respect is mutual. Set real expectations. Learn the culture. Humble yourself a little. You’ll have a way better experience. Thats all. Edit: i am not a bot. Im a girl,im speaking on my observation. If you found tall,white,baddie here its like 20% out 100%.

      "content_preview": "I don’t usually share personal stuff online, but I felt like putting some of my experiences out there in case someone relates. Dating across cultures has taught me a lot about honesty, effort, and how people’s intentions don’t always match their words. I’ve always been upfront about wanting something meaningful. I’m not overly religious, but I do value proper manners, respect, and building something real together. I’ve gone on some decent dates with guys from different countries (mostly through apps, sometimes social media). On my profile, I’ve always been clear that I’m looking for something serious that could eventually lead to marriage. I’m not fetishizing foreign men or anything, but for some reason I usually end up connecting more with them than with local men, or maybe I just haven’t met the right local guy yet, who knows. Some of the guys I met are still good friends, and I’m grateful for that. The problem is, a lot of men just want something casual. That in itself isn’t an issue. What’s disappointing is when they lie about their intentions. Some said they wanted something serious, but after a few good dates they switched up and revealed they only wanted a fling, or treated me like a “possession.” I honestly wouldn’t be that upset if they had just been straightforward from the start. Casual or serious, both are fine if there’s honesty. But pretending to want commitment just to get what you want? That’s the part that feels manipulative and unfair. And honestly, just because some people are older doesn’t automatically mean they’re wiser or better at handling relationships. I’ve met younger people who, because of what they’ve been through, carry a maturity and perspective far beyond their years. Emotional maturity comes from accountability and self-awareness, not age. Well, just speaking from my experience. The dates themselves weren’t fancy; local restaurants, street food, conversations about culture. I never expected them to pay for me or “spoil” me. I genuinely wanted to get to know them. So for anyone assuming women only date foreigners for money, that hasn’t been my experience. Of course, those negative experiences left me cautious, and sometimes it feels like certain men give all the rest a bad name (iykyk). But I don’t want to be bitter. I know there are genuine men out there who value honesty and effort. Women like me exist too. We’re not chasing status or money, we’re looking for a real partner to grow with. So if a man is clear about his intentions and consistent with his actions, he’ll naturally attract women who are ready to meet him halfway. But if his approach is only games and lies, then yes, loneliness will eventually catch up with him. At the end of the day, I believe genuine people eventually find each other so I’ll keep being myself and trust that the right man, wherever he may be from, will value that.",

      "content_preview": "I live in London, incredible city but difficult city to date. Connection is fleeting and rare, you pass many beautiful women every day but the chance of actually making a lasting connection with one unless you're a hyper succesful male is difficult. It's voted one of the worlds most single cities with highest rates of loneliness despite there being so many attractive people here. Throw in late stage capitalism, extortionate rents, dating apps, social media - etc etc it's literally become a dystopian dating market. I'm 29, earn a decent wage for my age, am on the way to buying my first property and generally at the stage where i'm looking to settle down, lock in and build a beautiful family. I am not a sexpat. I am christian and have been leaning more into my faith in the last few years and i've realised if i want to marry someone i'd like her to be christian too - otherwise the whole thing is just a shot in the dark. I am by no means perfect, I am flawed just like anyone else - but I would like to build something transparent and meaningful with the right woman who I will commit too. I'm looking for something and someone serious and like anyone else, i'm open to a connection with someone overseas. I have 3 months between october to december to travel this year. I want to visit south america for sure, likely colombia briefly and brazil (again). But i'm also considering other countries. In my opinion some of the most gobsmackingly beautiful women are Lebanese women. I dated one briefly when I was younger in uni and she's easily the best looking woman i've ever dated, however connecting with them is somewhat difficult since they stick to their community a lot in this - which to be fair I understand. So it's either Lebanon, which i've heard is an amazing country - but is dangerous to travel to at the moment because of that it's conflict with that country or Brazil which supposedly has one of the highest levels of lebanese outside of lebanon - however I have no knowledge where they reside or how their community operates. They might actually be more difficult to date than standard lebanese because to my knowledge they atend to be part of Brazil's elite. Curious if anyone has any experience of either or could give me tips",

Yes there’s a lot more that goes into it but everything starts with communication. And as someone who is tri lingual, I get it. Conversing in a language isn’t easy. But being able to speak Spanish as a foreigner made it somewhat more attractive and I garnered more respect from people around me.

I'm 25 years old, for the last ~5 years I've been getting my university degree and working in tech. Those five years made me feel pretty miserable - no girlfriend, no friends, a job that I don't like and lots of stress. I want to change it and go for a journey starting from October/November, so I've decided to quit my job and do a solo trip. My main goal is to socialize, meet girls and generally have fun. Meanwhile I'll be also taking some online courses to start a career in a new direction and hopefully land a remote job. I do have some savings (around $30K) that I can spend on this journey of mine. Eventually I want to spend around 3-4 months in different countries and travel. Which countries would you recommend me for that purpose? I've been to Europe many times, so by default I've thought about spending a few months in places like - Budapest, Lisbon, Prague and etc. But from what I've read in this subreddit those are not the most \"easy\" places for socializing and finding relationships. Perhaps SE Asia would be better? Would love to hear your advices and recommendations 😃 Thanks in advance!",

I added her a as a friend and tried to send a message but receive a message that this person doesn't accept messages from everyone and didn't receive my message. drat. So I turn around and contact my younger cousin (28? I'm 38) and asked her if she can put in a word for me if she's interested in a man from the USA. She responded that this was inappropriate, and out of respect to her friend she would not do that. She also questioned why am I looking for a woman to marry... that will just come naturally on its own. Was I inappropriate in asking? I felt like going through family and friends network is just natural but maybe I'm just socially dumb.",
