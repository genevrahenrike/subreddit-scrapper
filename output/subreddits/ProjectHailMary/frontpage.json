Would it differ from Grace‚Äôs reaction to realizing he was next to an alien spaceship? Obviously we know that Grace thought about the possibility of an antagonistic alien, but I wonder if Rocky thought the same? I think Rocky wouldn‚Äôt have been so quick to consider that Grace (an alien from his perspective, obviously) could be motivated to harm him. Considering how social Rocky‚Äôs species is (you sleep, I observe) I believe he was more willing to assume good intent from Grace. Edit: also considering that Rocky had been alone for decades, I think that would motivate him more to assume good intent from the alien (Grace)",

What an insanely tense and phenomenal sequence, sending out the chain for the sample and having to position the Hail Mary just right above Adrian‚Äôs atmosphere. The writing and ramping up of tension is just superb! And the cosmic scale and stakes of the scene really comes through. And of course, the ending of the chapter with Rocky‚Äôs decision. I really really hope they nail this scene in the film. It could be so epic and heart-pounding if done properly. Fingers crossed!",

I‚Äôm so glad I went in blind because every page I read made me eager to find out what happened next. I knew there was alien life, but I thought it was just the astrophage. So when Grace met Rocky?! I loved him immediately. Chapter 19 made me sob. I loved how Grace slowly regained his memories and figured out why he was on the mission in the first place. I have so many more thoughts but I‚Äôm still emotionally processing everything. Everything from the writing style to Grace and Rocky‚Äôs friendship made me fall in love with the book. I cried for the entirety of the last two chapters. The only downside is that it‚Äôs over and I don‚Äôt know how any other book can top it. I‚Äôd love some book recommendations with similar light-hearted, comedic writing or a cute friendship. I‚Äôm currently considering the Dungeon Crawler Carl series, the Murderbot Diaries series, or the Bobiverse series.

But what about all the other potential life in the universe that wasn‚Äôt advanced enough to figure out what was going on? Most likely just about every other inhabited planet in the universe was just wiped out. There‚Äôs a couple points where they were discussing things regarding life abs panspermia etc and I kept expecting one of them to bring up that conclusion, but it never came up. It‚Äôs really sad when you think about it. Only two planets were fortunate enough to detect the problem, detect that there was one place it wasn‚Äôt happening, and be able to send someone there to learn about it and bring a cure back.",
