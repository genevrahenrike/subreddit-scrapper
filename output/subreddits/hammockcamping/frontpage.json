      "content_preview": "I'm going on a trip soon and want to make sure I have my backup anchors squared away. There should be trees I can anchor from, and I plan to make a trip out to check, but just in case I've gotten permission to hang between the two Ford Transit 350 vans that we're bringing. These are the standard height, rectangular style, not the extended roof versions. They don't have roof racks, but I think I might be able to anchor on the B pillar. What do you guys think, what are the best places to anchor on a van like these? Bonus question: for vehicles that do have roof racks, is it safe to anchor from them? I've read that they're not designed for the transverse load and could be damaged. Cheers!",

I want to get back into camping, but I'm worried about getting out to a camp site and there not being trees, or space, or a sign saying I can't hang there. Do you pack a UL tent like an XMID for \"just in case\"? Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions! I think the best way forward for me is a Tensa Solo. A lot of the campsites I'd scouted before had at least one tree suitable for hammocks. One of my trepidations had to do with not having trees being spaced right or something. But with a Tensa pole, that pretty well solves my concerns.",

Quilts aren’t available where I live, so I’ve seen people modify mummy sleeping bags into underquilt-style pods for hammocks—even for winter camping. Right now my setup is a hammock with a bag rated around +5 to +10°C. On calm nights I tuck a hoodie under my butt to avoid heat loss from compression. I’m thinking of picking up another bag to use as a pod/cocoon system, but I’m not sure whether to stick with the same rating or go for one rated down to 0°C. Any tips on what temp rating works best? I want to stay warm without overheating.",

I have a 70lbs Doberman, who’s a total snuggle monster, so I don’t think she will mind being squished in there with me. The other option I’m thinking of is just having her bed directly below my body and hanging my hammock lower to the ground. What do you all do? Do you bring your dog their own hammock, if yes what gear do you recommend? Should I just bring her own tent? Update: thank you all for your suggestions! Please feel free to use this post as a place to post pics of your dogs IN hammocks as well as make dog hammock camping suggestions :)",

We had to push the trip back a month to October which means nights could be on average in the 40-60F range. I’m looking for advice on what a suitable under-quilt could be. I’m not looking to break the bank here in case I decide hammock camping isn’t for me. I’ve got a good wool blanket I’ll be sleeping with in the hammock and I own some woobies (poncho liners). Would it be suitable to tie a woobie beneath the hammock as an underquilt? If I can get away with using equipment I have on had that’s be great. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.",

I’m going on a 7 day thru-hike and it occurred to me that it’s way more beneficial in terms of space usage to have a sleeping pad on the outside of the pack. With an under quilt this isn’t easily achieved. How are you all maximising pack space whilst carrying a sleeping bag/top quilt AND an under quilt? It’s pretty tight considering all the food I’ll have to take. Thank you!",

Are there any alternatives? I don’t like this enter from bottom bug nets. The beauty of the summer sock is to easily shift it off and on. Thanks!",

I have not,licked the destination, but don’t want to drive too far so Goat Rocks is on the list (I’m in Oregon fwiw).  But I am hesitant of Goat Rocks for two reasons. First is lack of trees.  I have a single Trekking Tree from Tensa, but there will be two of us.  Is likely to work out?  I got the tree specifically for situations like this, but it looks like my partner can make it as well.  From anyone that has been up there, will this work OK or should I try to get another quickly if we opt for Goat Rocks?  My partner uses a ridgeback which does not have a ridgeline, but I saw a video of a guy using them with his ridgeback so I don’t think this will be a problem.  The bigger problem is I don’t have it.  The pics ai see all show pretty small,sparse trees.  But we are good with pretty creative hangs. The second one nobody here can do anything about and that is crowd.  But that is just something I will have to accept if we go that route.",

But I recently bought a grand trunk trunktech double (listed at 11ft) and when i measured it, it was 9ft 7in between gathered ends. I emailed GT and they said it wasn't an error, they measure carabiner to carabiner. This is a massive difference! is this a super wack quirk particular to GT, or are a bunch of companies selling 9.5ft hammocks as 11ft hammocks? or is dutchware the outlier here measuring gathered end to gathered end?",
