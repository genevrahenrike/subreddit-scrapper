I would be interested in any information/opinions people have in floortime.  In one of her 'x spaces' Kristine goes to great length to stress that she never looked into floortime, as she generally claims to have explored all potential therapies and read all books on autism I began to wonder why she is going out of her way to claim no knowledge of this one.",

Some have apologized directly to Natalia. Not only was it medically proven Natalia was a child at the time, but her own biological mother came forward. She never tried to harm Kristine or any of her adopted family. While I’ll never understand why Kristine lied to such epic proportions, that doesn’t change the fact she lied. She made it all up. And Natalia was just regurgitating what she was forced to say, out of fear of Kristine’s retaliation. Kristine not only emotionally abused Natalia, but she physically abused her, too. She’s a master manipulator, and all of this is evidence of this. Then there are those who question why her first adopted family gave her up, despite them straight up saying they gave her up because they just were not prepared to care for a child with the extent of medical needs that Natalia had. That happens a whole lot more than so many realize. So what do y’all think? Do you think Natalia was just a con-artist, lying about her age? Or do you think Kristine was just a narcissistic abuser, who wanted to be seen as a hero and would go to any lengths necessary to make that happen?",

Now that child is grown and thriving looking beautiful on People  magazine. It's hilarious Kristine's public images are those of a desperate, skank loser. They thankfully covered what she exposed with those black stars and exposed the truth of her character. The truth that she is an evil, depraved, sadistic, lying, manipulative, scum of the earth monster. She can rant about it all being lies and try to twist things to seem inocent BUT if what Jacob shared about making him pee on Natalia's bed was the only truth in the whole documentary, it's still an apt description. She's hideous. In the end having Nicole DePaul looking like a loving savior enrages Kristine. You know it does. Kristine probably randomly goes off to whatever poor souls she has in her vicinity, about how she knows Nicole did this or that, and saying crazy **** about Nicole. I hope those other sons escaped her and are in therapy. Let her rant at whatever sucker she snared with her \"white trash\" wannabe porn pics 🤢",

It absolutely BAFFLES me that the people who agree that she was a ‘dangerous’ person, ‘violent’ person or ‘sexual’ person don’t consider the fact that these are quite usual presentations for young people who experience adverse childhood experiences such as sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect etc etc.. if the claims are true from psychiatric hospital which they very well may be.. she could have been displaying hyper sexualised behaviour in response to her abuse. It’s all so easily explained through TRAUMA. I just don’t get these people who can be so blind to that. Including putting the biting a baby into the doco to prove that agenda? She was 10 years old and likely experiencing some misplaced emotions and jealousy. Of course I agree that traumatised individuals can cause harm but, I do not believe this was her intention. She’s clearly now grown into a well balanced individual which is such a huge credit to her. Help me understand these morons.",

The first 3 episodes were so bad that make me wanna quit, but according of what I saw on reels and tik tok about the TV show I knew I had to watch it. When I get to the half of it, I figured why those 3 episodes looked so bad, it wasn't that Ellen Pompeo was a terrible actress outside Meredith Grey, they make it looked bad on purpose because it was all bullshit. At first I thought the actress impersonating Natalia was terrible, but she did an incredible Job acting the unreliable narrative part. Chef kiss on that direction. And also the decision of make Michael less annoying that he really is was a great decision, otherwise those 3 first episodes would've been a nightmare to watch. I also think they added that last dialoge with Cynthia just because the last allegations and probably they cut some Antwon scenes too because of the same reasons, but that it's just my take.",

The Ciccones robbed Natalia of being adopted by several parents that could provide adequate support and advice stable home. We don’t know the whole details of what occurred in that home, but it’s a safe bet that it was not a safe home. Then the Barnetts. This family was beyond abusive and negligent. I hate how this family actively tried to change the narrative about the abuse in the home. It is evident that Michael was not only complicit but even a participant in the abuse. I feel bad for the son that did interview with the documentary series, but I would argue that him lying by omission does make him complicit. I understand that he wants to remain loyal to his father but both his parents were fucked up people. That whole criminal case was a sham. I hated the outcome because lawsuits come down to if it’s “believable” rather than factual. The Barnetts had much to gain by re-aging Natalia past the age of 21 however they did not expect that her disability would make her a dependent regardless of her age. I’m sure they did had no clue that carrying for Natalia would be a financial burden. Even if Natalia was an adult (she was not), you cannot leave a disabled person by themselves without any kind of support or assistance (nurse or caregiver). They should’ve been convicted on that basis alone. The Barnetts did lie about the close adoption, dental analysis, her birth mother confirming Natalia’s age and DNA maternal match. The Mans’ and Barnetts were sanctimonious con artists. The Mans’ were known to abuse children and had no real employment. And yes there are people that do foster children purely for the financial gain (sad). This family abused her financially, emotionally, and physically. It is clear that international adoption should include therapy but this particular case should have required medical consultation regarding the surgeries needed for Natalia’s disability. I’m happy the De Paul’s’ were able to successfully help Natalia but my god it was like pulling teeth with Natalia as an adult. She still needs therapy and surgeries.",

      "content_preview": "Hi, Well, first of all, Im not even American, so I was not familiarized with this real story at all. I watched the show on Disney Plus (it includes Star content in my country) and I was aware it was based on real events but I didn’t know until what extent. I didn’t read barely anything about the real story before I started watching it, so I was just expecting a thriller show somewhat similar to the Orphan movie. And the first episodes were kinda that, but the second part of the series was completely mind blowing. It really gave me goose pimples (Idk if I’m using the right expression) and I felt stupid because that’s what the show pretended: I always believed the wrong side of the story. As I said, I thought I was watching an Orphan movie remake but in a show. But then, I realized the villain was in the other side. The moral lesson I got from it was something like \"people tend to believe what they want to believe, doesn’t matter if it’s the truth or not\". It was definitely a sensational lesson as someone who values critical thinking a lot. Now, after having concluded watching it, I ended up with a lot of questions. Was Natalia a victim since the beginning or there are other stories behind? Is this one of those stories who doesn’t have \"clear\" sides (good or bad)? Or is it just a story showing how an adoption system ruined the childhood of Natalia and how there are some families who adopt kids just for let’s say image or their own selfish purposes? I came to this sub because I guess people will have some knowledge of the real case, and I’m interested in obtaining a non biased opinion that can complement my own thoughts after having watched the show. Thanks for reading!",

Not just the obvious culprits, but the lawyers, the neighbours… Kristine’s lawyer starting a fight with medical/expert witnesses because they made sarcastic quips about the outrageousness of the court order was completely unhinged. I’m assuming he was aware that he was on double camera (court camera, and filming) and this was how he presented? Insane. Michael’s lawyer has a duty to zealously advocate, but the fact that he didn’t seem to once indicate/acknowledge (even by facial expression) that Michael is deeply delusional or cognitively impaired was wild. These neighbours are comically absurd. Like Sue is still out here insisting that the re-aging was appropriate? The neighbour who apologized also immediately started claiming she’d been duped by Kristine and was super performative and weird about it. Also, why would Michael agree to film? How could he possibly think he’d be able to evade accountability from viewers? Why is he fake crying every 10 seconds? Ugh he is the worst",

They both (Michael moreso than Kevin) victimize themselves to seemingly separate themselves from their responsibility to their children. I don't know.

But you can clearly see in the different videos and photos she develops like going through puberty. Plus the hand writing? Also from the videos of the adoptive father when she lived alone can you not see she was scared of him and he’s clearly intimidating her like a child afraid she’s gonna be hit for something?And the neighbors honestly are just as bad like they say they can tell she was hungry and need help but it was inconvenient for them to question the parents or actually get a story just tell her sorry you’re bugging me currently? I’m still in the first few episodes and maybe my pov can change (doubt cause obviously she was an abused child) but idk i feel so bad for her and the cards kid dealt her, I hope she can heal from everything.",

      "content_preview": "I’m a teacher. Although I’ve never been “threatened” I know teachers who have been. Kids will threaten to kill teachers and throw stuff at them. My friend had a stool chucked at his head and a knife pulled on him. I’ve been called names, hit, kicked, and been spoken to in an extremely disrespectful way. I have never once felt like I was going to be murdered by them. What I did feel was that they needed help. They needed to be evaluated and receive counselling or be put on medication. It could very well be true that Natalia threatened to hurt people, or that she hit people or did weird shit. But kids, especially traumatised ones, just do stuff like that. Natalia was never properly parented or taught right from wrong. It’s plausible she did some of the things she’s being accused of. HOWEVER that does NOT in ANY way justify her abuse and subsequent abandonment. IF (big if) IF she did those things, she needed HELP. therapy, meds, a family who actually loved her, SOMETHING. i want to clarify that i’m not saying she did everything she was accused of, but IF she did, kids do stuff like that and she should’ve gotten help. she shouldn’t have been mercilessly abused and abandoned to fend for herself. not sure if everyone will agree, this is genuinely just my opinion coming from personal experience. EDIT: a child being a child doesn’t necessarily make them innocent. they still need to be held accountable for their actions, ESPECIALLY if their actions cause harm, physically or mentally. i’m just saying that on top of this, they need help. not abuse.",

      "content_preview": "Any other SA survivor's blood fucking boil over during the documentary where Michael says that Kristene sexually abused him by withholding sex? First of all, what a rapey comment. Kristene has many health issues which can affect your sex drive. Maybe she just didn't want to?? I feel like there are lots of people in this world who will victimize themselves if their partner says no, and it's disgusting. Secondly, while withholding sex on purpose is shitty and in some cases emotionally abusive, it's just not the same as the actual clinical definition of sexual abuse. Michael was never 3, screaming on Sunday morning because the toddler group leader at church was molesting him. He's never been assaulted so brutally that he started hemorrhaging and needed a blood transfusion. He's never been in a locked, moving car going 80mph with the driver's hand down his pants. He's a delusional moron with constant \"Little Broken Bird Syndrome\" (as I like to call people who are constantly victimizing themselves). I really feel for his son who lives with him. Poor Jacob has probably heard all the gory details. Natalia showed many symptoms and behaviors of a CSA survivor. For Michael to not only directly abuse and enable the abuse of that little girl, and then turn around and call himself a SA survivor? Disgusting.",

I don't understand how they were able to get away with it what was obviously child neglect, child abuse, child endangerment, child abandonment. Watching her cry for her mom and dad while she was alone, scared, and confused in that apartment had me in tears. Michael's constant need to make himself the victim pissed me off to no end. My 17 year old said it best. She said yeah there was some weird things going on with Natalia's behavior but it was obvious she was a little girl. The fact that no one was held responsible for what was done to that poor little girl complete baffles me. I feel so bad for Natalia and hope she is getting the help she needs to overcome the severe trauma she has gone through so that she can lead a happy, fulfilling life. I hope Michael, Kristine, and everyone else that was involved in what was done to her, rots in hell. Intense, in-depth psychological investigations need to be done before someone is allowed to adopt a child.",

      "content_preview": "I have just finished watching the documentary “The Curious Case of Natalia Grace”. One of the best documentaries of all time. But again, I'm sitting there soo frustrated, thinking to myself that AGAIN, the perpetrators just win and get away with it. Just like it often turns out in documentaries, be it because of child abuse, some cult or whatever. Neither the orphanage, nor the Barnetts, nor the Mans faced any legal consequences that would be known. No matter what they did, how bad it was and how hard they tried to bring these people to justice. It simply didn't matter. The only one who has to suffer for the rest of her life is the only victim: Natalia. That simply can't be! This is yet another case that shows other sick-minded people that now they too can destroy the lives of orphans if you just do it brazenly enough, because they'll get away with it anyway. I'm sure Kristine Barnett continues her wealthy life with her daycare etc. or without success, but now with financial reserves that have provided for her.. And the Mans are sure to carry on just as before, abusing children and collecting their social benefits, now maybe wealthier than before. I'll even go out on a limb and say that the Ukrainian orphanage still exists and is still in operation (if it hasn't been bombed) and some of the people in charge are still working there. And all this as if nothing had ever happened. But these are just my thoughts and I hope their lives were actually destroyed financially and socially, if not legally. I'm just convinced it's not because I've heard so many of these maximally unfair cases. What do you say? Am I the only one who notices this and is massively bothered by it and are the social system and the rule of law at an end?",
