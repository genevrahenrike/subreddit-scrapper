The only company certified repair person obviously has no idea what he‚Äôs doing.  It‚Äôs been six months now without a fridge.  We ARE going to make them repair this expletive fridge out of principle, as well as to expletive make the clueless repair guy get this expletive work done and make the company make good.  The guy complained his car was broken down and I was offering to pick him up since he said he only needed a screwdriver to fix out fridge (he didn‚Äôt need his van with tools).  When he finally did come out the part swap did not fix it and he has not really updated us since except to say he has to call the manufacturer to figure out what the error code means. BUT.  We also ARE going yo buy a new one. And we do not want to find ourselves in the same boat again.  We will not be buying another Bosch.  What brand would you all suggest and where do you buy, and what protections do we need to get yo ensure our fridge will be repaired and/or replaced quickly with no issues in the future???

I always assumed it was a pretty basic machine. But the dishes always came out squeaky clean and crystal clear. Our new place has a Frigidaire and the glasses and black nylon utensils come out all hazy, and stainless cookware comes out with white streaks. I tried hi-temp wash with Cascade Rinse Aid and it was marginally better but still not as good as in the Amana. I'm wondering if the issue is the machine, or maybe it's the water in our new city. We moved from the Fort Lauderdale area to Tampa. Any ideas? https://preview.redd.it/new-home-new-city-new-dishwasher-same-detergent-v0-lr9z34evgsmf1.jpg",

The company I worked for hired one of my buddies for a single day as day labor and then told him to go fuck himself when he asked to get paid. I told the big boss that that's not cool and I'll have to pay him out of my own pocket and he lost it. He immediately fired me for insubordination, told me he's sueing me for faulty installs, keeping my final check, going to have me arrested and finally vaguely threatened my mother. What the fuck? I made a post on the appliance repair sub a while back about how the company had a policy of not replacing the gas flex lines on gas appliances when they're supposed to and I started to doccument it. This asshole thinks he as all the power and can bully me; he's got another thing coming. I've showed my evidence to everyone who would listen and I've at minimum cost the company it's contract with Lowe's. No one else has gotten back to me yet. I reported him to the intermediary company, Lowe's, best buy, the fire Marshal, local FD, local police, the gas companies, everyone. Fuck that guy. \"SR transport inc\" if anyone's wondering. I'm pretty sure it's not the Nevada based trucking company that comes up when you Google the name. They've got no website and I don't think they have an address.",

What would be the best quality / most reliable brand I could order online? (For instance, apparently to buy a Wolf you must go to a showroom, which I can't do.)",

Mainly cause it was huge. Having issues with it freezing up and thus not cooling like it should. Back in may it was floating around 40-42¬∞. In May before a vacation I unplugged it overnight and let it thaw. It helped, but still didn't cool to <35 like it used it to. I confirmed with my fridge thermometer, and threw in my Thermoworks Smoke Now it's doing it again. Ironically a week after I got back from vacation and missed a chance at an empty fridge it defrost again. In my research LG actually wasn't that bad as far as repairs go. Everyone seemed meh. Samsung was awful. Why can't someone be like Speed Queen and just make a reliable fridge? tl;dr 2022 LG fridge freezing up. Does anyone make a good fridge?",

She said it‚Äôs what it looks like. Claimed their warranty only covers returns in the first month The rust is inside The supervisor wanted to troubleshoot the rust lol. He asked me irrelevant questions for 20+ minutes (does it make noise? does the display work?) Supervisor said he was \"the highest of the highest\" and no one else could help Suggested I clean the rust with baking soda (I already tried cleaning - it's actual rust, not dirt) Finally offered a \"replacement\" for $329 - MORE than I paid originally I have the full call recorded and the rust photos. The call is incredibly frustrating to listen to they bounce between ‚Äúno‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù while never actually honoring the warranty. What can I do at this point?",

I transferred all my food to the new fridge---but I need to hold onto it for the utility company to pick it up later this month.   Thing is, I feel it's ridiculous to keep the thing running just to keep it from getting that funky smell.   I don't plan on cleaning the interior as my guess is the utility company is just going to scrap it anyway.   Can I unplug it and prop the doors open a crack, or should I just keep it plugged in and running at its warmest setting (that's what I'm doing now).   Thanks for your input.",
