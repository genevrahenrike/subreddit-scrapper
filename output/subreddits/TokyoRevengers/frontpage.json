      "content_preview": "It would go so hard. I specifically want it to be from Hanmas perspective, about how much Kisaki changed his life, and the friendship they had. And I want more of their backstories. We know nothing about Hanma and Kisakis families/home-life, which I think is so strange because for every other character it is a huge part of them. The fact that every character has neglectful parents or were orphaned or whatever is a huge theme is the manga/anime because it tells stories of found families, and is why all the characters can get away with never being home and getting tattoos so young. Considering Hanma could get away with tattoos, Kisaki could get away with full body tans and both could get away with never being home they must also have neglectful parents. That’s what I want to see, I want to see a reason for why they are both so messed up. Also I kinda think Hanma grew up poor, and Kisaki rich, so I think that would be a really good contrast to explore in a manga. But yeah I want to see from Hanmas perspective the light that Kisaki gave him, I want to see their friendship grow, I want to see that reliance they had for each other.  Like a want to see them actually being teenagers in some scenes. Cause we never got scenes like that for them. I want to see them laugh, Hanma making fun of Kisaki and Hanma tryng to get Kisaki to smoke or something. The manga would start off at the grave in the future where Hanma is telling Kisaki the story of the Pierrot and the reaper, then it goes back in time and that’s most of the manga. Then at the end it can jump back into the future with Hanma at the grave having just finished the story. I think this would compete my life.",

      "content_preview": "There seems to be lots of people that were unsatisfied about the fight between South and Mikey Which I do understand as they were built up to be like equals And yet we all saw how the fight ended However there are many reasons on why the fight ended like it did. One is that South had been relying on adrenaline and he had already fought before And South is someone who relies on his brute overwhelming force to take down his opponents And we've seen how people like Senju was able to use her technique In order to land an attack on him But South overwhelmed her due to his extreme physical capabilities. On a Physical level he can be considered superior than both Mikey and Senju But Senju and Mikey are both superior to him when it comes to technique. Mikey was someone who had both the physical capabilities to be able to fight South Along with the Technique to be able to defeat him Because of that Mikey was able to see the openings in South's attacks as he clearly got carried away And Mikey was able to attack South in the vital spots and dislocate bones in South's body Making it so that Mikey was able to easily beat South. This was long, but this is the main reason why Mikey was able to win the battle.",

I adore each of their stories and genuinely want them all to have redemption and peace. but there’s a pessimistic part of me that feels like he should’ve just left Mikey alone and lived his life. AND hina’s necklace breaking just sent me over the edge 😭. I know I have to keep reading and it might change what I feel now, but like DUDE go get married!! okay vent over.",

And her death wasn’t a situation where she could just be away from ‘gang world’ bc her brother is literally a gang captain, she would ALWAYS be a target.

      "content_preview": "So these are the names Hanma gives himself and Kisaki. At first I thought Pierrot was the name Hanma gave Kisaki because he made his life a circus. And although that is part of the reason, the full symbolism of the Pierrot is actually super well thought out. The Pierrot is a symbolism for unrequited love and lovesickness. Which of course fits perfectly for Kisaki because of his relationship with Hina. This is interesting cause I think it implies Kisaki told Hanma his reason for everything, his love for Hina. I always kind of figured that was kept secret from even Hanma. But I think it adds another level to their friendship that he told him the truth. As well the Pierrot symbolizes loneliness and to hide your feelings behind a mask, which is really interesting. The truth is we know little about Kisakis past other then his relationship with Hina. I headcannon that he came from a household that lacked in love and attention, which fits the loneliness part. And I think the Mask means Kisaki was sadder than we saw. Kisakis emotions that we see are usually anger or that evil joy in watching his plan come together. But I think those emotions were more of a mask to hide the pain he actually felt. Again this kind of means Hanma knew how Kisaki felt. As for the reaper symbolism I’m kinda confused. I understand that Hanma was a violent person and how that connects to the reaper, the than that I don’t really see the connection. So hay can anyone explain to me the full connection here? What makes him like the reaper?",

      "content_preview": "Any that you look at and are kind of ???? For me it's when they put Panchi, Peyan or Angry in a gay couple, and Angry even with one of the girls. Panchi and Peyan are one of the few relationships in the work that from no angle becomes romantic and I think that when they get married at the end with Yumi and Yasuda it makes sense, it conveys that real couple thing. Angry simply doesn't pair up with any of the characters for me, I don't see him as someone who is interested in men, he's just the sensitive guy who has difficulty expressing himself without making a mess. And none of the female characters would make a functional pair with him in my head. Emma just wouldn't be the type of person I think he would relate to, Hinata would be shit because she would spend her life thinking about Takemichi and the blue cotton candy deserves better, Senju would just ignore him in the relationship in favor of fighting and wouldn't understand why he doesn't like fighting despite being incredibly strong, and Yuzuha would just suffocate him with that dominant authority. When I see a yaoi ship with them I get like ???. Mainly Peyan/Panchi or Haitani/Kawata. I see Smiley being able to be written as a pan character like Wade Wilson or Constantine, but not with a Haitani, in my head it just doesn't work. Maybe a Smiley/Kazushi. Bully/nerd is entertainment especially when the nerd gets louder.",

And when I started watching it I thought it was going to be some serious shonen about gangs, killing, betrayal, and I've been watching 7 episodes of a light headed comedy shonen. Every big stakes (like the simple fact that Mikey and Draken's fight might result in deaths and the creation of a ruthless gang later) is kind of \"ruined\" by the silliness of the jokes (omg Takemichi has poop in his hair lol!!!!) and the fact that Takemichi is dumb as fuck (from what I've seen so far). I've been enjoying the show thus far but if the whole 3 seasons are this kind of light headed comedy without real big serious scenes and stakes, I think i'll pass. For an exemple : Sakamoto Days, the first few arcs are light headed and not really serious and then it starts getting more and more serious, with better scenes etc, is it the same here ?
