      "content_preview": "I have been working at IBM for couple of years and last month I went to my home country (in South Asia) and worked from there for 2 days. It was a family emergency I didn't know how long I will have to stay there. Looking back I should have taken vacation or use FMLA. So I used a travel router with wireguard and digital ocean instance to make it seem like I have been working from US. I have used the same router last year as well but it didn't trigger any alarm. But this year I got an email from the compliance and security team within 2 days and I was interviewed by an investigator who works for IBM and I was questioned. This guy was like a prosecutor. 3 weeks later I was told by my manager that I am fired for using wireguard and digital ocean on a router and its a BCG (Business Conduct Guideline) violation. They also said they know I have used it last year as well. I wish they gave me a warning last year. Anyways it was incredibly stupid of me to do this and I wish I haven't done it but it's kinda devastating. i have psychological issues and I see a psychiatrist through my insurance but now I will lose my insurance as well. I am currently very shaken and just trying to cope with the situation. I really like the people I worked with but now I have to start all over again. I guess that's life",

      "content_preview": "As a retail investor, I’m sounding the alarm: IBM is probably one step from an Intel-style collapse, despite still being hailed as a “safe” dividend play. Let me break it down: Why I see IBM as Intel 2.0 Execution lag: Intel suffered chip delays. IBM’s pivot to cloud and AI has been painfully slow. Missed growth waves: While NVIDIA, AWS, and TSMC capitalized on explosive growth, IBM has mostly sat on the sidelines. IBM's Watson AI is mediocre and IBM consulting is bloated and overpriced. Cultural drag: Bureaucracy and old school leadership / inertia chain both companies to outdated models. Both companies have been brutal to employees. Financial engineering over innovation: IBM leans heavily on spin‑offs, cost cuts, and buybacks, reciprocal revenue arrangements propping up EPS in the short term but starving real growth. Brutal reality: Time-travel to 2013 and you’re basically nowhere If you invested in IBM back in 2013, your total return even including dividends was negligible. In fact, that year the total return was a slight –0.18% . Over the last decade-plus, that means flat to slightly negative growth. Meanwhile, broader tech and indices soared. To put it bluntly: A decade wasted, all the while dividend checks kept eyes off the fact that IBM underperformed and stagnated. Meanwhile, broader tech and indices soared. The recent post earnings dip seem to reflect this reality. What do you think?",

      "content_preview": "What an unbelievably bad website this company has, and apparently it's brand new this year, making its shittiness even more unforgivable. Let me count the ways (that it sucks): 0. It doesn't even tell you what term an internship is for. It was posted yesterday, but is if summer 2026? Is it Spring 2026? Your guess is as good as mine. It asks you to upload a resume, but does not extract any information to fill in all the blanks, like pretty much EVERY company in 2025. Even a 4-person startup has an application process that uploads info from resumes so this is just mind blowing. It then asks you to upload your resume at the very END of the process. A SECOND time?! It asks 5 different ways if you are a protected veteran - no means no! Throughout the form, it is a 'dumb' process, where none of your answers adjust future answers. What is the market cap of IBM again? Can it not hire even a summer intern to fix their website? It asks for your top 3 choices of place to work, but then later on asks 'are you willing to relocate' and below that 'if yes to prior question, never mind the preferences you selected above' but then leaves a huge blank to write in. Like, what?? what is the blank for?! After you finish applying and return to the job board, and select another job to apply to, it doesn't let you 'use last application' so you have to fill in all the answers AGAIN!! So not only is the process a nightmare, it's also a RECURRING nightmare. Can I even find an HR professional at IBM on LinkedIn to inform them of all this? Nope! I just can't believe that a company as big and as important as IBM - a company that is building quantum freaking computers in Yorktown Heights - and a company that HAS to stay awesome to keep this country on the map, has such an unbelievable mess of an application process. Source: University student applying for hardware internship - any referral help greatly appreciated (to compensate for the horror show of an application). Job ID applying for is 55106. [Thursday 8/28 update] Ok since this got 20K views I thought I'd apply to another position and walk through other things that are wrong with it (the first list of 6 was just off the top of my head). I click the job from a list, and it asks me to log in to my existing IBMid, which is sensible. Then it asks to choose an option to apply (without resume, copy and paste, or upload). I'm already logged in, and have previously uploaded a resume (several times!), so this is confusing/stupid, but I upload it again, and away we go. Next step is to update my profile on the talent network. In this step you can only choose ONE area of interest. So the choices include 'product management' and 'project management' (wha?), research, SWE, security... so if I'm interested in both research AND swe, then I'm out of luck. Most companies let you choose 3 but whatever. Also in this section it allows one to select 'communities of interest' but then lists only a single community (women@ibm), which is just ... embarrassing? Then we go to address/school info, and some of the fields are filled in (incorrectly). So that needs fixing. And instead of just entering a date in the 'end date' field it has a stupid little calendar you have to scroll years backward in to find the date - (some companies have a button for year, you click that and get another for month, then day, but here ... it's scrolling time!). You select 'country of university' but then in the next box, where you select the actual uni, it lists every school in the world (results not narrowed to the country selected). Also: on the prior page it already establishes what university you attend, so this is just redundant. It asks what city (of the ones listed) you'd prefer to work. Not remembering all the cities I scroll up to the job title and cities, and here's the hilarious list: \"RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, Dallas, Austin, San Francisco, WASHINGTON, Chicago, New York, Illinois, Texas, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, California, District of Columbia, United States\" So some are in ALL CAPS (why?), New York is listed twice (?), some options are entire states, others are cities in those states, the last one is the whole country ... like what is this? Another good one: \"Hybrid - can you meet this requirement?\" Uhh, I can work in person, but no: I refuse to work one or 2 days a week remotely - I must chat by the watercooler! Anyway. fun.",

The challenge is that if I reveal my pregnancy a couple of months before, it will overlap with appraisal discussions. I’m worried that, just like last year, I may not get a hike since my manager might assume I’ll be on leave for 6 months anyway. Another concern is that my team currently doesn’t have a replacement, so management might think the team can function without me, which could even put my project allocation at risk. How do I deal with this situation intelligently? Has anyone faced something similar at IBM? Would really appreciate your insights",

      "content_preview": "I worked in IBM briefly and honestly, I couldn’t last more than 10 months because the culture was so toxic it started affecting my mental health. Fake leads – Most “leads” had very little technical depth, but behaved like CEOs. They were earning maybe 20–30 LPA, but carried themselves like they were on 60. Their only focus was visibility – spamming Teams with reactions, unnecessary messages, or scheduling multiple daily calls to show they exist. Micromanagement hell – Even during client/user calls, if you missed their internal call because you were already busy on another one (clearly visible in Teams), they would still escalate it in the group chat just to get noticed by managers. Bootlicking culture – Forget technical discussions or learning, it was all about buttering managers. People even put on fake accents in calls just to impress. Totally shameless environment. Toxic managers – Managers are scared of clients, so they keep taking more and more work just to “impress,” without considering resources or budget. That pressure falls on leads → leads dump it on juniors → the cycle continues. Honestly, I think this bad mentality comes from Indian managers and leads who themselves faced ragging/abuse earlier in their careers, and now want to pass on the same trauma to us. Workforce management hell – Bench is next-level toxic in IBM. Instead of supporting people, workforce managers are extremely rude, constantly threatening, and make people feel insecure. Insane working hours – Industry standard is 8–9 hours, but here it’s 10–14 hours daily like it’s normal. No boundaries, no work-life balance. I was even called on sick leave and on planned leave - zero respect for personal life. Some perspective Bhagavad Gita (2.47): कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन — “Your right is to your work, not to the fruits.” In this culture, everything was about fake fruits (visibility, buttering managers), not real karma. Tulsi Ramayana (Awadhi): परहित सरिस धर्म नहि भाई, पर पीड़ा सम नहि अधमाई — “There is no dharma greater than helping others, and no sin greater than causing suffering.” Sadly, here it was the opposite - causing suffering was normal. Osho: “If something destroys your joy, walk away.” No job is worth losing your inner peace. Acharya Prashant: “Exploitation lasts only as long as you permit it.” Staying silent only feeds toxicity. Jiddu Krishnamurti: “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” Just because everyone is tolerating doesn’t mean it’s normal. And: “The moment you give fear a name, you are already free from it.” Naming this fear of managers is the first step out. Closing thoughts Honestly, it’s better to sit jobless and prepare for FAANG/product-based companies where your time and skills are respected, rather than sell your soul in a toxic culture. And to those reading silently - I know many hesitate to comment because of anonymity, but just write it, buddy. This is one life. No one will harm you. You will feel lighter by sharing, and maybe help someone else too. We may be wrong or right, but at least we spoke. Don’t just read and leave. Has anyone else faced this in IBM or similar orgs?

What’s one IBM product or tool you’ve used that really delivered but doesn’t get much attention? Maybe it: Quietly saved your team hours each week Solved a niche problem better than expected Played well with non-IBM stacks Surprised you with how stable or flexible it was I’ll go first: we’ve had great results using IBM Event Streams (Kafka) with MQ in hybrid setups super solid, even if the UI could use work. Would love to hear yours whether it’s old-school (like IIB or Tivoli) or newer tools flying under the radar. Let’s give some credit where it’s due.",

Coding, Recorded Video Competency , and English. I didn't receive any links for the assessments. are these live assessments with like a manager or are they online? and how can I prepare for these assessments?  also does that mean that my resume passed the filters or is it sent to everyone?

Why don't they track PTO?? It's on me to track not only my own accrual, but that of my team. Is this some kind of shady dodge so IBM isn't responsible for vacation time payouts during layoffs? It feels like massive amounts of the bureaucracy inside of IBM has been wholesale replaced \"because AI\" without studying/considering/doing the hard work of actually making sure it would even work. Is this normal for other companies being onboarded? How does this company even make money when 90% of the employees I run into are \"C-\" at best but think they are amazing?",

They mainly just kept the directors and high level managers within HR in-house. So 150 of us have now become IBM employees for our six month contract or transition period. This includes corporate and operations recruiting,talent acquisition sourcing, onboarding coordinators, HR managers, and part of our associate service center. We are all spread out throughout the US and many of us work remotely or at the locations where we have operations which are typically in destination areas.They told us at the end of the six month period. There might be an opportunity to stay on the account working for our old company or there might be opportunities within an IBM elsewhere. Just curious if anybody has any knowledge or experience on this and might know what percentage of us they might keep on the account? I specifically am a recruiter and I don’t think my chances are very good based on what else I’ve seen lol. The only thing I can say is that we do have quite a few in person, hiring events, college recruiting events, and specific things that need to happen in person at our resorts such as on boarding orientations and HR investigations and documentation approvals. I’m very worried that they are going to convert most of our jobs into AI or outsource them to different countries. Any insight would be much appreciated! Edit: thanks everyone! Unfortunately, that’s what I was thinking. I was just hoping for maybe some positive experiences. I’m getting my résumé together. It’s just unfortunate timing as I came back from maternity leave a few weeks ago and I spent years working for this company so I could get into a position where I was not working weekends and holidays. Better luck next time! I think I’ve learned my lesson working for large corporations",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I was running some experiments on IBM Brisbane (4 qubits) and noticed something odd in the correlation data. When I calculate the two-qubit Pauli correlations (⟨XX⟩, ⟨YY⟩, ⟨ZZ⟩) between neighboring qubits, the correlation vectors seem to rotate through 3D space as you move along the chain. What I'm seeing: Bond 0→1: (XX=-0.223, YY=+0.131, ZZ=-0.107) Bond 1→2: (XX=-0.246, YY=-0.146, ZZ=+0.166) Bond 2→3: (XX=-0.072, YY=+0.123, ZZ=-0.084) If you plot these as 3D vectors, they trace out what looks like a helix/corkscrew pattern. Each bond rotates ~120° from the previous one. My circuit: Just standard gates - rz, sx, and ecr (IBM's native two-qubit gate). Nothing fancy. Measured in all three bases (X, Y, Z) across 1024 shots each. What I've checked: It's reproducible (ran it multiple times) Pattern persists across different circuit depths Did some lit searches and can't find this described anywhere It's NOT the same as spin helices (those are single-qubit expectations) My questions: Is this just some well-known effect that I'm missing? Could this just be noise/calibration artifacts on Brisbane? Has anyone seen correlations form helical patterns like this? If it's real, what would cause correlations to rotate systematically? I'm probably missing something obvious, but figured I'd ask before going deeper down this rabbit hole. QASM/data output from IBM in below link if anyone wants to see. Quantum correlations between neighboring qubits seem to form a helix in 3D correlation space. Github https://github.com/VincentMarquez/IBM-Quantum-Brisbane-Circuits-Analysis",

Also enroll in some additional dental so I have the auto-withdraw on. Today I just got a bill in my bank account for $835  from Fidelity. So I opened up my NetBenefit acount and realized they are charging me $835 for my health insurance after the 3 month. Called them, turns out: the COBRA plan is actually an 18-month plan, IBM covers the first three month, but after that you have to cancel that youself. So, don't forget to check your portal and make sure your insurance is canceled after you leave IBM.",
