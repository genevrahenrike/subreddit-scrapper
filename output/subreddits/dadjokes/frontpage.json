    "description": "Welcome!\n\nThis is a friendly place for those cringe-worthy and (maybe) funny attempts at humour that we call dad jokes. Often (but not always) a verbal or visual pun, if it elicited a snort or face palm then our community is ready to groan along with you.\n\nTo be clear, dad status is not a requirement. We're all different and excellent. Some people are born with lame jokes in their heart and so here, everyone is a dad. Some dads are wholesome, some are not.\n\nIt's about how the joke is delivered.",

        "content": "Jokes posted must be dad jokes. Definition: A dad joke is a short joke, typically a pun, presented as a one-liner or a question and answer. Dad jokes are either told with sincere humorous intent, or to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to its overly-simplistic humor. Jokes not considered dad jokes may be removed at the moderators discretion. Alright so we can't really give out bonus karma, but at least you're hitting the classic stereotype of a dad joke. No hate speech, personal attacks, or harassment towards other users. Do not use derogatory terms in any context. We do not tolerate any toxicity. If submitting a joke, please remember to leave the punchline out of the title, otherwise your post may be removed. Remember to tag your posts with [NSFW] if appropriate. Failure to do so will result in your post being removed. Remember: Not everyone loves NSFW content (feel free to downvote it if this is you) and minors are browsing this subreddit, too! Don't repost jokes that have already been posted recently or that are high in the Top Posts of all time. Every now and again someone just wants to engage in discussion with the community, that's cool, but label it as such so people can choose whether to get involved or keep browsing for lols. Any personal information (i.e. phone numbers, email addresses, social media screenshots) that can identify the subject of the post or a comment, MUST be edited out. Please do not create spam posts / comments. Content of this nature will be removed by the moderators. Violations of this rule will result in a temporary ban. Continued violations after a temporary ban will result in a permanent ban. No advertisements or promoting, especially not of illegal goods/service. A recent increase in spam of this sort is forcing us to permanently ban everyone involved in this. Keep this subreddit clean! In a subreddit of this size it's impossible to keep track of every post and every comment, therefore please report inappropriate content / comments, reposts and spam. Thank you very much for your help! We have a comment karma threshold one needs to exceed in order to post here. It's designed to keep out spam and ads from brand new accounts and it's working very well. The amount needed isn't high, but we will not disclose it if you ask as this somewhat defeats the purpose. So if you're new, get out there on Reddit and start taking part!"

        "content": "Some dads are wholesome and clean, others have a bit of raunch to them. It's not about the content or the age of the person hearing the joke... it's about how it's delivered. Bonus points for sticking to the classic stereotypes of being opportunistic and punny. That said, dad jokes are not mean and there are some rules. We think they rule, so check 'em out and be kind to each other."
