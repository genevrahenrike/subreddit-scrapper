She’s suddenly sprung it upon me that she’s been told she needs a tax number for Etsy to continue using it. I understand registering as a sole trader is the next step. But my concern is the self declaration in October. My mum has 2 big rooms in her house full of yarn, that she buys if and when, some she’s had 20 years or more. There’s no receipts for them as she’s never needed to collect them, and there’s zero record of sales outside of Etsy even though she sells on her fb page. I know she’s had since January to get into the habit but she hasn’t as she was unaware of these changes. Ignorance isn’t bliss here! So what mine field am I walking into come October with the self assessment when I have zero information other than an Etsy sales number?",

      "content_preview": "I am a 25 year old student, living in private accommodation with four other students. I need to transfer £450 rent to the lead tenant tomorrow, and I have £415 left in my overdraft. My credit cards are all at their limits from previous rent payments, car maintenance payments (I sold my car a few months ago) and general life expenses over the past two years. I worked until about June this year, but the job required a car, so I had to hand in my notice. I was okay for money at the time as I had the cash from the car sale, but I’ve struggled to find a job. I now have one that I’m starting in September, and I’ll also start receiving maintenance loan payments at the end of September. I’ve borrowed £50 from my dad, but he sent it to a bank account that’s in an unarranged overdraft, so I can’t transfer it to the account with some overdraft left. I am in about £12,000 of debt altogether, which is a combination of loans, credit cards and overdrafts. I contacted StepChange earlier this year, and they recommended asking my creditors to let me stop making payments for the time being. Some of my creditors have allowed this, others have not helped at all, which I understand they’re well within their rights to do. Up until leaving my old job, I was working as many shifts that they would give me, but I was bank staff and I would sometimes only work 1 or 2 hours a week, so my finances just haven’t improved over the past couple of years. I just don’t know what to do. My credit history is so poor now that I know I wouldn’t get a traditional loan. Is a payday loan my only option? I’m sorry if this doesn’t make much sense. I’ve been doing everything I possibly can to try to get enough money to pay rent, and it’s made me sick with anxiety. I just don’t know what to do.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I’m almost 31, live with my parents, and after 5 years of working I’ve only managed to save around £10K. My salary is about £38K before tax (roughly £2,200 in the bank each month). Honestly, I don’t know where the money has gone. It never really occurred to me that I should be saving (for a house, future, etc.) until recently, and now I’m kicking myself. If I’d started at 25, I probably could’ve bought somewhere by now. I had been living with my head buried under the sand. I’m also very aware I’m in a lucky position — I work from home, pay no bills thanks to my amazing parents, and have had a massive opportunity to save. But I’ve basically pissed it all away, and seeing friends buying houses or getting married just makes me feel worse. It feels like I’ve wasted a golden 5 years of saving potential. If I get to 35 and I’m still in this situation, it’ll be a real shame. Whilst I like living with parents, I feel that the time is coming for me to move out in the next few years in my own property. I want to change things by budgeting properly and tracking every single pound I spend so I can finally see where my money is going. Right now, I loosely give myself about £800/month for spending, but I always go over because I don’t track it. Clearly, the rest of my £2,200 salary is disappearing somewhere. I want to be saving at least £1200 montly, which means a personal 'spending' budget of £1000 (which is still crazily high seeing as It's just for me). I have no debt Car costs me £300 per month (excluding fuel) Phone bill & subscriptions cost around £50 per month Does anyone know of good pre-built Excel/Google Sheets templates to track spending? Or maybe an app that makes this easier? I feel like building my own spreadsheet from scratch is too big a barrier and will stop me from getting started. I did try to ‘budget’ a year ago, but clearly it has not worked well because I'm in the same position as last time. Seeing a future where I'm 35 with pathetic savings whislt living at home has genuinely scared me. Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "80% of this is a relationship issue; I'm only here for the 20% that isn't. I earn £48k comfortably aged 37. I have £192k in a private pension. Aiming for £250k by 40. My wife earns £44k+variable bonus of 10% to 20% based on performance. She has £5,400 in a cash Lifetime ISA. That's her pension. Sometimes she chucks some money in there purely to get the free 25% bonus. That is the only thing which motivates her to even do it. I've tried explaining the rules about no tax on pension contributions, but she isn't having it. I've tried to get her to convert her LISA to stocks and shares. She isn't willing to do that. I'm starting to seriously worry about retirement. Any conversation about pension devolves into, \"But I want to enjoy my money now. I might drop dead in my 50s.\" I often counter this with, \"But if you don't drop dead in your 50's, I'm the one who will have to pay to take care of you in your old age.\" She laughs this off, but it's really getting on my nerves. We've been married 12 years. No children. The extra money that should be going to her pension appears to be going to expensive makeups, designer fragrances and designer clothing/handbags. She also goes on girls' weekends around European cities very frequently (7-8 times per year.) If I were to divorce, would I be able to keep my pension entirely given her refusal to contribute to her own? Is there anything I can do to protect either my current pension or future pension contributions in the event of a divorce?",

      "content_preview": "Hi, At 3:30am on 31 August, my phone was stolen. Before I was able to remotely delete the device and change my passwords, the thieves gained access to my Lloyds Banking app. Lloyds, my phone company and the police are all aware of what happened. They: Increased my Lloyds overdraft by £3,000 and transferred it to my Algbra account. Made two successful outgoing payments from Algbra (£211.99 and £212.99). Attempted further transactions, which Algbra rejected. I managed to transfer the remaining £2,575.02 back to Lloyds before my Lloyds account was blocked. In addition, they sent £956 from Lloyds to my SumUp account with the payment reference “This is my persi”, but this have not appeared in my SumUp app (blocked by fraud protection?). Two further attempts to spend from that account failed, likely because the payment didn’t clear and the linked Lloyds card was already blocked. At present, I cannot account for £1,380 in total (£211.99 + £212.99 + £956). I have reported the incident to Lloyds, Algbra, and SumUp and provided my crime reference number. Lloyds cannot recover funds that have been sent to accounts that are in my name (even though the £956 hasn’t arrived at SumUp at all). Algbra and SumUp have only promised that a ‘specialist’ will review the request and a response may take 20 working days. What are the chances of getting my £1,380 back and who can I escalate this to?",

Since then she has signed herself up with an agency which gives her day-to-day jobs, like supply teaching, etc. The trouble is that her previous employer made a mistake as to the date when she concluded her work and Teachers Pension informed that they will be taking £230 a month worth of money from her from the beginning of August, since they ‘overpaid’. Mind you this happened some time in January. Since then, she’s sent them the correct information and begged them to correct their mistake and for 6 months they didn’t do anything. She sent a complaint to Teachers Pension in June (or July, I’m not sure), and still no response, they have since taken £230 for August and again for September. We don’t know what to do because she’s been battling them for 9 months now with no response. What should our next steps be?",

      "content_preview": "Today at work in London, I was informed that I’m being made redundant. I’ve been at the same company for 9 years and 11 months, which is a long time by UK standards, working as a web developer in an advertising agency, earning £60k. I’ve been given two options: Option 1 – Take a payout and leave immediately: £7,190 tax-free redundancy payment £5,000 for one month’s notice (taxed) £6,250 for 5 weeks of “extra” notice (taxed) £5,000 for sabbatical leave (taxed) Option 2 – Reduce my working days from 5 to 3, which reduces my salary from £60k to £36k. I plan to ask whether, if I choose Option 2 and am made redundant at a later date (say, after a few months), the original redundancy payment calculated today would still be honoured, with any additional redundancy paid at the reduced rate. From what I’ve read, the job market looks tough, not just in the UK but across Europe. Many people I know have been recently laid off, so I’m unsure how long it would take to find a new role in my sector with a salary comparable to my current one. I’m personally leaning towards Option 2, as it provides a stable income (even if lower) while I look for a new role without financial pressure. Also: Do the numbers in Option 1 look correct? And should the 5 weeks of “extra” notice really be taxed, or could it be treated as part of the redundancy payment? thanks",

      "content_preview": "Hello all, first time posting. My husband of 25 years passed away last week. Although I work full time, he looked after all our finances. We also never got round to sorting out a will, it was always on the 'to do' list but well, at 54 it was never a priority. We jointly own our house, some mortgage outstanding. He had a life insurance policy and a pension, no idea of the details though. What do I do now? I don't know where to start. We have two girls, 19 and 17, the older one at university, the younger doing A levels. Any advice gratefully received.",

It’s spread out over 6 different cards and it’s getting to the point that I cannot keep track of what is coming and what is going. What makes it even more annoying is there is nothing to show for all my debt. I don’t have anything I can look at and say that’s where my money went. I am 22, live at home and have minimal bills, £149 on car insurance, £52 on my phone, £17 on Spotify. I might have a couple more monthly outgoings but honestly I do not know. I bring in £220 a week on average and get paid weekly which makes my money disappear even faster, as soon as it hits my account it’s just gone. I don’t know where to begin with getting my debt down, how to budget, I don’t even know what debts have interest. I’ve tried looking but I feel so stupid I can’t even work it out. Any help would be appreciated.",

Second, how is this even possible. My phone was unlocked but the banking apps use face ID as well as Apple pay. I am completely lost for words! I can't even erase my phone as my password to \"find my iphone\" does not let me in. Either I have forgotten or my password has been changed.

I am unable to erase the phone because guess how the reset a password....... yes they send a text message.

They're fuming. I wondered if a few of you had received similar letters and felt short changed? One of my other neighbours knows banking - and shared the counter argument. For every £1 the Customer has in an overdraft (used or not), the bank has to hold money as deposit to cover it as part of their licence, sometimes up to £8. So it can cost them a lot of money to leave your overdraft limit in place if you don’t use it often and even sometimes forgot you had. Hopefully insightful or helpful for someone - I certainly found it interesting.",

      "content_preview": "Hello all, In England. So my father is in palliative care and has been for some weeks. I have siblings and extended family but from da one no one else had any interest in maintaining his affairs so I have, single handedly. We undertsand now I has always had inconsistencies in his brain formation, communication and social relational issues and likely learning disabilities. He is not leaving behind much yet his desire was always to leave 'something' to his three kids and my heart desire is to fulfill this for him and let him know with certainty that it will be done. He has a defined benefit pension worth over £30k / under £60k. He did not get his affairs into order before becoming paralysed, unable to speak and blind. I gave up with the processss weeks ago since so much is going on emotionally but I finally received notification from court of protection on Friday last week that I have been appointed deputy of his financial affairs, yet to receive the paperwork in the post. His pension provider EPA Towers Watson (Sainsburys) have been incredibly slow and haven't even completed the process of onboarding the Interim Order I sent them first week of May this year so say they can't discuss details with me. I called again today and was told the same thing. I have online access to my dad's account. There are two options: small tax free lump sum and monthly payments. And transfer out to another pension provider at which point it would become contributions type (I think I saw that he could transfer the full amount out to his bank account minus tax also). Through my own research back in February it appeared that if he passed, not having a spouse or dependants they would not pay out. My aim would be to transfer out the full amount of dad's entitlement £30k+ to his estate but this would require FCA advisor and £4k+ fee for this advice as well as a good few more days to get this advice so the Pprovider would release the money.. my dad has done so well to make it to this point he really has defied all odds but time he doesn't have. The other option was to request the tax lump sum without the delay of the FA, which would pay for my dad's burial and service. My issue is the Pprovider seems to be defensive and even today the receptionist was really weird saying it (the decision) would go before the trustees.. If I requested the transfer before my pops passes will they still have to pay out the money, whichever of the two we go with in the end? Is there any advice anyone could give me? I'll also be arranging funeral and all myself. Much appreciated.",

I have a mortgage with my partner, and we split the bills equally, which comes to about £750 a month for me. I also have other unavoidable outgoings, coming to about £100 pm. My question is - what do I do? How do I navigate this situation? I will of course be looking for new jobs straight away, but the job market isn't great in the Tech industry ATM. I'm aware of things like Universal Credit, which I will be applying for as soon as I know the situation I am in. I will be cutting back on expenses as much as possible. What else can I do to weather the approaching storm? Thanks in advance. *Edit - spelling",

Over the past few months, I’ve spent a lot of time worrying that I’ve “adulted” too much or too quickly. I have struggled a bit getting used to all the outgoings on my own.  Mortgage, rent, bills & student loan repayments come to approx. 55% of my take home salary.  I also put away 10% into an ISA.  I live in London so the remaining amount gets eaten up fairly quickly. My emergency savings are significantly lower than what I feel comfortable with, let alone trying to save for the future.  Some months I don’t save anything at all. I also have some big ticket expenses coming up (£3.5k visa costs, plus two international weddings). I know that I am not on the bread line by any means and am fortunate enough to have been able to save a small deposit buy my place. However, I’m constantly chasing my tail financially, worried that living costs are going to take an increasingly greater proportion of my salary and it’s only going to get harder. If anything goes wrong, it’s really all on me, I don’t have a partner or family over here to rely on. More often than not, I’ve been waking up worried at the thought of whether this feeling will ever go away, or if it just gets worse.",

I've been saving religiously for the past 3 years, living in a flatshare that's honestly pretty grim, eating beans on toast more than I care to admit, and generally being careful with every penny. Finally hit £25k in my LISA + savings from some Stake sportsbets I won which I thought would be decent for a deposit. Started looking at houses around Manchester/surrounding areas thinking I could get something reasonable for £180-200k. Went to view a 2-bed terrace last weekend that was listed at £185k - looked like it had only been bought once or twice since it was built but honestly felt like a time capsule from the 80s. Tiny garden, weird layout, and the boiler made some concerning noises during the viewing. Estate agent casually mentioned they already had 3 offers over asking price and expected it to go for at least £200k+. For a house that the current owners have barely lived in but still needs probably £15k of work just to make it modern. I'm earning £35k which isn't amazing but isn't terrible either, yet I'm being priced out of buying anything that isn't either a project or in a rough area. My mates who bought houses 2-3 years ago keep saying \"just keep saving\" but at this rate properties that have barely changed hands are going for mental money. Starting to wonder if I should just accept renting forever and use the money I've got saved to actually enjoy life a bit. Feels mad that having £25k put aside isn't enough for houses that previous owners clearly didn't even settle into properly.",

Looking at Tesco Bank, for example, I could borrow the £4000 at 9.8%, however, if I borrow £5000, it will only be at 6.9%.  Why should I not just borrow £5000 and repay £1000 on day 1?  Locking in the lower interest rate but at a lower monthly cost? The theory extends to more money, for example, £7500 at 5.8% then paying back £3500 etc. Is there any negatives, aside from self dicipline to pay back that extra £1000 and eligability?",

My drawdown fund is going to last me (and the missus) for another 30 years - shifting the fund into bonds or gilts seems like madness?  Who cares if there's a sudden horrible recession in 5 years, 1 month before I retire?  It's a drawdown?  I'll only be taking £1600 a month out (or something) anyway and just won't take the 25% tax free for a few years?  So why not keep it in the 'high risk' stocks and shares - like - forever?

A combination of a house move, I was made redundant almost immediately after moving, car bills and just general rotten luck over the last year or so. It breaks down as; Lloyds 0% - £5,634.01 NatWest 0% - £4,366.59 HSBC 0% - £5,184.63 We both work full time. He is on £34K and I am on £29K. We’ve reduced our outgoings as much as possible, after our non essential expenses we’re left with £1200 a month. Our plan going forwards is to pay the minimum on two cards, then put the maximum on one until it’s cleared. Rinse and repeat for the other two. This should take us 14/15 months, provided we don’t have any other set backs. What I’m asking is, is there any way I can bring this down quicker that I’ve missed, or any other advice? Our expenses are as cut back as we can get them, I’m selling bits and pieces on Vinted to make some extra money. Apart from taking on a second/weekend job, or resorting to straight up begging 😂",

      "content_preview": "Me (30F) and my brother (35M) inherited a holiday rental house 50/50 from our dad. It’s a 4-bedroom place worth around £850k in a lovely location for holiday-goers, and it’s always fully booked over summer and during the holiday seasons. It’s quite expensive to run so we make some money from it (a couple thousand a year each) but not a lot.  We’re sentimentally attached to it. My brother now wants to move into the house with his wife and start a family in a couple of years. Plus, he and his wife want to do extensive renovations by us taking out a shared £180k mortgage. The ideal would be to split this 50/50 rather than diluting my share, therefore all renovations decisions will be equally balanced. I don’t want to dilute my share in the house. I have a few concerns. First - I believe as a 50% owner of the property I should be paid ordinary rental on my half as if he were a tenant, below market rate (£2500pm would be typical of the area, so I would suggest around £1000pm). However, he thinks he should only pay me a little more than what we get in holiday rent, he suggested £400pm. Second, I’m worried that taking on the £90k mortgage will negatively impact my ability to get a mortgage in future. He’s hoping we can pay off the total in 10 years but he only earns around £70k and his wife works part time at close to minimum wage, so I don’t see how that’s possible. Third, my friend told me it seems weird I’m paying to renovate a house that I won’t get to have any enjoyment of. My brother says the renovations will increase the house’s value 1.5x so it’s a good investment for me. But if we don’t sell the house and he pays me little rent, I don’t much benefit. Fourth, my brother doesn’t earn an amazing salary (I think £70k ish) and his wife doesn’t earn much. I’m concerned that this massive financial burden is going to prove too much for them, and if they realise they don’t like living there (as it’s not a great permanent area for a young working couple) they won’t be able to afford to move to a new home without us being forced to sell the place. I could never afford to buy them out, being single and on a modest salary myself (£40k ish). Finally, my brother is my best friend. I’m very scared that us becoming so financially entangled is going to ruin our relationship. But I also worry that I’m being taken advantage of. I don’t quite see if it’s fair for him to live in a lovely 4-bedroom house for such little rent. It means I will never have the option of living there, which I have wondered about for my future, so at least decent rent feels like fair compensation. I’d like to hear from other people who’ve made similar financial arrangements with close family and friends, and how they managed it. How do you balance being a good friend or sibling while looking after your own best interests? Thank you 🙏",

      "content_preview": "I bought a house during covid which i sold last year, after having it for just 3.5 years. My experience buying it wasnt a great one, with the estate agents being shady and telling a lot of lies (as estate agents do) Since selling the house, the mortgage broker from the same estate agent has called me and my wife a few times, the latest being in March and July this year. I made requests under GDPR's right to be forgotten in December 2021 and again in November 2023, both of which they refused to do because they need to keep detailed records of transactions for 6 years. However, this still didn't stop them from calling us to try and get us to use their mortgage broker to renew a mortgage on a house that we no longer own, even though they were told to stop during both GDPR requests and again, each time they called. I sent them another GDPR request in July and got the same response about them needing to keep my data. I meant to go to the ICO and take it further but never got round to it. Today I got a second email from the estate agents reiterating they need to keep my data for 6 years, but they now have investigated and found that we were contacted despite making it clear we didnt want to be, offering me £200 compensation, which in order to claim I would need to sign a form saying \"I accept the offer of £200 in full and final settlement of my complaint\" Initially i thought \"Nice, £200\", but now im starting to think \"Wait a minute, why are they trying to throw £200 at me if I sign a thing saying everything is settled\" - could this be something that I could get a lot more money out of them over if i was to take it further? (or am i just being greedy and watching too many american TV shows) I have nothing but bad blood for this estate agent, and would love nothing more than to stick it to them for harassing me and my wife. Wouldn't complain about getting a few quid out of it either.",

      "content_preview": "I’m 17 and leaving care in a couple months. I went to Halifax yesterday with my social worker and was told there with 2 savings accounts for me with my dad and uncle as controlling adults. I was told to come back the next day to do the paperwork and remove them as controlling adults (since I’m over 16 and neither of them have any legal responsibility over me). I went back today alone and the person I saw was very patronising towards me and repeatedly showed me his screen saying there weren’t any accounts in my name and he couldn’t share details of the one that was as those 2 were also on there (even though the man yesterday told me everything I wanted to know). I heard that I can close the accounts myself without their permission but not sure if it’s true. I don’t want to go back today as I don’t want to see that man again. I wasn’t even told they had separate accounts for me. When I asked my mum, she repeatedly said she didn’t know and that my dad said there weren’t any. The only way I found out was from a form I submitted to find lost accounts. If it helps my case, I also have a restraining order against him. Any advice or suggestions would be great. UPDATE: I went back a couple hours later to try to explain the situation to a different manager and to put the complaint in. Instead, I got stuck with the same smug guy and his attitude. When I said the complaint was about him and that it wasn’t about the situation but instead how he talked to me/acted, he said “well I’m not going to sit here and listen to a complaint about myself” and got up and left. I had to google the info on how to report him, which I’m happy to say I’ve now done. I’ll go to a different branch sometime over the weekend and hopefully talk to a much more professional and respectful manager. Thank you to everyone who has reached out to help me, not to be cringe but you guys are the only people who I feel have actually supported me. I just moved for the second time over the last 2 months and I’m in another “supported accommodation” placement which is ironic as there’s a real lack of support and isolating feeling here. Thank you to those people who have messaged me privately to help.",

If you earn above £200K a year, your £60K personal tax-free pension contribution alliance starts to taper down with every pound you earn until it reaches a floor of £10K a year. Anything above that £10K a year gets taxed at ~47%. The adjusted income and threshold income calculations include salary sacrifice, employer contributions and any other offsets that would normally reduce your income. On paper, it looks like there is no way to get the £60K allowance back, apart from allowance carry over from the last 3 years. Is that correct? Is there nothing out there to avoid this penalty?",

      "content_preview": "Long story short, started a new job 6 months ago and after all monthly outgoings I have on average £2000 spare. I live a modest lifestyle and have no partner/dependents. Bar £90k left on a mortgage and £120 a month for a motorcycle PCP deal I have no debts. Currently putting the money into a 4% savings account where I currently have around £67k. Completely financially illiterate at age 36 I’m ashamed to say and I have an unhealthy relationship with not spending money or taking financial risk due to childhood poverty issues so need advice on how best to approach making this £2k work for me as it is probably just treading water in my savings account. What avenues would you suggest I look into  if you were in my position? Thanks! EDIT: I am an employee, not self employed. No side hustles. Circa £60k a year but can be more dependent on overtime/incentives. Trained and worked as a car mechanic so this salary is completely alien to me! Thanks. EDIT EDIT: Thank you for all your replies. Given me things to think about and look into after proper consultation obviously!",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I’m looking for some advice about pensions and saving for the future. I started working for the NHS in February 2014 but (stupidly) opted out of the pension early on. I’ve been paying back into it since 2019. At the moment, I’m working part-time , just two night shifts a week due to childcare responsibilities. I’m a single mum with no support in the UK. We went through a very difficult period that included homelessness and several court hearings. Because of that, I currently have no savings. We rent and have no assets. The situation is tight financially, and unfortunately, my child’s dad does not pay any child maintenance, so I can’t rely on that either. I’m now 40 and really anxious about the future, mostly for my child. I’d like to start building some financial security, not just for myself but to give her a better future. Everything feels so expensive..  education , dental care .. and braces in the future!!! , and just life in general. I’m considering the following and would appreciate any advice: Should I try to pay a bit more into my NHS pension, even while working part time? Or would it be better to start a private pension (like a SIPP)? If something were to happen to me, would my child benefit from either of these pensions? Should I focus on building emergency savings first before worrying about pensions? I'd like to go back to full time work in the future (hopefully in a 9–5 nursing role) or when child is older and can stay alone at home after school but right now that's not a possibility. I know I’ve started late, but I’m trying to do the best I can now with what I have. Thanks so much to anyone who takes the time to read and respond.",

      "content_preview": "Posting on behalf of my mother (60F). About 2 years ago, her own mother (my grandmother) passed away and left her an assisted living flat in South East London. It was originally bought ~8 years ago for around £150k. The idea was that it would be a form of recompense for over a decade of unpaid caring, but instead it’s become a huge financial burden and is slowly bankrupting my mother. The situation: Service charge : £555/month to Firstport (building operator). No ability to opt out, no reduction even if the property is vacant, have already tried pushing for this. Council tax : £183/month. Council are threatening to double this as the property has been vacant for >2 years. My mum works, but the flat’s costs swallow her entire income. She’s even had to take out loans to keep afloat. Trying to sell, but can't: We’ve been trying to sell for 2 years with no success. Originally purchased for £150k, the flat is currently listed at £100k, though she’d accept £90k at this point. The big issue is that a much nicer assisted living development opened nearby around the same time we listed, so there’s little to no demand for this one. The letting estate agent has told us it's not a price problem, more a demand problem. Other flats in the building are listed and are not selling. We had one verbal offer that flaked and nothing since. Other issues: We tried to rent it out (even had a prospective tenant lined up), but Firstport told us that renting is not permitted under the lease - so this isn't a viable workaround either. Question: What options do we have here? The service charge is draining my mum dry, she can’t afford to keep paying it, and selling feels impossible. Firstport are not interested in compromising and don't respond to emails. Are there any workarounds, legal routes, or organisations that can help in situations like this? Any advice would be hugely appreciated.",

He seems to believe that Pension Credit is better. He started claiming he would get free dental, free opticians, housing benefit etc. For reference, I'm purely on the state pension, but I've made my full national insurance contributions. I don't have any private or public sector pension. Am I actually going to be in a worse position than my brother when I retire? Do we get the same pension, but he also gets a whole load of other free stuff?",

I'm 33, I messed around with \"investing\" a few years ago and opened an ISA with Hargreaves lansdown which I no longer pay any money in to. The value today is £3k I also bought some bitcoin which is valued at around £1.2k. Since last year/early this year I've tried to get more serious with my money. I pay into the NHS pension and also opened a SIPP with vanguard and pay £150/month into the global all cap. I pay £100-£150 month into a trading 212 ISA. Would it be worth selling my holdings with HL or moving it to Trading 212? Shall I keep the bitcoin or sell? I did get a financial advisor last year but I ended up taking out an overpriced product which I've cancelled but can't get my money back (£900) until I'm retirement age 🙃 Any advice would be appreciated.

I know the following isn’t a simple question to answer, but if you were in my position, would you transfer into the LGPS to guarantee the defined benefit?

She comes from a very wealthy family through property investments and has told me very blasé about giving hundreds of pounds worth of gifts to her kid’s teachers over the year, taking friends on expensive holidays and covering everyone’s costs, giving away her old cars worth thousands to colleagues when she upgrades etc. Just a very different lifestyle to my lower middle class background where I’ve had nice things but always had to be careful with balancing budgets. I’ve got some debts from earlier in life where family have helped me out and from some poor decisions, nothing too pressing but totals up to several thousand that I’m slowly paying back and will take me a long time and I’m barely saving anything. She’s alluded several times to offering to gift me a large part of the money, if not all of it, just to be generous and help me out. I’ve helped her through some really tough emotional and MH times so in her mind she’s just being a generous friend but it seems like such an alien concept to me to just gift so much money informally. I’ve kept batting away the idea as my pride hates the idea of taking the charity from her but with higher cost of living pressures it feels harder to just dismiss it. If I did accept it, would there be official ramifications like being taxed on receiving a lot of money as a gift and if we ever fell out later could she claim it back legally? I have no experience with individuals sharing so much money outside of inheritances or weddings.",

      "content_preview": "Hi, apologies if this isn't the right place but I can't find an answer to this anywhere and I can't get through to a real person using the Bank's live chat. I just got a new 0% balance transfer card to move CC debt to and the transfer completed yesterday (1st September). I transferred the full balance from one of my cards, but my usual direct debit is due to come off in 2 days (on the 4th), which was scheduled back on my statement date (10th August). Does anyone know what happens in this scenario? Would the DD complete and I'd end up with credit on my old account - in which case would I have to spend on the card, or could I request the funds be released back into my current account? Should I just attempt to cancel the direct debit from my current account and hope it doesn't get taken or is it too close to the scheduled date? If it goes through and I can get the money back that's fine but I'd want to avoid having to spend with the card - I'm hoping to close the account ASAP and I'd obviously rather use the cash to pay down the balance on the new card!",

      "content_preview": "My mother passed away. She was 73. When going threw her things I found a life insurance policy - naming myself on it and her private bt pension- also naming myself. Her will stated that im the only sole recipient even tho half the things named on it were never found amongst her belongings. When I contacted both companies they both said thanks for letting us know. That's it. Surely that can't be right and there should be something to come from them.",
