I have roughly £740 left to pay them back until the whole year would’ve been paid.I managed to get £1.5k back from selling my car. I used this money to pay off my entire PayPal credit bill, in hindsight I regret this because I could’ve used it smarter for other priority bills. My course fee’s are due for this semester and I have no money left. I have approached various Individuals in my neighbourhood about securing a temporary loan which I have to pay back , just to scrounge enough money to pay my courseThanks for the feedback and I have made some steps in the right directionEDIT: Here is the ORIGINAL POST:https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/s/xwkIC32KiQ",

I keep it as low as possible without denying myself things I enjoy but for a family of 3 (1 adult, 2 school-age kids) it is about £150 per week (£50 per person per week) and I really cannot get it lower than this. I’m quite happy with it at this level but would love to get it even lower. I was thinking about driving an hour to my nearest Costco to help.What are all you savvy folks doing out there to keep your food spending low? What is your per person per week spend? Is £50 per person per week a good level or do I have some opportunity to get this lower.",

      "content_preview": "In a pickle! 49yrs old, and work as a IT contractor, very well paid when in contract, but currently been out of work for 5 months and not due to start a new contract until the end of the month.New contract is £750p/d (£170k pa, based on 46 weeks), take home circa 8 / 8.5k pm,, but won't get paid until end of next month (Oct).I know, I am in an incredibly lucky position, in-terms of my pay. I never loose sight of that and very thankful its how it panned out for me. I had until, 5 months ago set up a £200 standing order to the local food bank as well as £150 to the teenage cancer trust, as part of my Christian upbringing. Now I do roughly 10hrs a week volunteering at the foodbank, to get me out the house and feel busy whilst I am off work.I just completed a house extension, it went massively over budget, that ate all savings and some. That with the unforeseen lay off, no pay for 5 months, I have got myself into a hole with paying off builder's bills after builder's bills and daily living (3 kids, wife). Thankfully all building work now finished and paid.Debit as is:18k Amex card - overdue, with collection company, need full payment or a payment plan. Crazy APR!10k Santander card - overdue, minimum payment £350 pm.22k Santander loan - 550 p/m - 1 month overdue65k mortgage - 530 p/m - 11ys left - 15% LTV. (Current rate 1.4%, 8 months left of the deal)50k car pcp - 700 p/m, 3yrs left, 40k left on it.20k HMRC - ltd company corporation tax bill (from 2 year's ago tax year)Sky £200 in arrears - £90 pm - 14months left of contract.Mobile £200 in arrears - circa 150 p/m (5 family mobiles)Gas / Elec - 1 month in arrears - circa 350 p/mTotal Unsecured Debt: 70k (excluding mortgage)Total Debit: 130k (including mortgage, excluding pcp)Ideally, I would like to borrow more on my mortgage, pay off the above and start again. Have spoken to my existing lender, who have flatly said they don't touch contractors for extra borrowing (I was an FTE, when I took it out).With an extra borrowing of 100k, to bring total mortgage to 165k and circa 1.5 / 1.75k pm over 11yrs. Which is manageable and around 20 / 25% of my take home.  Less, if I extend the length of the loan. Also, going to strip right back on direct debits (Sky, subscriptions etc), and actually take note of spending, whereas before I never took any notice.However, my credit is shot to pieces and being a contractor, some lenders won't touch me anyway. Spoken to a local broker, who said no one will tough ne until I start work again, but tbh, I don't even know if anyone would now!!I'm 49, and struggling to keep the wolves from the door, until I start work again. Its like bloody busses, with being offered 3 new jobs in the space of a week.As of now I have, roughly £300 left in my account, to last until end of next month. (Taken from my daughters savings account, and cleaned out) - felt sick, physically sick having to do that.....To see me over to next month, do I take out a 3/5k bad credit loan / card, Payday loan? What do I do?Never, ever, been in this position and at a loss as to what to do... Got to the point, I am \"stealing\" from my daughters account....",

      "content_preview": "80% of this is a relationship issue; I'm only here for the 20% that isn't.I earn £48k comfortably aged 37. I have £192k in a private pension. Aiming for £250k by 40.My wife earns £44k+variable bonus of 10% to 20% based on performance. She has £5,400 in a cash Lifetime ISA. That's her pension.Sometimes she chucks some money in there purely to get the free 25% bonus. That is the only thing which motivates her to even do it. I've tried explaining the rules about no tax on pension contributions, but she isn't having it. I've tried to get her to convert her LISA to stocks and shares. She isn't willing to do that.I'm starting to seriously worry about retirement. Any conversation about pension devolves into, \"But I want to enjoy my money now. I might drop dead in my 50s.\"I often counter this with, \"But if you don't drop dead in your 50's, I'm the one who will have to pay to take care of you in your old age.\"She laughs this off, but it's really getting on my nerves.We've been married 12 years. No children.The extra money that should be going to her pension appears to be going to expensive makeups, designer fragrances and designer clothing/handbags. She also goes on girls' weekends around European cities very frequently (7-8 times per year.)If I were to divorce, would I be able to keep my pension entirely given her refusal to contribute to her own?Is there anything I can do to protect either my current pension or future pension contributions in the event of a divorce?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all,I’m almost 31, live with my parents, and after 5 years of working I’ve only managed to save around £10K. My salary is about £38K before tax (roughly £2,200 in the bank each month).Honestly, I don’t know where the money has gone. It never really occurred to me that I should be saving (for a house, future, etc.) until recently, and now I’m kicking myself. If I’d started at 25, I probably could’ve bought somewhere by now. I had been living with my head buried under the sand.I’m also very aware I’m in a lucky position — I work from home, pay no bills thanks to my amazing parents, and have had a massive opportunity to save. But I’ve basically pissed it all away, and seeing friends buying houses or getting married just makes me feel worse. It feels like I’ve wasted a golden 5 years of saving potential. If I get to 35 and I’m still in this situation, it’ll be a real shame. Whilst I like living with parents, I feel that the time is coming for me to move out in the next few years in my own property.I want to change things by budgeting properly and trackingevery single poundI spend so I can finally see where my money is going. Right now, I loosely give myself about £800/month for spending, but I always go over because I don’t track it. Clearly, the rest of my £2,200 salary is disappearing somewhere.I want to be saving at least £1200 montly, which means a personal 'spending' budget of £1000 (which is still crazily high seeing as It's just for me).I have no debtCar costs me £300 per month (excluding fuel)Phone bill & subscriptions cost around £50 per monthDoes anyone know of good pre-built Excel/Google Sheets templates to track spending? Or maybe an app that makes this easier? I feel like building my own spreadsheet from scratch is too big a barrier and will stop me from getting started.I did try to ‘budget’ a year ago, but clearly it has not worked well because I'm in the same position as last time. Seeing a future where I'm 35 with pathetic savings whislt living at home has genuinely scared me.Thanks in advance!",

I need to transfer £450 rent to the lead tenant tomorrow, and I have £415 left in my overdraft. My credit cards are all at their limits from previous rent payments, car maintenance payments (I sold my car a few months ago) and general life expenses over the past two years. I worked until about June this year, but the job required a car, so I had to hand in my notice. I was okay for money at the time as I had the cash from the car sale, but I’ve struggled to find a job. I now have one that I’m starting in September, and I’ll also start receiving maintenance loan payments at the end of September. I’ve borrowed £50 from my dad, but he sent it to a bank account that’s in an unarranged overdraft, so I can’t transfer it to the account with some overdraft left. I am in about £12,000 of debt altogether, which is a combination of loans, credit cards and overdrafts. I contacted StepChange earlier this year, and they recommended asking my creditors to let me stop making payments for the time being. Some of my creditors have allowed this, others have not helped at all, which I understand they’re well within their rights to do. Up until leaving my old job, I was working as many shifts that they would give me, but I was bank staff and I would sometimes only work 1 or 2 hours a week, so my finances just haven’t improved over the past couple of years. I just don’t know what to do. My credit history is so poor now that I know I wouldn’t get a traditional loan. Is a payday loan my only option? I’m sorry if this doesn’t make much sense. I’ve been doing everything I possibly can to try to get enough money to pay rent, and it’s made me sick with anxiety. I just don’t know what to do.",

A combination of a house move, I was made redundant almost immediately after moving, car bills and just general rotten luck over the last year or so.It breaks down as; Lloyds 0% - £5,634.01 NatWest 0% - £4,366.59 HSBC 0% - £5,184.63We both work full time. He is on £34K and I am on £29K. We’ve reduced our outgoings as much as possible, after our non essential expenses we’re left with £1200 a month. Our plan going forwards is to pay the minimum on two cards, then put the maximum on one until it’s cleared. Rinse and repeat for the other two. This should take us 14/15 months, provided we don’t have any other set backs.What I’m asking is, is there any way I can bring this down quicker that I’ve missed, or any other advice? Our expenses are as cut back as we can get them, I’m selling bits and pieces on Vinted to make some extra money. Apart from taking on a second/weekend job, or resorting to straight up begging 😂",

This was in bonds for a few years winning on average around £2,000 a year, but a run of bad luck in 2023 meant I moved £40,000 into a trading 212 cash ISA, and left £13000 in bonds.I only work part time due to childcare restrictions, and I'm in the 20% taxpayer bracket.  With rates dropping every few months in my cash ISA and no doubt dropping again soon, I didn't know whether moving my money into the Chase account for a year at 4.75% was worth doing.I also wanted to add I'm also putting my money into two other savings accounts each month, £400 into a club Lloyds at 6.15% and £300 into Zopa at 7.05%.I have no interest in S&S or any form of investment so they're not an option.I have an emergency fund, 4k debt being paid off without issue each month, and yea I just want to maximise my money working for me, more than it is already if that's possible.Thanks, Pel",

      "content_preview": "Apologies in advance for the long post. (I am a overthinker as soon will become evident!)Me and my partner have been planning to move when our current fixed mortgage term runs out (September 2027), ideally looking for a larger house than we have currently. For background our current house cost 90k in 2021.I earn 33k a year, and he makes 25.5k. (Monthly take home figures 2165 and 1800 respectively)The plan was to put it on the market around Feb 2027, at which point we would have approx 30k savings. I would expect about 20k equity from our current house. I honestly think we may struggle to sell if for 90k (in hindsight we overpaid) but even selling for 85k this would leave us with around 20k equity. With this we could put down a 25-30k deposit on a house somewhere around the 220k mark.However, a spanner has been thrown in the works which is my job is no longer as secure as it was. It is a long story, and nothing is definite yet, however I feel I am probably safe until around June 2027. (We are being TUPED over in June 2026 to a company famous for offshoring)For other long and complicated reasons, I truly can't see myself getting another job as well paid as the one I currently have. Looking on the job sites there is just nothing comparable, most of the remote jobs now seem to be at least hybrid, and I do not drive, We do not live in an area with many high paying jobs.So now this leaves us with 3 options.Try and 'pip in' moving before my possible redundancy. I think this would involve putting our house on the market around December 1st 2026 (do houses even sell over Christmas?) We can't really do any earlier than this as we won't have the savings.By December 1st 2026 we would probably have around 27k in savings, which with the 20ish equity from the current house should mean we are able to move (although not with much left to furnish the place etc) The hope is to 'pip in' the move before I lose my job. If we are in the new house and I lose my job the plan is to use money left over from the equity and my partners wage to cover the bills until I start a new job on around 25k. I don't anticipate it taking me to long to get a job at this pay, but maybe I am being optimistic there.We WOULD be able to cover the bills with both of us on 25k. However the worry with this obviously is the process over running and me losing my job at some point in the process, possibly after exchange, and everything falling apart. I think an early repayment charge of around 2k would also apply in this scenario.Option 3 - In 2027 remortgage for 2 years and see where we stand in 2029. By 2029 savings for a deposit should not be an issue at all, however I worry by waiting we are pricing ourselves out of the market. I cannot see our wages going up any faster than house prices do, and I worry even with a larger deposit, we will get a house with less real value than if we were to move in 2027. In this scenario we will be limited by what the bank will lend us rather than deposit money, and what they will lend us won't stretch as far by then.I suppose we could go onto a SVR after our term ends, but again, I am unsure about my job. We could end up paying a high rate for months and months in limbo before I find anything out.What also makes it tricker is that the new area we want to move to will actually increase our job opportunities. So it really does seem sensible to try and get over there ASAP to me, but I am just so unsure about the whole thing. However I also do think our current boiler is on its last legs, so if that goes and we need a new one, it may set this whole thing backwards a few months anyway.Thankyou if you took the time to read. Also for context we are 25 and 27.",

He had a life insurance policy and a pension, no idea of the details though.What do I do now? I don't know where to start. We have two girls, 19 and 17, the older one at university, the younger doing A levels.Any advice gratefully received.",

      "content_preview": "Hello and Good Morning,I have recently started an online electronics business. I mainly sell on ebay however since I am not of age to sell on there I use my parents  account. I stared a few months ago and regularly do about £1,500-£3000 in revenue with £750-£1500 being profit per month(pre tax). I ideally want to move away from my current ebay account since my profits will be taxed at 40% which isn’t ideal and doesn’t make this side hustle worth my time. The problem is that I do not have a national insurance or a UTR number. Despite numerous forms and several hours on call with HMRC they don’t know what to do . After 2 weeks from sending a form they reply with “you filled out the wrong form, try call hmrc”. Does anybody know how to get a Ni or utr number or is there a way I can avoid all of this drama and keep 100% of my profits. I’ve done some research into a limited company in my parents name and they can pay be an hourly wage(which I will manipulate accordingly so there is little profit for the company and maximum wage for me) but that requires running a payroll each week and more complex forms. Any help/guidance you be greatly appreciated. Thanks",

      "content_preview": "Been lurking here for ages but finally need to get some perspective.I've been saving religiously for the past 3 years, living in a flatshare that's honestly pretty grim, eating beans on toast more than I care to admit, and generally being careful with every penny. Finally hit £25k in my LISA + savings from some Stake sportsbets I won which I thought would be decent for a deposit.Started looking at houses around Manchester/surrounding areas thinking I could get something reasonable for £180-200k. Went to view a 2-bed terrace last weekend that was listed at £185k - looked like it had only been bought once or twice since it was built but honestly felt like a time capsule from the 80s. Tiny garden, weird layout, and the boiler made some concerning noises during the viewing.Estate agent casually mentioned they already had 3 offers over asking price and expected it to go for at least £200k+. For a house that the current owners have barely lived in but still needs probably £15k of work just to make it modern.I'm earning £35k which isn't amazing but isn't terrible either, yet I'm being priced out of buying anything that isn't either a project or in a rough area. My mates who bought houses 2-3 years ago keep saying \"just keep saving\" but at this rate properties that have barely changed hands are going for mental money.Starting to wonder if I should just accept renting forever and use the money I've got saved to actually enjoy life a bit. Feels mad that having £25k put aside isn't enough for houses that previous owners clearly didn't even settle into properly.",

I’m a 27 year old male, I live with my sister and niece, we both pay for bills and house and I pay general upkeep and shopping but we are totally separate on finances (for example, she drives and I don’t etc) . I have around -£1600 in my amount due to a stupid overdraft during Covid and a previous abusive relationship, my family know of the overdraft, but not how much. Around 2 months ago I was sacked from work , in my opinion wrongly but it was a rushed process 2 weeks before my 2 year anniversary there and I had no rights until 2 years. I’m wait to start work, I have my induction next week, it is weekly pay but I’m waiting on a DBS check so still unsure of actual start date. I’ve already left my sister over £500 down this month from not paying anything really and I currently have about 60 in my account (-£1540) with the overdraft. What can I do? I’ve looked on roamer apps for daily free lance work and I have overdraft charges on my account frozen until mid October, with the agreement with my bank of things should improve by then ( I still hope). I’m just getting abit desperate, I struggle with mental health but have always worked really, I have had this overdraft since about 2019 and I can never seem to pay it off because I always very much lived month to month and always ended up either not being able to spare the money, or just put off by the shear amount.I appreciate any advice and time, I know there’s people better and worse off and hopefully I’ve detailed enough",

      "content_preview": "I’m 17 and leaving care in a couple months. I went to Halifax yesterday with my social worker and was told there with 2 savings accounts for me with my dad and uncle as controlling adults. I was told to come back the next day to do the paperwork and remove them as controlling adults (since I’m over 16 and neither of them have any legal responsibility over me). I went back today alone and the person I saw was very patronising towards me and repeatedly showed me his screen saying there weren’t any accounts in my name and he couldn’t share details of the one that was as those 2 were also on there (even though the man yesterday told me everything I wanted to know).I heard that I can close the accounts myself without their permission but not sure if it’s true. I don’t want to go back today as I don’t want to see that man again. I wasn’t even told they had separate accounts for me. When I asked my mum, she repeatedly said she didn’t know and that my dad said there weren’t any. The only way I found out was from a form I submitted to find lost accounts. If it helps my case, I also have a restraining order against him.Any advice or suggestions would be great.UPDATE: I went back a couple hours later to try to explain the situation to a different manager and to put the complaint in. Instead, I got stuck with the same smug guy and his attitude. When I said the complaint was about him and that it wasn’t about the situation but instead how he talked to me/acted, he said “well I’m not going to sit here and listen to a complaint about myself” and got up and left. I had to google the info on how to report him, which I’m happy to say I’ve now done. I’ll go to a different branch sometime over the weekend and hopefully talk to a much more professional and respectful manager.Thank you to everyone who has reached out to help me, not to be cringe but you guys are the only people who I feel have actually supported me. I just moved for the second time over the last 2 months and I’m in another “supported accommodation” placement which is ironic as there’s a real lack of support and isolating feeling here. Thank you to those people who have messaged me privately to help.",

      "content_preview": "Me (30F) and my brother (35M) inherited a holiday rental house 50/50 from our dad. It’s a 4-bedroom place worth around £850k in a lovely location for holiday-goers, and it’s always fully booked over summer and during the holiday seasons. It’s quite expensive to run so we make some money from it (a couple thousand a year each) but not a lot.  We’re sentimentally attached to it.My brother now wants to move into the house with his wife and start a family in a couple of years. Plus, he and his wife want to do extensive renovations by us taking out a shared £180k mortgage. The ideal would be to split this 50/50 rather than diluting my share, therefore all renovations decisions will be equally balanced. I don’t want to dilute my share in the house.I have a few concerns. First - I believe as a 50% owner of the property I should be paid ordinary rental on my half as if he were a tenant, below market rate (£2500pm would be typical of the area, so I would suggest around £1000pm). However, he thinks he should only pay me a little more than what we get in holiday rent, he suggested £400pm.Second, I’m worried that taking on the £90k mortgage will negatively impact my ability to get a mortgage in future. He’s hoping we can pay off the total in 10 years but he only earns around £70k and his wife works part time at close to minimum wage, so I don’t see how that’s possible.Third, my friend told me it seems weird I’m paying to renovate a house that I won’t get to have any enjoyment of. My brother says the renovations will increase the house’s value 1.5x so it’s a good investment for me. But if we don’t sell the house and he pays me little rent, I don’t much benefit.Fourth, my brother doesn’t earn an amazing salary (I think £70k ish) and his wife doesn’t earn much. I’m concerned that this massive financial burden is going to prove too much for them, and if they realise they don’t like living there (as it’s not a great permanent area for a young working couple) they won’t be able to afford to move to a new home without us being forced to sell the place. I could never afford to buy them out, being single and on a modest salary myself (£40k ish).Finally, my brother is my best friend. I’m very scared that us becoming so financially entangled is going to ruin our relationship. But I also worry that I’m being taken advantage of. I don’t quite see if it’s fair for him to live in a lovely 4-bedroom house for such little rent. It means I will never have the option of living there, which I have wondered about for my future, so at least decent rent feels like fair compensation.I’d like to hear from other people who’ve made similar financial arrangements with close family and friends, and how they managed it. How do you balance being a good friend or sibling while looking after your own best interests? Thank you 🙏",

      "content_preview": "Hi,So I recently (February) started a new job. This is my first time earning a considerable (comparatively speaking) wage, and I'm trying to learn the nuances of the tax bracket and pensions. Naively, I've never paid much notice to my pension and have never been in a position to pay anything more than the basic. Now I am in a position to do so. Obviously, I want to do so to the benefit of my pension and earnings.I'm now earning £55,000.00 p/a and auto-enrolled into the work pension scheme that is provided by NEST. I currently contribute 5% (£146 p/m) and my employer 3%. Understanding things as I do, I need to make an additional contribution of £4729 in order to pull my pay below the 40% tax threshold (£50,271).  This would mean either making that payment into my pension by the end of the tax year or upping my contribution to 9%. By doing this, I'm increasing my pension contribution by 4% or £158 extra a month (£304.31 total p/m) and putting the money into my own pension pot as opposed to the taxman's pocket?Am I correct in my thinking? Would people recommend increasing the NEST pension contribution as stated, or do I put the extra into a better pension/SIPP?Thanks",

      "content_preview": "Posting on behalf of my mother (60F).About 2 years ago, her own mother (my grandmother) passed away and left her an assisted living flat in South East London. It was originally bought ~8 years ago for around £150k. The idea was that it would be a form of recompense for over a decade of unpaid caring, but instead it’s become a huge financial burden and is slowly bankrupting my mother.The situation:Service charge: £555/month to Firstport (building operator). No ability to opt out, no reduction even if the property is vacant, have already tried pushing for this.Council tax: £183/month. Council are threatening to double this as the property has been vacant for >2 years.My mum works, but the flat’s costs swallow her entire income. She’s even had to take out loans to keep afloat.Trying to sell, but can't:We’ve been trying to sell for 2 years with no success. Originally purchased for £150k, the flat is currently listed at £100k, though she’d accept £90k at this point.The big issue is that a much nicer assisted living development opened nearby around the same time we listed, so there’s little to no demand for this one. The letting estate agent has told us it's not a price problem, more a demand problem. Other flats in the building are listed and are not selling.We had one verbal offer that flaked and nothing since.Other issues:We tried to rent it out (even had a prospective tenant lined up), but Firstport told us that renting is not permitted under the lease - so this isn't a viable workaround either.Question:What options do we have here? The service charge is draining my mum dry, she can’t afford to keep paying it, and selling feels impossible. Firstport are not interested in compromising and don't respond to emails.Are there any workarounds, legal routes, or organisations that can help in situations like this?Any advice would be hugely appreciated.",

She comes from a very wealthy family through property investments and has told me very blasé about giving hundreds of pounds worth of gifts to her kid’s teachers over the year, taking friends on expensive holidays and covering everyone’s costs, giving away her old cars worth thousands to colleagues when she upgrades etc. Just a very different lifestyle to my lower middle class background where I’ve had nice things but always had to be careful with balancing budgets.I’ve got some debts from earlier in life where family have helped me out and from some poor decisions, nothing too pressing but totals up to several thousand that I’m slowly paying back and will take me a long time and I’m barely saving anything. She’s alluded several times to offering to gift me a large part of the money, if not all of it, just to be generous and help me out. I’ve helped her through some really tough emotional and MH times so in her mind she’s just being a generous friend but it seems like such an alien concept to me to just gift so much money informally.I’ve kept batting away the idea as my pride hates the idea of taking the charity from her but with higher cost of living pressures it feels harder to just dismiss it. If I did accept it, would there be official ramifications like being taxed on receiving a lot of money as a gift and if we ever fell out later could she claim it back legally? I have no experience with individuals sharing so much money outside of inheritances or weddings.",

And nothing else within my budget and in my ideal areas is available to buy right now. So i have to keep looking for the right property and be patient.On the one hand, it means i can save more and potentially buy a slightly more expensive home.However, my family are emotionally and verbally abusive, and tend to take advantage of me. The are really getting to me, and the last few weeks I have begun to feel like I’m falling into a depression and it’s getting harder to stay strong.I can’t decide if it’s worth just sacrificing the additional savings and renting somewhere for a few months? Or shall i just suck it up and try and save and give myself more options when it comes to home buying?I have to say I also find moving very stressful so the idea of moving into another temporary home before buying is slightly stressful to say the least.But it could be 6 months of waiting for the right property…How to decide the next step?Thanks.",

I have spoken to the supplier and they have confirmed they havent been charging me VAT so im unable to reclaim it from there. Im considering shutting down this business, but that still wont get me out of the mess im already in, and the thousands i need to pay in VAT. I have already registered for VAT and if it gets approved ill get the number on 22nd September. What shall I do now? Everything has gone to sht and im stressing more than ever. Please give some advice Edit- For those who havent seen my last post, ive done £120k turnover since July 1st, well past the £90k VAT threshold",

I'm in line for inheritance in future which should pay off the mortgage regardless, plus equity from shares.Would welcome advise on the following please:During the application process I'm asked if it's for debt consolidation - should I answer yes to this?Is there a better way?Many thanks :)",

Which I got the same response that I should have been contacted or notified that a manual payment was required.Am I misunderstanding the Direct Debit Guarantee that they still should have processed the payment under the terms prior to the amendment?I'm reasonably annoyed about this as it's been over a week from the missed payment and if it goes down on my credit report as a missed payment that I'll have to dispute it.Have I grossly misunderstood something here or are Tesco in the right?",

Obviously I want to keep it open for as long as I can to receive the tax refund. Is that a risk with the bank or should it be fine? Would they even know I don't have a UK address anymore to keep my account open?Otherwise, I have a Wise account - has anybody had their refund deposited into one?",

      "content_preview": "Tried to have a talk about my older brother's retirement plans before his 63rd birthday. We got to chatting over a whiskey on Saturday night and he told me that there's no point saving for retirement because if you don't have anything saved, and haven't made national insurance contributions, then you get Pension Credit instead.He seems to believe that Pension Credit is better. He started claiming he would get free dental, free opticians, housing benefit etc.For reference, I'm purely on the state pension, but I've made my full national insurance contributions. I don't have any private or public sector pension.Am I actually going to be in a worse position than my brother when I retire? Do we get the same pension, but he also gets a whole load of other free stuff?",
