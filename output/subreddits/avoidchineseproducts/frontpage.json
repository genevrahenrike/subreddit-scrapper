      "content_preview": "I’ve been working on a small clothing project and made a conscious choice to avoid sourcing anything from China. Not out of politics, just a personal preference to support traceable and fair certified production. Sourcing ethically outside China was harder than I expected. Here’s what I’ve found so far: • Supima cotton from the US is excellent but comes with high order minimums and certification hurdles • Some GOTS-certified Indian mills are great but come with communication and scaling challenges • New Zealand merino is very ethical and high quality, especially when animal welfare is a priority. Curious if anyone else here is sourcing outside China. What suppliers or regions have worked well for you?",

Possibly they have a few Chinese components here and there, but most of the value is non Chinese. Don't expect noise cancelling or fancy functions. These are audiophile equipment that need a bit of tuning and EQ to get the sound you deserve. However their Bluetooth headphones are made in China so be careful. Make sure you're ok with open back headphones though. Recommendations for not made in China Bluetooth earbuds: -Technics AZ100 earbuds: made in Japan. Right now is one of the king or earbuds. AZ80 are also great at a cheaper price. -At an even cheaper price, the Samsung earbuds are still made in Vietnam.",

That simply was not acceptable. We set on a mission to find the best possible boots to use instead. Health of the feet is very important. The answer was Le Chameau . Apparently this is the best of the best, and made in France. According to my better half, their reputation is well earned. Now, this Summer, I needed new rubber boots myself, but since it is not for professional use, I can't caugh up sums that Le Chameau requires, so I chose instead Aigle . It is also a French brand, but some products are made in China. The website is quite transparent about this and you can easily find the models that are made in France. I can say they are the best rubber boots I have ever owned. Like walking on clouds.",
