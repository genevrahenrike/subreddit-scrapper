      "content_preview": "\"To prove strength beyond age, gender...\" and whatever. Anyway less than 15% were women. Men didn't wanted to choose women for the first challenges (sexism, shocking for no one). Making the already scarce women that were in the show get cut by half. Every challenge is the same thing, strength based, while we know physicality is interdisciplinary this show challenges is exclusively based on who's the beefiest and who can lift more , with the exception of some cardio here and there. It's boring and it's not as \"the ultimate challenge\" that it claims it is, and it favors the +90% of men contestants, which also get all the privileges to choose (oh surprise) other men. Sexism is a thing, specially in sports, and it's infuriating how this bad planning and thinking of challenges to showcase other things beyond raw muscle like endurance, cardio, flexibility, etc... just helps fuel the sexist stigmas that women are less. And if you want to have a show that's only strength and since we know testosterone is a big facilitator to gain and retain not muscle mass, why not putting men and women contestants that share height/weight? Why not try to make it fair like any damn sports league does? Lmao this show is like \"prepare for the most objective show, we're making a cage fight for a ball between a woman runner and a 2 meter solid dude that plays rugby. We're so fair\" Ugh.",

      "content_preview": "I've seen a fair amount of discussion on this subreddit regarding whether or not women should compete with men in these kinds of physical competition shows, especially with the recent debut of Japan's Final Draft show, where almost all of the women were eliminated within the first few rounds. I'm not really interested in getting bogged down into the nuance of whether women can ever be competitive against men, in what sports, and to what degree. Trying to solve for that and design events around it is a Sisyphean task. But I also don't think it's ideal to remove women from these shows completely, or sequester them to their own female-only shows. Let's be real - more people watch if women are participating, and the more people watch the more successful the show is. So here's what I think could work with as few compromises as possible: 50 men. 50 women. For all free-for-all challenges (where individuals compete against individuals for rankings or 1v1 elimination), men and women compete separately . For all team challenges , each team will be composed of an equal number of men and women. These teams of men and women compete together . For free-for-all challenges, the event/challenge can be different for men and women, but the format must be the same. If you're eliminating half of the men during a free-for-all all, the women's event must eliminate half the women. As a result, you have an equal number of men and women throughout the entire competition. This way you can have a solid number of events where men and women compete with and against each other (team battles), you get good opportunities to develop relationships, chemistry, rivalries and camaraderie, and you're guaranteed to have women survive all the way until the end of the show. Of course, the final will have to be two separate finals for men and women, and one winner will be crowned for each gender. But I don't see that as a downside - on the contrary, I think crowning a 'king' and a 'queen' can open up a lot of opportunities.",

How gracious they were when they were eliminated, all of that was lovely but my fav 3 moments were: Hong Beom Seok thanking his wife and kids at the end. And how she encouraged him to do the challenge and helped him to not fear failure. My heart melted. During the pull up challenge. I think it was Andres team but the girl who took part and did 6 pull ups. The encouragement melted my heart. \"WOW look at how perfect her form is. We need to learn pull ups from her.\" Like awwww. When Lee Won Hee was eliminated and he gave his little speech. He said he was so grateful for his team members and so proud and he wanted them to know he loved them. Again. Melted to the ground at this point. It just seemed like such an encouraging and inspiring group of people to be around. What were your favourite moments?",

I knew it would be different than Physical 100 but it definitely feels more standard (U.S.) reality show to me since we get so much of their backstories and living situations (which felt very Devil's Plan to me). I'm going to continue to watch but might fast forward past the personal elements because what I like about Physical 100 is that it's truly just focused on the challenges. I really hope that (for the American version at least) that they stick with traditional Physical 100 format for the other versions of it and don't try to American-ize it with backstories and made-up drama.",

It was really heartwarming to see athletes supporting each other, even while competing, and I think that says a lot about Korean culture and how much they value teamwork and respect. I do worry a bit about the show branching out to other countries and losing that. Especially with American sports, there’s sometimes more of a “me first” attitude—like people are just in it for themselves, even if it means stepping on others. I just hope future versions can keep that same spirit of respect and decency that made the original so special.",

Was watching some old videos of Jang Eunsil wrestling, and I think it’s safe to say that she’s a WAY better wrestler now than she was when she was younger. She’s just stronger and shows more skill and confidence. I wonder how she would do at the senior level of the Asian Wrestling Competition. It would be intriguing to see her challenge herself of Korea once again. She constantly wins gold at nationals in her weight class. How would she fare now against international competition?",

For me (British person) there was nothing about him that stood out, but everyone there immediately saw it was funny.",

      "content_preview": "Posted this because, even though I watched season 2 when it aired so it's been a while, it was on my mind. I searched and was very surprised at the only existing thread seeming to be against having separate divisions. Personally, I don't see the fun in competing if you know that the best you can get is, say, top 10 (if even that). Sure, I get the premise of the show is to find the \"most perfect physique\", but it's a fact that men are physically stronger in terms of absolute strength, so I don't see the point in having a show to prove it. Plus, we've already had two mixed seasons, so I would love to see sex-exclusive seasons. That or base challenges on relative strength, although that sort of goes against the premise of the show. It's nice to know I'm not alone in thinking this! Also, I've already watched Siren: Survive the Island and loved it, 100% recommend. Still, I would love a female-only edition of Physical 100 as the premises and challenges are different, and I feel like there's a deficit of female-specific physical survival shows in general. Edit: I don't know how to close this post without deleting it so I'll just be turning off reply notifications. :)",

The entire time I couldn’t help but think that the weight of these torsos and the weight of the buckets could so easily be rigged to assist who the show wants to win. In individual events like this, there’s no way for competitors to know if they are being cheated or not. And of course there’s no governing body ensuring fair play. The squat challenge is identical to the Worlds Strongest men squat event, but the oversight the event has is overwhelming compared to Physical 100. I wish there was some way for them to demonstrate fairness in events like this. Maybe have competitors switch squat racks or torsos after a certain amount of time - obviously looking past the obvious logistics of doing so. Just making a point.",
