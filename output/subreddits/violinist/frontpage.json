      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I just got a really nice 19th c. French violin around 3500€ that I’m very happy with. Up until now, I’ve only played with bows under 300€. I feel like I’m finally starting to get to know and understand my instrument better, and I’d like to upgrade my bow. Here’s my situation: I’m at an intermediate level. My violin has a warm, intimate, round sound. I feel like it needs a bow that can open it up a bit more, without sacrificing that warmth. My question is: should I look for an older bow (something like a Mirecourt/Dörfler workshop bow) under 1500€, or should I consider going up in budget to something higher-end or even a contemporary maker? Any advice or experiences with this kind of setup would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance :)",

      "content_preview": "Hi guys, I am a professional violinist who has casually handled a lot of beat up stinky fiddles (I inherited the violin inventory of a failing guitar store, it was about 42 violins, 20 or so if which I ended up just throwing away) (plus I've had a lot of students and I worked in another store which had a lot of violins in the back) We live in basically a luthier desert - the closest real shops around are about 2 hours a way, and the local guitar store doesn't mess with violins. So, I am hosting an \"open house\" for free where people can bring in their violins and I can take a look at them and tell them if they're playable, set up a bridge in roughly the right spot if needed, tell them if the needed repairs are better or worse than they look, tell them whether their closet Stradivarius is a real Stradivarius, etc. Because I feel like there are a lot of people who have these questions floating around in their head but no way of getting answers, so the fiddles just stay in the closet. Also I have a lot of affection for crappy closet violins with the bow hair going everywhere. My question is ... if you were doing this, what would you want to be sure to know about or have on hand to be prepared? And if you were going to one, or if you have a mysterious fiddle in the closet, what questions would you ask? I have my own ideas but I'd love to crowdsource if this is something you feel like answering. Thanks!!",

Those students that absolutely want to do it for the rest of their lives will do that. We are creating too many musicians for a limited number of jobs and not enough audience members! Many music students lose their love of music over the course of this progress and then don't want to go to concerts.\"",

When I tell myself i’m gonna practice I always forget or sometimes i’m just to lazy to pick it up which has resulted in not being that good. I know it takes years to be good at it but sometimes I just contemplaint to quit because it gets hard. But at the same time I think it’s really fun to play in the orchestra and I really like my teacher so I really don’t know what to do :(",

I really like them. Financially, I can manage to keep them, but I am not very comfortable either. For example, sometimes I might need to sell other things in order to pay for a violin purchase. I have read the rules and the FAQ, and I hope this kind of question is okay to ask here. Given my situation, should I consider selling some of my violins? I know they are not worth much, so I have never really thought about selling them before. But maybe I should? I would really appreciate your thoughts. Edit: I’ve decided to keep just my good violin and a knock around violin. Thanks so much to everyone who helped me sort out my “collection” and make this decision",

      "content_preview": "I live in a bit of a remote area and help administer an after-school string program for children. We did some substantial outreach this summer attending local events with our smallest violins, violas, and cellos to find good candidates for our program and were overjoyed to fill it with young students 6 and up. Shock of shock: we have a fairly balanced class with violins, violas and cellos. Our expansion has brought with it a bit of growing pains though in that our area is not outfitted with rental instruments for small 6 year olds for viola. (Our program loans out instruments for free and refers to the local violin shop luthier when we don't have instruments, but in this case neither we nor the shop have anything below a 12\" viola.) We've discussed and agreed with the local luthier that the likely best solution is to string our small violins as violas. We understand sound may not be ideal especially at the low end but for young students learning their first clef and first instrument in our classes, we would really like to get students the pitch range of instruments they best preferred when they met with us and tried out instruments. There's also the question of appropriate bridges for the restrung instruments, but at that cost of work it would probably make more sense to buy an instrument which we don't yet have budget for. The problem I'm having is finding appropriate C strings. It seems there are only 2, Overture Ultra and Prelude, that offer something that might work. I am unclear who makes Overture Ultra and if they are still making strings, OR if Prelude is really appropriate for a 11\" instrument. Do we have a luthier in the house who can speak to what works best for very small violas or small violins strung as violas?",

Sometimes it’s from a well-meaning teacher, other times from random people who’ve never even touched a violin. For example, I once got told: “If you can’t hit a note cleanly, just press harder with the bow and it’ll fix itself.” 😅 (Spoiler: it did not fix itself, it just made everything louder and worse.) So I’m curious — what’s the worst advice you’ve ever gotten about violin playing?",

A lot of you shared kind messages and great suggestions including renting. But one Redditor, u/Lygus_lineolaris , offered me to borrow her own violin until I can bring mine over during Christmas. We met up today in Winnipeg and I got a nice violin from her to restart my practices. Also, my uncle is coming soon and while he can’t bring the violin because he has his own carry on and backpack, he is bringing my books, so I won’t need to buy new ones here. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone, and especially to Lygus. I’m very happy to start practicing again and pick up where I left off. P.S. Bonus (few months old) video of Professor Kitty trying to chase the music stand. Lygus_lineolaris Violin Professor Kitty, inspecting the music stand",

Because of that, I'm considering upgrading to a new bow. The one that came with my violin is a very cheap Brazil wood bow that I don't even think can be re-haired. My question is - is it worth going to try some new bows at this stage? I was going to budget somewhere maybe up to $500 max for a new one. Would most of the benefits and nuances of a bow in that range be wasted on somebody as new to playing as I am? Or do you think I would notice a difference if I played some nicer ones even though I'm not using advanced bowing techniques?",
