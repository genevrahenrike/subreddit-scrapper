      "content_preview": "Twenty years ago today, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans ‚Äî but this wasn‚Äôt just a natural disaster. It was a failure of infrastructure, equity, and government accountability. When the levees broke ‚Äî especially along the Industrial Canal ‚Äî the entire Lower 9th Ward was submerged and every single home rendered uninhabitable.Prior to Katrina, the Lower 9th Ward had one of the highest Black homeownership rates in the nation.98.1% of residents were African-AmericanIt was home to many of the city‚Äôs first free people of colorOver 60% lived below the national AMI (average median income)Recovery has not treated this neighborhood equally.The state‚Äôs Road Home program ‚Äî the largest housing recovery program in U.S. history ‚Äî was found to be racially discriminatory in federal court. Many residents received far less than they needed to rebuild, or were excluded entirely. Thousands of families lost not only their homes, but also generational wealth and a chance to return.Atlowernine.org, our mission is to help correct that injustice.We rebuild homes for pre-Katrina residents using skilled staff and volunteer labor, keeping construction costs to about 30% of market rate.To date, we‚Äôve fully rebuilt 98 homesCompleted 400+ smaller repair and renovation projectsHosted volunteers from 37+ countriesProvided over $9 million in donated laborOperate a community food pantry to help fight food insecurity in a neighborhood where access to fresh, affordable groceries is still a major challengeWe‚Äôve brought back more Lower 9th Ward families than any other single organization.And yet, the neighborhood remains only partially restored.Today population return stands at just 34% ‚Äî far behind the rest of New Orleans. Many of the \"returning\" residents are newcomers settling in the Holy Cross area, where rising property values are pricing out long-time locals.Incredibly, it wasn‚Äôt until 2014 ‚Äî nearly nine years after the storm ‚Äî that residents received notices from the city saying, ‚ÄúThe City of New Orleans will soon begin repairing Katrina-damaged roads and infrastructure in your neighborhood.‚ÄùConservative estimates say it will take at least another decade to finish rebuilding the Lower 9th Ward.Disasters don‚Äôt discriminate. But recovery always has.We‚Äôre still here because the work is not done. Because justice delayed is still justice demanded. Because the people who called this place home still matter.I‚Äôm Laura, Executive Director of lowernine.org.Ask me anything.üìçOur Website:lowernine.orgüì∏Images of the levee breach and early flooding:https://imgur.com/gallery/MGQgdO4üì∏ What the Lower 9th Ward looks like today:https://imgur.com/a/OzpP0YSüé• Buzzfeed feature:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OfICZ34oDwüí™Volunteer with us:https://lowernine.org/volunteer/üì±Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/lowernineorgüßæProof:https://i.postimg.cc/KYx7QN8q/AMA-Reddit-2025-proof.jpg",

      "content_preview": "Hi Reddit! My name is Shoshana Walter and I‚Äôm an investigative journalist withu/marshall_project, and the author ofRehab: An American Scandal, a new nonfiction book from Simon & Schuster.REHABis a narrative-driven expos√© of the United States' addiction treatment system and the government's botched response to the opioid crisis.I‚Äôve talked to hundreds of people in and out of recovery, treatment staff and body brokers; I reviewed hundreds of hours of undercover DEA agent footage, and obtained confidential internal financial documents from profit-driven treatment programs.Despite an enormous expansion of treatment access over the past 25 years, I found a treatment system driven by profits that often hurts people more than it helps. This is a big deal nationwide: More than two-thirds of Americans say they or a family member have struggled with addiction.Among the problems with our system: thousands of people have been routed into programs that use them as an unpaid shadow labor force. In the book, I follow one middle-class kid from Louisiana who was court-ordered into a treatment program that required participants to work up to 80 hours per week, unpaid, at major for-profit companies, including Exxon and Shell oil refineries, chemical plants and industrial laundromats.Studies have repeatedly shown that programs that allow parents to remain with their kids during treatment have better outcomes. Yet, since the opioid epidemic began, the number of facilities that provide childcare or allow families to remain together have dropped dramatically. Meanwhile, maternal overdose deaths are skyrocketing, and children are entering foster care in record numbers.I also uncovered insurance-funded treatment programs that prey on patients for profit. ‚ÄúBody brokers‚Äù place patients into rehab by selling them to the highest bidder, while patients cycle in and out of ineffective 30-day programs that fuel relapse rates, rather than long-term recovery. In my book, I tell the story of one California treatment center that was overmedicating patients to the point of impairment, contributing to several deaths inside the program, and yet regulators repeatedly failed to take action.And finally, I found that it is still difficult for many people to access treatment, especially medications such as Suboxone. Arecent excerpt I published(gift article in The New York Times) details how government missteps and a pharmaceutical company‚Äôs thirst for profits kept the medication out of the hands of many people who needed it. The DEA made the problem worse by going after doctors who prescribed it, while the drug company behind the medication drew enormous profits. Still to this day, access is limited and few doctors are willing to provide care to addicted patients.I learned a lot reporting this book. Have a question about our treatment system? Ask me anything, starting at 9 am PST/12 noon EST.EDIT (12:06 PM): That's all I have time for today. Thanks so much for the great questions, everyone!",

      "content_preview": "Hey Reddit!I'm Kenneth Russell DeGraff, former Senior Policy Advisor for Speaker Nancy Pelosi. I spent nearly two decades in Congress crafting climate and tech legislation, and working across the aisle to build bi-partisan support, including playing a key role in crafting the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and CHIPS and Science Act, and lots more. Now I'm watching a new challenge that could undermine everything we worked to achieve: the massive energy footprint of artificial intelligence.I'll be here to talk about data centers, what concerned citizens should know about the hidden costs of AI, and what actions Congress should take to regulate the technology.AMA starting Monday 8/25 at 5 pm ET / 2 pm PT! I'll be around until at least 7p/4p.My paperoutlines how we can maintain our strategic AI advantage while building the social infrastructure that ensures benefits flow to everyone, not just those holding the knowledge and wealth. That means bending states, Congress, and agencies toward serving people, not just the powerful. We can have both innovation and shared prosperity, but only if we're intentional about the structures we build now.Proof: I had one of the \"best staff Twitter accounts on Capitol Hill\" and a \"key role in crafting climate policy.\" I helped Girl Talk, DJ Drama and Congressman Mike Doyle explode intoevery music magazine and blog at the time, called \"The Coolest Moment in the History of Congressand Why it Matters\" and Out Magazine named me to their annualOut 100. I've been a fellow atHarvard Kennedy School, where I have anew paperon these topics,Stanford Law - Center for Internet and Societyand theVanderbilt Policy Accelerator.Photos for Verification and of Speaker Pelosi and I.REVISED POST ADDENDUM:I accidentally posted this live instead of scheduling for Monday. My bad - but the AMA is now complete. Thanks to everyone who engaged.Why I never traded individual stocks- That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm on Reddit exposing utility scams instead of on a yacht. No revolving door for me.KEY EXCHANGES:On Congress:3.5x more productive under Pelosi + four-corner agreement requirement|Bernie 2016: expanded young voters we needed|Build Back Better died: childcare, pre-K, paid leave|UAP disclosure blocked by Armed Services Republicans; helped open access research|DOGE destroying technical expertiseOn Energy:‚ÄúTeapot Dome 2: Electric Boogaloo‚Äù - fossil fuel money bought Congress|Your bill‚Äôs spiking 29% from OBBB|Grid at 53% capacity - boost 33% without new plants|Data centers poisoning Memphis, North Omaha|Texas tripled capacity, saved 6-18%On Wealth:Wright Patman 1957 + $79 trillion wealth transfer during Congress‚Äôs 4-decade silence|$4 trillion OBBB wealth transferSolutions:Digital rights + Economic security + AI accountability|Start locally: State PUCs decide your ratesOn My Record:‚ÄúI was the translator‚Äù - bridging technical expertise with political reality|IRA/CHIPS/Energy Act: UN called IRA biggest climate law, Energy Act 2 degrees cooler|Prison calling: dozens of calls in last 48 hours|Autism work that still helps familiesvYelling at me on Reddit is among the least effective political acts of all time.

For one thing, there isn‚Äôt enough money ....¬† Many hurdles are less obvious ... This readable book shows why, as with so much else in environmental policy, we need action nonetheless‚Äù and Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN Special Envoy on Climate Change described it as ‚Äúcompelling and meticulously researched‚Äù.I have followed and attended the annual UN climate negotiations for many years, mainly focusing on adaptation issues, and you can see my analysis from one COPhere.Before starting at UCL a few years ago, I worked on practical adaptation projects and with policy makers across South Asia, Africa and Europe.I worked as a Senior Researcher for the International Institute for Environment and Development, helping governments develop frameworks to adapt to climate change and generate learning on how the world is adapting.¬†¬†I have also worked supporting entrepreneurs and innovators around adaptation and as a consultant with a range of international organisations supporting them to fund adaptation, create new programmes and design frameworks to assess their progress.I write about adaptation issues in my newsletter -https://susannahfisher.substack.com/Looking forward to your questions!",

In May, the NEA rescinded a $20,000 grant for our festival. Who knew the criminal queerness festival would hit so close to home.We also run programs like Staging Pride, a queer youth theater after school program for teens in NYC. Domestically we‚Äôve worked with institutions like Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, and have produced work in Croatia and Kenya.Our work has been covered inThe New York Times,NBC News,Time Out New York, andNY1.In 2024, we won an Obie award. Right now, we‚Äôre producing some staged readings on Fire Island.We also may have once (or twice) done a show in a leather bar‚Ä¶I got into this work because theater saved my life as a queer kid growing up in the early 2000s. I was bullied a lot, and theater gave me a safe space to be myself and make friends. As an adult, I assisted Nobel Peace Prize nominee Cleve Jones, protege of Harvey Milk and creator of the AIDS Quilt. Under Cleve, I learned all about community organizing skills I use to this day. Today, I use theater as a tool to empower marginalized communities and bring people together.When I‚Äôm not doing theater things, I enjoy hiking, drag shows, and exploring NYC.

      "content_preview": "Scene links: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNd9WMVfr/ I just wanted to drop a Q&A about my experience as an extra in Harry Potter. If you‚Äôve ever thought about doing extra work, getting into acting, production or if you just have some questions around what it was like to be on set while they were filming get involved! How it all started‚Ä¶ My mother had encouraged (more like forced) me to audition at a well known drama school called Sylvia Young in London. It was something I was never interested in at the time. However like all mothers she knew best. I‚Äôm glad she pushed me though, as it became one of my greatest childhood memories. I eventually made it onto their books, and just as I was starting my new secondary school, my mother had a call asking if I could attend a casting for extras in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I auditioned, but after weeks of silence I assumed I hadn‚Äôt been chosen. Then one day, while in the school car park, my mum got the call I was in. I‚Äôll never forget how happy she was. And me too, mostly because it meant four months of school or so I thought. I‚Äôd actually be taught on set, however this was still a huge relief to me as I absolutely hated my new school. Logistics‚Ä¶ Even though I lived near Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire, I had to travel to London and get a coach with the other kids every day. They wouldn‚Äôt allow individual travel which was annoying, but they covered all costs and paid ¬£50 per day, which for a kid wasn‚Äôt that bad. When I arrived, I felt like a total outsider. I was from a council estate, and most of the kids were from posh London families, many already enrolled in Sylvia Young with acting experience. I was assigned a chaperone (little did they know how much of a menace I was back then), and I instantly developed a crush on a girl called Emma with curly hair. The girls at my school weren‚Äôt quite as glamorous. Life on set.. The first few days were anticlimactic, I was stuck in a small cabin getting tutoring. But lunch time was absolute paradise. Coming from school dinners and my mum‚Äôs chaotic cooking, this was another world. Unlimited banquets of food and drinks, all for free and you could even sit near the cast, though the main actors had their own trailers, they would sometimes join us when filming. Three weeks passed and I still hadn‚Äôt been called to film. I was genuinely starting to think I was just a backup for the main kids that actually attended theatrical schools full time. Then one day, they finally said I was going to be filming. They took me to hair and makeup, then after to get dressed, i was assigned a Slytherin outfit and eventually taken to one of the studios we would be filming in for the day. That moment for me was unforgettable when i walked in. The sheer scale, the energy in the room, the size of the crew, the technology it all blew my mind. The buildings were huge and made out of foam and plaster but they looked so real. And the scenery outside was made out of thousands of fishing lines with green markers for CGI. I just couldn‚Äôt fathom how all of the stuff that was happening around me could possibly all harmonise together to produce this movie. It was my first glimpse into how they made films like this and my little mind was racing trying to figure out what everyone was doing and how every little thing worked. From that day on, I was filming most days. You wouldn‚Äôt do much other than be told how to react. Happy, sad, surprised, disgusted on cue. I filmed dinner scenes, court yard scenes, walking scenes and some I probably can‚Äôt remember. But everyday I got to walk onto the set was a moment of absolute joy for me. I made friends, ate better than I ever had, and slowly started realising just how lucky I was to be a small part of something that would eventually become a huge global franchise and embedded into culture around the world. That was until I got kicked off. Sadly, it didn‚Äôt end well. Toward the very end of filming, my ADHD and thirst to discover more got the better of me. I ran off from my chaperone and snuck into one of the studios. I was promptly kicked off the production. I guess I knew it was coming to an end and I just wanted to discover more. I think my chaperone was pleased as I was a massive pain in her ass, I was always trying to make the other kids laugh and joking around. Aftermath. I never became an actor, or had a desire to pursue acting. I landed further work with Sylvia Young right until the end of school, such as commercials for Yazoo and BT. All of which paid considerably better than HP but way less cool. That early experience though sparked a creative fire in me.¬† One that quietly shaped my life in ways I didn‚Äôt fully realise at the time. After leaving school, I studied electrical engineering, then later pursued a music degree at the University of West London. I ran a successful electrical company for several years, but eventually, my path led me back to creativity. Many years later, I co-founded a content agency in London, building a new career around storytelling for brands and filming. For a long time, my life was a balancing act between being a creative and a businessman. Now, I‚Äôm leaning more heavily into my creative side than ever before. I‚Äôm currently writing a book and launching a digital content brand centered around leaving the city of London to renovate my home outside the UK. My goal is to show people a more affordable, accessible way to own property. Melding my knowledge of construction with my expertise in marketing to create something different. But yeah.. It was a small part of my life, but it‚Äôs those small little moments that help shape your life without you ever knowing. The thrills I got as a young boy walking onto those sets everyday I believe led me to a creative career with the dreams of one day being able to release my own short movie. If you are still in school just join an agency it‚Äôs free, and if you are an adult still join it doesn‚Äôt matter. My business partner actually joined an agency in his mid twenties and ended up doing multiple commercials and even extra work on the Aladdin movie. So it‚Äôs never too late. (And the pay is a lot better) And if you want to get into production, find someone that works in the industry and start as a runner. If you made it this far thanks for reading, I know I rambled a bit, it was a long time ago so I have to remember and recite things and I‚Äôve never really talked about it in depth before. Happy to answer anything :)",

For the past 13 years, I have dedicated my career to exposing the co-conspirators in Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs sex-trafficking operation.My reporting on Epstein made international headlines, when I obtained and shared his so-called 'Little Black Book' in 2015, about four years before his suspicious death.Since then, I‚Äôve continued to investigate his web of pimps, enablers, and fellow child abusers. The criminal network that he was part of resembles other pedophile rings that I‚Äôve reported on in the past ‚Äî such as the Franklin Scandal. We can talk more about that here.To be clear, I would like to avoid pontificating about baseless rumors. This AMA is about hard evidence, documented corruption, and holding predators to account.There‚Äôs a growing movement to release the Epstein Files, and you can be part of that. I encourage you toSign my petition on Change(dot)org, which urges Congress to force the release of all evidence related to Epstein‚Äôs co-conspirators.Join my nonprofitEpstein Justice, a platform for people to learn more about this heinous trafficking operation.Some things I hope we can discuss today:Why the Trump administration‚Äôs recent memo denying the existence of a ‚Äúclient list‚Äù is laughably wrongThe inner-workings of Epstein‚Äôs global network and potential intelligence tiesHow the media missed (or ignored) this story for so longHow whistleblowers and survivors were silencedParallels and connections between Epstein‚Äôs network and other human traffickers.How you can help expose Epstein‚Äôs powerful croniesLet‚Äôs shine light on the Epstein case. Ask Me Anything!Proof:ImgurUPDATE 19:48 PM ET: Logging off now. I'm thoroughly impressed by the questions and knowledge of the Franklin scandal.

I was burned over 35% of my body and had to fight for my life in hospitals across Cambodia with no travel insurance, no burn unit, and no idea how I would get home.Eventually, the U.S. Embassy arranged for me to be medevacked to Denver on a government loan called a repatriation loan. It was the only reason I survived.I just published a memoir called After the Flame that tells the whole story, and I‚Äôm here to answer questions about: ‚Ä¢\tBurn injuries and recovery ‚Ä¢\tMedical care in Cambodia ‚Ä¢\tWhat it‚Äôs like to be medevacked across the world ‚Ä¢\tHow the repatriation loan works ‚Ä¢\tWhat happens when you don‚Äôt have travel insurance ‚Ä¢\tPTSD, trauma healing, and rebuilding your life after disasterAsk me anything.Proof:https://imgur.com/gallery/hi-R6uhYNghttps://youtu.be/rK7A2uWbz24?si=0a6Ej9w7imaEjznyBook is on presale now, will be released on August 14th (my burniversary)!https://a.co/d/fX2GfbR",

Question for Redditors: Should we do this again, like, soon?For more of our coverage on this, look out for our bylines atBloomberg Law.- Katie & Parker--Hi guys! I‚Äôm Katie Arcieri, an antitrust reporter with Bloomberg Law, and this is Parker Purifoy, on the labor team. We‚Äôve been reporting on the legal and labor implications of the recently approved $2.8 billion antitrust settlement between the NCAA and nearly 400,000 college athletes.Ask Us Anything! Well, anything antitrust and labor related to the deal, lol.The settlementfundamentally reshapes the landscape for amateur sports in the US. It allows colleges, for the first time, to pay athletes directly.But the settlement has already hit a bunch of snags. Numerous objectors have appealed the deal with some saying itviolates Title IX. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers slammed a billadvancing through the Housethat would standardize name, image and likeness (NIL) rules and prevent college athletes frombecoming employees.And on Thursday, President Donald Trump signedan executive orderestablishing NIL standards.We‚Äôre here to answer any of your questions!¬†Fire away!Proof.This AMA will start Friday, July 25, at 1 p.m. ET.",
