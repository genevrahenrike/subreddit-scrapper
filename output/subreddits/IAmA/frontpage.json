Doctors gave me 18 months to live. At that age, with a five-month old, hearing those words turned my world upside down.I had no idea what the future would look like. Since then, I’ve gone through treatment, faced fear and setbacks, and learned what resilience really means.Today I’m a wife, mom of four, writer, advocate, and someone who believes deeply in helping others know they’re not alone in this journey.Now I spend my time connecting with other cancer survivors, sharing resources, and offering hope. I also partner with The Mesothelioma Center atAsbestos.comto provide free support for patients and caregivers by sharing my story and writing about my experience.Ask me anything about:Getting diagnosed as a young mom at 21Going through treatment for mesothelioma and navigating the healthcare systemFinding second opinions and trusted resourcesHow I stay hopeful and what thriving looks like after survivalAMA!Proof:https://postimg.cc/LJ6N8m5cTamron Little,https://postimg.cc/hJyC2KVLThe Mesothelioma CenterThank you all for your thoughtful questions.

For one thing, there isn’t enough money ....  Many hurdles are less obvious ... This readable book shows why, as with so much else in environmental policy, we need action nonetheless” and Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN Special Envoy on Climate Change described it as “compelling and meticulously researched”.I have followed and attended the annual UN climate negotiations for many years, mainly focusing on adaptation issues, and you can see my analysis from one COPhere.Before starting at UCL a few years ago, I worked on practical adaptation projects and with policy makers across South Asia, Africa and Europe.I worked as a Senior Researcher for the International Institute for Environment and Development, helping governments develop frameworks to adapt to climate change and generate learning on how the world is adapting.  I have also worked supporting entrepreneurs and innovators around adaptation and as a consultant with a range of international organisations supporting them to fund adaptation, create new programmes and design frameworks to assess their progress.I write about adaptation issues in my newsletter -https://susannahfisher.substack.com/Looking forward to your questions!",

      "content_preview": "Twenty years ago today, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans — but this wasn’t just a natural disaster. It was a failure of infrastructure, equity, and government accountability. When the levees broke — especially along the Industrial Canal — the entire Lower 9th Ward was submerged and every single home rendered uninhabitable.Prior to Katrina, the Lower 9th Ward had one of the highest Black homeownership rates in the nation.98.1% of residents were African-AmericanIt was home to many of the city’s first free people of colorOver 60% lived below the national AMI (average median income)Recovery has not treated this neighborhood equally.The state’s Road Home program — the largest housing recovery program in U.S. history — was found to be racially discriminatory in federal court. Many residents received far less than they needed to rebuild, or were excluded entirely. Thousands of families lost not only their homes, but also generational wealth and a chance to return.Atlowernine.org, our mission is to help correct that injustice.We rebuild homes for pre-Katrina residents using skilled staff and volunteer labor, keeping construction costs to about 30% of market rate.To date, we’ve fully rebuilt 98 homesCompleted 400+ smaller repair and renovation projectsHosted volunteers from 37+ countriesProvided over $9 million in donated laborOperate a community food pantry to help fight food insecurity in a neighborhood where access to fresh, affordable groceries is still a major challengeWe’ve brought back more Lower 9th Ward families than any other single organization.And yet, the neighborhood remains only partially restored.Today population return stands at just 34% — far behind the rest of New Orleans. Many of the \"returning\" residents are newcomers settling in the Holy Cross area, where rising property values are pricing out long-time locals.Incredibly, it wasn’t until 2014 — nearly nine years after the storm — that residents received notices from the city saying, “The City of New Orleans will soon begin repairing Katrina-damaged roads and infrastructure in your neighborhood.”Conservative estimates say it will take at least another decade to finish rebuilding the Lower 9th Ward.Disasters don’t discriminate. But recovery always has.We’re still here because the work is not done. Because justice delayed is still justice demanded. Because the people who called this place home still matter.I’m Laura, Executive Director of lowernine.org.Ask me anything.📍Our Website:lowernine.org📸Images of the levee breach and early flooding:https://imgur.com/gallery/MGQgdO4📸 What the Lower 9th Ward looks like today:https://imgur.com/a/OzpP0YS🎥 Buzzfeed feature:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OfICZ34oDw💪Volunteer with us:https://lowernine.org/volunteer/📱Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/lowernineorg🧾Proof:https://i.postimg.cc/KYx7QN8q/AMA-Reddit-2025-proof.jpg",

In May, the NEA rescinded a $20,000 grant for our festival. Who knew the criminal queerness festival would hit so close to home.We also run programs like Staging Pride, a queer youth theater after school program for teens in NYC. Domestically we’ve worked with institutions like Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, and have produced work in Croatia and Kenya.Our work has been covered inThe New York Times,NBC News,Time Out New York, andNY1.In 2024, we won an Obie award. Right now, we’re producing some staged readings on Fire Island.We also may have once (or twice) done a show in a leather bar…I got into this work because theater saved my life as a queer kid growing up in the early 2000s. I was bullied a lot, and theater gave me a safe space to be myself and make friends. As an adult, I assisted Nobel Peace Prize nominee Cleve Jones, protege of Harvey Milk and creator of the AIDS Quilt. Under Cleve, I learned all about community organizing skills I use to this day. Today, I use theater as a tool to empower marginalized communities and bring people together.When I’m not doing theater things, I enjoy hiking, drag shows, and exploring NYC.

      "content_preview": "1.  Your home equity is a gold-mine. If you need cash, stop taking out high-interest loans.So many people take out high-interest payday loans – please don’t do this. If you get into trouble you can typically get a relatively low-interest HELOC (a home equity line of credit).Essentially with a HELOC, you’re borrowing against the equity you have in your house and use it for whatever you need (much like a credit card).Typically, you’ll get lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms compared to traditional loans.Here’s a calculator you can use to see how much/little you could borrow (link here).Side note: if you hate debt, you can still get money out of your home’s equity by using something like Hometap, where you more or less sell investors a portion of your equity without a loan)2. Switch auto insurance companies every 6-12 months.If you haven’t compared auto insurance rates in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$400/year¹).Example: I cut my car insurance bill by ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers (same exact coverage too) and it took me a whopping 5 minutes.Take two minutes and pull up a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, Auto-Savings.com is fine too) and compare multiple offers from different companies in one go.Worst case scenario: you stay with what you’ve got. Best case scenario: you save a few hundred dollars a year.Here’s a link to a good comparison site: link.3. Try and find the best price online.Big stores like Amazon know that no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites, so there’s often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices.I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but Capital One Shopping has always worked well for me and I'd recommend trying it (link here).When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will automatically compare prices for you, and auto-apply coupon codes when possible.4. Get yourself a dang advisor.Most people are under the false impression that financial advisors are just for wealthy people.They absolutely aren’t: if you have a net worth of $100k+, you can typically qualify for an advisor. Having an advisor typically increases your yearly returns by 3%¹ (mostly due to smarter tax planning)If you don’t have an advisor in your family, use a site like WiserAdvisor or Zoe Financial to find somebody with good reviews in your area.5. You don't have to pay off your debt by yourself.Very few people know about it, but If you have $10k+ in debt, you can technically ask a debt relief to come in and take over the process for you.It’ll typically save you 23% off your total debt, after fees (according to NDR, a big debt relief company).They’ll negotiate with your creditors and try to get your debt reduced (then they take a cut of the savings).Typically people who are struggling with debt save 23% on avg. when they ask for help from debt relief companies.Here’s a little calculator you can use to see how much you’d potentially save: link).6. Save on home insurance.Some homeowners save $1k+/year just by switching home insurance providers (typically saving them more than changing auto insurance policies).If it’s been over a year since you’ve reviewed your rates, it might be worth taking a few minutes to compare offers. Here’s a home insurance comparison site I’ve used: (link).",

      "content_preview": "Hey Reddit!I'm Kenneth Russell DeGraff, former Senior Policy Advisor for Speaker Nancy Pelosi. I spent nearly two decades in Congress crafting climate and tech legislation, and working across the aisle to build bi-partisan support, including playing a key role in crafting the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and CHIPS and Science Act, and lots more. Now I'm watching a new challenge that could undermine everything we worked to achieve: the massive energy footprint of artificial intelligence.I'll be here to talk about data centers, what concerned citizens should know about the hidden costs of AI, and what actions Congress should take to regulate the technology.AMA starting Monday 8/25 at 5 pm ET / 2 pm PT! I'll be around until at least 7p/4p.My paperoutlines how we can maintain our strategic AI advantage while building the social infrastructure that ensures benefits flow to everyone, not just those holding the knowledge and wealth. That means bending states, Congress, and agencies toward serving people, not just the powerful. We can have both innovation and shared prosperity, but only if we're intentional about the structures we build now.Proof: I had one of the \"best staff Twitter accounts on Capitol Hill\" and a \"key role in crafting climate policy.\" I helped Girl Talk, DJ Drama and Congressman Mike Doyle explode intoevery music magazine and blog at the time, called \"The Coolest Moment in the History of Congressand Why it Matters\" and Out Magazine named me to their annualOut 100. I've been a fellow atHarvard Kennedy School, where I have anew paperon these topics,Stanford Law - Center for Internet and Societyand theVanderbilt Policy Accelerator.Photos for Verification and of Speaker Pelosi and I.REVISED POST ADDENDUM:I accidentally posted this live instead of scheduling for Monday. My bad - but the AMA is now complete. Thanks to everyone who engaged.Why I never traded individual stocks- That’s why I’m on Reddit exposing utility scams instead of on a yacht. No revolving door for me.KEY EXCHANGES:On Congress:3.5x more productive under Pelosi + four-corner agreement requirement|Bernie 2016: expanded young voters we needed|Build Back Better died: childcare, pre-K, paid leave|UAP disclosure blocked by Armed Services Republicans; helped open access research|DOGE destroying technical expertiseOn Energy:“Teapot Dome 2: Electric Boogaloo” - fossil fuel money bought Congress|Your bill’s spiking 29% from OBBB|Grid at 53% capacity - boost 33% without new plants|Data centers poisoning Memphis, North Omaha|Texas tripled capacity, saved 6-18%On Wealth:Wright Patman 1957 + $79 trillion wealth transfer during Congress’s 4-decade silence|$4 trillion OBBB wealth transferSolutions:Digital rights + Economic security + AI accountability|Start locally: State PUCs decide your ratesOn My Record:“I was the translator” - bridging technical expertise with political reality|IRA/CHIPS/Energy Act: UN called IRA biggest climate law, Energy Act 2 degrees cooler|Prison calling: dozens of calls in last 48 hours|Autism work that still helps familiesvYelling at me on Reddit is among the least effective political acts of all time. Readmy paperfor the full analysis, and please consider doing one or two more things than last year to help better candidates get elected everywhere.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

We'll be starting soon, and bear with us if replies are a bit delayed - we're squeezing in responses between race prep!Proof pic:https://imgur.com/a/Ndxa40pAlrighty - that's all we have time for today!

I'm Gidon Eshel, a geophysicist and professor at Bard College who studies the intersection of food, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.Proof. My research focuses on the environmental impacts of plant-based diets and has been featured inThe Washington Post,The Guardian,Science Magazine, and other outlets. Ask me anything!Agriculture has been reshaping Earth for millennia. Today, our individual diets continue to have a profound environmental impact, and relatively simple voluntary dietary switches can make a huge impact. Unfortunately, there is still a good deal of public confusion about the nutritional and environmental dimensions of food, some from deliberate obfuscation, and some from misapplied research (all topics I explore inmy new book).While science has limitations and rarely settles intellectual disputes definitively, my aim is to help curious, yet scientifically untrained readers navigate the bewildering discussion about our food’s environmental impact.I’ll be here from10 am – 12 pm ESTtoday (Thursday, August 21st) to answer your questions about:Our diet's impact on Earth’s climateEasy-to-apply choices for positive planetary effectsIs grass-fed beef better for the planet?Is meat essential?How to shop and eat for maximum environmental and nutritional benefitsWhy meat (and beef in particular) is one of the most powerful environmental levers we haveWhat my own diet looks likeAlternative proteinsAnything else about food and environmental sustainabilityAsk me anything!",
