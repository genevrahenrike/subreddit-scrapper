        "content": "Websites that are aggregates for other content are not allowed. The submission is not unique enough. Not unique submissions could be websites everyone on the internet already knows about, websites that do very similar things to previous submissions, websites that are very basic (e.g., a website with a timer or a website to take notes), or submissions that have been recently posted on this subreddit. webgames are not allowed. This includes quizzes, puzzles, etc. Articles, videos and static or animated images are not allowed, this includes collections (such as galleries). Blog posts, LinkedIn posts or similar are also not allowed. We do not allow any sites that are online stores, sites that serve only to sell a specific product, or paid services. Free demos or free/paid tiered services where the full version or key functionality requires payment are also not allowed. Websites that require an email address, name, or any other personal information to fully experience the website are not allowed. This includes Facebook, Google, or any other account. Also included are sites that simply serve as waitlists or newsletter sign ups, and so on. Additionally, this rule also extends to websites that require a webcam in order to function. Extensions, software (mobile or desktop) or other content which requires being downloaded before being used are not allowed. Website is slow or unresponsive. Reddit has hugged it to death and the site needs a timeout. No political posts please! To prioritize human ingenuity and effort, submissions are not allowed if their primary content is produced by AI, or if AI is used to drive functionality (especially for tasks that do not inherently require AI). This sub follows the 90/10 rule for self-promotion. If almost all your recent activity on Reddit is advertising something you made, you will not be allowed to post here. 90% of your recent participation on Reddit should have nothing to do with a site you own or operate. Posts featuring tools designed for launching products, job boards, SEO optimization, or any other tool aimed at businesses are not allowed. We enforce a standard of common decency and civility here. Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words and otherwise shitty behavior will be removed and may result in a ban."

Everything happens on your computer, so it's totally private and actually works offline once it loads...I made it free because I got tired of all these conversion tools that either cost money, have weird limits, or make you upload your personal files to who-knows-where.Would love for you to try it out and let me know what you think ! Any feedback would be awesome good or bad, I'm just trying to make something people actually want to use.Check it out:https://thefileconverter.app/",
