No judgment, no masks;  just support and a chance to feel seen. It’s made me realize how important chosen family and safe spaces are, no matter what form they take. So here’s a little love post: for everyone who’s found comfort in something unconventional; a pet, a game, a song, an AI, or a friend you never saw coming; you deserve that softness. Who or what has been your unexpected safe space lately?",

However, they, as well as the rest of their mod team, have since left, and with no active mods for the past 6 months, this subreddit’s activity has unfortunately reached a dearth. To fix this, we’ll be making a few small changes to the sub as well as making more posts to get things up and running again. Moderator applications will be held in the future, but not yet. What’s New: We’ve now added the following rule “All posts must have an Aww factor.” The intended, default, or most obvious reaction for the reader to have to your post must be for them to think or say “Aww.” If your post does not match this standard, then it would be more fitting for another subreddit instead. If you have any suggestions or feedback for the sub, feel free to leave a comment!",

Therefore, the wiki of this subreddit has r/femboy listed as ' Good subreddits for venting and other mental health needs .' But why? Usual posts on r/femboy are selfies. The thing about selfies is that they increase the likelihood of creeps spawing in DMs. And creeps are a quite major concern for the femboy community. While it might certainly be a place where one could find support, I wouldn't recommend it if it attracts creeps. That's also a reason for why I'm not very often there which also means I might assess r/femboy incorrectly. r/feminineboys is more suited for ' venting and other mental health needs .' Since it is a femboy subreddit, one is still quite likely to encounter creeps. The thing here is that images are rather not allowed in the first place, and most posts tend to be actual discussions. It is pretty common to vent, talk about mental health realated things and be supported there.",

I’ve lived through a lot of loss, rejection, and misunderstanding, especially when it came to being open hearted, soft spoken, and different. But here? I feel like there’s finally room to just be. Whether it’s sharing our pets, our joy, or just existing authentically; that’s powerful. Being yourself isn’t always easy. But it’s always worth it. And I think there’s something beautiful in us carving out a corner of the internet that says: you’re safe here. Looking forward to connecting with everyone. (and big love to the mod for keeping this place alive; I’d be honored to help however I can!) — @echoesofvalors",

The news has been grim for many, and many LGBTQ+ spaces online are rightly focusing on activism, advice and news. However this can make it even harder to find things that remind us of all the love and positivity in the community. For that reason it feels like now is the right time to relaunch and make this space a welcome break from the mayhem of the rest of the internet. We'll still be focusing on the same content - positive things, showcasing creativity from our community. or things that just made you go aww (and are related to the community in some way!) We're also looking to help LGBTQ+ creators who are migrating platform, either to Reddit, Bluesky etc. etc. For that reason we're banning any links/references to Twitter or Meta sites. We still require you to credit artists, but it must be to a platform other than Twitter or Meta. Rule Changes Rule 10 has been added, clarifying that AI Generated content and NFT content is not welcome. Please report content you have good reason to believe is AI generated.

Our sponsor gives us a lot of freedom to decide what we want our GSA to accomplish. We do a lot of educational displays and we participate in the Day of Silence and we send out a newsletter to school staff on LGBTQ+ related topics to educate them so they can support our LGBTQ+ students. But we find ourselves stuck on new ideas of what to do. We really want to finish the year having done something impactful that we are proud of and that can maybe help our peers feel comfortable at our school. There are limitations with what we can do because of our school district. But if anyone out there has ideas or if you want to share what YOUR GSA does then all ideas are welcome! *HOWEVER we try to avoid doing food related things because they are difficult to approve and you need a food handlers card for that",
