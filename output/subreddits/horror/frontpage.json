      "content_preview": "I don't know what the makers of this movie intended for this movie to be - but it certainly wasn't a horror movie.The entire movie seems like it is jerking off to the Warrens leaving the franchise. The movie beats you over the head with the fact nPatrick Wilson and Vera farmiga are leaving the franchise (at least for now!).From here onwards there will be a spoilers:-All the conjuring movies have the same overarching story line:- Ed and Lorraine warren sit down with a couple of people who have suffered a haunting - the first one is usually to introduce them - then we move on to the actual family that will be the main subjects of the film. first half will be the family suffering and trying to get in touch with the warrens, then the warrens take over in the second half. IMHO this is a decent formula for a horror movie - if done correctly and if the scares are good.This movie is so obsessed with giving a sending off to the warrens that it forgets it is a horror movie. Constantly circling back to Ed's heart issues, his daughter getting married to a boy - which they then turn into a second coming of Ed and Lorraine warren with their daughter having the same gift as Lorraine warren.The family that is the \"actual plot\" of the movie, you barely see them suffering any major \"hauntings\". In fact they have 2 teenagers, 2 kids, parents and grandparents living under the same roof, I could have made a 2 hour movie of just scares and jump scares, scaring the shit out of these 8 folks.Anytime they face any troubles, the scene just jumps to the Warrens' and what is happening with their daughter - that is important because she has the same \"gift\" as Lorraine and they probably want to make the next few conjuring movies with her as the lead.If my review seems all over the place - that's probably because the movie is all over the place, I just saw the movie an hour ago and I can't tell whether I have watched 1 movie or 2. Here's the final kicker:-When they are trying to deal with the main demon from the movie - much like the second movie - Lorraine says the main antagonist demon is using the spirits to block her vision and stops her from seeing the true evil presence haunting the family in the house. Then Ed and Lorraine warren, along with the daughter stop the 3 demons with the power of love (no joke!) and poof the movie is over. Where in the hell if the main demon that was using the 3 spirits to block your vision? Where is the actual horror in the movie? What the fcck is happening?Ohh and the final nail in the coffin - their daughter gets married and the family from the first (Perron!) and second movie (Hodgson!) make it to the wedding?Like what the actual fxck is this shit?? is this is a rom com?Overall this feels like two movies - one in which they send off the Wilson and farmiga and their daughter takes over the franchise. And the conjuring movie.Wait for streaming guys, not worth watching it in the theatre - unless your are stonned or someone is offering free all you can eat snacks !!!",

The protagonist Claire is super likeable, a genuinely nice girl who was just having fun and meets a gruesome fate through severe misunderstandings.What I found so interesting about it is actually how lighthearted it is for a horror movie. Claire is super excited AND scared when seeing the Piano key move, she's jumping around everywhere and being all happy-go-lucky. The act transitions also felt comedic, somewhat, like Act 2 ends with Claire embarrasingly \"exposing\" herself (in pyjamas) to a little kid and her mom.I get the criticisms that its not scary at all and there's not enough horror, just thought it was interesting and very depressing.",

      "content_preview": "\"The Wicker Man\" is superb at creating this atmosphere of \"something is just not right\" the second we arrive on Summerisle, no matter how cheerful and inviting the natives are. And yet is easy to side with the locals against Edward Woodward's Sergent Howie once he arrives on the island even though he's clearly the protagonist. Oddities aside, the locals appear to be a friendly and accommodating bunch just living their lives and bothering no one with their sincere pagan beliefs, while Howie, dedicated cop that he is, is also a prig of the first order and is openly intolerant of religious beliefs other than his own. Then you add in Christopher Lee at his most charismatic as Lord Summerisle, who, even though he's a pagan for practical reasons, appears sincere for doing so and it's understandable to have the mentality of \"yes, Howie's doing his job, but he doesn't have to be such a dick about it.\"But of course, this is all intentional. And come the third act, we get the revelations and we realize, \"Shit, this made us sympathize with a bunch of murderous cultists.\" You can understand why Ari Aster took all the cues for \"Midsommar\" from this.Added, I especially love the moment when Howie points out that if his sacrifice doesn't work and the crops don't get better, the only sacrifice to suffice next is Lord Summerisle himself. The reaction by Summerisle is maybe Lee's best acting moment in the film; a genuine \"oh shit\" realization of a guy who knows he's riding a tiger that will eventually devour him.",

      "content_preview": "To preface, most theories aboutThe Thingget stuck in the whodunit phase — who got turned when, and who is human in the final scene. That is the wrong question. We see the answer play out on screen, but we fail to acknowledge it. The real story is about how the Thing operates. It is not a mindless monster. It is a seasoned infiltrator with centuries — possibly millennia — of experience in survival, deception, and adaptation. Once you view it through that lens, the events of the film make complete sense.McReady was the first host in the American camp. He has the perfect profile for it. A. He is the helicopter pilot and the only one with the means to leave. B. He is one of the few the crew will follow without outright challenge. C. He can move freely between all groups, making him the ideal vector. D. Infection could have happened at any point after the dog’s arrival during his off‑screen moments. The Thing needs only moments to infect. E. The logical first plan would be to keep suspicion elsewhere, maintain the chopper, and leave under a plausible pretext or after everyone else is dead or assimilated. F. His torn clothes were found hidden early on — a clue many dismiss.This is exactly how a veteran infiltrator would operate: establish a trusted position, control mobility, and keep suspicion pointed elsewhere until extraction is possible.The plan collapses when Blair discovers the Thing’s nature and sabotages all means of communication or escape. That forces the Thing to pivot. The only engineer is now isolated and dismissed as unstable, making him the perfect host to build a new way out.The dog was never the main threat. It was a distraction and an infection vector. A seasoned infiltrator uses expendable assets to keep the enemy paranoid and divided. Fear clouds judgment, and the Thing exploits that at every turn.The blood test may have been the most effective misdirection of all. If McReady is infected, how better to remove suspicion than to run the test himself? The Thing can sacrifice a small, isolated portion to protect the whole. After a few negative results, doubt creeps in — then Palmer is revealed. That sacrifice serves two purposes:It validates the test so no one questions it.It clears McReady completely.The test only works once. A real verification would require multiple positives. In a scientific outpost, a microscope would have been the obvious choice, yet McReady never suggests it. That is the restraint of an experienced infiltrator — never offer the method that could expose you.Blair is the closest thing to a hero, but even his actions serve the Thing. His sabotage contains the threat but also ensures no one can warn the outside world. Once infected, his mechanical skills become the Thing’s greatest asset. He begins building the saucer, but when it is discovered, McReady leads the destruction — maintaining cover while eliminating a compromised plan.With the saucer gone, the objective shifts to mop‑up: eliminate survivors, destroy the outpost, and erase all evidence. McReady remains the only one who can plausibly survive to the end without suspicion.In the final scene, McReady waits for the freeze. The Thing can survive cold — it has already done so for 100,000 years — so this is likely energy conservation after the mop‑up. Childs reappears after an unexplained absence, claiming he “thought he saw someone.” The Thing does not act randomly. By now, McReady’s cells are fully alien and would be destroyed if discovered. Childs appears uninfected — until he drinks from McReady’s bottle.At the cellular level, that is all it takes. A dormant hitchhiker in saliva or a drop of blood. No symptoms, no suspicion, just a ride back to civilization. This is the patience of a predator that has been perfecting its craft for centuries. It has waited before. It will wait again. Its escape is not a matter of if, but when.",

      "content_preview": "My mom died August 19th after fighting cancer since her late 20s. She beat stomach, lung and brain but it came back and spread. among cancer she had fallen and broken 3 ribs, had pneumonia and double lung infection. She had only a lung and a half, a football sized tumor removed and brain surgery.Now to the horror part of this post, NO I’m not lost lol. My mom was a die hard horror fan mainly zombies. Specially George A. Romero, Day Of The Dead etc etc. Before she died luckily she got to see Terrifier 3 she loved the series. However I really wanted to show her Smile 2 and other horror movies. I really wanted to post her rows and rows of horror movies underneath her tv.Those movies probably atleast 200 will not be watched and sit to collect dust. One thing about my mom too is she watched every horror movie. Even if it was filmed on a  potato she gave it a chance! She wasn’t allowed out really so she would turn on horror movies so she wouldn’t be alone. She was also illiterate so she would explain certain movies by plot despite suffering brain cancer, brain bleed and brain surgery as well she would remember.Her birthday is Wednesday watch a horror movie for her! Put on your favorite zombie horror film! I’m gonna watch Night Of The Living Dead 1990 with Tony Todd who she adored. I wanted to post a photo of her collection but wasn’t allowed.Edit:OH MY GOSH THANK YOUThe outpouring of support and love is overwhelming. I didn’t even expect this much traction. I’ve even had direct messages and people using the links in my bio.Also her name was Christina.",
