I love scary, interesting stuff, especially if it implies a deeper lore.Thank you for understanding.",

I’m new to this sub so I’m wondering if there are some films in this vein that you people could put me onto so I can check them out? I’d love some recommendations!Here’s my list so far: The Babadook; It Follows; Goodnight Mommy; The Witch; Under the Shadow; The Wailing; Get Out; Hereditary; Suspiria; Us; The Lighthouse; Midsommar; Nope; Barbarian; Nosferatu; WeaponsAnd here are a few from the past decade that I like but don’t consider to be part of the same movement, either because they’re too similar to widely explored subgenres popularized before the past decade, or because their vibes are too blockbustery: The Ritual; Green Room; A Quiet Place; Sinners",

They lure the unsuspecting Americans into a trap, brainwash, rape, and murder them.And the way the main characters react to the early warning signs is like a really on the nose \"take that!\" criticism of cultural relativism and tolerance. When they watch the whole community gather to watch the elderly commit suicide, their response itn't \"OMG, these people are obviously dangerous, we gotta run!\" (only the two side characters react that way) like anybody in their right mind would have done. Nope, they stay, and Chris even says something about how \"we stick out elders in nursing homes\", which seems like the movie trying to portray him as a straw liberal.Kind of uncomfortable.",

If I act, I might be wrong—but she lives.”She's thinking \"My daughter is the only relative I have left, I can not let her die, looks like I have to guarantee she lives.\"This next paragraph is aSPOILER* of the opening sceneThis explains why the opening scene shows Ghostfaces burning Stu Macher's old house after killing the people who live there knowing they may have some connection /relationship with ethier her daughter or Ghostface since she remembers Amber being Ghostface and she owned the Stu Macher home...So she'd be Kevin Duval 2.0, because if you watch the scream tv series than you'll know that Kevin Duval kills Kieran after knowing that he is a threat to his daughter so he was like an Anti-Hero.Every kill is a calculated risk. She’s not sloppy she’s surgical. But the cult is smarter.The twist? None of the people she kills are actually in the cult.She’s been manipulated by red herrings, false clues, and trauma triggers planted by the real mastermind.Towards the end she may get caught and arrested, she may get the Laurie Strode H20 treatment where she is kept at a mental facility after killing people she thinks is apart of the massacre just like Laurie did when she thought a paramedic was Michael Myers, or she may just get away with it but have guilt in her mind knowing she killed innocent people.Now I know may some not like theory nor may not wanna see that happen but I personally believe you have to do something new with the Sidney Prescott character that. You have to do something with the character that no one would expect out of the character to avoid staleness.",

How did anyone finish watching this and think \"boy that was great, I can't wait for a sequel\". I RARELY give imdb reviews/ratings a 1 or 2 out of 10, but this movie surely deserved it. Even if I don't like a movie, I typically give it a 4 or 5 for some redeeming qualities. This film has none outside of some relatively \"pretty\" nature shots",

She implies it’s for healing, but then why keep them alive for over a month without doing anything? What was the delay?Why did the Witch appear in the dreams of people who had never met her? It’s implied she needs a connection or some “hook” to gain influence, yet she’s in strangers’ dreams anyway. Was this just for scares, or is there an in-universe explanation?Why target her own family? If she has this much control, why risk drawing attention by going after her nephew’s class and her sister’s household? She could have chosen any random family, but instead she makes herself traceable.Why leave Alex outside her control? She clearly has no problem killing him later, so why give him the freedom to move around and risk exposing her plan?Why were the kids only captured on the Ring cameras of their departure houses? Realistically, there would be dozens of other cameras in the neighborhood. Police could have cross-referenced footage to triangulate their destination.Why no forensic evidence? Having that many kids traveling together would leave footprints, clothing fibers, or other signs. Why risk gathering them all in one place?Why did no one call the police on bloody Benedict Wong running what appears to be miles? Why no police afterward?What was the Witch’s actual agenda? Her family hadn’t seen her in 15 years, but there’s no backstory: why she’s sick, why she became a witch, or why she suddenly chose to return and target her own relatives. Without context, her motives feel thin.The setup was cool, but the film would have been stronger if it had given us more about the Witch herself. One of the character vignettes should have been dedicated to her. Showing what she was doing before she appeared at her sister’s house, and why she chose this moment to strike. You could cut out the whole Teacher/Cop cheating plotline to make room for it",

And I loved the way it presented its (real) antagonist, having Satan lurking in the background, and even when in the foreground, having him depicted in an unnatural way that subverts the \"guy in makeup\" pitfall of most horror. And finally its bold editing, industrial/noise-esque sound design, and brooding cinematography also had so much of an original quality that I didn't have to feel like I was going through the motions of horror conventions and be distracted/taken out by conventional horror tropes. All of this building to the illusion that I'm witnessing true evil that almost transcends its medium, and this is precisely what I'm looking for. Not necessarily breaking the fourth wall or posing as lost media, but just having such cursed vibes that it feels like I've stumbled on something I personally wasn't meant to seeI've gotten similar feelings from the game Sad Satan, the Tomino's Hell poem in The Radio Station, Begotten (at least in its imagery in the first act), of course the Ring tapes and Sinister tapes, and I'm including in the comments a list of more movies, games, and music projects that come close (which I've ranked in terms of closeness from top to bottom). So if anybody knows of horror media of any kind that fits a similar description, I'd love to get some more recommendations, and I appreciate it in advance!",

The protagonist Claire is super likeable, a genuinely nice girl who was just having fun and meets a gruesome fate through severe misunderstandings.What I found so interesting about it is actually how lighthearted it is for a horror movie. Claire is super excited AND scared when seeing the Piano key move, she's jumping around everywhere and being all happy-go-lucky. The act transitions also felt comedic, somewhat, like Act 2 ends with Claire embarrasingly \"exposing\" herself (in pyjamas) to a little kid and her mom.I get the criticisms that its not scary at all and there's not enough horror, just thought it was interesting and very depressing.",

Did he remove the meat under the surface and sew the skin back on top? We saw her sitting later (and rubbing because it apparently still hurt) but he didnt take her whole ass. I’m sorry i kinda got hung up on how much ass we’re talking here.So either show us how it worked or pick a different body part.",

Its all there. Talk to Me, Smile 2, Nope... I haven't even seen Bring Her Back yet, but so many bangers lately. Eggers, Peele, Cregger, Aster, Tarantino (imo both deathproof and once are great horror), the A24 scene, Blumhouse, Neon... so many masters at play!
