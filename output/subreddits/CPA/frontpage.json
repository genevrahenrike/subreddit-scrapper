As the title suggests, I don't feel overly confident making my way through the MCQs for each section, but I am getting like 85%+ on each chapter. Is this normal? There's a decent chunk I can rule out with common sense and attention to details in the language (like assessing an internal auditor's competence and all the other answers are related to independence). The videos have mentioned a few times that it gets easier as you progress through the material, so I worry about spending too much time in the beginning on review if I am still doing pretty well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Best of luck to you all!",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I could really use some guidance and encouragement. ✅ Cleared FAR on first attempt with a 76 (took it July 2024) ❌ Took BAR in Oct 2024, got a 73 (so close…) ❌ Took AUD in Feb 2025, got a 68 I chose BAR because I’m a CMA and felt the content overlapped well. But wow, the BAR exam was tougher than expected. I plan to retake BAR in Oct 2025. Is the time enough? Considering I've been just doing MCQs past 2weeks like a warmup. As for AUD, I’m thinking of retaking it in Feb 2026. I need some breathing room and want to come back stronger. I’m now at a crossroads and unsure how to approach my prep. Should I: Just redo all MCQs and TBSs again? Change my strategy completely? Focus more on weak areas or try a new review provider? Would love to hear from folks who’ve been in similar shoes. What worked for you on retakes? Any study plans, tips, or mindset shifts that helped? Thanks in advance",

I definitely know more than I tell myself but unsure if that's enough to get me to a 75. I approach almost all of the mcqs using process of elimination with one almost always being a clear answer. Is that the same with the exam as it is with Becker? Is this a similar feeling for others who have sat for AUD? I have also focused a lot on carefully reading the questions and answers over the last few weeks which has also improved by SE scores and practice tests. I also perform decently with the SIMS and am planning to really hammer in those tough ones before I sit. Are there any other strategies or random mnemonics that helped others?",

The counselors said something about having plenty of time and being in a good position. Do I need to go in all day every day for the next 4 weeks? Or can I do something today here and there?

      "content_preview": "Found out on my birthday I passed my last exam. Almost two years ago I started studying for the exams and it’s been quite the journey for me! BEC - 69 FAR - 75 AUD - 83 ISC - 73 ISC - 83 REG - 83 (this was nice since my Becker expired) I see a lot of posts like these and figured why not share what I’ve learned. General yet great advice for all: Figure out what works for you and fuck what people say about your study method. Make a personal study plan and stick to it (Disciple > motivation). Daily cumulative review (MCQs and/or flashcards or notes). Obsession = success. Advice from my personal experience: Do all the MCQs and TBS. Don’t ignore the TBS. AI is a great tool to understand the why! Newt was great for ISC and REG. Don’t fall for the “easy exam” BS. I failed BEC and ISC because of that. All in all, figure out what works for you and put in the work. 1-2 years is going to pass anyways so take it one day, one exam at a time. Also do what you got to do to avoid burnout and burning interpersonal relationships, sadly, sometimes you might have to burn them. P.S. I studied while working full-time in PA and being a single-dad. It was hard and very demoralizing but the faster I finished the exams the quicker I’d be free to enjoy life again with my kiddo. We have our birthdays 3 days apart so it’s nice to celebrate three things this Labor Day weekend! Good luck, don’t give up or quit!",

I took AUD back in June and it was going great until the SIMS. 5/7 were on the SAME mgmt assertion. I got so unlucky. Got a 72. At this point, I read all these audit threads and just feel like everybody’s tips are pointless because you could just get so unlucky with the exam you get. But wish me luck bc I take AUD on 9/12 and REG the following Monday. Bc of my own personal circumstances this is how close I have to test. Please I just need to pass 1 exam already I always get so close but nothing. It’s actually so defeating. Previously I just used Becker but this time I supplemented w Ninja questions.
