Now, a cosmic enforcer known only as Oblivion is hunting her across realities, cancelling her meta-powers and threatening to tear entire worlds apart. She can still jump from universe to universe, but this time she can’t cheat her way out — if she’s going to survive, she’ll have to assemble a team of heroes, outthink a villain who literally bends the rules of the multiverse, and face the consequences of every chaotic choice she’s ever made. It’s Gwenpool like you’ve never seen her: meta, chaotic, and finally forced to play by someone else’s rules. Which heroes do you think she should recruit? How would you survive Oblivion if you were in her shoes?",

      "content_preview": "This current run is a stinky pile of straight doo doo and ca ca. Pee pee and wee whiz. I don't think that's a particularly hot take but i still just. hate it. everything about it. who is this character??? it's not gwen (poole), this is some different fucked up character. Did the writer (or more likely execs) not READ the first comic??? WHY are they making her EVIL???? This happened in strikes back too! the whole arc was, that despite the fact that being evil would get her more comics, and more chances to exist, she chose not to out of principle. That was SUCH a good ending and every comic after it just fucking. ignored it. Also she's not even the main character!! poor girl got sidelined in her own comic. this is a spiderman comic in a very unconvincing disguise, he didn't need another!! he has like 50 ongoing comics already!! This is a story about gwen (stacy (clone #6,187,236)) figuring out she's a clone and stopping whoever is controlling her. Gwen (poole) could be replaced with spider gwen and NOTHING WOULD CHANGE. i'm losing my m ind. i don't want a dark and gritty gwenpool comic. i want silly fun that ultimately has a sad and meaningful story to tell. That's what I want out of this character, who on earth saw the fun and lighthearted original comic and said \"yeah but what if we did the worst superhero trope with her\". judging by the ending of the most recent issue, this whole thing is not mainline. which is like ok good, because what the fuck was that, but also like. why. what was the point then. Just so we can get a Gwenpool Kills the Marvel Universe? Was it worth it? I doubt it'll be any good anyway on account of the poor writing of the rest of the book + the fact that SHE WOULD NOT KILL SO MANY PEOPLE THAT IS NOT SOMETHING GWEN (POOLE) WOULD DO. They have one (1) issue to rap EVERYTHING up, because god KNOWS this shit isn't getting renewed and with the pacing of the rest of the comic I have NO idea how they're gonna do that. All of this frustration and anger goes to the EXECUTIVES at marvel NOT THE WRITERS. I can SO imagine an exec going up to Cavan and being like \"hey you're going to write for this book and we want you to make it Dark and Gritty™ so that it will sell more copies. because that's definitely what people want out of Gwenpool.\" This is fuck. World is fuck. 100,000,000,000 dead gwenpools. I have many other issues with this comic but this was my brief rant. ok thank you goodbye mwah",

I had 1-9 from when they were released but Hurricane Ian ate them. eBay isn’t much better. Does anyone have a plug?",

If she got her deserved project for the new MCU, she should go first. Her project would be about showing us the viewers this new world. Where the x-men, fantastic four, and avengers all exist with each other.  She would be our stand in for how we feel about this new world. Excited but nervous. What you all think? And any other ideas?",
