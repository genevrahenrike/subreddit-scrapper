      "content_preview": "You see that girl you are dating now, she has a higher chance of making it in life faster than you. This is why you shouldn't spend all your youthfulness building relationship with a woman. The truth is she can easily walk out of that relationship and go ahead and marry an already made man, a man who has figured his life out, who has money and enough resources and on the strength of her marriage with the already man she has made it in life. Whereas, you as a man is own your own, nobody is coming to save you, nobody cares about you, people don't even love you until you have value. You see why investing all your youthfulness with a woman can be very dangerous and unhealthy for your future. Women has more leverage early in life than man, like this like this, she's already winning you, the world is more fair to her than you and this is why you need to focus more on your purpose than you are focusing on her. If you fail to make it in life, you will suffer in her hand, she will finally dump you for another man who didn't fail to make it. Forget all those romantic bullishit she use to assure you \" that she will be with you forever\" its a lie, when jungle mature she will disappear. The truth is most women are just managing your brokeness because they don't have a better option yet the moment a better option present itself she will abandon you and forget all your sacrifices and all her words, women knows nothing like loyalty. This is why as a young man, you don't have to spend all your time focusing and chasing women up and down, women are big distraction to a man who is not purpose driven. They will drain you and leave you. Hustle for yourself, take your life more serious, read books, learn skills, develop and harness your masculine power, be more focus on becoming a better man, invest in your mind at the end of this is the only thing that will never leave you through thick and thin. Be wise. üôè",

You can choose to set a boundary. and ur boundary is personal. not universal law. You can choose to not participate if sth is not according to your liking. ¬†It does not mean storming into a room of people and insisting they all stop what they're doing because u dont like it. Everyone is different. Just because you choose to see the world through a narrow lens does not mean all of us must narrow our entire field of vision to match yours as well. Your freedom to hate sth does not have to mean you get to deny everyone elses freedom. as long as they dont attack u or ur rights. (also we must be careful of kids. bt since one of the mod seems to be a kid, i dont really know if they should be able to moderate a server with ns fw flairs allowed as well. )",

      "content_preview": "So I‚Äôm currently in a one-sided love with a friend of mine. She‚Äôs 25F and I‚Äôm 20M. She‚Äôs Newar and I‚Äôm Bahun . She works as a nurse with 3 years of experience, and I‚Äôm still just an IT student in my 4th year. The thing is, we vibe really well. We go on ‚Äúdates‚Äù (just the two of us), hang out at cafes, and talk a lot. She smokes while I just sit there listening to her. Recently, her family has been pressuring her to get married. I really don‚Äôt want her to marry right now,it honestly terrifies me. The problem is, she‚Äôs been talking to a guy who lives in the US for about a year now. But from what I see, that guy doesn‚Äôt really show much interest in her. Still, I‚Äôm scared of losing her. I can‚Äôt sleep at night, constantly worrying about rejection or not being able to marry her someday. Finally, yesterday morning, I gathered up the courage and confessed to her. I told her I have a crush on her. She just asked, ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù and when I said yes, she laughed. That crushed me. But here‚Äôs the twist,later that night, around 3 AM, she called me while drunk and just started talking randomly. Then at 3:40 AM, she called again just to apologize for disturbing me. Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I see her in my dreams, I can‚Äôt sleep properly, and my feelings are all over the place.",

He‚Äôs a software engineer working for a foreign company, supposedly earning 1-2 lakhs a month (his words not mine). We vibed super well over texts for about a month, so we decided to meet up for a date. First date: We went to a chill restaurant he picked for coffee and lunch. We had a great time, good convo, and I could actually see this turning into something more. When it was time to leave, I stood up and asked the counter \"Kati vayo?\". This dude just stood there zero expression, no move to offer, nothing. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, paid the bill, and thought maybe he‚Äôll offer next time. Second date: He suggested we do one of those cute paint on a small canvas thing, which sounded fun. We went, had a good time again, but when it was time to pay, SAME THING. No offer, no gesture, just standing there like a statue.  I paid again. Now, this guy wants to go for a third date some stupid zipline in freaking Nagarkot. And I‚Äôm already annoyed. Like, what the actual hell is this ?  I‚Äôm totally fine with splitting bills or going 50/50, but this dude brags NON STOP about his lakh ma aaune salary yet can‚Äôt even offer to pay for a Rs. 500 date? It‚Äôs not about the money it‚Äôs the principle. At least pretend you‚Äôre gonna reach for your wallet or something, you know? Am I overreacting, or is this a red flag?
