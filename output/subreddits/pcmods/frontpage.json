I am really enjoying pc overall now so im def going to need an upgrade. Problems: Very laggy, low or ultra-low game settings only to play, slow start up time, can't run Spotify and discord at the same time, i think my SSD or hard drive is cooked cuz i can't recognize them in my files section Specs: Intel i5-9400F @2.90 GHZ, GeForce GTX 1650 super (4GB), 16 GB RAM, B365M DS3H WIFI (motherboard I believe?), 932 GB storage (813 GB used) Games I play most : NBA 2K, Madden, Call of Duty, Battlefield 6 (when it drops obviously), Fortnite, CS2, Valorant, Rocket League, GTA (FiveM) Would this be a \"Get more RAM\" kind of thing or am I seriously due for an upgrade? I'm new to this so let me know if you need any more info on the pc. I am looking to upgrade though so I can play COD and Battlefield 6 with my friends. Please help!",

      "content_preview": "Hey r/pcmods ! 👋 I'm currently working on a concept that some of you might find exciting: interactive anime characters that can be integrated directly into your PC case. Here's the idea: • Magnetic attachment: The figures can be flexibly placed on housing plates or GPU backplates. • ARGB integration: Using a controller like Lian Li Connect or similar systems, the figures can control LEDs in sync with your housing effects. • Interactivity: In the future, the characters could even react to gameplay or PC temperatures, e.g. B. glowing effects when the GPU is under load. • High-quality design: The figures should be heat-resistant and visually appealing, with attention to detail for collectors and modders. • Own software: Instead of standard lighting effects, I'm planning my own app/software that enables effects typical of anime, e.g. E.g. scenes from the series, special light animations etc. Goal: An exclusive, high-quality collector's item that visually enhances gaming PCs and is interactive at the same time. Questions for you: • Would you buy something like this if the figure was e.g. B. costs €200? • Which anime or gaming franchises would be most interesting to you? • What features would you like to see (e.g. reaction to GPU temperatures, sound, animations)? I look forward to feedback, ideas or discussions! 🔥",

      "content_preview": "Intro Alright, bit of a long one here. If you’re the type who needs Subway Surfers running on split screen just to keep focus, this post probably isn’t for you lol. For everyone else, here’s the story of how I built my wall frame PC. End Result Background story Back around plague time (Covid 2020), I was in touch with a mate who’s always been a big gamer. He had upgraded his rig and his old one was sitting unused. The thing is, this wasn’t just some random PC to him - it was his first proper gaming machine, something he worked hard to save for, and it meant a lot to him. Basically a relic. He didn’t want it to be wasted or stripped for parts, but he also didn’t know what to do with it. At the time I wasn’t really gaming much myself, just using a laptop. It was fine for work and portability, but the integrated graphics held me back from playing anything newer and i felt sad that Deus Ex (one of my favourite series) wouldn’t be able to run properly. So I made him a deal: I’d buy the rig for a friendly price, promise not to sell it on or gut it for parts for at least five years, and if he ever wanted it back for sentimental reasons, I’d hand it over no questions asked. He agreed, and I got the PC along with a monitor. Fast forward a few years - I looked after this big a*s prebuilt ROG machine – big a*s because it was inside Fractal Define XL R2 (the one with the crazy “shotgun-proof” marketing stunt lol). The trouble was I really don’t like massive cases, and as you might know - in the UK homes space is often tight. The PC still ran fine for what I needed, but the time limit was up, meaning I could finally do something about it... CHUNKY Boy for comparison The hunt for an idea My first thought was just to shrink it down somehow. Maybe a smaller custom case. Maybe build it into some random object (I always remembered those mini rigs built inside Jack Daniels bottles - except obviously this one wouldn’t fit lol). Maybe stick it into one of those rounded-corner IKEA square shelves with perspex – sadly (or thankfully) I could never get hold of the shelf. Thought about a table build - but didn’t have a nice table worth sacrificing. Then I toyed with the idea of a picture-frame PC. But the more I imagined it, the more it bugged me. Either the parts would stick out of the frame (which I hated), or I’d have to use a very thick frame which defeated the point. The “aha” moment While browsing other people’s DIY picture frame builds online, I stumbled across wall-mounted PC frames. Instantly I loved the concept - slim, tidy, visible, and space-saving. But the reality? The ones on sale were ridiculous. £300+ for a plain aluminium rectangle Oversized and universal, with loads of wasted space Industrial-looking, ugly, and not something you’d want hanging in your living room Clearly made for stuffing full of RGB strips and messy cables for “gamer bling” That wasn’t what I wanted. I wanted something slim, minimal, and futuristic-looking - not a giant industrial slab with RGB spaghetti vomit all over it. So that’s when the challenge idea was born: build my own budget £100 wall frame PC. Planning & wood hunt Once I settled on the wall frame idea, the next challenge was materials. The whole point was to keep it budget-friendly, not go out and buy fancy timber like I was building a designer coffee table...This was more of a “train the brain” project - a challenge to problem-solve with what I had or could scavenge cheaply. The issue was weight and thickness. All the old furniture pieces I had were at least 1cm thick, which was too heavy and too chunky for what I wanted. My vision was a slim profile, almost flat against the wall. Then pure luck hit. At work, my workplace was throwing out some old shelving. Not sure what you call this type of pressed wood, but the grain/dust mix they used was way finer than your standard chipboard. Best part? Only 6mm thick. Absolutely perfect! I asked if I could take a piece - they said “sure, no probs”. And just like that, the project got a huge motivation boost. Classic ADHD moment: as soon as I had the perfect material in my hands, my brain went into overdrive planning the whole thing - I have to be specific here - it took me around 4 months to constantly think about it whenever I had a chance to free the space in the brains for the project. Step 1 – Layout & Measuring First things first: measuring everything. That was its own challenge because the PC was still in active use at the time - so it was a lot of awkward swapping around, but I’ll skip the boring part. Once I had the dimensions, I drew a basic layout directly onto the wooden board. Even in its raw state it looked good - the board already had a nice dark tone that gave it a solid vibe. But I knew I wouldn’t leave it bare. From the start, I wanted the whole thing to feel more “tech” and futuristic, not just “here’s some PC parts bolted to a shelf” and that’s where the idea to get a carbon fibre wrap - cheap, sleek, and tied in nicely with the whole Deus Ex inspiration (carbon fibre being the material used in augmentation) came in - but I’ll expand on that later on. At the same time, I was already thinking ahead about cable management, how I could bend/route things without snapping them, and how I’d eventually deal with the big Cooler Master block cooler that stuck out like a sore thumb. Measuring and Planning Step 2 – Problem Solving While I was drawing and sketching, I was also actively hunting for solutions to all the problems I could already see coming. Cables - My first headache was figuring out how to “bend” cables cleanly without actually damaging them. I wanted the whole thing to look neat, not like a snake pit. CPU cooler - The stock Cooler Master aluminium brick wasn’t going to cut it. It stuck out like a sore thumb, ruined the slim profile I was after, and just looked bulky. GPU - Mounting the GPU on a flat board? No chance with the standard slot. Thankfully I discovered PCIe extension cables - miracle solution. Suddenly it was actually possible to put the GPU where I wanted. PSU & cables -  The original PSU was a big a*s non modular unit with way more wattage than I needed. Heavy, thick, fan ran loud - all the time with no control. I even considered desoldering unused cables to tidy it but that wouldn’t fix size or weight, and it would still stick the whole frame off the wall. After a lot of digging I found that the company who makes PSUs for brands like Corsair, Thermaltake, NZXT,Antec etc. Famous brands and while quite rare - they also sell their own OEM units. They had a model that ticked every box for this build - slim profile, modular, and hybrid 0 RPM fan mode. Exactly what I needed so the frame wouldn’t bulge out. While searching around, I started discovering parts that made this whole project click together: L-shaped connectors - for the PSU, on both ends, which massively helped with cable routing. AIO liquid cooler - I hadn’t looked at liquid cooling in years, and last time it was all custom loops, refills, and maintenance nightmares. Finding out AIOs existed (all-in-one, sealed, and maintenance-free) felt perfect for this job. LEDs & controller - I wanted simple LED lighting to highlight the PC, but my old motherboard didn’t support it. After some digging, I found a cheap little controller that would handle it, and it looked decent too. Motherboard backlight - grabbed an LED frame that sits under the motherboard. It gave off a nice glow around the edge and also meant the board didn’t sit directly on the wood (even though it would eventually be vinyl-wrapped, I was still a bit paranoid about heat and grounding). Fancy PSU connector - I found a 24-pin L-shaped PSU connector with built-in addressable LEDs. Completely unnecessary, but it was another small “cherry on top”. NVME heatsink - at this point the online shop algorithms started feeding me more “shiny things”. I ended up grabbing an NVME heatsink with the same infinity mirror look as the AIO cooler - and yes, with ARGB. Had to get it. PCIe adapters - also picked up slim PCIe adapter for the extra NVME drive and I had one already lying around. No sense wasting them. SATA drives - I still had a spare SSD and NVME. Flat SATA cables worked perfectly for bending around tight spaces and hide these in the back, so I hooked those up too. Piece by piece, it felt like the puzzle was coming together. Figuring out how I'll place AIO and tubes Step 3 – Style & Aesthetics Looks were a big part of this project. I didn’t want it to end up like the generic wall frames I’d seen online - plain aluminium, industrial, oversized, and ugly. Since it was going to hang on the wall, it needed to look intentional, not just like I glued computer parts to a board. I went through a few ideas for the finish: Leather wrap imitation - would’ve been unusual, but hard to make it look right. Brushed metal - nice in theory, but it risked looking cheap or tacky if not done perfectly. Carbon fibre wrap - this one stuck. Cheap, sleek, and tied perfectly into the Deus Ex inspiration I kept coming back to. Carbon wrap won. Easy choice. I didn’t stop there - I also wanted small details that would give it a bit of character without turning it into RGB vomit. While browsing online marketplaces, I stumbled across self-adhesive golden PVC furniture strips with a rounded edge. Dirt cheap. Instantly gave me cyberpunk vibes - specifically that flashy but stylised Neokitsch look (if you know, you know). So I bought that too. The idea was to use it sparingly: to smooth rough edges, hide imperfections, and give subtle golden highlights without making it gaudy. Little accents that would act as the “cherry on top” once the build was done. https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-7nxmsw01fskf1.jpg Step 4 – Tools, Cutouts & “Ghetto DIY” Once I had the board, the wrap, and a rough idea of placement, it was time to actually make space for everything. This is where the “DIY on a budget” part really showed. My tools were… limited. So some of the cutouts I made were definitely in full “ghetto mode”. Lots of frustration and a few questionable cuts later, I managed to carve out the areas I needed: Holes for screws where I knew components would need proper support (like securing the GPU). Cutouts for cable routing where absolutely necessary. Spaces for brackets, connectors, and airflow. https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-n3l6r39ciskf1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-0zp7e68plskf1.jpg Then came the GPU problem. Mounting a GPU flat against a wooden board isn’t straightforward. I ended up improvising with random aluminium offcut I saved from an old TV repair attempt (one of those “this might be useful one day” boxes actually paying off). https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-dmmx9zbsiskf1.jpg The great thing was these pieces already had raised threads in them, so they acted as ready-made mounting points. I cut them to shape, drilled matching holes in the board, and used longer screws plus washers to clamp everything neatly. Surprisingly solid solution for something so improvised. Before doing it for real tho I gave the GPU a full refresh. Repasted it and replaced every single thermal pad I could find with fresh ones from a mixed pack. I’m pretty sure this helped with the overclock later. Cleaning old Residue with Isopropyl and placing fresh pads (the power inductors and capacitors on the left also had fresh strips placed on them but weren't done before this picture was taken) Next issue: the GPU’s lighting and design. The logo originally had a bright LED behind it (white/red glow) which I hated. Thankfully it was just a connector I could unplug - problem solved. One of the decorative plastic elements was red. Not part of my vision. Luckily it was attached with push clips, so I popped it off. But here’s where it got weird: I didn’t have any neat part to replace it with. So I grabbed wall filler (yes, the same stuff you patch cracks in plaster lol). I used it to flatten the shape, sanded it down smooth with fine sandpaper, and then wrapped it in the same carbon vinyl. Worked way better than it had any right to. \"Ghetto DIY\" using filler so I could wrap it smoothly. The last awkward bit was the GPU connector. I bought an angled HDMI adapter, but it turned out to drop the refresh rate down to 60 Hz. My monitor can do 144 Hz, and I wasn’t going to lose that. So I had no choice but to use the bulky Dual-Link DVI-D connector instead. The cable itself could be “gently” folded, but the connector block stuck out like a sore thumb. Solution? Wrapped the connector itself in thin leftover vinyl slices. It wasn’t perfect (the surface wasn’t smooth), but it blended in way better than I was hoping for. Step 5 – Eeemotional Damage! So far things were going surprisingly well… until the moment that nearly killed the whole project. At one point when I had the CPU out of the socket, I managed to drop a screwdriver right onto the CPU socket pins. Yep. That heart-sinking, “oh f***” moment. I looked closer and could see something reflecting light weirdly - one of the pins looked bent. And we’re talking hair-thin, microscopic pins here. In pure panic, I tried to just seat the CPU anyway and boot it. Nope. No joy. The error codes confirmed it: CPU not being detected properly. At that moment I thought the whole project was bricked. Months of planning, all the parts, and the one thing you absolutely can’t screw up had been ruined by my clumsiness. Then I remembered I had a little USB hobby microscope lying around. Honestly, this thing saved the build. Under magnification, I could see the bent pin clearly. I spent the next two hours painstakingly nudging it back into place with the smallest, slowest movements possible - we’re talking nanometres at a time (I feel pain just thinking about it now lol) – i was terrified it would just snap off. Finally, after what felt like microsurgery, I slotted the CPU back in. Held my breath, pressed the power button… and it POSTed. It actually worked! The relief was unreal - I genuinely felt like a surgeon who had just resurrected Frankenstein haha. That one bent pin nearly gave me emotional damage for life, but somehow, it lived. At some stage here I also repasted the CPU properly using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme – it was best one I could find at that point. https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-ekfukycdlskf1.jpg Step 6 – Final Touches & Cable Management With the major components mounted and the scary CPU surgery behind me, it was time for the little details - the part where neatness makes or breaks the look :) LAN cable - I didn’t want a big chunky cable sticking straight out. My first thought was to run a flat LAN cable directly under the motherboard. Problem was - what if I ever needed to disconnect it? Not viable.... I then tried an L-shaped extender, but the way it angled meant it stuck out even more. Finally, I found a slim extension cable. Routed it neatly under the board, between the LED backlight panel and the motherboard (tight fit, but it worked). In the end, only a barely-visible round cable sticks out, which I can live with. USB headers - I used angled USB connector to keep things tidy. For example, one tiny angled cable went to the little 3.5-inch IPS screen I added, which displays system stats. Another L-shaped connector went next to the LAN port and routed it in the same way, leading to a discreet 4-in-1 USB hub mounted on the wall just above the mouse. This hub is purely for keyboard/mouse and plugging in my FIDO security key when I’m working. Front panel audio - I salvaged an old front panel part from another PC case (with mic + audio + 2x USB) but I didn’t want those little pin bundles showing up like a bundled mess so I wrapped the cabling with the electrical fabric like tape to make it tidy and routed it through a small hole I drilled under the motherboard near the GPU. Invisible once in place Visible cables - For the few cables that had to be seen (like the 4+4 CPU power, PCIe 6-pin that vent into GPU and some headers), I wrapped them with the same fabric style electrical tape. It made them look like single clean cables instead of messy bundles of little wires :) Power button - Obviously I no longer had a case button. The motherboard’s built-in button was now blocked by the flat PCIe riser cables. Solution: I bought a small button that looked like a keyboard key. Routed it neatly and glued it behind the monitor stand. Now I’ve got a “secret” power button hidden away but easy to reach :) PSU fan noise fix - The slim modular PSU was perfect, but its hybrid fan control kept throttling on/off (this started after I overclocked GPU and CPU), making annoying high-pitched spin-up noises. My fix? A tiny 40×40×20 mm fan blowing constantly across the PSU. Totally silent, and it stopped the PSU fan from what i would call - “hunting”. Now it only kicks in under heavy load and stays consistent. Golden PVC accents - Finally, I used those golden PVC strips I’d bought. Originally for trimming the board edges, I ended up cutting leftover bits into small sections and sticking them around as accents: a strip along the left side of the motherboard, small offcuts around the LED controller, one along the PSU and even a couple of tiny pieces on the GPU and 24pin connector. Minimal touches, but it tied the whole thing together with that cyberpunk Neokitsch vibe. All these little details were the finishing touches that turned it from “DIY PC parts bolted to wood” into something that actually looked like a proper design in the way I personally liked. https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-2o1lei7unskf1.jpg Step 7 – Performance & Overclocking After the frame was complete and all the cables hidden, it was finally time to see how well the cooling and all those tweaks actually worked. I knew very well that the components were ageing, so this was the part where I didn’t want to rush. Repasting & thermal pads - Earlier in the build I’d already repasted whatever I could so I was fairly sure this would make a difference once I started pushing clocks. AIO cooler - The affordable dual-fan AIO was the real game changer here. Compared to that massive Cooler Master aluminium tower, this not only looked cleaner on the wall but also gave me way better thermal headroom to actually overclock without cooking the chip and the temps are ideal 100% of the time. CPU overclock - Stock was 3.4 GHz. After loads of trial and error (and a few panicky restarts), I managed to get it stable at 4.4 GHz. That’s about a 33% uplift, and thanks to the fresh paste and AIO it stayed stable under extended stress testing. Max temps peaked around 77°C  - which is pretty amazing considering the age of the silicon ;) GPU overclock - This was where the new pads + paste really shone. I built a custom VF curve and managed to flatline the core at around 1950–2000 MHz at the higher voltages. On top of that, I overclocked the memory by +485 MHz (~9400 MHz effective). Anything beyond that gave me artefacts and benchmark crashes :( I dialled it back to this max stable point. I also set the power limit to 118%.   result: 12-15% performance increase on the GPU, completely stable. System behaviour - With both CPU and GPU refreshed, the whole system ran smoother, quieter, and cooler. The PSU’s hybrid fan control did start properly at higher loads. In summary: CPU: 3.4 -> 4.4 GHz (~33% boost) with temps never exceeding 77°C. GPU: +12-15% stable boost with custom VF curve + memory OC, no artefacts. For what started out as a sentimental “big a*s relic” in a bulky shotgun-proof case, it now runs like a modernised, wall-mounted cyberpunk machine - just the way I imagined it! :) GPU Voltage Curve https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-7vkzirb6pskf1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-59smwkkopskf1.jpg But can it run Crysis? Ops...wrong decade....It runs Cyberpunk at solid 60fps with AMD fidelity resolution on Quality. Almost everything is maxed - I’ve had to nudge couple of shadow settings and volumetric clouds down a notch to get it stable 60 and I’m running quite a few mods, including a 2K texture pack - which just makes it look so much better :) Pretty sure it's all down to the maxed OC and the fact I’m on a 1080p monitor - I honestly can’t tell 2K from 1080p anymore, probably getting old, no jaggies too. Only thing I notice is the odd fuzzy NPC hair now and then, not sure if that’s my settings or the game. Rest looks excellent to my eyes and I’m happy to skip ray tracing for now :) Min 55.59fps, average 69.32fps, max 83.41fps with in game benchmark https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-3lm9fmnfyskf1.jpg Step 8 – Cost Breakdown & Closing Since this was meant to be the “£100 challenge”, here’s the full breakdown of what I actually spent. Keep in mind: A lot of this was bought during sales or as bundle deals. Most of it was from China as I tried to eliminate middle-man costs and when buying from there the shipping is often half the price of the product – so when bundling up products it ends up dirt cheap. A few things were completely free (scavenged wood, screws, nvme to PCIe card, usb cables, offcuts etc). https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-vttbk3gjzskf1.jpg Case & Mounting Wooden board - Free TV wall mount bracket (adjustable) - £8.09 Carbon black vinyl wrap - £3.00 Self-adhesive golden decorative PVC strip (3 metres) - £2.37 Subtotal: £13.46 Hardware & Fasteners Screws, nuts, bolts, bracket - Free (from \"one day this might be useful box\") Electrical insulating tape - £1.40 Subtotal: £1.40 Cooling & Thermal Teucer AIO dual-fan liquid cooler - £29.78 ARGB heatsink for NVME drive - £3.10 Thermal paste 1g (Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme) - £5.10 40×40×20 mm cooling fan (for PSU) - £1.50 Pack of thermal pads - £1.80 Subtotal: £41.28 Lighting & Aesthetics PWM & ARGB hub with remote - £3.20 Motherboard ARGB backlight - £10.89 Teucer ARGB 24-pin ATX adapter (90 degrees) - £3.63 Subtotal: £17.72 Power & Connectivity Teucer power-on switch - £1.60 ATX 24-pin 90-degree power connector - £2.32 C14 to C13 AC adapter 90-degree (for PSU) - £1.10 Subtotal: £5.02 Display & Expansion 3.5-inch IPS type-C secondary screen - £8.10 USB-C 90-degree converter (for mini screen) - £1.31 PCIe x1 riser 90-degree extension cable - £3.42 PCIe 3.0 x16 riser cable 25 cm - £10.59 PCIe adapter for NVME drive - £1.65 Subtotal: £25.07 Adapters & Cables USB down-angle 20 cm male to female adapter - £0.92 Round desktop USB splitter with external power supply - £5.41 RJ45 female-to-female adapter (for LAN cable) - £1.27 LAN cable (mainboard to adapter, 50 cm) - £2.59 Subtotal: £10.19 Overall Total: £114.14 - Technically a little over the £100 target, but the core frame itself sits within budget. The extra £14 came from a few aesthetic and quality-of-life additions that could easily have been skipped if sticking strictly to £100. Extras: Cleaning brush with long bristles (for dust removal) – £1.30 Ferrite core clamp (noise suppressor for 3.5 mm audio cable) – £2.06 Subtotal: £3.36 Why post the whole saga I really miss seeing people experiment. Feels like we’ve outsourced creativity to premade stuff and “buy now” buttons. This post is a reminder that you can upcycle, bodge, learn, fail, fix a bent pin under a microscope and end up with something you’re proud of! If you’re not sure where to start, start small and start messy. You will figure it out on the way. If this post helps one person try, that’s the win. Quick disclaimer I’m not a pro - just a hobbyist who loves problem solving. My day job has nothing to do with PCs or electronics at all. I learned most of this as I went along with manuals, forums and a lot of trial and error. I’m sure there are things I did wrong or could have done cleaner - that’s fine. The point is to try, learn, and improve! If you’re unsure, just start Start tiny and accept it will be messy at first. Use what you already have and set yourself a budget rule. Sketch the layout or mock it on cardboard before drilling anything. Label cables, take photos before you unplug - trust me, keep screws in little bags. \"Breadboard\" it first - get a clean POST before mounting. Power off at the wall, check clearances, avoid shorts, be patient with tools. Expect setbacks. Wrong parts, returns, bent pins - it happens. Share progress or make a journal like I did...ask the sub for tips. People will help if you show your work. If this nudges even one person to try an upcycle or a weird budget build, that’s a win in my book. I’ll finish this with the quote: \"It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.\" Seneca https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-rag3xq5k1tkf1.jpg Trigger warning for symmetry lovers - it's deliberately offset https://preview.redd.it/diy-wall-mounted-pc-on-a-100-budget-with-aio-v0-jdq04inq1tkf1.jpg",

But cpu temp shows in round up numbers like “45C°” But FPS shows like 129.378. Anyone know how can I make it show roundup numbers instead of decimal? Their customer support are not responding to my emails so I thought I’d ask here.",

Since then, 2 of the fans had failed and had to be replaced, which were easy to find a year ago on eBay for a reasonable price. Now the 3rd is failing and apparently they are in very limited supply and hard to find or are extremely expensive. I've reached out to Deepcool and they no longer have replacement parts available. Was wondering if the fan connection is proprietary, and if so, is it possible to cut off the proprietary connector from the old FC120 and solder it to a different brand fan that has the same voltage/wattage specifications. Or even better, if there is a direct replacement. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Just trying to avoid having to replace the entire AIO cooler, being the only thing wrong is a single fan at this point. The other option I considered was disassembly and repair but i pretty confident that would just destroy the fan being it appears to be a sealed unit.",

There is a tall capacitor right where the higher lane pci express slot would be. I had the idea of grinding/melting the x4 slot to fit a full size graphics card there, but the capacitor is blocking it. I was wondering, does the 5v cap supply mainly the PCI express slot, and would the graphics card be reliant on it? I could just try removing it. Or I could consider replacing it with a lower fahrad version that takes less space, or then attaching the capacitors with wires and gluing.  Any thoughts?",

I want the theme to be an amalgam of flesh and machine. Like somesort of failed cyborg or something. Can any of you think of mods that have that kind of semi organic look to them?",
