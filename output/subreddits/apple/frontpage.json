No matter what I try, it only ever recognizes one at monitor a time but both displays work perfectly on my older M1 machine. After weeks with Apple support, a senior rep finally told me the cause: one of the monitors supports 240 Hz refresh. Even if it’s set to a lower rate, the fact that it’s capable of 240 Hz supposedly prevents the M4 from detecting a second monitor altogether. Apple advertises the M4 as supporting two external 4K displays at 120 Hz but if support is correct, that seems like a pretty big misrepresentation. In any case, has anyone else had similar issues?",

      "content_preview": "Download Fluidium on the App Store I'm a creative technologist who really likes working with interactive art style applications - things that people can just play with to relax or make some cool art or wallpapers. I was added to the App Store Hall of Fame a while ago for my work on the particle animation app Uzu. This new project is called Fluidium and it's based on a fluid simulation that I originally implemented in WebGL, but then I ported it to iOS Metal because I wanted to see it running at 120 fps. Using metal directly also gives more performance headroom for doing some interesting things with reflection mapping and additional effects. You may have seen fluid simulations on iOS before, but I tried to add some things that the others just don't have. The real-time reflection mapping creates beautiful glossy or satin-like effects and I've implemented a number of brush types and \"velocity fields\" for creating interesting shapes and interactivity. There are over 130 unique factory presets, but you can also tweak things and save your own presets as well. There is also an auto-play feature where it will simulate touches moving across the screen while randomly switching presets - so it's great for just chilling and watching with your favorite music. The app is free to download with 25 free presets and a number of free settings to tweak. A one-time purchase of $4.99 (in the US) will unlock all 130+ presets and all the features. Thank you so much for checking it out. If you like it, please consider sharing it with your friends or leaving a review - every bit helps! Features: 130 stunning factory presets to spark your imagination Design and save your own presets for unlimited creativity Real-time interactive fluid simulation powered by Metal for unmatched speed and beauty Deep customization options to fine-tune every detail 4 expressive brush types, each with unique dynamics Advanced reflection effects for immersive visuals Generate stunning wallpapers and background images Record HD videos of your creations to share or keep Smart Pause freezes the flow when you lift your fingers Auto-Play mode for hands-free relaxation and inspiration Optimized quality settings for smooth performance on any device One-time in app purchase for unlocking all features",

Also, it seems really insecure to still be using a phone number as an authentication method. I'm away from my home country, studying for 9 monts. I have closed my phone number back home for that period so I cannot access it. I have temporary phone number here that I DO NOT EVER  want to use for authentication for anything. I have only one Apple device, my MacBook which I want to sell to get a newer model. To sell it, I would need to reset my MacBook. Once I do that, I'm locked out of my Apple account. Way to go Apple! Why can't I use third party authenticator? Or why can't I at least use an email as an authentication method??? If I reset my MacBook, then the only thing I can do is start the recovery process. This takes days and I don't even know what information they might ask. I created the account so long ago, I might not remember or even have the information they require.",
