      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! After checking several posts, I found that the commonly suggested minimum tank volume for fancy goldfish is: 20 gal for 1 fancy 30 gal for 2 fancies (+10 gal for each additional fancy) I live in Japan, where apartment space is usually small and compact. Sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to fit a 30 or 40 gal tank into an apartment because it takes up too much space. Most of them buy 20gal tank. What‚Äôs interesting is that in Japanese books, forums, and videos, the rule of thumb is about 0.55 gal per 0.39 inches of goldfish length. Using that formula, unless your goldfish is over ~8 inches, it‚Äôs considered safe here to keep 2 fancies in a 20 gal tank. What do you think of this Japanese rule of thumb? On Reddit, is the concern about tank size mostly about the limited swimming area, or more about ammonia spikes from bioload?",

I feel silly being this sad about it but I‚Äôve been crying all morning. I have a cat, a dog and a one year old baby so it‚Äôs not like he was my only animal. I‚Äôm pretty worried that if I‚Äôm this upset over him, I really don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna handle my dog and cat when that dreaded day comes. I just needed to vent and get it out. Thanks :(",

      "content_preview": "We ended up with two goldfish as a goody bag from a B-day party for their kid. ( I know, I know)  2 months later I just finished setting up a 75 gallon tank in my basement.  My wife has been an amazing caretaker - they are healthy, growing, and happy through her constant 15-20 gallon tank maintenance that she panic purchased to keep them in other than the tiny bowls that were thrust into her hands while she was leaving. We will eventually plan to rehome them if they outgrow this tank - but for now our children are attached. I've read and watched hours of how-to setup a canister filter appropriately for the bioload created by a goldfish.  I cannot for the life of me find a \"solved\" solution. We bought a fluval all in one tank (75 gallon sienna).  It has a Fluval 407 canister filter.  After all my reading here is my planned filter media setup, can you let me know if I should make any changes or am heading in the wrong direction? Pre-filter:  No change to factory pads Level 1: No change to factory black pad and filter floss Level 2: Add additional bio-media (Fluval Bio-FX) to tray with factory bio-media (ceramic tubes) Level 3: Full bin of Seachem Matrix Level 4: Save this for activated carbon, purigen, additional filter floss, or pads to target specific tank params (ammonia/nitrites/phosphates/etc).  I'm thinking I'll run mostly purigen and filterfloss as the default. Lastly, I want to plant this tank.  Maybe not now because it seems goldfish are buttheads and eat all the plants.  But would it hurt for me to place a solid planting substrates under the gravel for future use, and maybe to house additional beneficial bacteria?",

      "content_preview": "I am aware Goldfish are semi-aggressive to properly aggressive. I have a fairly large goldfish named Wagner, who is about three years old. They're in around a 30-ish? (I dont remember the packaging it was one of those \"fully set up things\") gallon tank. Wagner grew up as the biggest with three other goldfish, and came from a carnival which stopped me and gave me a few at the end of the night suggesting they didn't look the best and he had heard it was my birthday. Like... thanks. I love dying fish as a gift. Most of them made it to two years until a tragic filter issue. The filter fell off the side of the tank, and my whole family and me were at work. Unfortunately, three of them died to the lack of oxygen. Wagner, somehow, prevailed. For a long time I've lived with the idea that goldfish are expensive at pet stores and never got him another mate. He seemed totally okay with this. But, recently I went to get minnows to test him with them as tank mates (did not go well) and ended up getting the only olive colored goldfish there. Eduardo. Eduardo seemed to be doing fine. Hid from Wagner a lot, but was overall okay. Yesterday, at around 1 pm, I did a full water change and added better gravel. I ran out of testing sticks the night before, and the water definitely deserved a full change, mostly because I hadn't been able to level out the nitrate. I put them in a seperate tank, changed all the water, treated it exactly like normal, and got them in. The temp on the side tank and the big tank seemed pretty identical, so besides adding in the water from the side tank I didn't worry about shock. And there wasn't any thing like that. He was fine, all the way up until I went to sleep at 10 pm. When I got out the shower this morning at 4:20 am, I went in to see him laying lifeless. No gill movement, no response to me handling him, no response to anything. Wagner seemed fine. Wasn't even picking at his body. He was hovered over on one side of the tank, kinda near Eduardos body. His top fin was down, but I dont know if that means anything, he seems to do that ever so often. He didnt seem to be injured from Wagner, no fin damage or like, crushed parts of his body. I can't test the water, and I dont have time to change the water before work. This is not the type of job I can call in late to. Im really nervous for Wagner, but if it was just him getting territorial (even though they seemed to be doing fine together) then I'd be a little less scared. Im buying testing sticks right now and I'm going to have my mother check on Wagner periodically and test his water and send me the results. I am super sad about Eduardo. I've never seen a olive goldfish, even though apparently thats their most common color, according to Google? Hmmm",
