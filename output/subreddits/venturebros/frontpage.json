      "content_preview": "Given that The Venture Brothers is very much a parody of Johnny Quest that became a parody of superheroes, filled with nihilistic 90‚Äôs slacker energy, there‚Äôs a lot going on under the surface and under the hood.¬† Just look at all the fan theories of what was going to happen in the future and the internet discussion on the show, right?¬† But the more I think about it, the more fine points and tips I unearth.¬† Call them the theories of a man who‚Äôs been unemployed for a few months (But has a job now).¬† Call them shower thoughts or fridge logic.¬† But there are good points alright.¬† Here are just some of them. 1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dr. Jonas Venture Senior sent his son to State University, where he met many of his friends.¬† An odd choice, given that Jonas had the clout and money to send his son to an Ivy League school like Harvard, Stanford or MIT.¬† But then, Jonas was a controlling sociopath.¬† By putting Rusty in State, he could have an easier time watching him, hushing up any scandal or breakdown Rusty might cause or undergo, and could buy off State if Rusty‚Äôs super-science shenanigans caused problems (Like that lab explosion Rusty was blamed for).¬† Also, State University would be more likely to take transcripts from a talking bed as provided by Venture Industries rather than Harvard.¬† Though that might involve a bribe or two. 2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Also, Rusty‚Äôs education at college was cut short with the death of his father, and he was recalled to the Venture compound to run the family business.¬† Which he ran into the ground.¬† But having not completed his undergraduate degree and having not gotten any work experience, he was not equipped as a scientist or a businessman to run Venture Industries.¬† His career in super-science was effectively stillborn. 3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dr. Jonas Venture Junior might be the better super-scientist, but he never grasped human psychology that well.¬† It wasn‚Äôt just his deal with the Investors or not playing ball with the Guild.¬† He never seemed to work out how a great man like Jonas Sr. could produce such a jaded wash-out like Rusty, or even asked questions as to how it happened.¬† And of course, he left his company Ventech to Rusty, knowing he was probably the best man for the job, but didn‚Äôt leave instructions in *how* Ventech was to be run over the next few years or put someone in charge of oversight until Rusty proved he could follow Jonas Jr‚Äôs vision for the company.¬† Or not screw everything up. 4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rusty seems to have no problem hitting on Dr. Mrs. The Monarch, despite her being in an (open) marriage with his arch-nemesis and plainly not interested.¬† He doesn‚Äôt seem willing to put two and two together and realise that she might not be that great a woman seeing as she married The Monarch, and like attracts like.¬† But then, sleeping with Shiela would a great way to get at the Monarch, so why not keep trying?¬† And making her uncomfortable is a (rather sexist) way to get payback by proxy. 5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Brock Samson never got over Molotov Cocktease for a long time, even though he knows she is a mercenary and an assassin for hire with more red flags than a Soviet parade.¬† But he never had a chance from the start.¬† He did kill her father, the Siberian Huskey.¬† And even though it was in defence of another, when someone kills a family member, that person is not someone you want to be in a relationship with.¬† Too much bad blood.¬† And the passion of the relationship was probably in part of Molotov messing with Brock as a way of getting payback. In fact, she seems to be able to pull his strings pretty well, given how she had Brock take out various assassins for her and her business.¬† Possibly.¬† You won‚Äôt get too many straight answers from assassins-for-hire. 6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Speaking of which, just how did General Hunter-Gathers recruit Molotov Cocktease to do business with the O.S.I. in O.S.I. Love You?¬† Hunter-Gathers used to work for the Black Heart assassins and proved to be a reliable operative, given that Molotov let him (her at the time) rise up the ranks of an all-female organisation.¬† They probably stayed in touch.¬† And when the O.S.I. worked out Monstroso‚Äôs location on his ship, Hunter-Gathers got in touch with Molotov ahead of time and cut a deal on the down low.¬† But that story‚Äôs for another day when I get my tinfoil hat done. 7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It‚Äôs odd that Monstroso got Billy‚Äôs qualifications sorted so Billy could work as a doctor, but then we never once saw Billy practice medicine afterwards.¬† There‚Äôs a good chance that the paperwork was never filed with the appropriate institutions for a few reasons.¬† Such as Monstroso seeing Billy handing him over to SPHINX custody as betrayal.¬† Or he didn‚Äôt give instructions to anyone in his organization to file the paperwork before his capture.¬† Or it got lost in someone‚Äôs to-do pile. 8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† In retrospect, it‚Äôs fairly easy to see why the Venture Brothers connect better with Sirena Ong than Triana Orpheus romantically.¬† The boys had a selfish father who frequently put them in danger on adventures while also sheltering them from the real world.¬† Triana‚Äôs father was loving and supportive, while also ensuring she got a proper education and keeping her away from super shenanigans.¬† Sirena, by comparison, also had an overbearing and selfish (Albeit loving in his own way) father who kept her one foot in the supervillainy world as an informed civilian.¬† Plus, both Dean and Hank had done a lot of growing up and gotten more confident as well. 9.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Outrider might seem like a pretty decent and affable guy, so long as you forget that he did marry his teacher Dr. Orpheus‚Äô ex-wife.¬† That‚Äôs not a good way to repay your teacher after all he did for you, and it‚Äôs a clear violation of most Bro Codes many male friends abide by.¬† At least when Dean slept with Sirena, he expressed his remorse to Hank and did make a good faith attempt to make amends.¬† The Outrider never seemed to express remorse for what he did to his old master. 10. Speaking of which, I think Tatyana, Dr. Orpheus‚Äô ex-wife, might have been the bad one in that relationship.¬† While Dr. Orpheus was a workaholic and did not make time for his family, it can often take two to tango.¬† Tatyana marrying his student the Outrider, effectively trading Orpheus for a younger model is rather odd, and the DVD commentary for season 4 said she was getting bored of the Outrider too.¬† Dr. Orpheus getting custody of Triana could indicate he‚Äôs the more responsible one, even if he is the responsible one by default.¬† But the real issue is that weird psychosexual magic that Tatyana and the Outrider did at Dr. Orpheus‚Äô Hallowe‚Äôen gathering.¬† In front of Dr. Orpheus.¬† And his colleagues in magic.¬† At his own house.¬† At a party he invited them to.¬† I call foul on that, and have to ask what made Tatyana think this was a good idea. 11. And if you ever want to a sign that Rusty Venture is caught up in the same abuse cycle his father put him through and has not escaped the trauma, look at the living quarters of the Venture Compound.¬† They are decorated the exact same way as when Jonas Senior was alive and kicking.¬† Rusty even has the same wallpaper and bedsheets from the sixties and seventies.¬† And you‚Äôd think he would redecorate now that the Venture Compound is his property, but instead he still remains trapped in his father‚Äôs shadow.",
