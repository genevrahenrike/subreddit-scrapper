      "content_preview": "As always, please no spoilers in the comments! Last time we tried to make sense of everything that happened at the end of Act 1 and now we’re ready to continue. We’re back at the Renegade base, trying to escape from Yuan, Botta and their lackeys. Not that they’re trying very hard to follow us. In the room next to the save point we find one of those sorcerer ring machines. Why are these everywhere we go? Isn’t there supposed to be only one sorcerer’s ring? Why would the Renegades install this in their base? I know I know, it’s just a game thing, same with the chests full of goodies that are just lying around everywhere, but it’s still funny to think about that. This ring machine, if we remember, changes the function so that the ring fires electric shots instead of fire. We move some boxes around, grab some chests and reveal a secret staircase so away we go. In the next room there’s a machine that needs power, a water column thing and a box. I spent a good amount of time trying to figure out what to do here. I shot the computer machine thing to charge it and it didn’t work, so I figured I needed to shoot the water cylinder thing in the back. However, the perspective here is awkward and I just couldn’t get it right. After a while I gave up so I moved on to the box. I pushed the box into the water to see if it did anything. It didn’t. I was now boxless and frustrated, so I started frenetically shooting at the pillar from different angles and distances until it finally worked. Yeah, not the best designed puzzle in the game. After checking the (now powered on) computer, we lower a platform but it lowers down too much and we can’t cross it. My dumb brain eventually figures out it’s the same platform as the one in the floor above so I go back up, move around the boxes some more and manage to make a bridge. Phew. We cross it and find… another freaking pillar. Luckily I know how to activate them now so I’m able to continue without breaking much a sweat. There’s a cleverly hidden chest in this room that you can only see briefly when the camera changes to an overhead perspective when getting on some stairs. Luckily it caught my eye and I got a Protect Ring for my efforts. Very nice. Moving on to the next room, Lloyd is frustrated at the wishy washy nature of the Renegade’s allegiance. Are they friends or enemies? We can’t tell yet. We start to discuss what to do next about Colette when out of nowhere Raine asks Sheena where she got her exsphere. Raine is definitely on the spectrum. Sheena says they gave it to her at the Imperial Research Academy, a place she has mentioned before. She explains that exspheres are very uncommon in Tethe’alla (same as Sylvarant I guess) and they were brought over there by the Renegades. This means they can also travel between worlds at will. That’s probably how they could transport themselves to the inside of the Tower of Salvation, I’m guessing they went back to Tethe’alla and from there they opened a portal to the Tower, and then came back with us to Tethe’alla and warped back to their Sylvarant base from there. Or something idk I’m not a half-elf radicalist. Sheena explains that exspheres are mainly attached to machines in her world, and the Renegades were the ones who made the Tethe’allans aware of the nature and existence of Sylvarant. I guess the Renegades are a pretty big deal in Tethe’alla. They’re also the ones that came up with the plan to kill the Chosen and convinced the King and the Pope (!!!) to execute it, but obviouly it wasn’t for the benefit of Tethe’alla, but rather to further their own agenda Raine suggests going to Tethe’alla to find a cure for Colette, since we now understand that her condition is caused by the Cruxis Crystal and they have a whole academy researching that kinda stuff over there. In fact, Sheena assures us they’re already studying THEIR Chosen’s Cruxis Crystal. Genis is surprised to hear there’s also a Chosen in Tethe’alla, and Sheena explains they do the regeneration journey and everything. Lloyd then asks the question that is on everyone’s mind (or at least, you know, mine). He asks why Martel’s vessel hasn’t been completed yet if there have been so many Chosen. I’d very much like to know that too! Raine hypothesizes that the corpses at the entrance of the Tower of Salvation were… and she doesn’t complete the sentence but I think I know what she meant. They were probably failed vessels who didn’t survive the complete angelic transformation. That would at least explain why there were so many corpses there, at the final step of the journey. It still doesn’t really answer the question though. Afterwards Lloyd gives the understatement of the year: there’s too much we don’t know yet. Oh boy tell me about it! We resolve to go to Tethe’alla, so Sheena tells us we need some crafts called Rheairds to get there, and the Renegades should have some here in their base. Hell yeah! Those who played Phantasia know these are awesome flying mechanical bird things that can get you anywhere. No more walking 500 miles to then walk 500 more baby, we’ll be riding in style now! Before we get too excited we must remember we’re still too early in the game for that kind of mode of transportation. They usually give you the flying mode of transportation later in the game when you’ve already explored most of the map, so it’s likely that something will happen that will disable them. Maybe we’ll crash land when we get to Tethe’alla or something. Hopefully not though! Moving on, we arrive at a room that feels very familiar. We immediately make our way to the prison were Lloyd was being held, and there we’re able to rest up and save, which is great! Before doing anything else I went back to the Gamecube puzzle room due to u/RockSauron subtly nudging me in that direction, but I couldn’t find anything there/ The whole system was deactivated and nothing I did worked. I really tried everything but no dice. Sorry bro I feel like I failed you! Moving on we quickly find the Rheairds and off we go suckaaaaas! For all of 10 seconds anyway. As accurately predicted by yours truly, as soon as we arrive at Tethe’alla our flying bird machines fail due to a lack of fuel (mana) and we crash land on a hill. It seems that opening the seals in Sylvarant has already made the mana decrease substantially in Tethe’alla. Oh man the people here are going to be PISSED at us. No more than the Renegades for stealing and crashing their birds though. It seems the Rheiards are not too damaged at least, but we need electrical magic to fuel them such as the one produced by Volt, according to Raine. I knew Volt was going to be here! I seem to remember we also needed Volt for the Rheiards in Phantasia but I could be misremembering. Lloyd then notices something curious. There’s also a Tower of Salvation here! Apparently it appears whenever there’s a flourishing world, which I take to mean it’s when a Chosen starts the regeneration journey. That begs the question of why it happens at the same time in both worlds. Maybe they’re competing? The world who wins gets to keep the mana until the next Chosen grows up and starts their journey? I don’t know man this is all very confusing, I don’t know what parts of the gospel of the Church of Martel are real and which are fake. Raine asks Sheena if the place the Tower of Salvation is on is called the holy ground of Kharlan, and Sheena says that it is, same as in Sylvarant. This must be the point at which the two worlds connect. It also has the same name as Derris-Kharlan, and I’m sure it’s not a coincidence. At least this clears up the whole thing about the Kharlan war. It was probably not waged against Derris-Kharlan, the planet, but rather waged IN Kharlan, the place in Sylvarant/Tethe’alla. Or at least it’s where the peace treaty was signed. You see, she then gives us more details about the Ancient War, mainly that Mithos called the 2 kings of the countries involved in the war to the Holy Land of Kharlan, where they signed a peace treaty. Both worlds have proof that their Kharlan is the real one, so that supports my theory that they used to be just one world that was split in two. Anyway, after this discussion we finally regain control. This officially starts Act 2 and we get a whole new world to explore! The downside to this is that I need to find guidepost monuments all over again so for now we’ll go back to being lowly pedestrians. In fact, I don’t even know if there are monuments in this world or if Noishe even came with us. We probably don’t have a map yet either, so that sucks. Coming down the hill from where we crashed, there are enemies and I notice we have a new battle theme. Awesome! This small area serves as an introduction to Tethe’alla. It’s very easy and linear and we get a BUNCH of skits on the way. Nothing ground breaking, we don’t really gain any new information or anything but it’s nice to see everyone’s opinions and reactions to everything that has happened. As we approach the exit, Lloyd asks where we’re going. Sheena tells us we should head to Meltokio, the Imperial City and capital of Tethe’alla. This city’s name is almost as creative as “bear” and “fish”. As soon as we exit we get a new overworld theme and a skit featuring our friend Noishe. He did come with us after all! I guess this means there are monuments guidepost things here as well. Also, we do have a map, so everything is going great. After this I went around exploring a bit, and I easily found the guidepost thing for this area and a few chests that were just lying there, out in the open. Me and Tethe’alla are getting along already! Near the monument we find a House of Guidance. Are these Tethe’alla’s version of a House of Salvation? It seems like it. Inside we find a trader, so on u/grephantom ‘s recommendation I save scum a grab bag until I get a Sephira (took only 3 tries!). I then used my Rune Bottle to turn it into a Blue Sephira. I don’t know if it was the best use of my Rune Bottle right now but I’m always hurting for cash in this game and typically in Tales games Rune Bottles become very commonplace later on. Aaaand this is where I’ll stop for today. Tomorrow we’ll explore the city of Meltokio, meet the imperial king and who knows, maybe we’ll take a tour through Melshibuya and Melakihabara and go shopping or something. See you tomorrow and thanks for reading!",

      "content_preview": "DISCLAIMERS: FIrst of all, I wanted to thank Muctales for answering my questions regarding Narikiri Dungeon X. Not only they make me understand the plot better, they make me appreciate Dhaos and Rondoline more. I will include some of his explanations in the analysis, because they're quite important. Secondly, this post contains spoilers of the following games: Phantasia, Phantasia Cross Edition, Narikiri Dungeon, Narikiri Dungeon X, and Symphonia. Dhaos isn't just the first villain in the Tales of series, he's the first well-intended extremist in the franchise. And the fact that Dhaos is actually someone that had good reasons to commits evil actions is the first subversion the Tales series has given us. https://preview.redd.it/phantasia-analysis-the-fatal-flaw-of-dhaos-what-i-believe-v0-j91wwbsy7cmf1.png At first, Dhaos seems to be an evil Demon King who destroys towns and cities because potatoes, who started a war, and who causes the death of many innocent people, with the special intent of killing anyone who dares to research about magitechnology. And all of that for no reason, apparently. The only party member who dares to question Dhaos' actions and motivaitons is Arche... only to be silenced by an angered Cress, who gets very angry just by hearing Dhaos' name. Cress only sees Dhaos as an evil piece of shit, a man responsible of his family's death and his village's destruction, and a force of destruction that must be stopped at all costs. https://preview.redd.it/phantasia-analysis-the-fatal-flaw-of-dhaos-what-i-believe-v0-sclbpj668cmf1.png But after the final battle against Dhaos, it's revealed that this villain, who seemed to commit evil just because potatoes, was actually doing it for a good cause. Dhaos was actually a half-elf from Derris-Kharlan, and was the prince of one of its largest countries. However, Derris-Kharlan was dying because the planet's World Tree ( or a comet made of mana, according to Symphonia ) was losing mana, and all life depends on mana to survive, unlike Aselia, whose planet only needed mana for magic and magitechnology ( even if Symphonia says that all life in Aselia needs mana too ). Dhaos was sent to Aselia as a last hope, so he could obtain a Mana Seed from Aselia, and send it to Derris-Kharlan. The problem is, Aselia's World Tree was dying because the humans and half-elves from that country were using magitechnology, as well as the Mana Cannon (and both of these things consumed mana). That's why Dhaos used lethal violence to destroy towns and cities where magitechnology was being developed. That's why Dhaos started the Valhalla War. That's why Dhaos caused the death of so many people. And now that Dhaos was about to die, the main characters have doomed Derris-Kharlan... but fortunately, the heroes time traveled, and they, alongside Martel, sent a Mana Seed to Dhaos' home planet, saving it. If Dhaos' motivations were well foreshadowed or not, and if the ending feels like a deus ex machina or not, it's up to you. But the idea of a villain who is actually a well-intended extremist started in Phantasia. The direct sequel of Phantasia, Narikiri Dungeon for GameBoy Color (and its remake for PSP) expand more on the destruction of Derris-Kharlan, as well as Dhaos' backstory. Before the beginning of the end of Derris-Kharlan, Dhaos was a pacifistic king, who always sought peaceful solutions and diplomacy. Unfortunately, there was a war between Palace Gudora and Palace Sedamyu (two nations of Derris-Kharlan). Dhaos asked both nations for a truce and a ceasefire, but his words weren't heard. A Mana Cannon was developed by Meltia Bandi, and Dios Bandi used the mass-destruction weapon. This resulted in Derris-Kharlan's World Tree starting to lose mana (which, like I said before, was necessary for all life in the planet), and both Dios and Meltia died along with the every single soldier from the warring nations. Norn (the Spirit of Derris-Kharlan's World Tree) ready to punish Meltia and Dios. And thus, Dhaos was sent to Aselia. But Aselia's World Tree losing its mana, as well as Dhaos' own guilt over how his begs for peace weren't enough to stop the war between Gudora and Sedamyu, chose to hate all humans and to become a killer. Because of what happened, it can be argued that Dhaos' fatal flaw was his fear of confrontation. I really find very interesting the fact that Dhaos was a pacifist that became a killer after that pacifism wasn't enough to save the day. He's, in a way, a fallen hero. He reminds me a lot of Canute from Vinland Saga, a character who started off as a pacifistic prince, but eventually became an king willing to start wars and kill people. I love this kind of development, even if it's tragic. However, despite this character development, Dhaos' fatal flaw still exists. Even after renouncing to his pacifism, Dhaos' fear of confrontation still exists. As Muctales himself said: \"When he arrived in Aselia and when Midgard leaders didn't want to stop the studies on Magitech, he closed his heart and attacked humans to prevent them from killing the Mana tree. And he always did that indirectly, using minions and manipulations all over the world so that he wouldn't have to do it himself and to prevent anyone from reaching out to him and questioning his methods (he used Demitel to destroy a city, Jammir to control Alvanista, an army of monsters to attack Midgard, etc). When the party finally reaches him, he also avoids telling the full picture (twice!), making the party attack him very quickly without truly confronting his motivations. Even his own shadow in NDX wants to kill Dio and Mell so that they wouldn't face him and tell him they are angry at him. Dhaos avoids all kind of confrontation.\" And do you want more proofs of Dhaos' fear of confrontation? Rondoline Eclipse Effenberg. Please pay attention to her ring. And no, this is not a gooner joke. It's serious, and you'll understand why. Before talking about Dhaos and Rondoline's relationship: Rondoline was specifically created for Tales of Phantasia NDX, but since they couldn't pull a new human friend for Dhaos out of their asses, she was added in Tales of Phantasia Cross Edition too. If you like Rondoline or not, if you like her relationship with Dhaos or not, and if you feel her inclusion was shoehorned or not, that's up to you. I used to believe that Dhaos giving Rondoline a time-traveling ring made no sense, since Dhaos only came to Aselia for the sake of saving Derris-Kharlan. But Muctales made a great point about the ring: \"When he arrived in Aselia, he found Rody and as time went on, a strong bond grew between them. But in the end, he decided to go through with his plan against humans. However, he knew one thing for sure : since Rody cared that much about him, she would definitely come to confront him someday, to understand why he is doing this. And since Dhaos would be/feel unable to do so, he did something to prevent that. He gave Rondoline a time travel ring ; a ring he has FULL control of ; in order to send her back somewhere else every time she would try to reach him. And it perfectly worked because, Rody was also unable to accept the Dhaos she knew was also the 'Demon king' and never got rid of ring. She got sent back in time by Dhaos countless times because she was also unable to truly confront him.\" In a nutshell, Dhaos gave Rondoline a time-traveling ring so he could keep her away from him , because he doesn't want to be confronted. Remember how Dhaos' fatal flaw is his fear of confrontation? The ring is just another way he manifests this fear. Dhaos was afraid of being confronted, and because of that, he couldn't stop the war between Gudora and Sedamyu with pacifism, something that nearly doomed Derris-Kharlan. But ironically enough, Dhaos was so afraid of being confronted that, when he chose violence, refused to explain his actual motivations, something that nearly doomed Aselia too, and Derris-Kharlan as well. And that's the other important topic of the analysis. I wanted to repeat some things that I said in a previous post of mine about Tales of Symphonia , since they're relevant for this post: In fact, the Chosen One system and the Aselia split into Sylvarant and Tethe'alla, while being portrayed by Mithos as necessary evils to prevent magitechnology destroying the world, are nothing but tools Mithos use to avenge his own suffering and his sister's death. It's made pretty clear that Mithos' actions aren't motivated by love towards half-elves or even his sister (at best, they're motivated by an idealization of Martel, not by Martel herself), they're motivated by his hatred towards humans. This is why, despite Sylvarant and Tethe'alla being Mithos' playgrounds, half-elves are still discriminated against by humans. Because Mithos wants to destroy, not to construct. [...] Keep in mind Mithos spent 4000 years doing all this stuff. [...] Now, compared to Symphonia, how are half-elves treated in Phantasia (4000 years after Symphonia ended)? Elves still treat them like trash, but half-elves are accepted and treated way better by humans. Half-elves can live freely out in the open, be majors in towns, are highly valued magic researchers, and hold ties with one of the most (human) powerful monarchies in the world. [...] Mithos' method of ending racism (racial revenge and trying to apply the \"you can't be racist if there is only one race\" meme) is useless and didn't result in improvements (keep in mind Mithos was at the top during 4000 years , yet he achieved nothing). Why humans became accepting and respectful towards half-elves by the time Phantasia takes place? It wasn't thanks to Mithos. It was thanks to Symphonia's main characters. This shows that race-blind justice and race-blind compassion, which is what Martel actually wanted, and what the main characters defend, is what actually ends racism. Judging people not because of their race, but because of their actions. But why is this relevant for Phantasia? Because something similar (but under a different context) happens in Phantasia: Dhaos' murderous actions didn't save Derris-Kharlan. Even if he had good reasons to do what he did, he's still the main villain, and Cress was right at stopping him. And what saved Derris-Kharlan? Dhaos' extremism didn't. Mint and Martel's compassion did. Now knowing Dhaos' motivations, the party goes back to Aselia, and Mint casts a barrier spell on Aselia's World Tree, preventing it from losing mana. After everyone returned to their respective time periods, Martel sends a mana seed to Derris-Kharlan along with Dhaos' corpse. Thanks to these actions, Derris-Kharlan was saved (and Martel became known in Derris-Kharlan as both the savior of their world and the savior of Dhaos’ lost soul). https://preview.redd.it/phantasia-analysis-the-fatal-flaw-of-dhaos-what-i-believe-v0-x06zmi5n7cmf1.png Mint and Martel's actions, combined with the contrast between Mithos' racial revenge and his sister's race-blindness , give me the impression that one of Aselia's main moral lessons in general is this one: \"Cruelty, even with good reasons, doesn't solve problems. Compassion and communication is what actually solves problems.\" That's the end of my analysis. Thanks a lot, Muctales. You're making me appreciate Phantasia's plot even more than I did before.",

      "content_preview": "I've never played a Tales game before, so this was a pleasant surprise. I've played some great games this year, like FF7 Rebirth, Expedition 33 and FFX, so this game is in excellent company. - The combat was a lot of fun. The boost attacks were actually brilliant. FF7 Rebirth tried to do that with synergies, but I don't think they executed as well. - The story and characters were a nice change of pace. I loved the characters, their dialogue and skits. I've had my fill of sad and bittersweet endings, so this was really nice. - Alphen is such a great male role model. He's strong, but also very caring and shares his feelings with his friends. His interactions with Shionne were a highlight for me. - The side content (quests, fishing, cooking, etc.) were kind of perfect. I'm not a completionist, so there was enough there for me to take a break from the main plot, but not too much as to overwhelm. I went into this pretty much blind. I prefer not to bias my experience, but if you're on the fence, I 100% recommend it. After finishing the main story I read some people's reactions and reviews, here's my response for whatever it's worth: - The main plot doesn't fall that hard in the last third of the game. It's really hard to wrap up a story and I think they did ok. As a whole, the story was pretty good and has a satisfying conclusion. - Too much of our media is full of cynical stories, bittersweet endings and downright depressing storytelling (FFX's ending was a bit much for me personally). As funny as it might sound, the happy \"power of friendship\" type of ending this game gets is almost subverting tropes with how basic it is. - The combat is fine in the last dungeon and the enemies are not actually that \"spungie\". I was playing on normal so that might be it but my party was destroying everything so fast. The bosses actually died way too fast. Expedition 33 was a fantastic experience, but that combat gets completely broken (i.e. balance is gone and the game gets too easy) by the end. So TLDR  -- good game, enjoy it and savour the romance and sappiness because so many games these days think they're so clever and artistic with their game of thrones inspired plotlines and cynical characters. That's all.",

      "content_preview": "As always, please no spoilers in the comments! Last time… wow, what a ride last time was. We finished act 1 and a bunch of crazy stuff happened. After all that was done, we were left at the Renegade base escaping from Botta and Yuan once again, like in old times. Now, before we escape the Renegade base, I want to touch on a few points I didn’t have time for in the previous post. First is my Mithos = Yggdrasill theory. In ancient times there was a war were magitechnology, and most notably the mana cannon, were used as weapons. This rapidly depleted the world’s supply of mana, which came from the mana tree. The mana tree was dying, so the hero Mithos, presumably a human, set out to stop it. He formed a pact with the Sylvarant summons and with their help set out to stop the war. Whatever events developed on his journey, in the end he gave up his life to take over the place of the mana tree, and a new world, Tethe’alla, was created. These are all facts. Another fact is Tethe’alla was created by Yggdrasill himself. And yet another fact is that, in the future, during the Tales of Phantasia events, there is a new mana tree called Yggdrasill that houses the spirit of none other than Martel. Taking all of these facts into account, here’s my theory: Martel was a spirit housed in the original mana tree. Mithos met her somehow and fell in love with her. When the war broke out, mana consumption went up, and the mana tree started to die. Martel was dying with it, so Mithos set out to stop the war to save his beloved. At some point, the Mana Cannon was used and it used so much mana that the mana tree died, along with Martel. Desperate and filled with grief, Mithos sought out a way to revive her. He somehow came up with the regeneration journey with the help of the summons, and sacrificed his human body in order to trascend humanity and become an angel. Having trascended his humanity, he took on a new name: Yggdrasill. Everything he’s done since then has been for one purpose and one purpose only: to revive his beloved Martel. If there’s one thing I’ve learned in JRPGs is that 99% of the time when a hero starts doing evil stuff, it’s because of love. Just like Dorr with Clara, there’s no motivation like it. Creating Tethe’alla to control the flow of mana, sending the summoners to the new world in order to have full control of the summon spirits, selectively breeding humans to create a suitable vessel, manipulating the Desians into creating exspheres presumably to create Cruxis Crystals, creating an angel army out of humans and half-elves with said crystals and creating the Church of Martel to control the world, all of it was done exclusively to revive his beloved Martel. And if Tales of Phantasia is any indication, he ultimately succeeds. I’m guessing he makes the ultimate sacrifice for her and ends up becoming the Mana Tree himself. Given the information I have, this is my theory and I’m pretty confident about it. At least for like 60% of it. Of course there’s a whole bunch of stuff I have no idea about yet. Kratos is still a big mystery. I’m pretty sure he’ll end up being a good guy but I don’t know his exact motives and goals yet, or how he fits into the narrative. Was he a companion of Mithos on his journey? Was he a previous Chosen’s protector? Was he a friend of Lloyd’s parents? How did he end up becoming an angel? There’s just not enough information yet. Same with the Renegades, the only clues we have is Yuan’s ring with the letters Y and M, where Y probably stands for Yuan and M might be Mithos or Martel or someone else entirely, and the other clue is his obsession with preventing the resurrection of the Goddess and with Lloyd’s exsphere (which I believe are related). Yggdrasill showed absolutely no interest in Lloyd or his exsphere, so it’s probable that the Angelus Project is more of a Desian project than his. And the Mana Cannon being developed is almost assuredly being done behind his back, since Kratos was surprised to hear about it. But we still have next to no information about any of this so it’s too early to make any calls. There’s also the very important subject of Derris-Kharlan. Some of you in the comments, most notably u/azure-flute , called to my attention that this place is in Tales of Phantasia and it’s where Dhaos comes from. I did not remember Dhaos’ planet had a name. I’m telling you, my memory is worse than a peanut’s. All I remember about this place is that it had a war and the mana was depleted so that’s why Dhaos went to another world, which turned out to be Aselia, to get a mana seed or something. This is something that happens far into the future, though, a few decades before the events in Phantasia. The fact that the Chosen was supposed to be taken to Derris-Kharlan to complete the regeneration journey adds an extra layer of confusion to the whole thing. What does Dhaos’ home world have to do with anything? And why was the ancient war that was waged in Sylvarant called the Kharlan war? Was the war not between two countries, but between two worlds? So this got me thinking. I have been making a very important assumption all this time, and it is that Sylvarant is the same world as Aselia, which is what it was called in Phantasia. I just assumed at some point during the thousands of years between the 2 games they changed the name of the world. But what if I’m mistaken? The only proof I have for Sylvarant and Aselia being the same place is the summons. Efreet, Undine, Sylph, Aska and Luna are all found in Aselia. But what about the rest? Where’s Gnome, Maxwell, Shadow, Volt? Are they in Tethe’alla? And that got me thinking further. You know what is for sure in Tethe’alla? The ninja village where Sheena is from. And you know who shares her last name? Suzu from Phantasia, who lives in, you guessed it, a ninja village. There’s also the small matter of where are the freaking elves. We have seen a lot of humans and a lot of half-elves in Sylvarant, but not a single full elf. Genis and Raine were supposed to be elves, but they were revealed to be half-elves. So where are the elves? We’ve already explored all of Sylvarant, right? That only leaves one other place: Tethe’alla. In Phantasia, there’s a village of elves. In fact, there’s heavy discrimination there against half-elves. If we suspect the elves and remaining summons are in Tethe’alla, and we know for a fact the ninja village with the fujibayashi clan is there as well, then we have a handful of possibilities: Aselia is actually Tethe’alla and not Sylvarant. If this is the case, then the most likely scenario is that either Sylvarant gets destroyed at some point but the Sylvarant summons are somehow transported to Tethe’alla before the destruction, or Sylvarant and Tethe’alla merge together at some point to make the world of Aselia. To me, this is the most likely explanation and reconciles everything beautifully. But wait. What if, and hear me out because it’s not that crazy, what if the 2 worlds were Aselia to begin with and what Mithos did was separate Aselia into 2 worlds, Sylvarant and Tethe’alla? That would explain so much! It would explain why the 2 worlds are so interconnected to the point that travel between them is possible even though they are in different planes of existence (see: Sheena), it would explain why the last summoner on Sylvarant was Mithos but there are still summoners in Tethe’alla (see: Sheena, again), and it would explain why things that are in Sylvarant and things that are in Tethe’alla are both in Aselia in the future. The worlds were originally one, and then will merge back together at some point! If this is true, then there’s the possibility that the ancient war was not an internal conflict in Aselia, but was actually waged between Aselia and Derris-Kharlan, an invading planet. Maybe even back then Derris-Kharlan was already having a mana shortage and attacked Aselia, much like how thousands of years later they sent Dhaos to Aselia to get mana and he waged war with the natives of that planet. Maybe that’s why it was called the Kharlan war! No idea why the Derris part is missing though. One thing that makes all of this very confusing is that the same exact event has happened, by my count, at least 3 times. In ancient Sylvarant/Aselia (Mithos’ time), in future Derris-Kharlan (Dhaos’ time), and in future Aselia (Cress’ time). There’s always a war where magitechnology is abused, and at least 2 of the times the mana cannon has been involved. The abuse of magitechnology eventually leads to a mana tree dying, and mana dissapearing from its respective world. Maybe I’m misunderstanding something and two of these events are actually only one event, but I don’t think I am. All of this, sadly, gets me no closer to what the world of Derris-Kharlan means for our current plotline. Why would Colette be sent there? Is that where Cruxis has their base of operations? Why there? What happened all those years ago? And final question, why were the Desians trying to stop the Chosen from completing the journey of regeneration if they are part of Cruxis? With that I’ll end today’s post. I know I know, I made absolutely no progress. Today was a super busy day and I didn’t have time to play so I decided to just finish up this write up before going to sleep. There’s a lot I wanted to talk about and it ended up being a pretty long post anyway. Tomorrow we’ll definitely continue with the game. Thanks for reading!",

I get jealous of those who enjoy it all the way through. Will I like Xillia? Is this all a part of getting older and having less time? I played Symphonia and Abyss in middle school and loved every second of it. I was never able to achieve the same high from playing the newer games. Anyone else feel like this?",

      "content_preview": "Almost every Tales has at least one mascot: Narikiri Dungeon: Couleur. Eternia: Quickie and Dede. Symphonia: Noishe and Corrine. Rebirth: Zaphie. Legendia: The Oresoren and Giet. Abyss: Mieu and Tokunaga. Innocence: Coda and QQ Selezneva (yes, she's considered a mascot too). Dawn of the New World: Tenebrae. Vesperia: Repede. Hearts: Windum (DS-only), Tetsu Hagane (DS-only), and Beryl's black sheep pet (I don't remember her name). Graces: Mecha-Asbel and Mecha-Sophie. Xillia: Teepo. Xillia 2: Rollo. Zestiria: The Normin. Berseria: Bienfu. Arise: Hootle. And because of that, I wanted to start a discussion: Who is your favourite mascot, and who is your least favourite mascot? And why? If it's possible, give detailed reasons why. In my case, Couleur is my favourite mascot, and Noishe is my least favourite one. But why? Couleur is my favourite mascot for these reasons: https://preview.redd.it/discussion-favourite-mascot-least-favourite-mascot-v0-hu4v8h3ow7mf1.png She looks a lot like Kirby. In case you wonder, Kirby is one my favourite videogame franchises. Why is she named Couleur (which means \"color\" in French)? Because in ND1, Dio and Mell could develop different personalities (this only applies to the gameplay) depending on the costumes/classes they're wearing, and that would make Couleur's appereance and moveset. Unfortunately, Couleur's evolutions were removed in NDX (that's one of the few things that I dislike about NDX). In NDX, she can transform into other party members thanks to the Chain Partner mechanic. At least her \"color\" motif wasn't entirely gone... Did you notice I'm refering to Couleur with female pronouns? That's because Couleur is actually Norn's physical embodiment. Yeah, Couleur is actually the main antagonist of ND1 and NDX, being the first playable antagonist in the series. In ND1, Dio and Mell must fight against Norn without Couleur's intervention. And the same happens in NDX's first battle against Norn... but not in the second fight (Couleur separates from Norn and joins the twins again). At first, that didn't make sense for me, but after Muctales gave me some explanations, now I understand it better (and I appreciate both Couleur and Norn better). Couleur is Norn and only separates at the end of the game to help the kids. It's important to know what is the trial's goal to understand the motivation of each character in this game (I might do a video about it). Norn is supposed to be that impartial judge that will decide at the end of the twins fate. However, she is a spirit, and very well known to be a gentle and considerate one. Couleur extracting at the end represents her own desire to help the kids pass the trial. But since she must be impartial, she goes all out to be sure the judgment would be fair. She is not only battling the kids but also her own feelings. And as why Noishe is my least favourite mascot... https://preview.redd.it/discussion-favourite-mascot-least-favourite-mascot-v0-82gp4n5qw7mf1.png My main problem with him is how shoehorned he is into Symphonia's plot (or at least, that's how I felt). For example, he crosses dimensions with no explanation, and he appears and disappears from scene to scene. It's almost like if Noishe's addition was an afterthought. Like, he feels like a remake addition in his own name!",

After getting back around, we finally made it to the Asgard Ranch. Inside we see security is tight, much tighter than the previous ranches. We decide to disguise ourselves as Desians to gain entry, so we ambush a patrol and easily overpower them. We presumably slit their throats and feast on their blood, and leave them naked to boot. We decide it’s a good idea to change back in Luin, just in case. Back at Luin we camp out. Turns out only one of the Desian uniforms is of any use (presumably because the others are filled with the contents of the bowels of the other Desians who crapped themselves when we slaughtered them like the animals they are). The uniform is for females so it falls to Raine to lead us in, and the rest will act as prisoners. This makes sense since she’s mature, smart and level-headed so it leaves less room for error. She’s also a half-elf so that makes the disguise even more convincing. Next day we gain access to the ranch surprisingly easily. For some reason the party was not fully healed even though we spent the night camping, so that sucks. Talking to the Desian soldiers we gain some insight on the inner workings of the human ranches. It seems they’re instructed to work the humans to the point of exhaustion so the exspheres awaken and turn them into demons. They even refer to them as “host bodies”. We don’t know the purpose of doing this yet but at least we know now what cultivating humans means. We also learn the name of the Grand Cardinal in charge of this ranch: Kvar. He’s said to be the cruelest one of them all, which checks out with what he did to Luin. So far we have the names of 3 Grand Cardinals (Forcystus, Magnius and Kvar), one suspected but unconfirmed Grand Cardinal (Rodyle), and their leader (Pronyma) who might or might not be one of the Grand Cardinals. If these are the 5 Grand Cardinals, then Pronyma must be the blue-haired guy we met way back when Lloyd was escaping the Desian base. Another possibility I’ve been entertaining is that the blue-haired guy might not even have been affiliated with the Desians. We know there’s some people impersonating Desians since the beginning of the game, they implied so during the attack on the Iselian temple. I remember feeling something was off in the base where Lloyd was taken captive, like those Desians felt nicer. They’re absolutely half-elves because that’s the reason they let Genis off the hook, so I don’t know what to think at this moment. Maybe they’re from the same world as Sheena. Heck, maybe every elf and half-elf comes from that world originally. We’ll see what happens, I’m probably just wrong about everything as usual but it’s fun to speculate! Once inside the base, a soldier says that soon Lord Kvar will replace LADY Pronyma as leader of the cardinals. LADY. That immediately disproves the possibility that Pronyma is the blue-haired guy. I mean, I’m a pretty open-minded guy so who’s to say he doesn’t identify as a woman, but these games tend to be very tropey, especially one as old as this one, so I don’t think they intended for him to be a woman. There’s still the possibility that there are 5 Grand Cardinals + Pronyma, but I don’t think that’s the case with the way they talk about her. I feel if she was some sort of supreme leader she would command the respect of the others, like with Kilia. However this doesn’t seem to be the case for the Grand Cardinals. We know Kvar wants to take her place, and Rodyle is plotting behind her back. This makes me think they’re more like peers. I also really think Rodyle is a Grand Cardinal since he gives off those vibes and seemed to be on the same level of authority as Magnius. In that case, the 5 Grand Cardinals would be Forcystus, Magnius, Rodyle, Kvar and Pronyma. This leaves us with the question of who the hell is the blue-haired guy. For now I’m going to go with mysterious 3rd party impersonating Desians. Moving on to the next room, we find out the secondary purpose of the ranch. It seems it doubles as an exsphere manufacturing plant. After all, if they have to tire out their human slaves, might as well get them to work on something productive right? While Lloyd drools over the amount of exspheres, Colette picks up some noises with her superhuman angel hearing, which are coming from the next room. It seems someone’s coming! We don’t have time to hide as they suddenly burst in. It’s our old friend Botta! I had forgotten all about him! Wait, if he’s here, and this is DEFINITELY a Desian human ranch, this would mean he is, in fact, a Desian, which means our blue-haired friend is likely a Desian as well. Since he likely isn’t a Grand Cardinal, then I guess he’s just another important Desian. Maybe their president or something? Who knows. Well, YOU know. But I don’t. Yet. Ok so immediately after I wrote the previous paragraph, Lloyd calls them Desians and one of the soldiers says “they still think we’re Desians”. Arghhh. Damn my impatience! They’re not Desians after all. My initial hunch was right. One of the soldiers says it’s the perfect chance for something (killing us?) but Botta stops him on account of Kratos being with us. Lloyd asks Kratos if they know each other, but Kratos deflects saying yes because we ran into them at Iselia and Triet. Yeah, I’m not buying that. Kratos definitely knows who they are, and this dialogue confirms these dudes are part of the group that impersonated the Desians and attacked the temple at Iselia. The blue-haired guy is probably their leader. By my count we have at least 3 different groups trying to stop us. There’s the Desians of course, then there’s the impersonators with the base near Triet, and finally there’s Sheena and her whole country/world. Man, it’s not easy being Colette’s entourage, everybody hates our guts. Even Kratos has beef with the journey of regeneration. I suspect they’re right, too. The game has been hinting heavily from the beginning that the world regeneration is not what we think it is. The impostors start to leave, when suddenly the doors open revealing some actual Desian soldiers. Colette and Kratos are hit by the Desian’s signature magic ball hadouken attack thing but they manage to block it. The Desians leave in pursuit of Botta’s group, but we have someone else to worry about. Who shows up but who I assume is the man himself, Grand Cardinal Kebab. Kvar. He looks like a Dragon Ball reject. He calls Botta a “Renegade”, so that’s what I’ll be calling that group for now. By his wording I understand they happened to also be infiltrating the ranch at the same time as us. He calls us inferior beings, so clearly he holds the Renegades at a higher level than us, all but confirming they’re also half-elves. Kratos confirms we’re dealing with Kvar. The Grand Cardinal then reveals he’s the mastermind behind the Angelus Project, where Lloyd’s exsphere originated. Colette attacks him and misses, but we use the opening to escape into the next room. Soon after, we arrive at a conveyor belt carrying some prisoners and apparently packing them up in some hexagonal cylinder things. Luckily our pal Kvar arrives just in time to explain what’s going on, as mandated by the super villain handbook. Apparently, exspheres are dormant initially, and need to grow by nourishing themselves with human nutrients in order to awaken. They’re parasites, basically. I was wrong earlier, this is actually why human ranches exist, for the sole purpose of creating exspheres out of human bodies. This is horrifying. The exspheres we have been using so freely came at the cost of countless human lives. Worse than the lives themselves is all the suffering the human hosts had to endure beforehand. There’s no room to forgive the Desians or have any kind of sympathy for them, what they’ve done is absolutely unforgivable and inhumane. They’re some of the most objectively and unambiguously evil antagonists in the series. Kvar further explains that Lloyd’s exsphere was to be an offering to Lord Yggdrasill, but it’s still not clear who or what that is and if it has anything to do with the World Tree in Phantasia. We just learn he’s the Desian’s leader. He then tells us that Lloyd’s exsphere is the result of years of research, and it was stolen by a female host body. He confirms her to be host body A012, otherwise known as Anna, Lloyd’s mom. He also drops a huge bomb: the one who killed Anna was none other than Lloyd’s own father! Whaaaat! Before I have an opportunity to speculate, he states that Lloyd’s father was also a human. He is also dead. This means that Kratos is most likely not Lloyd’s father, and also that Lloyd is 100% human. Kratos does get very upset and tells Kvar not to speak ill of the dead. This basically confirms my theory that Kratos knew Lloyd’s parents. In fact, I’m pretty sure he’s the one who took baby Lloyd and the exsphere and left them under the care of Dirk the dwarf to hide them. He probably also stayed close in order to look over him and protect him (and keep tabs on the exsphere). It’s possible Kratos was a Desian that befriended the pair during their time in the ranch and, harboring doubts about what he and his peers were doing, helped them escape and maybe even went with them. This would fit with him seeming to know a lot about Lloyd’s parents, the Desians, the journey of regeneration and the Renegades, as well as for him showing up seemingly out of nowhere during the Renegade attack on the Iselian temple. As for Lloyd’s dad killing his mom, it seems it was because they tried to remove her exsphere forcefully (presumably because it was making her ill) and didn’t know the consequences of doing that. When she unexpectedly turned into a monster, he killed her trying to protect baby Lloyd, but was mortally wounded and passed away. That’s my theory anyway. The Desian soldiers start to close in and all seems lost, when suddenly our BFF Sheena jumps in out of nowhere! Wasn’t security supposed to be super tight here? It seems everybody and their mother infiltrated the ranch at the same time! She takes out some kind of spell tag, apparently the last one her grandpa gave her, and uses it to summon one of her elemental companions who makes us disappear. Kvar is unbothered since he can apparently find us at any time by following the Chosen’s “signature trail”. Is he referring to how Colette leaves Colette-shaped holes everywhere? Whatever the case, we decide to head back to Luin. Back at Luin, our group, including Sheena, ponder about the fact that our exspheres are made of human lives. Lloyd gets really upset at this fact and almost throws his away, but Colette and Kratos talk him out of it. Colette also confirms she doesn’t use an exsphere. We may have failed our rescue mission, but we learned a lot and this experience served to strengthen everyone’s resolve. We also gained an unexpected bonus: Sheena finally joins our group! Hooray! We learn she calls her summon creatures “Guardians” but as expected, she’s run out of them. However, checking her techs I see she can still summon our squirrelly friend Corrine. I wonder how that works. Heading out I spot an NPC that wasn’t there before. When we speak to him we get another one of Kratos’ training sessions! Nice. Only one to go! As we’re about to exit the town, we start wondering about our next steps. It seems there’s someone named Pietro at Hima, who might know another way to get into the ranch having escaped from there himself. I haven’t been to Hima yet, but when I found the guidepost on my way back from the Sword Dancer I saw a grey dot on my map that I haven’t been to yet. I have to imagine that’s Hima so that’s where we’re headed. Even knowing where it was and seeing the dot on the map I had a hard time finding it. I eventually figured out the entrance was literally just a dirt path and went in. Inside, we said hi to Rockie the dog, who anyone would describe as a good boy, and started to explore. Not that there’s a lot to explore, whoever said this place was a backwater run-down god-forsaken hovel knew what they were talking about. There’s only one building and a graveyard, where people who have escaped the ranch are buried when they inevitably expire due to the “curse”, which is more than likely the exsphere’s effect of draining their life force. In front of the inn, which as I said is the only building in town (if you can call this a town), is another good girl. This cutie’s called Boo. I’ll be sad when we run out of doggos to say hi to. Inside, we find Sophia, one of Sheena’s friends. It seems we’re too late and Pietro already passed away. She tells us not to dig up his grave, so of course we have to go dig up his grave. Before that, we find the Wonder Chef in one of the rooms. He gives us the Risotto recipe. How fancy! We go examine Pietro’s grave but ultimately decide against grave-robbing and start to pray. Suddenly, none other than Pietro shows up! Whaaat. He seems to be brain damaged or something and starts muttering stuff about how the Chosen must die and something about the ranch underground. Sophia shows up and takes him back. Before they can go we start to question him about the ranch. He mentions something about moving a boulder to an underground tunnel in response. I remember seeing something like that right outside the ranch, it seemed like a boulder blocking some kind of duct. I tried to interact with it and nothing happened, but that’s probably what he’s referring to. Sophia wants us to leave him alone, so Sheena starts victim shaming, blaming Pietro for what happened at Luin. Not cool Sheena. Our party insists on questioning him for the sake of the Luiners and Sophia says that she’ll allow us to question him only if we lift his curse. Now that’s just plain unreasonable. We’re trying to save a whole city here! Well we’re actually trying to save the whole world, not that anybody cares. She tells us that the healing technique was left behind by Boltzman, who was the author of the book that the Luin priest mentioned before the disaster. It’s in the Tower of Mana, so I guess we have to do that now before being able to go back to the ranch. Because fuck all those people, right Sophie? Every second we spend not storming the ranch dozens more are sacrificed to make exspheres, but the only important one is Pietro isn’t he? People can be so selfish. Luckily, Raine is no pushover. She agrees on the condition that we free the citizens from the ranch first. Sophie agrees and tells us he escaped through the front yard and blocked the exit with a boulder. That’s definitely what I remember seeing! For some reason his things are in the grave, so we’ll be doing some grave robbing after all. We get a Desian Orb, which purportedly opens up the secret passage into the ranch. Before leaving, I went to the top of the hill to finish exploring the “city”. The view is beautiful from up here! You can see the Tower of Salvation stretching up into the sky in the distance. Suddenly some guy shows up out of nowhere (as happens very frequently in this game) and declares this to be a great spot for his Dragon Tours business. Sounds awesome! Apparently it involves riding dragons (as in, flying them!!!!) to the Tower of Salvation. He’ll get it set up soon. I can’t wait! Near the exit we find a trader who wants us to help him carry food to Luin. This is another one of those fast travel NPCs, like the one in Palmacosta. Fantastic! This is just what we needed. We’re immediately transported to Luin, and that’s where we’ll leave it for today. Join me tomorrow as we storm the Asgardian ranch for the second (and hopefully final) time! Thanks for reading!",
