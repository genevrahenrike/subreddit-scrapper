      "content_preview": "Hello! I'm looking for some recommendations for soups or any meals really, that people with gerd dont get their symptoms triggered by. I'm craving a pumpkin soup but worried it will cause my reflux and nausea to spike! I've been living off chicken cup soups or home made chicken soup all winter, but even that can cause some reflux after, yet I still eat it cause its healthy and hits my cravings and I've convinced myself its a \"safe\" food. I want to try branching out as I've been stuck on a daily diet that doesn't change much and am getting tired of it. I've tried googling gerd safe foods and recipes but dont know weather to trust them or not and thought I'd ask on here since people on here have been living with it for varying amounts of time, so surely you guys will have some ideas üòÖ I'm asking for soup but if you have any desserts, snacks or meal idea please feel free to share! Any suggestions would be appreciated!!",

      "content_preview": "I just need to rant. I (F, 30)just had the worst medical procedure of my life so far. An endoscopy without sedation. Because I didn't have anyone to go to the hospital with me, I couldn't be sedated. I've cried my eyes out before the test, I knew the ordeal I was going to go through, as I've had a manometry and pH test before with just numbing spray and had the same difficulty. I just hated everyone around me, nurses were trying to assure me I won't feel a thing, while I was bawling my eyes out because I knew I was gonna throw up continuously. But I didn't have any option available, I didn't know if I wanted to stay in the hospital I had to prebook that. I would've done it. The frustration of it was unimaginable. I'm alone in a foreign country and have no one with me, so with these types of situations is always hard. The procedure was painful, I tried my best to get through with it but they were just shoving the bulky endoscope so deep in my intestine that I couldn't deal with it. It lasted for one minute I think, because I was simply throwing up too much. They tried to do aspiration but I didn't let them I was panicking so much, thought they were gonna shove another tube in my throat. I was crying like a dog lol, unable to move, one nurse was wiping my tears, another one was trying to hold me down. So if you ever think of having an endoscopy, choose sedation and take someone with you and save yourself the horrific experience. P.s. I will crying for the entire day at home, not only for the traumatic experience, but because of how miserable life is right not to live with GERD and have no one next to you. P.s 2. I overheard one of the nurses in the waiting room moaning that she struggled with me lol. As if she was the one with a hose down her throat and throwing up of anxiety and The procedure itself. ü•πü´¥üèª",

      "content_preview": "Hi, everyone. I started taking Zoloft(sertraline) 50mg a few months ago and had GI issues. I believe this caused my acid reflux. Well, I haven‚Äôt been able to eat solid foods in a month and a half because it feels as if it is too thick to pass through my esophagus beneath my collarbone area. I‚Äôm going in for my first endoscopy in a couple of hours and I am pretty nervous. I also turn 27 tomorrow! I hope they can figure out why I‚Äôm unable to eat solid foods. When I first experienced the acid reflux my throat was burned a lot for two weeks straight. Reflux and regurgitation. Shortly after, as in that week, I started to lose my ability to eat solid foods. I‚Äôm starving. I hope everything goes well. Please wish me luck as I am terrified.",

      "content_preview": "I promised myself I'd make this post if I was close to full recovery so here we go. If this helps even one person, it‚Äôs worth sharing I‚Äôve been dealing with LPR/GERD for about two years. It all started after spending a few months in a foreign country where I felt constantly sick and congested. I ended up taking antibiotics for the first time and around the same time my whole body started feeling off. My neck was sore, I felt drained, and nothing felt right. When I got back home, things went downhill. My ears would pop every time I swallowed. I woke up every morning feeling like I had been hit by a truck. It got so bad that I thought I had sleep apnea and bought a CPAP machine. I tried everything I could think of. I convinced myself I had bile reflux, gastritis, acid reflux, LPR, and more. I am 21 and in great shape but no matter what I ate, it would trigger symptoms. I dealt with every symptom in the book. From a burning throat, gnawing stomach, and constant discomfort DAILY. Over time this created extreme anxiety. I became afraid to leave the house. Bright lights made me feel like I might pass out. I thought my life was over. I eventually went on an SSRI for a year, something I never wanted to do, but I felt like there was no other option. When I say I have tried everything, I mean it. After two years of obsessive research, I finally believe I found the root cause. Listen to me. Your body is designed to heal. If you have gone through a period of intense stress or trauma, your body can store that stress for years. If it is never addressed, it can create chronic symptoms that seem unrelated at first. Many people with GERD or LPR also mention symptoms such as Abdominal pressure or bloating Feeling like you cannot get a full breath Jaw and neck tightness Hip tightness Difficulty rotating the torso Ongoing anxiety These problems are often tied to a tight diaphragm and tight psoas or hip flexors. When these muscles are tense, they can restrict blood flow to the digestive system, slow down how food moves through, and cause bloating which, as you might guess, often ends up coming right back up. That was my issue and I bet many of yours as well. Two simple tests to check yourself 1. Straight Leg Lift Test Lie flat on your back and try to keep your lower back pressed into the floor. Lift one leg at a time as high as possible without bending the knee. If your leg shakes a lot, it may be a sign that your diaphragm and core are not working in sync. 2. Lunge Hip Flexor Test Get into a half-kneeling lunge with one knee on the floor and the other foot in front. Tuck your pelvis slightly under. Lean forward without arching your back. If you feel extreme tightness in the front of your hip or struggle to stay upright, your hip flexors may be overly tight. If you focus on releasing these tight areas and supporting your body every single day, you can see real change. These are the seven things that have helped me the most, in order of importance. 1. TRE and shaking Tension and Trauma Release Exercises (TRE) are my number one. Shaking releases deep muscle tension stored in the body, especially in the psoas and diaphragm. They have been a game changer for me. Look them up and learn the basics... it is easier to watch than to read about. 2. Get off the endless research cycle Stop living on health forums. Learn the fundamentals of a healthy lifestyle, then step away from the constant symptom chasing. I stopped researching about six months ago and it freed up so much mental energy to actually heal. 3. Make it a lifestyle, not a quick fix No specific food, supplement, or workout alone will ‚Äúcure‚Äù you. It has to be a daily way of living. For me, playing basketball a few hours a week has been one of the best things I‚Äôve added. The jumping helps lymphatic drainage, releases the diaphragm, and gets my whole body moving and its FUN. Live a little. 4. Daily mobility and stretching Spend time each day opening up your hips, rib cage, and spine. Even 15 minutes of focused mobility can help retrain your body to move and breathe properly. 5. Breathing retraining Most of us with chronic tension breathe shallow without realizing it. Practicing slow, deep rib and belly breathing helps calm the nervous system and frees the diaphragm. 6. Strengthen, don‚Äôt just stretch Weak core and postural muscles can keep your body locked in bad patterns. Strength training for your back, glutes, and core can help hold the new mobility you gain. 7. Consistent low-level movement Walking 10 minutes a day after EACH meal, light cycling, or gentle sports keep blood and lymph moving throughout the day. It is not about exhausting workouts... it is about staying in motion so your body does not stiffen back up. Like I said, I would love to give full breakdowns for all but YouTube for the above are so much more informative visually. I hope this can help someone out and please don't hesitate to leave a comment I'll try to reply to as many as possible. You will be healed. It's only a matter of time. TL;DR: Had severe LPR/GERD for 2 years with every symptom imaginable despite being young and fit. Tried every diet, med, and supplement with no lasting relief. The real root cause for me was a tight diaphragm and psoas/hip flexors from years of stored stress and tension, which was restricting blood flow and slowing digestion. Two quick self-tests: Straight Leg Lift Test: Leg shaking = diaphragm/core not in sync. Lunge Hip Flexor Test: Extreme tightness = hip flexors too tight. 7 things that helped most: TRE and shaking to release stored tension Stop endless symptom research Make it a lifestyle (basketball, fun movement) Daily mobility and stretching Breathing retraining Strengthen postural muscles Walk 10 min after each meal Edit: These two videos hit the nail on the head for me and explain it better than I can.

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm the same person who wrote this post . Last time I shared my story, I got a great response so this time I want to explain everything again more concise, clear, and easy to follow. If you‚Äôre worrying and suffering right now, I‚Äôve been exactly where you are. I went through most of it too, so I hope my story can bring you some comfort and reassurance. Let‚Äôs begin. Symptoms I experienced (head to toe): Dizziness, migraines, nausea Burning acid sensation in my throat, scratchy/raw feeling Extreme light sensitivity, not just in bright places; even in dark rooms my eyes would sting and migraines would kick in Pain around the shoulder blades and upper back Chest tightness and vague, hard-to-pinpoint chest pain Couldn‚Äôt take a full satisfying breath; felt like I had to gasp in small portions to fill my lungs Indigestion and bloating all day after eating Woke up hoarse every morning due to acid Terrible bad breath (I was always self-conscious talking to people) Sudden chest squeezing with panic attacks, felt like I was going to die on the spot Basically felt like a total wreck In my case these symptoms flared up randomly and often together. During my GERD journey I ended up in the ER 7 times . By my 3rd panic attack I knew it was caused by GERD, but the fear that my heart would stop any second was so overwhelming I had no choice but to call 911 ‚Äî that‚Äôs how terrifying it felt. I even have military experience and consider myself pretty tough. Yet GERD brought me to the point where I had to hit 911. Medications/Supplements I took: Japanese cabbage extract pills(just go with any brand out there, Japan has some awesome pills) PPI for only the first 3 months (stopped because it worsened my digestion) One Gaviscon tablet before bed Didn‚Äôt go hunting for other meds beyond that My main GERD triggers: Stress (jobless at the time, it was mostly the fear about my future) Binge eating Late-night meals/snacking A life with no structure or routine Exercise I did (slowly increasing intensity as I improved): Walking 30-second jogging / 30-second walking intervals, increasing over time Biking Hiking Lifting weights Things I avoided because the internet said so: Alcohol Binge eating and late-night meals Junk food (though I‚Äôd cheat occasionally) Things I didn‚Äôt avoid even though the internet said to: Vaping Long-term Gaviscon use (later this contributed to IBS, but at the time I literally could not sleep without taking it before bed) Constantly Googling my symptoms (led to health anxiety; eventually I forced myself to stop searching) Tests I had done: Blood tests Enclosed lung function tests Both chest CT and X-ray Heart checkups I wanted an endoscopy, but my doctor didn‚Äôt recommend it so I didn‚Äôt get one All test results came back within normal range Some comments on my last post pointed out that my case seemed stress-related/functional and that I might not understand what genetically/congenitally chronic GERD sufferers go through and I agree. I managed to recover in 4 years, while many people struggle for 10+ years. Still, I believe stress management and diet are crucial. I ate cabbage and tofu in all possible ways obsessively . I honestly believe there‚Äôs no food in the world softer and easier to digest than those. My personal tips for beating GERD: Laugh a lot (my doctor said ‚Äúwhen you laugh, your stomach laughs too‚Äù) Go outside ‚Äî don‚Äôt look for a reason, just go Keep yourself busy; my doctor even said GERD often hits people who are unemployed or inactive Fill your head with positive thoughts Stop Googling symptoms; talking to your doctor for 5 minutes is far better than doom-scrolling for an hour That‚Äôs it. I truly hope this helps and gives some hope. I still have minor lingering issues, but I‚Äôve overcome about 95% of it. Once you get busier, find things you enjoy, and bring life back into your routine, it naturally gets better. I guarantee you that. Stay strong, everyone. Yall can beat this.",

I've been mildly suffering with what I believe is GERD for pretty much most of my life at this point, but I have never experienced something like this. My throat feels like its on fire and Im not sure what else I can do. Do i need to go to the hospital? How do I stop the burning... this is unironically so painful. I thought I was going to die, now im just really uncomfortable and mad I can go back to sleep :/  I've been taking Pepcid daily for weeks now but I dont think its really helping as much as I would hope. Im scared to see a doctor, but if this becomes a reoccurring thing I don't know If I could live like this without some sort of treatment. I don't know this really sucks and I have been kind of avoiding changing my style of eating as I really enjoy all of the stereotypical trigger foods. I know at this point I'm just doing it to myself but Im still angry about it.",

      "content_preview": "So 2 months ago I think I've got sent to ER and these all started then.. I have really bad breathing issues since then and my doctor even prescribed me an inhaler although it doesn't work much for me. So the thing is especially lately, everytime I step to the bed and try to sleep I get an ongoing continuous burping till morning it doesn't ever stop and along with it everytime I drift off to sleep, my breathing starts slowing down and after 2 seconds later I just get the urge to wake up and breathe fully again, like r/SleepApnea folks. Even if I manage to sleep I get up at 3-4 am and stay up till the morning out of the panic thr I'll die in my sleep. When i first got my \"diagnosis\" (sort of, because the doctor at the time implied it was a passing thing but it haven't) my symptoms were: Loss of appetite the day before and after, nauseous, burping in long durations, trembling, sweating with a cold sensation, not being able to breathe well (ever since that day I still can't fully take a good breath), feeling of your energy taken out of you and don't forget the coughing fits. This happened me a few times, they're all too sudden. Now they're mostly gone but when I eat something I can't take or even ANYTHING at this point, I don't know because even the days I eat carefully and drink lots and lots of water I still burp on an empty stomach at nights and get sleep apnea. Any of you who matches my exact description of symptoms? I'd like to hear your experiences too.",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I've been on this subreddit for a very long time now and this is my first post here since I finally have something worth posting about! I have a very extensive list of foods I can't eat. Anytime I go out to eat I can immediately tell which foods will trigger me. Regarding that, ive noticed that i can always rely on sushi so that's another thing that might help some of you if you're into that. But anyways, the main point of this post. I've heard a few times in my life, my dad told me about this before too, that beans and rice specifically is a meal you can rely on to get the most basic amount of nutrients that you need. It's one of those staple foods. So with that in mind ive decided to just stick with that for now for about 80% of my meals. I've eaten exclusively beans and rice for lunch, a lot of times ALSO for dinner, and its always helped me loads with my symptoms. I've been having a lot of bad symptoms lately, anxiety is what makes it really bad. But the last few days ive eaten nothing but beans & rice, or just rice with something else, and my symptoms have practically gone away. I was very worried for my health but ever since I started sticking to beans and rice lately, I've just been having so much relief and im so thankful I know about this. So yeah, I just wanted to share that if youre ever stuck on deciding what to eat, get beans and rice (and I mean simple plain cooked rice and beans, no seasoning or extra flavors). It might help you a TON like it's helped me. Obviously I should go see a dietician so I can start eating other things, but for now and times like this where I feel hopeless, plain beans and rice has never let me down and has helped me SO MUCH.",

      "content_preview": "Well its been a crazy 7 months. I knew I had some acid reflux as there has been incidents during my sleep where it has choked me and woke me up in the middle of the night. I know I have also had a hand of incidents where it came up during the day while standing up working. My acid reflux I can honestly say most months I don't even have a flare up that I even know about. These last 7 months though I have had a lot of crazy stomach problems (noises,fullness,bloating,heaviness in stomach, bowel changes). Of course when you have long term issues that dont go away you get extra worried and probably makes the symptoms even worse. Freaking out and expecting the worst I scheduled an appointment with a gastro and reviewed everything and he thought lets go ahead and get a colonoscopy and endoscopy to get some peace of mine at least. Needless to say I had one benign colon polyp and one precancerous polyp at the bottom of the esophagus. No cancer so I am very happy for this and no other big heavy hitter diseases. both polyps removed ( I am 42 next week so I guess its not bat at all). Doctor even said dont even worry about the pre cancerous  polyp because it was removed and even them have only a 8 percent chance of even turning cancerous when not removed but we got it anyway. So during the tests there was signs of GERD and the doctor gave me pantoprazole 40 mg to take daily before breakfast. Ehh I get the purpose and what he wants me to take it for but the long term side affects sound terrible. He wants me to take this for 60 days then 20mg afterwards. I know this is a small dose, but if this is something I may have to remedy long term I dont want to have to take this forever. I have seen so many people talking about slippery elm on multiple sources online. Anyone have any experience? Natural sounds way better to me and without the risk of joint and bone problems.",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I'm new here, 28f. I have had 2 oesophageal spasms in the past year. The first spasm was gradual onset, severe chest pain that felt like squeezing right at my breast bone and radiated through to my back. It lasted about 4 hours. It was very scary. The second spasm I had came on more quickly (over about an hour) and was much more severe, I couldnt even walk without keeling over. I ended up calling an ambulance and having a green whistle and fentanyl to manage the pain. In the hospital they did a chest X-ray which was NAD and an ECG which showed normal heart activity. I saw my GP recently to review these occurances and they weren't interested in sending me for any further intervesigations. My question is, does anyone else have these extremely long and severe spasms? And how do you manage them and the anxiety that comes with them? Even the tiniest bit of chest pain now sends me spiraling into a panic attack. I should also mention I'm a nurse and I'm on escitalopram for existing anxiety.",

I am following all general gerd lifestyle recommendation and still figuring out what ppi works for me. But.. i feel like i need a better nasal spray or something for my upper throat to reduce irritation especially at night. Dymista spray actually worsened my symptoms so bad, and the pharmacist told me it could be the corticosteroid in it going down the throat and causing more relaxation or the sphincters after a few days of use. Please if you found a nasal or throat spraying routine apart from alkhaline water can you share it with me? Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "(The start of this is an update about my life, so if you don‚Äôt want to read it, go to the bottom of this post for the acid reflux stuff. But if you do, you can read it and I‚Äôd recommend reading my last post before this). So it‚Äôs been 40, almost 41 days since my last post. I‚Äôm 14 now because my birthday was on August 13th (yay)!! I also started school, my freshman year, and it isn‚Äôt as bad as I thought it would beüòÅ but I hate the school because of the staff and the setup the school has. We have A and B days. I don‚Äôt really know how to explain it, so please look it up if you don‚Äôt know what it is. For my A day, I have Art first, then Spanish 1, then lunch, then Computer Science, then Ecology (basically science if you don‚Äôt know), and lastly advisory. Advisory is kind of weird. They say it‚Äôs like setting you up for your future. Updates about the school and stuff. Kind of like a study hall basically. Every single one of my classes are an hour and 25 minutes long, except for advisory, which is 30 minutes. And lunch is only 20 minutes long I think. Basically 10-15 when everyone gets through the line. And there are literally about 10-15 staff members and teachers in our lunch period. Stalker much?? Then on my B Day, I have Theatre first, Algebra 1 second, English 1 third, and PE last. I hate B Day so much. My English teacher pisses me off so bad. She always comes up with these stupid rules and thinks that people will like her after. Especially now that she has made this rule to where we can only go to our lockers 3 times a day. Once in the morning, 2nd at lunch (only if you have a lunchbox), and lastly when you leave school. And it‚Äôs only for us freshmanü´© But my older brother and his friends have A day lunch with me, but on B day, they have a different lunch than me. One of his friends is actual so attractive (But I know I could never be with him so I just leave him alone and I have respect for my brother and his boundaries too. Which is not talking to his friends at all). But I will steal glances at his friends at lunch and my friends say they see his friends staring at us. And I know they‚Äôre probably making fun of me- but I like being delusional. And here‚Äôs the thing with Algebra‚Ä¶I cannot understand the Algebra teacher at all because of her accent. I‚Äôm not trying to be rude at all, so don‚Äôt say I‚Äôm being racist. She‚Äôs from Jamaica I think. Nobody can really understand her, especially the people who have English as their second language. The school doesn‚Äôt care either. We also have to put our phones in these yondr pouches. I hate them. And then the uniform rules‚Ä¶ I get a uniform. But their rules about a jacket are so petty. We can‚Äôt wear any jacket that doesn‚Äôt have their logo on it and they‚Äôre always yelling at us to tuck in our shirts. Now onto the GERD/acid reflux stuff: I‚Äôm not nearly as bad as before, but I have been overeating a lot and today I have some chocolate too, so I think that‚Äôs triggering my acid reflux right now. It‚Äôs making me kind of nauseous and isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as it was on my last post. Y‚Äôknow that feeling when your stomach is growling? Yeah, that‚Äôs happening, but in my throat. That‚Äôs what happens before I burp. And every time I burp, my stomach feels a bit better. I‚Äôm currently chewing on mint gum right now which is helping a bit and I really need to go on a diet (which might help me a lot), but I‚Äôm too lazy and can never commit. I also want to play soccer. I always have. But now that I‚Äôm kinda chubby, and pretty much too old to start, I think it‚Äôs impossible, and my anxiety is killing me. I always get anxiety attacks after school ends. They never really happen during the day, most of the time after school and during nighttime. Like right now. I need tips yall‚Ä¶and please don‚Äôt say ‚Äòjust throw up‚Äô. I won‚Äôt. I have Emetophobia. The fear of the throwing up. And my anxiety also makes me scratch the top of my head and stuff when I‚Äôm anxious, and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs feeding into the fear‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm feeling kind of sleepy now and I kinda wanna go to sleep. When I get like this, I get sleepy and stuff and when I close my eyes, the anxiety decreases. So I‚Äôm wondering if me not getting enough sleep might be feeding into my anxiety, as well as my eating habits and my fear of throwing up. Tips??",

      "content_preview": "I eat 3 hours before bed I drank ginger and turmeric tea in the morning. I felt like this helped me. Magnesium glycinate 500 mg and melatonin 2.5 mg at bedtime (I split 5 mg melatonin in half with a pill cutter). 5 mg was too much for me. I was so tired and sleepy the next day. I started both at the same time so I‚Äôm not sure which or both helped. When I had a GERD flare, I would be VERY cautious about my food intake. First, I was very attentive to chewing my food a lot before swallowing. This helped me maybe the most. I tend not to chew much when I eat. Make sure you‚Äôre chewing your food fully before swallowing. Probiotic before or with a meal. This helped with my chewing issue I have. I had to take 1 capsule before or with each meal. It helped with bloating as well. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were great for lunch. Egg whites with toast were my go-to breakfast every single day. I had just bare chicken (just bare is the brand) that I air fryed a lot. BBQ sauce was the only sauce I could eat during my flare (you may be different). Obviously no acidic or spicy food. I was on omeprazole 20 mg every night for about 2 weeks. 2 extra strength Gaviscon tablets and 1-2 Tums tablets after every meal. I did this right after any meal I ate. Manuka honey MGO 550+ if I felt acid come up. This is actually really expensive and I tried to not use it all the time. Tbh, I could‚Äôve gone without the Manuka honey. But it is good bc it‚Äôs a prebiotic for the gut so it does help. But if ur on a probiotic, this is probably not needed. Something I didn‚Äôt try but I was about to order if I didn‚Äôt get better was chewable DGL licorice tablets. I‚Äôve heard very good things about these tablets for GERD. You‚Äôre supposed to chew 1-2 tablets before each meal. Make sure you‚Äôre chewing the tablet. Don‚Äôt swallow whole. Also make sure you get the CHEWABLE tablets not the capsules. Other supplements that I didn‚Äôt try but people have good results with are: Slippery elm Marshmallow root L-glutamine Zinc Aloe Vera juice Hope this helps someone!",

      "content_preview": "Just wanted to start my saying that this subreddit provided me so much support throughout my healing journeyüíïüíï. I‚Äôve had acid reflux for years but didn‚Äôt take it seriously until I started having horrible episodes this year. I went to a clinic for my heartburn and acid reflux in 2023 but they just told me to take TUMS and sent me home so I just always ignored it üòê. I had all the normal GERD triggers - spicy foods, fried foods, [saturated] fatty foods, tomatoes, chocolate, citrus, peppermint, alcohol, carbonated drinks, caffeine. My symptoms were- heartburn, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, excessive burping. I was miserable until the past few weeks üò≠. Earlier in the year, I tried to resolve my GERD through the natural way - got a dietitian, limited trigger foods, followed all the rules (multiple small meals a day, wait 3 hours before laying down, chew throughly etc.). My dietitian was also helping me heal and maintain a healthy gut microbiome but my symptoms continued to get worse. It took me months to find a doctor that could help me because of waitlists. The first one I saw prescribed me Pantoprazole. That did not work for me and gave me horrible stomach pain. Then I was prescribed Dexlansoprazole, I took it for 4 weeks and I feel SO MUCH BETTER. üôåüèºüôåüèº I‚Äôve been consuming my trigger foods and drinks and having none of my symptoms. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm fully healed, but it‚Äôs nice enjoying my trigger foods again in a limited quantity üíï. TUMS & Pepcid did nothing for me, but there‚Äôs some things that helped me relieve my symptoms: Trader Joe‚Äôs ginger mints Homemade ginger tea Homemade fennel tea Traditional Medicinals throat coat tea (this works great for me I drink it everyday) Raw fennel seeds Eno chewy bites Aloe vera juice  (no added sugar) Harmless Harvest coconut water with aloe pulp Going on a BRAT diet for 3-4 days when I have a bad flare up Eating a GERD friendly meal right after or day after having a trigger food (balance was key for me to heal) This is not meant to be medical advice, just my story. Happy to share more or answer questions. I‚Äôm so happy it got better üò≠. Oh another factor was definitely stress. I think my GERD was triggered from stress, I started a stress management routine over the past few months which I think also helped me heal!",

      "content_preview": "You may have had reflux or GERD for what seems like forever, but you can‚Äôt quite shake it. Lifestyle changes, diet improvements, and/or medication seem to help, but not enough. You keep asking yourself- why is my reflux not going away for good? I see these sentiments a lot in this subreddit. They‚Äôre pretty common, whether from someone who‚Äôs been struggling with reflux for years or only for a short time. From what I‚Äôve seen, most of these are (unfortunately) self-inflicted. They think they‚Äôre doing everything right, but are actually missing something. Just wanted to write this honest and blunt post to help you out, if you feel like this might be you. Here are some of the most popular missing pieces: You‚Äôre not being consistent with diet or lifestyle changes This is a SUPER common one. A person gets reflux/GERD, they‚Äôre overwhelmed with symptoms, and they make quick changes- life like getting on a reflux-safe diet and putting into practice popular lifestyle techniques (like not eating too late). For a week or two, this seems to be helping‚Ä¶ but then they compromise. They eat that trigger food they know they‚Äôre not supposed to. They have dessert too close to bed. They drink that glass of wine or bottle of beer. They tell themselves they‚Äôre still being reflux-safe, when in reality they‚Äôre not. Often, this leads to a perpetual cycle. They relax, reflux symptoms coming back as strong as ever, they go back to a strict diet, and then it happens again. They do not give themselves enough time to heal, or their body time to adjust. Some people‚Äôs reflux also just needs more permanent lifestyle/diet changes in order to be managed. Many people ARE able to loosen things up a bit after a while, but this is usually after many months or even a couple years of diet and lifestyle changes, not a few weeks or a just month or two. If you‚Äôre in this boat, find a way to stay consistent with a reflux-safe diet and lifestyle. Stay disciplined, plan your meals, and do whatever you have to do to heal. Staying consistent is the best way to get to eventual improvement. At some point, most people are able to work in some trigger foods, or relax their lifestyle- but you are probably not there yet. 2. You‚Äôre depending on meds to cure reflux, when they‚Äôre only a band-aid solution The second way I see a lot of people frustrated at a slow process of healing is because they ONLY depend on meds, and do not make adequate lifestyle or diet changes. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong- meds can be a helpful component, and for severe reflux/GERD, sometimes necessary. But if you are taking meds while also eating a lot of trigger foods, or neglecting to make lifestyle changes, you‚Äôre simply not going to see any improvement. Solution? Make it a priority to shift your diet and lifestyle to be more reflux-friendly. Meds alone will not help that much, and are not even an actual cure for reflux- just a way to treat symptoms. Long term, you want to figure out how to get off of meds. Lifestyle and diet are key ways to do that. 3. You‚Äôre not tracking your progress or symptoms, or setting any goals Let‚Äôs say you have your lifestyle and diet in a good place. That‚Äôs great- but at this point, some are still frustrated. A lot of that frustration and stress can come from not feeling like you are in control, and not feeling like you understand what‚Äôs going on. Actually tracking your reflux (and setting some goals) is a critical part. Instead of trying to keep track of your symptoms through your memory (a lost cause), actually track them! This allows you to approach reflux in a more controlled way, and have actual data to base your treatment plan on (and foods to avoid, lifestyle changes to make, etc.). Give yourself the information you need to make smart choices, rather than flying blind. To do this, you have a few options. You could use a notebook, journal, or spreadsheets. You could use a reflux-focused app like NoBurn. You could even use post it cards. Whatever you decide, stay consistent, follow through, and set some goals for yourself to look forward to. Things like ‚Äúnext month, I will cut my symptoms in half‚Äù. Having aspirations is a great way to cheer yourself up during your journey and keep you motivated during tough times. 4. You‚Äôre doing nearly everything right, but avoiding an obvious issue This is also something I see pretty consistently on this subreddit. A person makes a post, they‚Äôre super stressed out, and they mention what they‚Äôre so far. Everything looks right, they are properly following a reflux friendly diet and lifestyle‚Ä¶ then they reveal they vape regularly, or drink regularly, or are obese. No judgement if that is your situation! However, understand that these things are critical to combating your reflux. If you are unwilling to change them, having the most perfect diet in the world isn‚Äôt going to do much at all. It might be stressful and difficult to do something like quit drinking or lose weight, but for progressing past reflux long-term, you have to stop neglecting these issues. The results are worth it. 5. You‚Äôre letting stress and fear rule you This one is easier said than done of course, but it still matters. Reflux/GERD can be stressful to manage, especially when it feels like nothing is going your way. However, a major thing to note here is that stress often causes reflux itself. This can put people in these frustrating and somewhat paradoxical situations, where their reflux causes them to stress out, then their stress causes more reflux, and so forth. If this is you, here are some things that might help. 1) Slow down. You may be frantically looking for solutions every day. Reflux takes time to heal. 2) Know that many, many people have successfully treated reflux- and you can too. Again, it may take time, but be optimistic about the future. 3) Find some ways to relieve stress. These could be things like deep breathing exercises, short walks, sports, hobbies, hanging out with friends, you name it. Figure out how to best take your mind off of reflux, and replace the stress and anxiety with other things. I hope these tips helped- let me know if you have any questions!",

I was obsessed with scientifically isolating certain foods and would cut something out for 2 weeks, observe, then cut something else out and nothing seemed to be \"the trigger\". Now I eat basically whatever I want but in moderation and have been nearly symptom free for almost 6 months. FWIW I also take Voquezna + Famotidine, a fiber supplement and work out like a demon which also seem to help tremendously.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all - wanted to share some symptoms I‚Äôve been having for the past 3 months to see if anyone can relate / has any helpful tips or suggestions. Month 1: Sudden onset of: symptoms similar to a heart attack (shortness of breath, chest tightness, heart palpitations, dizziness - went to the ER and ruled out heart related issues with an ECG. Symptoms calmed down for a bit. Month 2: visited a walk-in clinic and described my symptoms - doctor said likely GERD, however I didn‚Äôt feel convinced. I am not having typical GERD symptoms such as heartburn, acid reflux, sour taste in mouth etc. At this point all I could feel was a gnawing / burning in upper abdomen right where the abdomen meets the ribcage. I‚Äôve had this feeling before so I was convinced it was gastritis, but never had this for so long‚Ä¶ anyways, was prescribed pantoprazole magnesium 20mg once a day for a month and I finished about 3 weeks of it before I began to feel better and then dropped it. During months 1 and 2 I continued my regular diet (a lot of fast food, alcohol, etc) wasn‚Äôt very mindful of whether this had an impact at this point. Month 3 (right now): Primary symptoms are extreme bloating shortly after meals feeling of pressure in my upper abdomen, the burning and gnawing is still there gurgling / sounds in the same area tiredness/fatigue despite getting a lot of sleep most annoying symptom is the tightness of upper abdomen after meals - makes it feel like I can‚Äôt get a deep breath / really have to try to get a full one no heartburn still and no acid reflux consistent burping and farting (quite gassy) all the time poop has been consistently hard and in small pieces (not as small as pebbles though) for the past week I went on a GERD diet for 1 week (started last week) and seemed to have helped the symptoms within 3 days. And simultaneously, been working out to lose some belly fat in case it is GERD and I heard weight loss helps. For context I‚Äôm 193lbs and 6 feet tall, however most of my fat is around my belly and thighs - fairly lean upper body. I did break this diet after 7 days for 1 night where I had a good amount of alcohol and fried fatty foods (birthday party) and had no reaction / symptom flareups that night. Next morning I was fine as well, however had a carbonated Poppy at lunch and this triggered all my symptoms all over again. I‚Äôm currently on pantoprazole again (on it for 15 days so far, did twice a day for the first week and now once a day as prescribed by my family doctor in a follow up). I‚Äôve taken a Urea breath test in case it‚Äôs h pylori but waiting for results still - not sure how likely hpylori is tbh, but trying all avenues. If this comes back negative, will consider an endoscopy. Anyways the most annoying part for me is the extreme bloating feeling that‚Äôs causing difficulty getting a full breath vs. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs GERD triggering asthma symptoms? What do yall think - do I just need more time on the GERD diet and meds‚Ä¶? Is it worth exploring a SIBO test based on symptoms?",

      "content_preview": "I don't have anyone else to speak to about this so I'm ranting here. I'm 18 and began suffering with chest aches a little over a week ago, one trip to A&E (ER) and an emergency clinic they ruled it as acid, I'm on my fifth day of omeprazole but I really can't take it anymore, each night I think I'm getting better it‚Äôs a new pressure or ache, I'm beginning to feel it in my sternum and beneath my left rib and my stomach not just my chest anymore and the worst part is I'm so paranoid it could be something more than GERD even though they ran bloods, two ECGs, chest x-ray and a CT and found nothing. It gets so much worse at night I feel scared and weak and can't stop crying, I apologise if this isn't the right sub for this but I don't know what to do anymore.",

      "content_preview": "Currently 20F and It's been about 2-3 years since I started having this condition, where my acid just triggers and to be fair, i still don't know how to manage it. Ever since i got gerd, i started having anxiety about it and the foods i eat, becoming overly conscious of oily foods, dairy, etc. I'm not officially diagnosed yet as my father told me i don't need to get checked by a gastroentologist even though the ER i went to referred me. He said it will pass, but it's been 2-3 years now. I'm just asking if my experiences align with yours, if that's okay. Whenever i eat little, it triggers my acid, when i eat more it does the same thing. My triggere always seem to be a lot of meats, oily foods, spicy foods, caffeine, dairy, and chocolates, for some reason some fish as well. Whenever i do eat trigger foods, i always feel my stomach hurt like it frels sour and i start burping, even getting acid reflux. Ever since then, i started getting anxiety about the feeling and whenever i get anxiety, it also triggers it lol. I guess i just needed some validation becausr whenever i bring it up to my family, they always tell me it'll pass or that i just need to change my diet even though i already did and it still triggers on occasion. I apologize if my title and flair is wrong, I'm not really sure how to tag this as. Thanks for taking the time out to read this :)",

      "content_preview": "I have been on PPI's for around 5 months now. My main issues were a hoarse voice and post nasal drip which causes a foul smell. Thankfully the post nasal drip went soon after I started taking Lansoprazole along with a nasal steroid and dietary changes which involved mainly avoiding snacks/eating late at night. However my hoarse voice still hadn't gone away. The Doctor suggested to change from Lansoprazole to Omeprazole which hadn't made a difference, until last week when I ran out of my usual dose of Omeprazole, and I decided to buy an OTC version of Omeprazole which has worked wonders! I feel like my voice has been back to normal touch wood. But this OTC version of Omeprazole is giving me headache and feeling nauseous. I am wondering if I should continue taking  the OTC version or go back to taking the one prescribed by the Doctor? I am also considering stopping the PPI's. Can I stop straight away? Thanks for your advice",

But then night comes and my stomach starts.  Every single night. I take meds but it doesn't matter.  I fall asleep sitting up, and it doesn't matter.  It'll wake me up and give me anxiety.  Then around 2am, it's over.  I can lay flat if I want to at that point.  It has to be something physiologically or hormone related going on every night around the same time.",
