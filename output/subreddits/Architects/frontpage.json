      "content_preview": "I am about to start taking the ARE in New Jersey. I've been working at a firm in south Jersey for 3 years. My plan is to get licensed, hopefully get a raise, and continue working at this firm for a tad bit longer as I feel that I lack experience still. To be honest, I do love this job, but I simply cannot fathom working a 9-5 until I retire. I think Id rather be homeless than work for a barley livable salary that can't afford me a home anytime soon. My familiy runs a pretty successfull construction company in North Jersey. I am debating on just risking everything and going solo, and some how tie my license in with my families construction company. Does anyone have any similar experiences, or knowledge on such a transition, being that I've only worked for 3 years as an architect. I mainly worked construction my whole life. I am just tired of being around people who have fully accepted working their lives away for someone else, living pay check to pay check to feed their families, and pay mortgages. Nobody at my job seems to want more in life, and I find this mentality to be draining. Maybe I'm delusional. I am also a single 26 year old male, with zero responsibilities, who luckily can live at home. I really want a house, but it's almost impossible for me any time soon, which Is why im willing to risk this job right after licensure and start from 0, working for myself.",

      "content_preview": "So pretty much all states have protections of the ‘architect’ title. That is good, but obviously not enough as many companies/individuals have begun marketing architecture-related work without being licensed. What Oregon is doing is including language that prevents any unlicensed individuals deceiving consumers into thinking they are receiving architectural work. The specific language is: OAR 806-010-0037(1) prohibits the use of the title \"Architect\" or any modification or derivative such as \"architectural\" or \"architecture\" when such use misleads, or deceives a consumer seeking services related to designing, in whole or in part, buildings and the space within and appurtenant to buildings in Oregon. Excited to see this being introduced. Lots of drafters producing ‘architectural drawings’ without being licensed nowadays.",

My interests and strengths are in BIM (Revit), construction detailing as well as visualization (rendering, diagrams, presentation). My long-term goal is to work abroad  possibly in Singapore, Australia, Japan, or Europe. I was an intern at a high-rise building design company that mainly used Revit and rhino, and I quite enjoyed this type of work. I've never really been good at conceptual thinking but I love BIM, construction detail and visualization. I’d like to ask: How many years of work experience should I get in my home country before applying overseas? Do firms abroad usually value technical BIM/detail skills more, or design/visualization skills for entry-level roles? What’s the best way to build a portfolio that stands out internationally? For those who have worked abroad, what was your path to getting your first job outside your country? Any advice, personal experience, or resources would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",

I have always been interested in architecture and it is my area of interest in art history, though I never seriously considered it as a career because I was set on academia. I also have fairly limited studio/design experience. I’m in Canada, my question is, is it possible/a good idea to pursue an M.Arch without a relevant bachelor’s? The only English program in my city requires a B.Sc in architecture (McGill) and I don’t think it is worth it to do an entirely new undergrad. The other options would be to hone my French for a year and apply at the francophone university, or move to a different city. Both of these options feel intimidating. For those with an M.Arch, did you also do your undergrad in architecture or was it something else? Were there people in your program with unrelated bachelor’s? Additionally, would it be possible to find work related to architecture/design if I take a year off to take French classes and work part time to build my portfolio? Thank you!",

I hired an architects’ firm to develop and submit the structural plans. It turns out that two different versions of the same drawings (showing different design details) were submitted. Unfortunately, the builders have worked off the wrong version, which wasn’t the one we wanted or approved. To make things trickier, there’s also a third set of updated structural drawings (the correct ones) which were never submitted at all. Correcting the mistake now will involve extra costs. My questions are: In this situation, who would normally be liable for the extra costs — the architects (for submitting conflicting/incorrect drawings) or the builders (for not clarifying)? Would this usually be something covered by the architects’ professional indemnity insurance? Has anyone dealt with something similar where multiple versions of drawings caused confusion on site? I’d really appreciate any advice or experiences before I go back to the architects to discuss how this should be resolved. Thanks!",

This will be over both digital and physical design. \"It is the policy of my Administration to deliver digital and physical experiences that are both beautiful and efficient, improving the quality of life for our Nation.  Towards that end, the National Design Studio will advise agencies on how to reduce duplicative design costs, use standardized design to enhance the public’s trust in high-impact service providers, and dramatically improve the quality of experiences offered to the American public.\" The Executive Order linked above is very vague, and does not give any indication of what this exactly means. So we as an industry will need to pay attention to see how this affects federal building projects. I am not posting this to discuss the Trump administration, or their potential impact on architecture. I just want to point out to the community that this now exists, and anyone that is bidding on federal projects should be aware of this new office and the potential effects it will have on the built environment.",

I am self employed and had a baby this year who is 10 months old.  Previous to giving birth, I was making good money but working very long unsustainable hours.  While on maternity leave, I feel as though everything that I built in my small business is gone and it has been absolutely brutal to try to return and build my career again.  At this point, I am so regretful to have ever gone into this industry.  All I want is a job that feels like it could truly support my small family in our high cost of living area.  Without my husband’s income though, this would be so tough to manage on my earnings alone and leaves me feeling so vulnerable / embarrassed / disappointed in myself. I see so many other moms gliding through life on salary positions in tech or many other big industries… with great benefits and flexibility to not have to slave away at a screen every minute of the day.  All while creating real financial savings and contributing to their family’s finances equally. Meanwhile, I’m debating if we can really afford daycare on my earnings and can’t see how motherhood as an architect really works.  It just sucks.  For all the work, it makes me angry, frustrated, lost…. Feel like I just got some vanity degree in college. I just feel very sad. (And I know probably sound ungrateful.) positive words and stories are welcome to help me turn this around or inspire me to take my work in a different direction…. UPDATE:  thank you all so much for the kind, thoughtful responses.  From simply acknowledging that what I’m feeling isn’t crazy, identifying with motherhood challenges / career stalls, and offering fresh takes on how to simply reframe my perspective…. I feel much calmer and reassured now. I am going to work on accepting that not everything needs to be up and running on all cylinders at every stage of life.  And that’s okay.  Also will focus on being thankful for the opportunities that I do have and not dwell on comparisons.  To all the parents out there - raising kids is really no joke and a full time career in itself!",

      "content_preview": "Hi! Im a student in QLD, Australia, and would like some honest thoughts on career prospects for graduates in architectural design before I commit. I would LOVE to study architecture- I feel like it’s a good balance (for me) of practical and computer work, creative but still with guidelines, technical/plan-focused, collaborative, and I also have a huge passion for (obviously) architecture and beautiful, functional spaces. But I am nervous about job prospects, because I’ve heard they aren’t great, and I’m interested in what people in the industry think, since I’ve already switched degrees 1 1/2 times (Vet science -> genetic science -> scheduled to start interaction design 2026). Information I can find indicates that post-grad employment (in Australia) has been increasing since ~2022, although i can’t find if this is full time or part time, or even in the industry, and the information isn’t that up to date. Architecture is also a notoriously competitive industry (for graduates and in general), and while I certainly don’t mind this, I am trying to be realistic. I know my cousin graduated from her architecture degree in 2019, couldn’t get a job, and is now a social worker. In my family, getting a ‘useless’ degree (:,)) is apparently a cardinal sin, so after she did that I never really considered architecture as a serious option (but I have been told Im a disappointment anyway, so I’m considering doing something I like!) I have a few months to decide. I accepted my offer for Interaction Design at QUT, and then deferred to start in Sem 1 2026- I can internally transfer at any time. I don’t plan on committing to the dual bachelors/masters degree straight away, but would consider it if it has that much influence on post-grad career options. I think it would be just as good (or better) to graduate with bachelors, work/intern for a bit, and then try for my masters with some real world experience (I’ve also heard uni doesn’t prepare you that well for working, but I dont know when the curriculum was last updated, or if this has been addressed). Thanks in advance!",

I'm about to complete my Part 3 course, which means I'll soon be officially licensed to use the title 'architect' in the UK. While there are many rewarding aspects of the profession - both in terms of the work itself and the community - I’ve been thinking very seriously about what alternative career paths might be available to architects, seeing that many mid-tier architects reach career plateaus as there is increasingly less scope for progression in firms. It’s becoming harder for me to envision a long-term future in practice that allows for financial stability, a healthy work-life balance, and the ability to build a family and pay into a mortgage without significant stress. I’d love to hear from others who’ve made a transition or are considering it. What roles are you in now, and how did you make the leap?",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone. I am starting to explore alternative models of practice. Unfortunately, I had to drop my M.Arch program after 2.5 years, with just 1 year left, because I couldn't afford it. I have always imagined that I will eventually go solo in my career and have always seen licensure as the only path forward. But due to my circumstances, I am forced to rethink that approach. Not every jurisdiction allows you to even work on early design and planning phases without a license. But, many other jurisdictions allow for the stamping of drawings, even on small-scale projects like single-family homes and ADUs, without a license. In jurisdictions where I am allowed to work on early schematic phases but not allowed to stamp drawings, collaboration with other firms, either through a contractual agreement or a joint venture, is also a possibility I have read about. These have all made me hopeful that in the US, there is a future for unlicensed individuals. I understand the hardest part of all this is finding clients. I mean, who would want to trust an unlicensed individual to build their homes, right? I think that is more of a case-by-case basis rather than something that is true for everyone. There are many famous architects who, despite having little professional experience, were able to capitalize on the right connections at the right time. Exhibit A: Peter Marino's first project was the renovation of a brownstone owned by Fred Hughes. The two were introduced by Andy Warhol, whom Marino met through his girlfriend at the time, who worked for Warhol. It all eventually led to a chain reaction where Marino got introduced to other friends of Hughes. So, as long as one network plays their cards well, I don't see why someone with money wouldn't trust an early-career design professional with a renovation or other small projects if their creative visions align. So my question: has anyone ever built something without a license? How was the experience for you?",

A new foundation was poured, and the house was set onto it about 40 years ago — and it has withstood some natural disasters like earthquakes since then. City records (pulled from microfilm) show there was no final inspection . On one hand, I’m kind of amazed (first time I’ve ever heard of something like this!) and happy the foundation is newer. On the other hand, I’m wondering if I should be concerned and get it checked out. The standard home inspection didn’t reveal this history and just noted the house was in good shape. The seller and seller’s agent knew, but didn’t disclose this to us or our agent. Any builders, architects, or fellow homeowners with experience in this — what would you do?",

      "content_preview": "Hello, all architects. I've been feeling really lost in pursuing architects as my career.  I need advice on whether should stay on or pivot to something else.   What should I learn, and what path should I go after? of Here are ome background information about me and my works I am 29 years ago, about to turn 30 in the next couple months. Graduated with bachelor's degree from a non-accredited architectural school. So I did not go through an intense architectural program. Working under a residential architect in the Bay Area for the past 5 years and still counting. My current job title is Job Captain.  The firm size is extremely small, only 5 people.   We only take on residential projects ( ADU, Interior remodel, addition, some ground-up, and subdivion) I am proficient at AutoCAD, Sketchup, code research, dealing with City and Contractor, understand basics of structural framing, a little bit of CA I am working on the ARE exams, still studying, but have not taken down any of the exam yet. I have not seen a contract yet.  Typically, the architects bring in the job and finish the design, then pass on the project to us, then we push the project through the permitting process, and coordinate with the contractor. I don't have a standout portfolio. ( I don't know where to begin) subdivision How I feel about this job I only feel a sense of contentment when the building that is drawn on the plan gets actually built.  Most of the time stuck in the office drafting. Even though my job title is Job Captain,  I feel like I am more like a draftsman.  I did not grow as much I wanted to.   Pushing the project every single day. It's getting overwhelming sometimes All I know it some basic exterior and interior finishes, and typical construction assembly. The earnings from this job is not enough for me to survive in the Bay Area. And I don't want to moonlight behind my current employer. Just out for respect. He is the one who bring me into the industry and has kept me employed since I graduated from University. I want to learn something that can combine with what I know in the architecture industry I want to make more money. I have no clue what I am doing. I feel really stuck right now. Thank you so much for all the help in advance!!!",
