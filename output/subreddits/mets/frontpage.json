      "content_preview": "The Mets were supposed to be a juggernaut this season. In the first two plus months of the season, they were. Not that it would ever be smooth sailing (it never is as we all know), but I thought it would be a division race with the Phillies along with the battle for the best record in NL. There are so many issues with this team that quickly vanished these hopes. The Rotation: The rotation was simply dominant to begin the season. Guys like Griffin Canning, Clay Holmes, David Peterson, and Kodai Senga performed expectionally well. We knew it wouldn’t continue all season, but the amount of injuries and the fall off in production of the rotation’s best pieces is truly astounding. It’s an embarrassment that that McLean and Tong (thank God for them) are being looked as saviors while Senga, Manaea, and Holmes are making tons of money just to throw 5 or less innings. Mendoza’s mind boggling decisions: It seems like Mendoza has pushed the wrong buttons more often than the right ones in 2025. He seems to be managing nervously, not knowing the right bullpen arms to bring in, when to take out starters, and not putting out the right lineup. For instance, It’s mind boggling that Mullins has been starting almost every day in CF. You have McNeil, Taylor, or even Nimmo who can play there (rotation of all three). Constant bullpen moves: I know it’s the business of baseball, but it’s pretty demoralizing to see the last bullpen slot being treated as a revolving door. From Rico Garcia to Chris Devenski to Kevin Hegert, these guys have given length and pitched well only to be DFA’d or sent back down. Arms like Helsley are guaranteed spots even if they continue to struggle. I think Mets will make the playoffs as the third WC spot, not because they are good, but because the rest of the NL is composed of weaker teams (Reds, Giants, Cardinals are the only real threats and they are all over 4 games out) that simply can’t put it together. The next 25 games will be crucial to the direction of the franchise going forward. A postseason appearance should not satisfy the fanbase, but it might be all we could be getting this year. I don’t faith if they face the worst division winner in the WC round. Anything can happen, but I’m not feeling confident. Feel free to let me know if you agree/disagree and what other points I may have missed.",
