      "content_preview": "So I feel like the Voting video comes back into fashion like clockwork every 4 years. One must imagine Sisyphus happy… But I think 2028 is going to be more profound. Feel free to disagree with me here but I’m 99% sure that the race is going to be Newsom vs Vance. This means everything in Voting still applies. Vance will represent a continuation of MAGA, but Newsom is going to have a lot of trouble getting votes from the Tabby’s. In the lead up to a presidential campaign we’ve seen him try to become more moderate, including on trans rights. Not great, but still the lesser of two evils on that issue (and all the other issues…). I think there’s going to be a big backlash from leftists on a Newsom ticket. And that brings me to the next issue. Voting’s main messages came up again from Natalie last year, and I fully expect the same in 2028. But given Newsom’s moderation on LGBT+ rights, part of me thinks the reaction from the online left will be even less sympathetic than in 2020 or in 2024. I think it could lead to more annoying discourse. So not really a question for the SubReddit in here, just some ramblings (mainly brought on after seeing Taylor Lorenz criticising him on Bluesky). So…yeah feel free to share your thoughts on this. Agree? Disagree? Think I’m talking nonsense? I’m not American so I could be missing something obvious about how politics works there.",

I'm hoping you guys can help! It was about the disconnect between what a piece of art is trying to convey and the message people actually take away from it (idk if the whole video was about that or just the moment I'm thinking about), and it had an shot from (i think) American History X, with her voice saying something along the lines of \"We know he's supposed to be a bad guy... but honestly, doesn't he look kind of cool?\". I guess it could also have been a collab/an appearance in another creator's video but I kind of doubt it. I know she took some of her videos down so it might no longer be available, but if it rings a bell for anybody, please let me know!! Edit: Solved thanks to u/FlyByTieDye , it was in fact not a Contrapoints video but a Lindsay Ellis' one!",

She is absolutely correct when she says it’s one of the best documentaries ever made. Herzog’s masterpiece works on a number of different levels. From human interest story about a whacky hippy who got eaten by bears, to metaphor for the existential threat of climate change, and everything in between. Herzog’s comments about the overwhelming indifference of nature are so powerful.",

      "content_preview": "I've been revisiting older videos after the Paglia tangent and it's striking how much of what has her currently canceled re: I/P is plentiful throughout Violence, The Left, Degeneracy etc. The enjoyment of necessary violence as an uncomfortable litmus test for left wing movements, the abandonment of optics for smaller and smaller silos of acceptable opinions, and left wing accelerationalism being assumed to bear out well for the \"good guys\". There's been discourse on the various twitters to the tune of \"Natalie is revealing the neoliberal colonialist she's always been,\" and to some degree, they're right. But the more honest reading is Natalie was never hiding anything and really hasn't changed. She's always been a liberal with socialist leanings, distrustful of the violent carte blanche tendencies of internet far leftism. She's more interested in nuance than sloganeering, a truth seeker who hates being condescended to for her marginalization. I know it's been said many times on this little corner of the internet, but I do find it unbelievably depressing that the left has decided to hate her so bad, to make her irredeemable. While being a contrarian in the way she is of course will draw detractors, to me she always comes across clearly trying to illuminate truth, understand others, and fight for a better world. The left is beyond hope if they see her as an enemy. I'm not sure what the solutions are. I hate that I couldn't even bring up Natalie in my social circles without suffering a minor version of the same fate. I feel so stuck in between my belief in making the world better without violent means and what seems to be blood thirst from my entire political wing. I know it's not always avoidable but do we have to hunger for it so openly?",

      "content_preview": "I decided to make a post in reference to contra's latest instagram post, which is about a tangent on her patreon regarding Paglia. The comment section is....a mess..... I think the irony is that a lot of the comments parrot the ideas Natalie presented in 'canceling' I have noticed that A LOT of people are calling her a 'zionist' and a 'fascist' despite Natalie being on the same side as a FREE PALESTINE. I think its valid that people disagreed with some of her points on reddit, however this is taken too far and to an extreme... This outrage I think would better be directed toward politicians whose votes directly impact what happens in Gaza. What is going on there is horrific... It IS no doubt a genocide, but I fail to see what piling on Natalie does to fix that? Even if she made a video on it tomorrow, she would be ridiculed for making a video NOW that she is being cancelled... I don't think she can \"win\" this one... I don't exactly know what the solution is but I think one of the answers is NOT to engage with the 'haters' their minds are ALREADY made up about her. She donates regularly to Palestine causes.... at this time she is correct in that a video won't change much.... Like a lot of people, I HATE that there is so much violence and unrest in the world.... I don't think that cancelling Natalie will fix that. I also worry about her... I don't want to wake up and find out that she is gone because so many people are publicly hating on her... I have lost enough people in my life already... I guess what I am saying is that the misplaced rage only hurts Natalie and doesn't really help Palestinians... wouldn't it be better to uplift Palestinians instead of tearing down Natalie?",

      "content_preview": "This is just some disorganized thoughts about apologies and the philosophy surrounding accountability and what that looks like. I'm going to leave out names because I don't know if it will get caught in the auto mod. Maybe a pitch for a new video lol. Over the past several days there's been some pretty interesting TikTok drama, a big fitness influencer quitting the Internet because people refused to accept his apology for saying \"coloreds\" on a live stream defending his decision to not apologize for defending Hulk Hogan. A bunch of disorganized people making an accountability archive, the solid gold labubu lady unfortunately making a black face labubu that was supposed to be a streamer, a \"looksmaxxing\" influencer getting called out for hanging out with a notorious Nazi twitter influencer and finally a popular lawyer getting outed as a sex pest. Now most of these controversies have at least one thing in common which is that the mob demands accountability. But what does taking accountability actually look like? How do you want these people to take accountability? How does adding people to an archive force that person into taking accountability? Does the mob have the power to force that person to be accountable forever? The most important thing is that does this desire to hold someone accountable actually lead to a path of reconciliation? Reconciliation? What is that? I have no idea. There are people who still have grudges from various incidents with celebrities, influencers and YouTubers. Hell even I have a parasocial vendetta against Chris Brown(it's on sight). People apparently have a parasocial vendetta against Beyonce for supposedly going onto Epstein island, this happened when she would be in middle school was she a victim? Who knows but the grudge is real and you're valid sweety. Is there anything at all these people can do as they take accountability to ever reach a stage of reconciliation and moving on with forgiveness being the best case scenario? And people will claim that they moved on from insert person here and then they memorized a list of sins and transgressions. Is this really moving on when you can instantly recall everything someone did but not what you ate for breakfast? There's another angle of moving on where people practice forgiveness but don't forget about the transgressions. In my opinion that's probably the healthiest way to do things because lying to yourself that you moved on but you're still keeping track of what this person does is an interesting way of moving through life with a healthy dose of \"I'm just holding them accountable\" while that person never actually sees their comment, post or video. The link between accountability and the path to reconciliation seems to be broken in a seemingly permanent way. What do you want the labubu lady to do? Dedicate her platform to anti racist education? Kill herself as an apology? I have a feeling that more people want option b over option a however neither are viable as this is a comedy tiktoker at the end of the day. There's someone out there right now debating on the morality of following the labubu laby feeling like they have to discard a piece of joy as to not be \"held accountable\" themselves as their mutuals can't punch up at the labubu lady but you are in their reach. A lot of people can't reconcile with the fact that they lack power themselves and feel like they lack control. Putting a screenshot of a tweet of someone with a profile picture of Mugi from K-on onto a Google drive to eventually \"own them\" after they may or may not change their opinion seems like is returning a sense of control to that person. But maybe that person should join a community basketball team instead.",

      "content_preview": "Really keen for thoughts on this one. Feels underdeveloped. Do you think algorithmically tailored information saturation performs a similar function to censorship? “Past behaviour is therefore used to predict our future decisions, creating a loop between ourselves and these media providers. Algorithms hone in on what will keep us using their services, and then saturate us with that media. Decisions about what we experience are being made for us by unelected third parties with no vested interest in our well-being. This means that what we think and what we feel are also being sculpted by these same authorities. Huge proportions of global populations swing towards hivemind-like appreciations of incredibly complex global events, having only consumed media that whittles news down to bite-sized chunks designed to emotionally satiate. It no longer requires an appreciation of a situation or a dynamic to feel like an expert. Daily saturation of the same algorithmically-tailored ideas produces within us a sense of self-assurance no different to that produced in authoritarian countries with tightly regulated state media. One cannot help but consider 1984’s Minitruth. The question that remains is whether or not the word censorship works both ways. Is it unreasonable to suggest that the saturation of one’s personalised media feeds performs the same function as censorship? Instead of a government banning the free-flowing of all media, companies like Meta can perform the same freedom-curtailing function by ensuring that people see as much of what they want—as opposed to as much of what they might need—as possible.” https://open.substack.com/pub/fornormalpeople/p/censorships-affect-on-the-brain?r=j3ug3&utm_medium=ios",

Feel free to suggest other mediums of artwork (poetry, paintings, etc.) My contributions: Hozier's song \"Foreigner's God\" reminds me of \"Shame\" -- especially the line \"I've no language left to say it/but all I do is quake for her,\" which I feel like evokes comphet. His song \"Angel of Small Death\" reminds me of \"The Hunger\" -- the actual Angel of Small Death being Lucy, ofc, but the descriptions of people addicted (\"shaking the wings of their terrible youths,\" \"lurch[ing] like a stray to the arms that were open\") makes me think of Virginia in her pre-Christian days. I hope it goes without saying, but please don't spam this/harass each other/the mods, etc. I just want some Contra-adjacent music suggestions. (Bach is a copout but one I'll accept).",

How long would you last, cast out into a world where survival without community is nearly impossible? You're not just alone. You're dead. Not literally, yet. But biologically? Spiritually? Socially? You’re already finished. ---- This fear of exile, of being cast out, has been burned into our brains over tens of thousands of years . We survived not because we were strong, but because we belonged. The little caveman in our brains whispering: Leave the tribe and you will die. That wasn’t a metaphor. That was nature’s law. Fast forward to modern times. We may have smartphones, but the same ancient software still runs the show. Only now, our tribes aren’t made of blood and kin—they're made of ideology. Our sense of belonging comes from political movements, online factions, hashtags. Yet, that fear of exile is just as strong. ---- Which brings us to today’s political extremists—and to Natalie’s recent canceling. When your tribe is defined by ideas instead of birth, membership is fragile. You don’t just look like a loyalist. You have to prove it. And how do you prove loyalty in a tribe of ideas? You go to the edge. You don’t just echo the tribe’s values—you scream the most extreme version of them. The louder and more uncompromising your beliefs, the harder it is for anyone to accuse you of being an outsider. So everyone follows suit. No one wants to be the moderate who gets cast out. No one wants to be the next Natalie. The ideology spirals. What once was a reasonable idea becomes a purity test. The test gets harder. The boundaries get stricter. Each new loyalty oath pushes the tribe further to the fringe. In a world of instant communication, this radicalization happens fast. Ideological shifts used to take generations, speeches given upon the mound. Now, It can happen overnight. ---- Is there any hope? Eventually, the tribe begins to eat itself. Anyone who questions the spiral becomes suspect. They’re labeled traitors. They're exiled. And for a while, the purging works - every imposter you root out cements your own safety. But when spiraling the drain, eventually you run out of material to flush. The number of exiles grows too large, until eventually they form their own tribe. This new community traditionally defaults to be a wider tent, one that welcomes the castaways, that preaches tolerance (at first), and promises that this time, they won’t turn into what they just left. The original tribe whithers on the vine, as their members seek safety in the larger group, their inner caveman whispering: Join the tribe or you will die Until the cycle begins again.",
