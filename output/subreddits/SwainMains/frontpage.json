      "content_preview": "I’m a Swain Drain tank enthusiast and love playing our guy as support. I’m looking for some advice/criticism on my build: Resolve aftershock (thinking of swapping to grasp), font, conditioning, overgrowth Secondary axiom archanist and AH Runes AH, scaling hp, scaling hp I rush tear and winters approach, then do unending despair. Winters approach is very affordable and fixes mana problems while providing a good accessible shield when it becomes Fimbul.  Unending despair is the dream drain tank item and just works so well with Swain’s kit. It’s just a little on the pricey side for support, but is just so good for drain tanking. From here, is it better to build more into tank (ie  spirit visage or knights vow) or transition to some AP or slow (Liandry’s or Raylai’s)? I realize there is flexibility, but what are you looking for when deciding between building more Ap/slow or going more tanky?",

With all due respect for Riot and specifically Phreak (I like his work a lot), even though I think the last rework did move Swain towards better gameplay, both Riot and us as the playerbase need to stop kidding ourselves: Swain still needs REAL work to be done to his kit in order for him to have a distinct playstyle and place in League's roster.",

I mean things like cait with karma, ziggs/mel with any enchanter etc? i tryed going dorans shield with font of life to survive the poke and had mixed results, where I didnt got kicked out of lane due to health, but due to lack of mana instead. Like  in mid if you are outranged you can at least clear the wave and roam, but apc dont really have that option. on a similar not, how tf do you guys deal with mel?",

Unfortunately, he's not exactly a common pick in that role outside OTPs and Bwipo so there's not a lot of resources out there. I just had a few questions that maybe you all could help me with. 1: Rune pages (I assume matchup dependent) 2: When to pick Swain top ideally. I know Bwipo says he really likes him into tank tops he can drain tank off of but I am curious about some of his non tank top matchups that are favorable for him. I definitely will not be blinding him as I am aware he has some awful lanes but any general favorable matchup examples are welcome. 3: Summoner spells 4: Best builds for top. 5: Any other general advice for Swain top, I know a lot of you play him there so any insight from Swain top players is very welcome. Thank you everyone!",

I often have to play somewhat of the tanky / secondary frontline role - depending on which friends are playing. I normally play Orn, but had so much fun with Swain in Arena I want to play him in summoners too. As I'm often the fill guy (I main sp) I don't really aim to win my lane if my opp is good - just go even and win at teamfighting. If you guys have any laning/trading tips would also greatly appreciate. Our ranks are around gold/plat so nothing super serious. Many thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I’m still fairly new to Swain, trying to have him as my official tertiary pick. Recently had a game vs Azir mid, and I ran into the issue of being consistently out ranged. His spacing was much better than mine in this matchup, I don’t have a lot of experience playing Swain nor mid yet, so to a degree that was the primary issue. I can identify that on my own, not necessarily what I need help with. The way I saw this lane, I had three choices. Back off, farm at range with Q, and let him push me under tower. Take some poke to farm with autos, trade with the tip of Q and back off. Or let him auto me for significantly longer, get EWQ off, and then back off. In all 3 scenarios, I’m down on gold, hp, and prio, and have to sit back and scale. This isn’t necessarily an Azir specific issue, I’m just using the brief example to get my decision making across, but I don’t really understand the game plan I should take here.  It’s to my understanding that Swain is very effective versus melee/mid ranged champs, but generally poor versus long ranged champs. I am trying to sit through the matchups for the sake of learning, but I’m unsure if my assessment is correct or not. Should I focus on scaling and let Azir take the gold lead? Do I need to take second wind/biscuits/dshield (I know it’s less effective as ranged but I’m unsure if that’s meaningful in this case). Is RoA the best item to rush early or should I take something else in this case. Should I feel bad about not poking/stacking passive if I’m losing trades consistently? Coming as a top lane player, being able to back without being hugely punished is a weird feeling playing mid, unsure to what degree I’m allowed to accept losing trades for the sake of scaling/gold before it’s an issue. Any/all advice appreciated.",

This mode can be a problem or a bless for swain, depending of how it is implemented, however, lets remember the main balance problem with swain is his E (what is essentially one of the slowest skillshots in the game, to the point that it isnt even fair for the player who is using it, because you dont really depend of use it propperly). The thing is consiering how slow swain and his kit is, is possible he needs some tweaks and there is where we are necesary. In my opinion we all should test the wasd controls and share feedback (aiming specially for his main role, that is midlane). If we  have luck maybe it could be good for him (or at least not be a bad thing). -------------- Here are some possible things to focus ---1: How easy or hard is to land his skillshots and specially his combos in lane? ---2: How easy or hard is for the enemies to dodge our abilities (specially our E in lane)? ---3: How the wasd controls interact with our constant aoe R1 and how benefitial are for our Q? ---4: Considering how slow swain is... How hard is to dodge enemy skillshots with him while using wasd? ---5: Would it be necesary any buff for any of his abilities? (yes) , however, would it be even more necesary to give him some love considering all the other points i mentioned? ------------- I dont really know how we can share the feedback about swain with wasd controls when it comes, but here is where we all must contribute for noxus :v If someone knows how to test it or knows how to give them the feedback (or even if someone wants to share his thoughts with the rest, i think it would be nice to do it :D) P.D.: Thank you very much in advance for reading my post :3 https://www.leagueoflegends.com/es-es/news/dev/dev-wasd-controls-are-on-the-way/",

      "content_preview": "I'm not sure if everyone has this issue, but it is difficult to move, cs, and cast abilities all with the mouse. It requires multitasking. It is doable, obviously, but Swain is also a battle made andat times it feels a bit rough moving while trying for an optimal E. When it drops I feel like Swain will do better. Easier to move while casting. The mouse I believe will purely be used for offensiveness (cs and abilities) with map. I'm very excited to weave around. Tbf I'm not using keyboard. Theres an Azeron robotic hand (mines green for swains tyrant demon arm) and it is a killer keyboard sup. Moving around like a controller nub essentially. What yall think?",
