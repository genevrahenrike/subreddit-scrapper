Also have a HT with tires that roll great (Ground Control / Purgatory) but reach their limits when it gets steep or if it's slimy, so considering bumping the tires up on the HT a bit. Contenders are something like Purgatory / Eliminator or Rekon / Dissector (new version). The new Forekaster II is probably a possible rear to combine w/ a new Dissector front also. This is less about exactly which tires you'd choose or you prefer and more about how they relatively roll... I guess a Rekon rolls faster than a Purgatory in the rear, wouldn't be surprised if a Purgatory rolls better than the new Forekaster... I might just pick up more Purgatories (can get them locally at a good price) to try and if I'm ok w/ it in the rear then get an Eliminator or Dissector front...",

      "content_preview": "So recently purchased my first second hand downhill, bit heavier to what I'm used too. Originally came with Shimano zee front and back. Both pads,discs and hoses are new Replaced the front with a new slx lever and the original zee caliper, which feels solid with one finger braking. On the rear I've got a new saint caliper and new xt deore lever . I'm having to pull pretty hard with two fingers to get stopping properly and doesn't feel as firm as the slx on the front. I've bled it more times than I can count over the last few months since I've had the setup. I've tried another new hose, olive and seals, new seal on the caliper bleed nipple. Also tried adding pressure to the system by pushing the syringe before closing the bleed nipple. Just resulted in the excess oil escaping from the end of the lever. Now looking into hope brakes , although these are all brand new so pretty frustrating. Any ideas would be super.",

I visit \"home\" often (and there's even a possibility of moving back there) and I wanted to bring my bike with me next time. Trailforks seems to be a giant mess of access roads, XC, etc, and it's kind of hard to tell what would be worth hitting. For reference, I ride 90% chunky enduro runs (tiger + raging river + north slope, etc.) and like 10% other (XC, bike park). I was hoping some bay area people could offer recommendations that would be closest to the type of riding we have up here/what I tend to do. I know that it probably won't be a 1-to-1 comparison, but anything that closely resembles some fun downhill tech/flow. TIA!",

Our bikes have 150/170mm and 165/170mm travel, skill level is somewhere around the lower end of intermediate. Red trails im Austrian bike parks are not a problem, up to S2 difficulty rating is where we are comfortable. Tours should be doable without ebikes",

I’m switching my transition spire to a coil next season as I want to make the thing feel as much like a couch in the rough stuff as possible. Used to love doing laps of jumplines and I still do but I’m also riding lots more steep rough tech trails at my local park. My question is, will I notice a big difference if I just go with the vivid coil rather than the Telum? The Telum costs quite a bit more but from what I’ve read people praise vorsprung for it. They give you a huge questionnaire before they custom tune it to your bike and riding style and it comes with a sprindex coil where as the rockshox you just order it, then order a coil for it. I’m also not huge on tinkering with settings and people say the Telum pretty much feels just right with the settings vorsprung tunes it with. I’d just like to hear some of your guys’s opinions. I’m leaning towards the Telum. Edit: off the shelf, not off the self. lol",

A lot of the areas they go to are self built - eg other riders have dug out and built the jumps. My wife and I love the fact he is out and about with his mates and not at home on the devices but we are worried about the risks. At one location this weekend there was two very serious accidents that may well leave the riders paralysed as just one example. We want to allow him to still ride but really need to encourage safe practice and do worry they are doing things outside of their ability due to the enthusiasm, adrenaline and competitive rivalry associated with it all. He has a proper helmet but beyond that no other protective gear. I am most worried about head, neck and back tbh but am really keen to hear recommendations on safe riding practices I can share with him and safety gear that I can look into. He’s 14 and has been riding fair 2 years, really getting quite extreme in the past 12 months. Thanks!",
