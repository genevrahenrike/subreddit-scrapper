This time: A sudden stop injured both me and my friend (we were wearing the lap belts provided). Staff gave us wrong info for the night tour — we waited, no bus ever came. We were also misdirected on the Beach line. The buses were dirty and overcrowded, nothing like the premium service they advertise.When I contacted customer service, instead of really listening they basically dismissed everything with excuses. The “clarifications” in their reply made me feel like I wasn’t believed at all. They offered only a partial refund, which doesn’t even begin to cover how poorly this was handled.After years of using Big Bus worldwide, Athens has forced me to switch to other companies like City Sightseeing. I’ll never recommend Big Bus hop on hop off ever again.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, just wanted to share a quick tip that I used while travelling to Canada and the US. I made a quick search and didn't find this \"hack\" here, although it's pretty simple and I guess a lot of people know it.Many rental companies allow or even force you to reserve your car instead of paying it in advance. While looking for rental cars in both Canada and the US, I found them pretty expensive. As I had nothing to lose, and I always use Revolut for travelling - which allows you to have multiple currency accounts - I tried changing the currency between CAD, USD, EUR...Surprisingly enough, and maybe because of these last years increase in the EUR -> CAD exchange rate, reserving the car in EUR was quite cheaper. So I just reserved the car in EUR, and during the rental they just exchanged the currency to CAD, saving more than 30 CAD per day compare to the direct reservation in CAD.I thought it would be the same in other cases, but in another rental we did, it happened the other way around. I could use CAD, USD, EUR, and many others. Most of them were similar, but in this case USD was substantially cheaper.In total, this saved us good money to spend on food and drinks. Hope this can be helpful to someone!",

Even its capital, Lima (8th largest city in the Americas), is mostly just used as a connecting hub by international tourists and is hardly ever brought up in travel-related discourseIndonesia is the 4th (?) largest country in the world in terms of population and a nation with thousands of islands but its only globally known place among travelers is Bali and maybe some of its surrounding islands that are used for day-trips from Bali.Some Central European countries are also mostly just known for its capitals like Prague with Czech Republic, Bratislava with Slovakia, and Budapest with Hungary.What other countries fall under this category based on discourse you've heard in your circles?",

Obviously, I like your coastline a lot, so that’s why I keep coming back all the way from America.However, my sentiment has changed this trip. I’ve realized that everything has gotten so overpriced for quite mid food with mid ingredients. The difference is especially stark because we were in Italy prior to this. You can’t get pasta for under 20 euros here, and the ones we got from highly rated places (though everything is 4.5+ stars here) were all mid. The here’s one place we saw who posted a menu from 9 months ago showing 12 euro risotto but now, it’s 20 euros. I travel quite a bit around the world and have never seen restaurants with this much dynamic pricing.I live in America, so this pricing isn’t anything excessive, but it did make me feel like we’re being taken too much advantage of. Venice, one of the most touristy cities in the world, has MUCH higher quality food for cheaper. Meanwhile, here you get unoriginal food that is low quality and overpriced. It’s like everything is designed for instagram tourists.Tourists have already noticed, and words will spread around. For a country where tourism makes up 20% of the GDP, you guys are playing with fire here by being excessively greedy.Also, sure, you can position yourself as a luxury destination, but the quality in restaurants and infrastructure doesn’t support that yet.",

Should I put it in my checked baggage or my carry-on? On one hand, I know that the people that will be handling my checked baggage are not that careful, and therefore it might get smashed, but on the other hand it could be considered a liquid due to the insides in TSA and get stopped.So, should I keep it in my carry-on or checked luggage?",

She has since graduated from uni and wants to go travelling, we both want to experience the world together.I’m feeling now after a year and a half of being home that going and spending so much money to need to come home and live with my parents after while all my mates are starting to buy property, get engaged etc would be an irresponsible decision. At the same time there’s still so much more travel I’d like to do before settling down.Bit of a ramble here but just looking to see if these doubts are normal for travel minded people.",

I’m working with a tight budget — €400 maximum combined for flights and accommodation.What Im looking for:Affordable, student-friendly destinationSafe for solo women travellersReliable public transport (no car needed)Pretty scenery and access to nature (even if just city parks/riverfronts)Rich history, culture and atmospheric streets (think cobbled lanes, cafés, old buildings)A lively nightlife scene (bars, live music)A romantic, movie-like feel — somewhere that’s photogenic and charming in winterI’ve recently visited Poland, Portugal and Spain, so I’d prefer new places. Open to capitals or smaller cities. Any recommendations for where to go, how many nights to aim for in January, and specific hostels/hotels or budget airlines to watch for would be amazing.

Check-In BaggageI’m considering buying theAirconic 2.0suitcase with dimensions:49 x 77 x 31 cm(L x H x W)The total linear dimensions add up to157 cmthis is purely from the website obtained dimension sum i didn't measure it in person, while Malaysian Airlines allows up to158 cmand a maximum weight of25 kg.Would this be a safe choice, or should I go for a slightly smaller suitcase just to avoid any issues at the airport?2. Carrying Minoxidil & Shampoo in Checked LuggageI’m currently undergoing a hair treatment and need to carry:12 bottles of Minoxidil spray [60 ml each bottle]2 hair oil [250ml each bottle]2 different sets of shampoo [around 90 ml each]Should I remove the original packaging and consolidate them in one bag to save space, or is it better to keep everything sealed in their original boxes when packing into checked luggage?3. Carry-On Bag ChoiceFor my carry-on, I’m leaning towards getting theAmerican Tourister \"Backpack Stuff\", instead of a traditional cabin trolley. Since I’ll be studying abroad, I figured a backpack would be more practical fordaily-use bag for classes or even short trips and trekking.Any suggestions would be helpful .Thanks in advance for your help!",

This girl asked if she could share the table because it was packed and we just started talking. what was supposed to be a quick chat turned into hours we ended up walking around the city late into the night, laughing about how neither of us had planned to even be there that day. We kept meeting up after that little things like grabbing street food, checking out parks, even just sitting by the lake. it felt so natural, like we’d known each other way longer than a few days. by the time i had to move on to the next part of my trip, we both knew it wasn’t just a random travel encounter. we kept in touch, and now she’s actually my girlfriend. Solo traveling gave me a lot of freedom and perspective, but i never expected it to also bring someone into my life like that. anyone else ever had a trip take a turn you completely didn’t see coming?",
