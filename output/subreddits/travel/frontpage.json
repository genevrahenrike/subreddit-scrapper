      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, just wanted to share a quick tip that I used while travelling to Canada and the US. I made a quick search and didn't find this \"hack\" here, although it's pretty simple and I guess a lot of people know it.Many rental companies allow or even force you to reserve your car instead of paying it in advance. While looking for rental cars in both Canada and the US, I found them pretty expensive. As I had nothing to lose, and I always use Revolut for travelling - which allows you to have multiple currency accounts - I tried changing the currency between CAD, USD, EUR...Surprisingly enough, and maybe because of these last years increase in the EUR -> CAD exchange rate, reserving the car in EUR was quite cheaper. So I just reserved the car in EUR, and during the rental they just exchanged the currency to CAD, saving more than 30 CAD per day compare to the direct reservation in CAD.I thought it would be the same in other cases, but in another rental we did, it happened the other way around. I could use CAD, USD, EUR, and many others. Most of them were similar, but in this case USD was substantially cheaper.In total, this saved us good money to spend on food and drinks. Hope this can be helpful to someone!",

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/europcar-no-its-europscam-v0-ouhcn4go48nf1.png It's been a long time, and I gave them every opportunity to resolve the issue peacefully. They didn’t. So now, I want to let everyone know about Europcar, possibly the most fraudulent car rental service out there. Literally scammers. On March 24, 2025, I traveled to Portugal with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. At the airport, I rented a Mitsubishi Eclipse from Europcar. I picked it up with a full tank, drove it around Portugal, and refueled it before returning it on March 26. Europcar staff accepted the car and provided a statement of return, clearly showing both the pick-up and return fuel levels as 8/8: Statement of Return — signed by Europcar employee and delivered to my email at the moment I returned the vehicle. I also received a finalized invoice with all charges, including $0 for fuel, as I returned it full, exactly as I received it: Finalized invoice, showing that vehicle is returned and I owe them nothing. It looked like solid proof to me. At least, that’s what I thought before leaving the parking lot and heading to the check-in counter at the airport. A MONTH LATER, Europcar issued another invoice, charging me for “missing” fuel and a refueling service (see scan). Weirdly, it also had different license plate number stated in it (covered for privacy purposes). They sent it by regular mail: \"Missing\" fuel invoice I immediately contacted their support, questioning the charge and sending proof of return, including the final invoice and statement of return. Their response? They claimed, “The statement of return is issued automatically at the end of each rental. However, it was later verified that the vehicle had only 4/8 fuel at return, per the attached document. The fuel charge was correct”: https://preview.redd.it/europcar-no-its-europscam-v0-csfpaosc58nf1.png Would you like to see the document they attached? It’s a random, unverifiable piece of paper, handwritten with an unreadable date and missing the required customer signature: https://preview.redd.it/europcar-no-its-europscam-v0-u7ang50f58nf1.png No idea when it was written, who wrote it, nor why I should trust their word a month later. Of course, I replied that this was nonsense. The statement of return is meant to document all details of the vehicle’s condition, leaving no room for further claims. I even waited for the statement to arrive to my inbox before leaving the parking garage: https://preview.redd.it/europcar-no-its-europscam-v0-bv1ym6qh58nf1.png Their response? They didn’t care. They said, “If you have proof of refueling, such as a receipt, we’d be happy to review it,” completely ignoring that I’d already sent a refueling receipt signed by their own employee: https://preview.redd.it/europcar-no-its-europscam-v0-ce5oct7j58nf1.png Europcar refused to provide evidence of the alleged missing fuel or explain why they issued an invoice a month later. As a frequent traveler who always rents cars, I ensure vehicles are refueled before return and keep records of the statement of return. Yet, Europcar thinks they can scam customers with fictitious charges. Whether it’s their employees stealing fuel or just gross incompetence, their refusal to resolve this shows they can’t be trusted. Avoid them unless you’re okay with paying random, unjustified fees. Thank you for attending my brief TED Talk about untrustworthy car rental services. Your likes, reposts, comments and shares are kindly appreciated. Avoid Europcar at all costs. There are plenty of other options.",

Even its capital, Lima (8th largest city in the Americas), is mostly just used as a connecting hub by international tourists and is hardly ever brought up in travel-related discourseIndonesia is the 4th (?) largest country in the world in terms of population and a nation with thousands of islands but its only globally known place among travelers is Bali and maybe some of its surrounding islands that are used for day-trips from Bali.Some Central European countries are also mostly just known for its capitals like Prague with Czech Republic, Bratislava with Slovakia, and Budapest with Hungary.What other countries fall under this category based on discourse you've heard in your circles?",

Obviously, I like your coastline a lot, so that’s why I keep coming back all the way from America.However, my sentiment has changed this trip. I’ve realized that everything has gotten so overpriced for quite mid food with mid ingredients. The difference is especially stark because we were in Italy prior to this. You can’t get pasta for under 20 euros here, and the ones we got from highly rated places (though everything is 4.5+ stars here) were all mid. The here’s one place we saw who posted a menu from 9 months ago showing 12 euro risotto but now, it’s 20 euros. I travel quite a bit around the world and have never seen restaurants with this much dynamic pricing.I live in America, so this pricing isn’t anything excessive, but it did make me feel like we’re being taken too much advantage of. Venice, one of the most touristy cities in the world, has MUCH higher quality food for cheaper. Meanwhile, here you get unoriginal food that is low quality and overpriced. It’s like everything is designed for instagram tourists.Tourists have already noticed, and words will spread around. For a country where tourism makes up 20% of the GDP, you guys are playing with fire here by being excessively greedy.Also, sure, you can position yourself as a luxury destination, but the quality in restaurants and infrastructure doesn’t support that yet.",

This girl asked if she could share the table because it was packed and we just started talking. what was supposed to be a quick chat turned into hours we ended up walking around the city late into the night, laughing about how neither of us had planned to even be there that day. We kept meeting up after that little things like grabbing street food, checking out parks, even just sitting by the lake. it felt so natural, like we’d known each other way longer than a few days. by the time i had to move on to the next part of my trip, we both knew it wasn’t just a random travel encounter. we kept in touch, and now she’s actually my girlfriend. Solo traveling gave me a lot of freedom and perspective, but i never expected it to also bring someone into my life like that. anyone else ever had a trip take a turn you completely didn’t see coming?",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone — I’m an 18-year-old student from Ireland planning a little January 2026 getaway before semester 2 starts. I might go alone or with a friend (still undecided). I’m working with a tight budget — €400 maximum combined for flights and accommodation.What Im looking for:Affordable, student-friendly destinationSafe for solo women travellersReliable public transport (no car needed)Pretty scenery and access to nature (even if just city parks/riverfronts)Rich history, culture and atmospheric streets (think cobbled lanes, cafés, old buildings)A lively nightlife scene (bars, live music)A romantic, movie-like feel — somewhere that’s photogenic and charming in winterI’ve recently visited Poland, Portugal and Spain, so I’d prefer new places. Open to capitals or smaller cities. Any recommendations for where to go, how many nights to aim for in January, and specific hostels/hotels or budget airlines to watch for would be amazing. Thank you!",

Places to see and places to avoid? Is it safe for two women traveling alone? Of course, we’re aware that it’s better not to walk around holding hands, but we’re experienced travelers and know when it’s best to be cautious.Thanks to anyone who replies!",

Arrived in Çeşme last night.This morning I'm looking at my spouse's bites and noticed that the bites are in a line on their arm, mine are in a cluster on my leg.We did interact with some of the strays so I was hoping these were flea bites, but I flicked a yellow piece of shmutz off our bedsheets this morning. I thought it was a spouse-booger until I read that bed bug carcasses are yellow too.So what do I do? I guess I still need to confirm that these are bed bugs, and then proceed from there?
