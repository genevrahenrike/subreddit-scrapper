Last year, there were fewer trucks but still seemed to be variety. But this weekend, when I went for Saturday lunchtime, not only were there no acts going on, the limited family activities were all closed, and there were few trucks and fewer options. Burgers, poutine, tacos, grilled cheese. The takoyaki place was new and interesting, but also...tacos. I think I counted ten food vendors, including the soft serve truck. Ads on the radio claim thirty. Ads on the radio claim all day family fun. But up til 2pm Saturday there was nothing going on at the limited games. Did you go? How was it? Did I just miss the good times? I admit that's possible going Saturday lunch time and being disappointed enough to skip Sunday. But there's only a dozen trucks. Options seemed limited.",

They haven’t had much luck finding someone to help train the dog, so any recommendations would be appreciated. Needs to be someone who can do the training in-person. Thanks!",

Some cars were left plugged in for over 24 hours, (mostly Teslas) basically treating the chargers like personal parking spots. Now it’s switched to paid charging, and surprise surprise the stations are almost always empty. I get why they had to start charging, but it’s a shame that a few people ruined a good thing for everyone. It was a nice perk, but as per usual people ruin it.",

When I went to N1 in Ottawa, we would warm up for about 10 minutes and the rest of the hour is technique. However, I've yet to see anything here about Lions Cage.",

      "content_preview": "Brampton had the second-highest eviction filing rate in the GTA during the pandemic, with about 7.5 per cent of renter households facing a filing in 2020 and 2021, according to a recently released report. Only Oshawa recorded a higher rate, according to the research led by University of Toronto Mississauga PhD candidate Sean Grisdale. In Toronto, Grisdale’s study found that tenants in majority-Black neighbourhoods were far more likely to face eviction filings from corporate landlords. In Peel region, local tenant advocates say they see similar disproportionate impacts on racialized renters. In Brampton, a city with the largest Black and South Asian populations in Peel, the eviction rate raises pressing questions about the racial disparity and how the growing role of corporate landlords, known as financialized landlords, is shaping the risk these tenants face.

(11:03 pm - still in hallway - no check in) Edit edit: forgot to add that they discharged me, and then a very friendly volunteer asked me if i needed help getting to my car to get home Edit #3: I was unconscious I didn’t call 911 stop PM’ing pls. (Plus thanks to the person who did because I was inside an authorized restricted entrance area) please investigate this hospital ——————— New Update Aug 19: i (OP) ( obviously ) cannot drive so i take uber daily - sometime three times a day consistently for over almost 8 years. today my uber driver and i were talking and the topic of civic came up. this is his story: i took my 18 month old to ER where they told me she has heart problems so they need to monitor her - they did not monitor her properly and she needed to be immediately transferred to sick kids - she passed on the way in the ambulance because civic did not monitor her properly. i spoke to a lawyer who said to get the autopsy report - i have been waiting 2 months and emailed, contacted to get an update they keep saying they don’t have one. when i went in person to get an update the autopsy guy told me her heart failed and if i had an issue I should just sue him. they killed my daughter - they killed her. we were at my destination as he was mid conversation - once parked he continued telling me the remainder of the story and then proceeded to show me photos of his daughter. i was beyond heartbroken and it took a lot for me to not cry and overwhelm him further. rest in peace baby alina 🩵",
