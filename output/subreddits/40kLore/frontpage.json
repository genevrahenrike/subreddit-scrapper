      "content_preview": "From my understanding the Death Watch started as a kind of Navy SEALS \"best of the best\" elite force and it was seen as a great honor to serve, but everything I've read about black shields and the DW itself describe a place of absolute penance. I remember hearing life expectancy of a DW Marine is extremely low which is why it's seen as penance (among other practices) but I'm confused if it was always intended to be that? The idea of an honorable duity/promotion being turned into a kind of punishment definitely fits in 40k I guess I'm just wondering if there was a key moment it flipped?",

In Godblight: Emperor to Mortarion: \"\"You could still be saved... but you must return to the master you have chosen for now.\"\" Emperor to Lorgar: “Lorgar could be forgiven, but not now.” In Fury of Magnus: Emperor to Magnus: “You can come back to me, but your legion cannot. I will build you a new legion... warriors the likes of which the galaxy has never seen.” Magnus asks: “You will give me a new legion?” And the Emperor replies: “I would. And they would be the pride of the new Imperium.” (Although this is contested to be one of magnus' shards perspectives and not the real story) In The Board is Set: Emperor to Malcador: “no primarch is beyond redemption and that death is just another state of existence.” All the lore we have regarding Chaos seems to confirm that it is not possible to come back from Chaos, yet we do keep seeing slivers of hope in small excerpts that it may be possible. Do you think it would ever happen, is it foreshadowing or just small glimmers of hope in a hopeless grimdark world?",

      "content_preview": "Jokaero, for those who don’t know, are lovable orangutan-esque Xenos who were created/uplifted by the Old Ones to have an innate technological genius, and the ability to craft all manner of exotic equipment and weaponry such as digital weapons (digi-weapons - powerful miniaturised weapons which can be worn on fingers as rings, hence the name), personal forcefields, and their own private pocket realities. They can sometimes be found pressed into service by Inquisitors. One of the Warhammer Adventures books for children, Attack of the Necron , features the Jokaero Flegan-Pala, given the nickname, much to his annoyance, Fleapit. It actually even gives us an extended section from his point of view, and thus constitutes one of the most in-depth looks at Jokaero we have available. The book showcases all of the usual Jokaero abilities as regards mastery of technological invention, it name drops digi-weapons, and we get this interesting passage showcasing Flegan-Pala’s thoughts on having escaped his enslavement by a human: Of course, for that they’d need supplies. Like all of his race, Flegan-Pala could create the most sophisticated machines from the most basic parts. That’s what made him such a valuable slave. He scratched at the restraining implant that had been fitted around his neck. It was the only device he couldn’t tamper with, not unless he wanted a thousand volts surging through his nervous system. Still, his master was now half a galaxy away. There was no way he could activate the implant from that distance, thank the Old Ones . Flegan-Pala was safe here, whatever the conditions. Scott, Attack of the Necron (2019), p. 82. While not directly stating that Flegan-Pala believes/knows the Jokaero were made by the Old Ones, it’s obviously a riff on “thank god” – and so implies as much. This is interesting, as it harks back to link between the Jokaero and the Old Slann (who at the time filled the place in the lore later transferred to the Old Ones as the ancient highly-advanced precursor race, with the relationship between the Old Ones and the Slann now being complicated) which featured in the original 1 st ed. 40k rulebook: Of all the races in the galaxy the Slann claim to be, and may actually be, the oldest. The days of their bright empire are waning, but still they remain amongst the most enigmatic creatures of known space. The Slann evolved, matured and spread throughout the galaxy many hundreds of thousands of years ago. During the heyday of their empire they discovered and nurtured many primitive creatures, encouraging the evolutionary process on countless worlds, eradicating or moving dangerous species, and seeding many planets with promising stock. For millennia they experimented and played with the galaxy, possibly creating many of the races of modern times in the process. … The Jokaero are a fascinating race. For one thing, no outsider has ever decided whether they are intelligent. They are certainly capable of tremendous feats of engineering, construction and problem-solving, yet they have no language, culture or motivation higher than survival. Their physical appearance is of a heavy, orange-furred ape, similar to the orang-utang which roamed ancient Earth. This may or may not be coincidence, for it is an established fact that the Slann created and modified many races at the dawn of time, and appear to have visited the Earth on numerous occasions. The most amazing thing about the Jokaero is their technical brilliance - they appear to have an innate, genetically structured understanding of technology. Given sufficient pieces of battered machinery, a group of Jokaero can make almost anything, from a spaceship to a las-cannon. Their comprehension of astro-physics is baffling, they seem able to tap power-currents which flow imperceptibly through the galaxy. Their understanding of such matters goes far beyond that of even the most advanced of other known races, with the possible exception of the Great Mages of the Slann. Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader (1987), pp. 194, 196. It was also clearly established right from the start that it is the Jokaero who produce digi-weapons. The Jokaero have continued to be listed as one of the species created/uplifted by the Old Ones in lore down the decades. Much more recently, we got this account of Trazyn perusing his War in Heaven gallery within his collection, where the Jokaero were referred to as “maintenance-slaves”: Lights eternally burned in the War in Heaven gallery. … He kept focus, forcing himself not to look at the rows of plinths that surrounded him in a double line like a phaeron’s honour guard. They were enemies. Here, an aeldari stood mid-leap, the tip of her wraithbone dance slipper barely kissing the black display base. Next, a hulking krork, mountainous shoulders bunched and slick with battle-sweat. A Khaineite warrior in green armour, crouched low, legs wide, weaving his chainsword forward and up as if hooking it under a lychguard’s shield. A jokaero maintenance-slave . And across from them, blank dummies wearing the resplendent armour of the ancient necrontyr. A reminder of a time when they needed armour, before their bodies were living metal. The old times, sixty-five million years gone. The Flesh Times. Their long shadows met in the centre, mingling as if they still battled. Trazyn remembered the war. As chief archaeovist, he had attended every clash that logistics allowed. Recording impressions, taking samples. Attending the embalming of each great phaeron that fell to the Old Ones and their twisted creations . Rath, The Infinite and the Divine (2020), p. 34. So, again, firmly establishing their link to the Old Ones. Though as to whether they were “slaves”, at least in the sense we would understand that term: who knows? We don’t have enough information to say. This could be an accurate statement, or it could say more about how Trazyn perceived the Necronty’s ancient adversaries, the Old Ones. Or it could reflect a Necron mindset, where all life is understood via notions of strict hierarchy, and control and servitude. In the Horus Heresy series, meanwhile, the Cabal also showcase the Jokaero/Old Ones link, though in a very implicit manner. I have previously discussed the possible links between the Cabal and the Old Ones, and the evidence pointing to one of the Cabal, Gahet, being a Slann, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1lrhf05/the_old_ones_and_the_cabal_and_a_cabal_of_old/ Of interest here is an item worn and used an agent of the Cabal, John Grammaticus: Grammaticus had never heard an Astartes cry in pain before. He decided he never wanted to hear the sound again. He pushed Shere aside against the moving wall of lizards and adjusted his ring. It was an Old Kind digital weapon, a gift from Gahet. He triggered it. An incandescent blue beam lanced out from it and exploded the crocodilian’s braincase in a wet blast of meat, bone and tissue. Abnett, Legion (2008), pp. 100-01. So, we have what is seemingly a Slann and/or an Old One gifting their agent a digi-weapon, which plays on the old Slann/Jokaero link. We were also told this about a Jokaero space vessel, the ‘Sawbone Station’, which turned up at the mysterious Blackstone Fortress which serves as the setting for the eponymous game: Many data-traders aboard the Precipice have noted the apparent similarities between the vessel and the structure of the Blackstone Fortress itself , leading some to speculate that the two must have a shared origin. Blackstone Fortress: No Respite (2020). The Jokaero were also some of the very first to arrive at the Precipice Station, near the Blackstone Fortress ( White Dwarf 452 (2020), p. 126). Given that a major theory as to the origin of the Blackstone Fortresses is that they are Old Ones technology (though how this all fits together with the Eldar god Vaul also being given credit is intentionally ambiguous), this perhaps serve as another subtle Jokaero-Old Ones link. Moreover, Jokaero vessels are also said in the old and newer lore to rely on “galactic power currents” to move, which seems very Old Ones-style given their big focus on things like ley lines and cosmic patterns (which deserves a post of its own). The Sawbone Station is also noted to “extend into multiple non-Euclidean dimensions”, which reminds me of the way the temple-ships (literally spaceships which serve as temples) of the Seraphon in AoS also defy the normal rules of Euclidean geometry with their internal architecture. These temple-ships being themselves relics of the Old Ones. Now, what’s also interesting is that the Jokaero aren’t the only race created/uplifted by the Old Ones to remember and venerate them. The Eldar are aware that the Old Ones uplifted them, but only via what are almost certainly highly metaphorical myths. But there is also the Hrud: Hrud religion is a peculiar subject. Where other races invariably regard their deities with a subconscious distance, the clarity of Hrud mass-memory makes it likely that their legends are - if not real - then at least based upon real events. They have it that at the dawn of time their race was created by a pantheon of benevolent gods ( the Slah-haii, or 'most ancient' ), who intended them to bask in the sun and be fruitful. Al this changed when deities entered a ruinous war with the Yaam-khoh ('mirror devils'), and were variously slain, crippled or forced to flee. According to the Hrud, only one of their Gods remained: Qah - 'he who lingers'. This solitary godhead, recognizing the danger his beloved children were in changed the Hrud into the nocturnal scavengers we know today. Curiously, around 500,000 years ago, Qah disappeared: informing the Hrud that he had great work to attend, and that they would be reunited at the time of Raheed-skoh: when the tribes come together for the last battle against the Yaam-kheh. Xenology (2006), p. 80. The Slah-haii obviously sounding similar to Slann, while “most ancient” evokes the Old Ones. It’s unclear whether knowledge of the Old Ones is common among Jokaero, or just how detailed such knowledge might be. Perhaps the phrase uttered by Flegan-Pala is just a vestigial cultural artefact, a blessing which continues to be repeated but which holds little deeper meaning for Jokaero. Or perhaps it speaks to some form of continued loyalty or worship for their ancient creators. It’s impossible to tell, but it is interesting that at least one Jokaero uses such a phrase long, long after the Old Ones are seemingly gone. It is, I think, a nice little detail – and it is yet another interesting reflection of the way ideas and concepts in 40k lore can be very enduring, even if the details evolve and change. You can see games developers and authors looking back at older lore for inspiration, and having fun playing around with it, developing or adapting it, and sprinkling in little details. And Attack of the Necron , despite being aimed at kids, is well worth a quick read, especially if you want some Jokaero goodness. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this latest ramble through the history of some of the more obscure elements of 40k lore.",

      "content_preview": "Erasmus Crowl is Ordo Hereticus Lord Inquisitor operating on Terra. One day he receives a call. I returned to Courvain to find a message from an old friend waiting for me. His name was Henrich Tlag, and when I first met him he was a battleship commander in the Imperial Navy. His was a significant and powerful rank, one that at its height saw him command many tens of thousands of souls. But he gave it all up, and that was wise. He left the service with that rarest of things, an honourable discharge, and travelled to Port Luna in a private capacity.  He took advantage of old contacts, cashed in significant sums of coin obtained by means left largely unexplained, and began his new life in the mundane but lucrative world of hull brokerage. I lost touch with him after that. 'Tlag?' I asked Aneela, my personal coadjutant. 'Henrich Tlag?' 'I activated a five link to your inner rooms,' she said. 'He's been waiting several hours.' I poured myself a glass, removed my armour, donned fresh robes, and settled to receive the communication. 'Tlag,' I said, smiling. 'Erasmus,' he said. Few people call me by my given name. It felt strange, then - not impertinent, just strange. 'A long time,' I said. He didn't linger on pleasantries. 'I'm worried,' he said. His expression was like those waiting for me in my cells - eyes darting, hands twitching. He was sweating. 'Can you get to Luna?' 'Not easily,' I said. 'What is it?' 'It's... brutal. I mean, it's always been, between us, the guilds. But it's getting out of hand. I've had staff killed, ships burned. They want my operation. They've got their people insinuated into the judges, so no help from them. I think I know who's doing it, but there's no proof, and this really isn't my thing. Contracts, deals, I can handle. But this is your work.' He smiled, a nervous gesture that didn't last long. 'Could I get you up here, just for a day?' 'Do you suspect heresy?' I asked. He couldn't lie to me. Very few people can. 'Not that,' he said. 'Corruption, though.' 'In the dockyards of Luna,' I said. 'I find that hard to imagine.' He began to see what he was asking then, and I thought I detected embarrassment amid his evident fear. 'I haven't slept much,' he said. 'It's like a war, and I thought I'd fought the last of those. I'm getting jumpy.' 'I can see that,' I said. 'If things change, will you consider it?' I rolled the goblet around in my hand. 'It's good to hear from you,' I said. 'Maybe soon? I have much to keep me here - you understand that.' He nodded, weakly. He did. I might have felt a twinge of remorse, watching his features fall, but also some irritation. The request demeaned us both, and a less forgiving member of my order would not have tolerated it. 'Remain in touch,' I said, before closing the link. (This conversation keeps nagging Crowl, so eventually he looks into this. After failing to reach Trag through the link, he decides to pay him a visit in person) 'My lord,' he said, his face pale. 'Thank the Throne you came. I do not take this lightly. It is His will that you are here.' 'You do not look well, Henrich,' I said. 'No time,' he said, looking back and forth. 'This way, this way. This is why you had to come.' We passed inside the carcass of the great ship, watched over by teams of armed guards, some human-normal, some barely more than gunservitors. It was due to remain in port for a year or more, he explained, and teams of maintenance drones and tech-priests had been scheduled to move in to begin the long process of stripping-down, tearing-out and building-back. 'Had been?' I asked. 'Yes,' Tlag said, unhappily. We reached a heavy bulkhead. On the far side was a vacuum door, oxidised and scratched. A single porthole of armour-glass punctured its smooth outward curve. It was closed, and guarded by two attendants with autoguns held openly. They regarded me with as much nervousness as their master. 'I did nothing, once it was found,' Tlag said. 'I can't do anything else now, of course. You'll see.' He moved towards the door, punched in a keycode and pressed his thumb against a blood-cycler. We entered, the guards remained outside. Aside from the two of us, though, only one soul inhabited the chamber now, but he was far from needing its services. His body had been hacked apart, his limbs splayed wide across a blood-dark floor. Marks of cultish origin had been daubed in dried blood across the chambers inner walls, though I did not recognise the precise sigils. 'When did you find this?' I asked. 'Two nights back. But he could have been here for days. The ship's been cordoned.' 'Who is he?' 'This is Jodka,' Tlag said. 'Nefam Jodka.' I knew the name from my researches. Three major cartels controlled the void-traffic in this sector of the Port - the Herial Vo Combine owned by Ariete Nuim, the General Transit and Conveyance Corporation of Nefam Jodka, and the Frateris Lupax brotherhood of Tlag himself. If Tlag was correct then one of the three most powerful figures in this network of mercantile realms lay dead, moreover within one of his rival's own ships. 'Tlag...' I began. 'I did not do it,' he stammered, pacing back and forth. 'You must believe me. You know me, Crowl. You know I have my weaknesses. I do have them, surely, but not this. This was the problem.' He came to squat beside me, almost pulling at my armoured sleeve in his agitation. 'You know I had had threats. You know members of my brotherhood had been killed. Of course I suspected Jodka's people, but I never had proof. I had taken precautions, I had called you, I had called others, but I did not resort to this.' 'You found him, just like this?' I asked. Tlag nodded. 'The door was sealed,' he said. 'You understand? Totally sealed. It could withstand a bolter volley, that casing, and it's not been touched.' 'Who had the access code?' 'Me.' Tlag smiled ruefully. 'I keep the codes. No one else. I had to be careful.' 'I'll look into it,' I said, trying not to adopt the tone I used with ordinary suspects, and possibly failing. 'You won't leave Luna, I'm sure.' He shook his head. (After some investigation and visiting Ariete Nuim, the head of the third cartel, Crowl pieces this puzzle together and returns to Tlag) 'Did you discover anything, lord?' he asked, virtually wringing his hands. 'Nuim, your rival,' I said. 'She has a teleport homer. It was in separated companion pieces, but it looked operative to me. That solves the problem of your vacuum door.' Tlag's eyes widened. He thought on that for a moment, remaining on his feet before the fire. 'Would that be possible?' 'Eminently, for someone skilled enough. There would be risks, of course, but she struck me as a woman who knows when to take them, and when not to.' Tlag frowned. 'Then she could have taken Jodka inside, killed him, and escaped again without damaging the unit.' 'That's right,' I said. 'But may I ask you a question, Henrich?' 'A question?' Tlag asked. 'Of course.' 'When did you stop calling me by my given name?' I leant back. The upholstery coped with the weight of my armour well. Truly, this was a remarkable chair. 'Did I?' Tlag looked confused. I shot him a dry smile. 'You've been Nuim's guest before, I'm sure. You'll have seen it - she didn't keep it secret. Perhaps that put the idea into your head.' 'I don't know what you mean.' 'Yes, you do.' I moved my gauntlet slightly, ensuring I had ready access to my laspistol. 'Nuim didn't kill Jodka. Trust me, I can detect dissemblance in most people, and there was none in her. I doubt she even knew he was dead. And that is not surprising, of course, because, as you and I both know, he isn't.' Tlag maintained the pretence for just a moment longer. He didn't have much choice, I suppose, but to cling to the slim chance that I might be wrong. 'The small things,' I said, untroubled by that possibility. 'The details. You used my title rather than my name. Those implausible cult markings. Come now, that's my vocation .' Even then, he didn't crack. That was welcome - it gave me a chance to expostulate a little more. Emperor forgive me, I indulge the sin of pride too often, but it is good, from time to time, to set the cards on the table. 'The attempt to cast Nuim as the architect was artfully done,' I said, 'but allowing her to speak was dangerous. She told me of Jodka's fondness for rejuve alterations. That settled it. You didn't sweat, even in the hold of that ship. You're not really ill, are you? You're covered in synthskin. Oh, don't look so horrified - it's not your face to use, Nefam.' Finally, the feigned ignorance fell away. The man grinned, and it was unpleasant to see my old friend's features distort around another man's expression. 'Fair enough,' Nefam Jodka said, reaching for his own weapon. 'It was a decent attempt.' 'When did you kill him?' I asked. I had spoken to the real Tlag from Terra, so knew that the corpse in the vacuum chamber could not have been more than a few days old. Jodka must have killed him as part of the feud that Tlag had feared was escalating, picked up my subsequent unanswered messages to him, realised I would come to Luna to investigate his disappearance, then devised this ruse to hide the crime. He had done well, to organise such a deception in such a short period of time. Then again, these people had almost infinite resources. 'It hardly matters,' Jodka said, drawing a slender laspistol and pointing at my forehead. 'You should never have left Terra, inquisitor.' 'Would you have been Henrich Tlag forever, then?' I was genuinely curious. 'Or just for long enough to see me off?' 'You'll never know,' he said, and fired. I should be clear, here. It is quite impossible to move fast enough to evade a lasbolt aimed at that range. The time taken to send a mental command to one's muscles is comparable to the time taken for the loosed stream of energy to strike home. Even an Angel of Death would have struggled to react in time, and I did not possess anything like the reactions of those holy warriors. So it is fortunate that Revus was a good shot. The room's crystalflex blew a fraction before Jodka was able to squeeze the trigger home, throwing scattered shards across the chamber floor. My captain, being ordo-trained, chose his moment perfectly, and never missed. His volley punched into Jodka's flabby, over-enhanced body, hurling him to the parquet and sending his weapon spinning out of reach. I got up from that truly exceptional chair and pulled my own laspistol from its holster. All the while Revus hung somewhat comically on a length of wire on the far side of the broken crystalflex, making ready to pull himself through the hole he had just created. Jodka was gurgling blood, trying to claw himself away from the both of us. 'She was right, your rival,' I said, standing over the wounded Jodka. 'These are petty wars.' I pressed the trigger on my laspistol. Nothing happened. A faint snap from the power pack made the thing jump in my grip, and a curl of smoke escaped through the upper casing. Revus, now fully inside, snorted a laugh. I looked down at the damned thing. It had never actually failed me before, not in twenty years of use, and yet I had never loved it. That had always been an omission. I had been waiting for the right counterpart for too long. 'That rather spoiled the moment,' I said to Revus. Then I put the weapon aside, flexed my gauntlets, and reached down to finish the job. One of my favourite examples of how business rivalries in the Imperium may turn into violence and why offing an inquisitor may be a bit harder than some people may think.",

In “The Great Work” Cawl has a vision of a memory from the mind he had assimilated and has a conversation with the Emperor. What’s remarkable is that the Emperor addresses him as Cawl, not the actual person he was talking to. The important thing is the Emperor tells Cawl that he will do something and think he has betrayed the Emperor but the Emperor assures him it as part of the plan. From what I understand, the Mechanicus seems to label Cawl as a boarder line Heretic as it is already. The only reason he hasn’t been executed is because of his knowledge and station, if I understand the dynamic correctly. So if he is already such a controversial person, has this betrayal already occurred? Was it his Primaris project that was the betrayal? Or is Cawl going to damage the Golden Throne while trying to fix it. I know the lore states that the Throne is about a century away from total failure so I personally think Cawl will eventually accidentally destroy it while trying to fix it. I haven’t found much more information on what exactly the betrayal could be or if it had already occurred. If you know of another source talking about this and giving more details please inform me. Cawl seems to be devout believer so I doubt the betrayal would be very direct and deliberate. Which is why I think it will be a case of “road to hell paved with good intentions” type of thing. Any further information is welcomed. Thank you all. You guys rock.",

      "content_preview": "Context: Torrin Vey is a Codicier for the Exorcists, a Successor Chapter of the Imperial Fists. During a mission to hunt down an escaped daemonhost possessing the body of a failed Aspirant on the world Fidem IV, he and the Reivers attached to him came across a group of heretics in a dugout, guarding the entrance where a squad of Word Bearers (who is hunting the same daemonhost) last used it. Vey chose to take the lead and effortlessly slaughtered the heretics. One of the heretic, knowing he can't stop the rampaging Librarian, accidentally primed a frag grenade, which detonated right in Vey's face, with unsurprising results. Vey chose to advance with the Reivers, Kerubim out and ignited with his psychic potency. He had been forced to throw the net of his consciousness wide in his questing efforts, and it had left him feeling drained and cold, but it had achieved the desired result. He had found a clutch of heretic infantry guarding the entrance to a dugout nearby. Their organised presence, when all else around them had been thrown into disarray by the Exorcists’ assault, had immediately struck him as strange. Once he had pinpointed them, it hadn’t taken long for him to work out why. They had received direct orders from their masters not long before. A squad-strength force of Word Bearers had entered the dugout they were now protecting, and hadn’t re-emerged. Vey had been unable to use them to see what lay within, but there was only one reasonable explanation. It was an entrance to Fidem’s underworld. ‘I will take the lead,’ he told Belloch, moving along the trench-line. The Reiver nodded, letting Vey take point without complaint. He suspected there were few others to whom he would have surrendered the role so unquestioningly. The trench bent away to the left. It had once been part of the Sacred Ways, just like the lines protecting the north of Pilgrim Town, but since the Archenemy had claimed Deliverance, they had set about despoiling the sanctity of the old battlefield. The small shrines that had been built by pilgrims into the sides of the trenches had been smashed and defiled, daubed with Dark Tongue script, the eight-pointed star and what Vey recognised as crude attempts at copying the burning book and daemonic visage that was the ancient heraldry of the Word Bearers. It was impossible not to see the similarity between the dark Neverborn icon and the horned skull of the Calva Daemoniorum emblazoned on Vey’s pauldron and those of his brothers. The Librarian let his mind quest ahead, finding the presence of the knot of heretics. He passed a pillbox, disembowelled corpses surrounding it, recognising the handiwork of Belloch or his Reiver brethren. It demarcated the edge of the rightmost extent of the Hexbreakers’ assault. Beyond it, the enemy still held sway. Vey sent a ‘permission to engage’ tag request to Eitan, adhering to the Hexbreakers’ hierarchy. The request blinked green, confirmed. Vey swept around the bend in the trench, Kerubim blazing in his gloved gauntlet. The heretic herdsmen were better warriors than most of their flock kindred, or perhaps they had felt Vey’s presence in their minds, had sensed the growing warp chill of the psyker’s ominous approach. Either way, they were ready. Crimson las-bolts whipped and cracked at him down the trench’s length. He let them earth against his armour or burn black marks into the protective multiweave of his camo cape. Now was no time for the subtlety he usually preferred – his mind was tired from his recent psychic efforts, and direct methods of destruction were more suited to this. Sometimes, the hammer was a surer tool than the scalpel. Vey charged the length of the trench, covering the ground with terrifying rapidity. The cultists’ discipline collapsed in the face of his assault, and all of them were scrabbling for fresh powercells, their lasguns drained, as Vey struck the first. There wasn’t room in the trench to swing Kerubim properly, so the Librarian thrust instead. The long, psi-reactive blade punched straight through the sternum and spine of one heretic and skewered the one immediately behind. Vey sliced upwards, carving the sword through the collarbones of both heretics in an arc of blood and leaving them cleaved open. He barrelled over them, checking the urge to bellow a war cry, refusing to let himself become caught up in the death he was dealing. He backhanded the next cultist against the trench wall, shattering his skull and snapping his neck, then lunged at a fourth. The angle was less than ideal, and Vey was only able to pierce his side rather than disembowel him. A surge of psychic energy, channelled through the weapon, ensured the blow was no less fatal. Using the brief connection, Vey’s mind pulverised the heretic’s, crushing it like an avalanche. The psychic assault was so sudden and violent that part of the cultist’s head caved in. Two more left. One had managed to reload, but couldn’t get a shot away before Vey drove in, leading with Kerubim’s crossguard. The heavy skull pommel of the weapon struck the heretic’s face like a sledgehammer, driving the ridge of her nose bone up into her brain and dropping her instantly. The last one had palmed a frag grenade. The pin and lever were out. The heretic’s eyes were wide, going from the explosive in his hand to Vey, almost as though he had primed it without really meaning to. Vey came to an abrupt stop in front of him. ‘That will not be sufficient, I’m afraid,’ he told the wretch, doing nothing but raising a gauntlet before his face. The grenade went off, battering Vey’s armour but failing to penetrate it. He lowered his hand, pausing to knock a shard of metal from the back of his glove and shake the heretic’s blood off it. He felt a presence behind him and turned to find Belloch and his death-faced kindred stalking down the trench, stepping with the instinctive, light movements of predators over and around the bodies he had left in his wake. ‘You should have been a Reiver, Brother-Librarian,’ Belloch rasped. ‘Too much knife-work,’ Vey said offhandedly. ‘Sin Slayer and your brethren have that in sufficiency.’",

But can they do what this quartet of poor musicians can? See how the zitherist sets the tempo, how the others follow. A song no one has heard before, an act of pure creation, yet one that still speaks of what this place once was. Music that invokes the cool island breezes that caressed these shores in centuries past, when the seas were higher, music that contains memory. Can your blessed algorithmchants do that?’ ‘No,’ Orikan admitted. ‘They merely reshape the fabric of space-time, transmute matter, and bring objects through the dimensional skin of the universe. Algorithm-chants are useful, that’s why those that know the arcane utterances are part of a select immortal order, while these short-lived insects play for coins thrown by gawping travellers, unvalued even by their own kind.’ Just posting this because while I found the Crypteks cool it was difficult to imagine how exactly their powers work. If they have no psychic abilities/sorcery, how did they translate their insane reality-breaking abilities into practice. This seems to be the answer, initiating algorithmic sequences based on mathematical concepts human brains can't comprehend. It sort of reminds me of Enuncia in that anyone can theoretically do it psyker or not, though in this case the sequences seem to be closely guarded.",

By this point the tyrant likely knows who is behind citys current calamities and after two attemps on his life, first by friendly kabal turning against him, then on return trip being ambushed by squadron of fighters, Yllithian returns to Fortress spire of White flame defeated and plans in ruins. That is, until he has important realization Yllithian permitted himself a small, triumphant smile as his barque slid into a docking port low down on the flank of the fortress along with the remnants of his battered escort. Inside there were White Flames warriors clustered along the quaysides suspiciously covering the new arrivals with splinter rifles and disintegrators. Or rather they were suspicious only until they caught sight of Yllithian standing in his barque. To his astonishment the archon of the White Flames found himself greeted by salutes and cheers from his troops, in a tide of excitement and noise that seemed to rise until it echoed through the entire mighty fortress. They were relieved, Yllithian realised, relieved that he was alive, so they could continue to follow him through the terrible crisis of the Dysjunction rather than think for themselves. Yllithian had always worked hard to be feared rather than loved by his followers and yet it seemed that sufficient terror from outsiders was enough to make them love him anyway. He smiled graciously and raised a hand to acknowledge the unexpected approbation. Looking at the thronging warriors Yllithian also realised that he had been wrong. He had sufficient leadership and strength to unify the lesser kabals against Vect. He hadn’t considered the true depths of fear and desperation that the Dysjunction had brought to Commorragh. All he had to do was exploit it as thoroughly as he would exploit any other resource. He clenched his raised hand into a fist and the cheers of his followers roared louder still. Later in the book we see warriors of White flame making preparations for upcoming siege and to follow through with their archon in battle against Vect's Black heart. The steps gradually changed from being white marble, sweeping and magnificent near the top of the fortress, to being mean, narrow and steep towards the bottom. The warriors allowed Kharbyr no time for gawking along the way but he could see clearly that the fortress was being locked down even more thoroughly than it had been before. Squads of armoured warriors were rushing everywhere, and there was a general clangour of shutters being sealed and gateways being closed. [...] There was a sense of… excitement in the air as if the warriors were engaging in the fulfilment of a day that they had long looked forward to. Say what you would about Yllithian, the support of his own kabal seemed to be as solid as a rock. It made Kharbyr wonder a little about Yllithian and his apparently remorseless ambition. Perhaps the archon of the White Flames was really a product of his environment; maybe that was what made him so mad and power-grasping that he would try to match wits with the supreme overlord.",

Second: Allow fans to create their own versions of Primarchs and Legions. Considering that the II Primarch was found early and the XI Primarch was among the last (before Corax), were they purged together for the same reason, or were their causes different and unique? Also, Considering that the XI Primarch was among the last ones to be found, and yet was already purged by the time Emperor found Corax, things must have gone south with him almost immediately.",

      "content_preview": "Warhammer 40,000 by just its name show a massive time gap between our times (or rather the release date of 1987) and the setting's time. Time in such scale is harder to get on mind, but to give some major events. The Tyranids first appeared by 745.M41, 254 years before the \"main time\" of the setting. 254 years ago was 1766. The Tau were first discovered in M36, around the time of the Age of Apostasy. Around this time in the 20th century BC, Egypt was on its 11th Dynasty. The first Minoan settlements emerged on Crete, and the Chinese Bronze Age started. The big background event is the Horus Heresy, 10 thousand year before. As well, the Emperor is said to have been born around 8.000 BC in Anatolia. Anatolia was still under the Neolithic. Some of the oldest inhabited places, like Jericho and Gobekli Tepe emerged around that time. Oll Person is even older than the Emperor, born around 15.000 BC in Iraq. Still the Paleolithic, with the Lascaux cave paintings in France being made around that time. The oldest pottery known comes from Japan and China from this period. And finally, 38.000 years ago, the first Basal Eurasians arrived in Europe, around 2.000 years after the first humans arrived in Australia.",

Vect is the ruler of Commorragh, an absolutely enormous set of realms located inside the Webway, that serves as the home of the Dark Eldar. There are tons of factions and sub factions all vying for supremacy. There are tons of threats and dangers in every realms, each potentially being capable of usurping Vect’s rule if left unchecked. For example, Khaine’s Gate is supposed to be an almost unknown part of the city, which you’d think would mean that not many people are near it. Yet when something starts pounding on it, Vect is automatically on the scene, as he somehow already knows of this problem. So I guess he has agents stationed everywhere? The question though, is how does he manage all this information? I doubt he can leave it to middle management because who in their right mind would trust these Dark Eldar to not screw them over? He isn’t a Psyker like Malcador or the Emperor, so he can’t use Psychic Powers as a way like we saw Malcador do in the Siege of Terra novels. I don’t get it? Are Dark Eldar just built different?",

Jarulek and Kol Badar managed to rescue him just in time but the apothecary notes that he cannot save him He [Sor Talgron] struggled to free himself, to swim clear of this sickening, maddening morass of hatred and fury and rage, but he could not. This was his prison and his damnation, and what was worse was that it was one he felt he deserved. Darkness closed around him. It was all but complete, when a golden radiance appeared before him. He looked up into the face of a demigod hovering before him, and he felt the strangling tentacles fall away. My son. It extended a hand out towards him, light spilling from every pore. He reached up and took the mighty being's golden hand. The demigod's fingers closed around his own and golden light infused everything. 'That's it,' said a voice. 'It's over. He's gone.' The bloody, limbless thing on the table that had once been Sor Talgron was dead. It was actually the eighth time that he had died on the slab, but this time they had been unable to revive him. Apothecary Urhlan stepped away, unplugging the machines that had been straining to keep the captain alive. Their beeps and whirrs became a single, uninterrupted whine. He was covered in blood. It dripped off his arms and chest in thick rivulets. 'It was always unlikely that he'd survive,' he said. He glanced nearby, where another legionary lay unconscious, his flesh pierced by dozens of cables and tubes. 'That one is doing better, though. The one who brought him in. Who is he?' 'Cataphractii Sergeant Kol Badar,' said Dal Ahk in a hollow voice. He was staring dead-eyed at the fleshy ruin that had been Sor Talgron. 'I thought I'd saved him.' The master of signal turned and walked away, head down. One by one, the other legionaries drifted away until Jarulek was alone. The Dark Apostle stepped in close, staring down at Sor Talgron's melted face. He saw something twitch. He blinked, thinking he'd imagined it, but then he saw it again. An exposed ligament twitched in the right side of Sor Talgron's face. Looking closer, he thought he saw something moving within the captain's ravaged flesh, just for a fraction of a second... He felt the touch of the warp, then. It was seeping off the corpse of Sor Talgron like an odour, and his eyes widened in wonder. Sor Talgron twisted on the slab, and his jaw opened, working silently. A beatific smile broke across his lipless mouth. 'Apothecary!' Jarulek shouted. 'He's alive!' Sor Talgron turned his mutilated face towards Jarulek, his empty, bloodied eye sockets locking unerringly onto him. 'The Urizen,' Sor Talgron croaked. Jarulek dropped to his knees. 'Lorgar Aurelian? What of him, brother?' 'He... He lifted me from the darkness.' 'Apothecary!' Jarulek shouted over his shoulder again. 'I saw them, Jarulek,' Sor Talgron whispered. 'Saw who, my lord?' 'The gods...' he breathed.",

      "content_preview": "I've notice in recent years BL has churned out a number of quality xenos books for almost every faction. Necron fans are eating good between Infinite and the Divine and the Twice-Dead King, both of which are considered S-tier 40k novels (and rightfully so). The Necrons have almost been transformed from these excellent books, and the taint of the initial \"Newcrons\" Wardian lore has been washed away somewhat. I would say they were transformative for the faction in a positive way much in the fashion that Know No Fear was for the Ultramarines or Chris Wraight's White Scars HH series was for the White Scars. Meanwhile even a mediocre bolter porn new edition release tie-in novel like Indomitus still managed to have pretty good Necron POV chapters (which was the books only saving grace). Orks, probably in theory the most difficult faction to write a compelling POV narrative for, still have some alright stuff with the Ufthak Blackhawk series but the recent-ish Ghazghkull novel by Nate Crowley (of Twice-Dead King fame) is actually pretty great. And not just great, but very top of A-tier or potentially even lower S-tier great. It gave us our first homerun Ork POV novel. Somehow Crowley was able to make a number of compelling and sympathetic Ork characters when it should be impossible for a faction whose entire schtick is being silly crude brawlers without much else on their mind. Tau, theoretically the easiest xenos faction to write a POV novel for, have had the Farsight series which has been alright to even good at times. However Elemental Council is another A-tier or even S-Tier novel, giving the Tau a much needed boost in BL representation. Dark Eldar don't get much representation, and the recent Lelith Hesperax book by Mike Brooks was pretty mediocre to bad. However the old Path of the Renegade trilogy is actually solid imo and gives them their definitive novel series representation. Moreover, I would say their best (and most terrifying) representation are in the Vaults of Terra and Fabius Bile novel series, where they play a major role. Though I would like to see much more from them in the future and I feel like much more could be done with them. Leagues of Votann are new, The High Kahl's Oath was mediocre at best but it's too early to see if BL can give them the goods. I would argue that even the Tyranids, who you can't really write a true POV novel for, still had entertaining POV chapters in stuff like Devastation of Baal where you see a Lictor doing its thing. Which leaves us with the Craftworld Eldar. BL has always struggled with them in my opinion. Eldar Prophecy and Farseer are regarded as some of the worst BL novels ever made, in fact the former is often cited as the single worst BL book ever written. And even the Path of the Warrior trilogy, their closest to something meaningful, has a bad reputation in the modern fandom. The Phoenix Lords novel series was abandoned after just 2 Phoenix Lords and neither are standouts anyway. Path of the Ynnari was equally abandoned when it felt like they were just getting started, and again neither books are especially good. So the question is: Why does BL struggle so much writing Craftworld Eldar when they have nailed arguably harder factions like Necrons and Orks? Eldar should be able to write a compelling novel by themselves. Hell even in novels where Eldar appear as side characters they're still pretty boring, unlike what they managed for the DE in Vaults of Terra or Fabius Bile, the Tyranids in Devastation of Baal, or Necrons in Indomitus. So what gives?",

With Daemons wanting to literally fight each other for chance to be bound to a Daemon Engine or Weapon.* The Soul Grinders don't count though since well, it's a Hobson's choice for Daemons to either endure a very long wait or become a Soul Grinder for a fleeting chance to shorten their wait after banishment. *AN: I really think Bloodthirsters and Bloodletters would like to be bound to a missile so they can fling themselves towards enemies and contribute skulls to the Skull Throne. Think something like the fandom's Predator Angrinator of the Angry Marines but Khornate. Come to think of it, a missile might be a suitable vessel for a daemon of Khorne.",

      "content_preview": "Reading chapter 9 of Angron: The Red Angel, one of the protagonists, Ortan Leidis, is a standard space marine gone renegade. He defected from a Blood Angel successor chapter to join the World Eaters. After boarding the Conqueror, where many renegades and World Eaters were amassing, he gets into a scuffle with a true World Eater and Leidis shoots him in the head with a bolt pistol. The shot bounced off the World Eater's skull and he was harmed but shook it off. The text makes clear that this World Eater appeared like a beast leading me to believe this may be some blessings of Khorne or something, but is it canon that a space marine's skull would normally be strong enough to withstand a bolt pistol? Seems a bit absurd to be that strong, but it doesn't clearly chalk this up as a blessing of Khorne nor does Leidis seemed shocked by the World Eater surviving. Are there other accounts of a helmet-less space marine just tanking that kind of damage? UPDATE: Just to clarify, the text states that the bolt bounced off the \"impenetrable skull\" of the World Eater and exploded later. It was a very close range shot and Leidis had been knocked down while the World Eater was standing. I was not aware that a bolt pistol fires first from gunpowder and then later by a rocket motor before arming the warhead and exploding. This would explain how the shot didn't kill the World Eater. Thanks for the information, I certainly learned a few new things!",

      "content_preview": "Towering above the other warriors of the kinhost, Ironkin Steeljacks are incredibly powerful fighters. They employ their Votann-wrought strength, immense resilience and keen tactical precision in battles to defend Kin holdings or eradicate the toughest foes. Ironkin Steeljacks emerge from the complex processes of their creation as natural warriors. It is evident to all of their kindred that the Votann intend them to serve on the front lines of the most challenging claims and to defend the four pillars with every augmented fibre of their being. Compared to other Ironkin, Steeljacks boast greatly enlarged skeletal substructures of hardened, exotic alloys, more complex fibreweave musculature, reinforced servo-redundancies and enhanced adaptive logic centres. Understanding their innate talents, Steeljacks hone their martial skills in training, holopattern simulations, and, most of all, in battle. The galaxy is a hostile environment, and there are no shortage of threats to their kindred's prosperity. In battle, Steeljacks are ideally suited to several roles. The hulking fighters are devastating shock troops, their advanced systems enabling them to move as swiftly and agilely as any Kin, even when fully clad in their oversized suits of void armour. Armed with broad plasma falchions or brutal concussion gauntlets, Steeljacks can smash their way through defensive lines, snapping off shots from Autoch-pattern bolters held as easily as pistols. They can punch through bulkheads in swift and deadly boarding actions or form a mailed interdiction gauntlet at the vanguard of a Kin assault. In reclamation or defensive actions, Ironkin Steeljacks frequently form counteroffensive reserves or lead acquisition spearheads, supporting static elements of the kinhost with deadly assaults. Though Steeljacks loom over the Kin of their families, there is no unease in their presence. They are the objects of proud affection, looked up to by others as their kindred's most naturally talented soldiers. While those Steeljacks who rise to squad leadership positions as Theyns typically spend their entire lives immersed in battle or preparing for it, other Steeljacks are occasionally seen putting their immense frames and strength to work in industrial or civilian roles when not training with the rest of the kinhost, integrated as much into society as any Ironkin. It is only lamented that they are not greater in numbers. The initiation of a Steeljack's creation is entirely in the gift of the Votann and subject to those great minds' arcane ratios and formulae. When a forge begins to spontaneously construct masterwork weapons and armour far too large for any average Kin to wield, there is a great and quiet joy throughout the hold, for it is a sign that a new Steeljack will soon join a kindred. These guys are basically what men of iron were and are pound for pound stronger than the average space marine. Theres even the Iron Kahl. A Steel Jack that became Kahl Legends of an Iron Kâhl have existed for millennia. The figure has worn varied guises, often that of a humble Ironkin raised to greatness by the Votann and driven to command entire armies with nigh-supernatural strategic capabilities. In recent centuries, this figure has become more prevalent, with tales of an individual matching the legend bearing an uncanny ring of truth. It is known for rare Memnyr to flood their minds with such massive data flows that they can briefly achieve the feats ascribed to the tales' hero. However, doing so drastically reduces their lifespan, senescence swiftly stealing upon them. Most Kin thus dismiss the cohering rumours as accretions of several individuals' deeds. Gonna be real. There's barely any Grimdark in the new Votann Codex",

And sometimes they are both: “‘Sire, I believe we should save them for–’ The human said nothing more. The front of his face came free with a sickly crack, the flesh and jagged bone crunching in the Night Lord’s fist. Talos ignored the body as it toppled, spilling the insides of its halved skull onto the decking. No one had even seen him move, such was the prophet’s speed, clearing ten metres and vaulting a console table in the time it took a human heart to beat once.” From Void Stalker Like the duration of the average heartbeat is around 0.8 second, meaning that he moved at roughly 12.5 m/s. For comparison Usain Bolts top speed is 12.4 m/s. But he also loved faster than they could see, human eyes have a \"refresh rate\" of 30-60 \"frames\" per second, meaning he could have also moved at almost double the speed of sound! Then hey can also swemingly straight up block bolter rounds at point blank range! “The sorcerer stood at the edge of the marble disc, aiming a bolt pistol. He fired from almost point-blank range. Sabtah had no choice. He slapped the round away. His left hand exploded in a concentric swirl of blood and armour fragments. But then there are also times space marines have fought against seemingly ordinary humans! Now I am aware there is no chance that a space marines speed will be consistent across all of wh40k, but what is generslly a good range of speed to consider?",

There've been scattered mentions here and there -- it still shows up on galactic maps in the 40k core rulebooks, French's Horusian Wars mentions it once or twice -- but otherwise, it was more or less not getting much mention, and so we don't know how it fared in the wake of the opening of the Cicatrix. Until now. Owlcat is following up on the success of Rogue Trader with a Dark Heresy video game ( link ), and just like First Edition Dark Heresy, it takes place in Calixis, but after the formation of the Rift. So we're going to get to see how it handled (or failed to handle) events in the aftermath of the Thirteenth Black Crusade. It's also nice to see that the new Imperium Maledictum Inquisiton GM Guide, although set in the Macharian Sector, has a few callbacks to the Calixis sector.

If that was truly the case, what did the Emperor think about all the deaths of all the humans that his armies massacred in his name? For example, I am currently reading the book Rogal Dorn: The Emperor's Crusader, in which a human civilization called Scathia is mentioned. It was completely exterminated by a combined force of three expeditionary fleets from three Legions. This civilization was not allied with xenos, nor with Chaos, nor were they enemies of the Imperium, yet even so, every last human was exterminated by the Legions. Their only crime was not wanting to join the Imperium. If the Emperor, as he said, wanted to save humanity, why did he allow his armies to kill trillions of innocent humans, committing what was probably the greatest genocide in human history perpetrated by other humans, at least up to that point? Did the Emperor or Malcador ever feel guilty for all those deaths they caused, or did they simply not care as long as it helped their plans? Is there any moment in any book where this is explored in more depth? 🤔 Thanks for reading. Have a nice day. 🙂",

      "content_preview": "Context: A company of Dark Angels return to their homeworld to find it overrun by tyranids. Their villages have been sacked and the capital city is being controlled by a genestealer cult. The Dark Angels convene a tribunal to decide what to do. Cloud Runner looked at the faces round the fire. They were waiting for him to begin. He took three deep breaths. By long tradition, he must be the first to speak. A Gathering of warriors was not an argument in the formal sense, where words were used as weapons to count coup on the enemy. It was a pooling of experience, a telling of stories. Words must have no sharp edges on which to snag anger. He chose his carefully. \"When I was twelve summers old,\" he began, \"I dwelled in the Yellow Lodge among the young bucks. It was my last summer there, for I was pledged to marry Running Deer, who was the fairest maiden of my clan. \"Often, the bucks would talk of the Warriors from the Sky. A hundred years had passed since their last visit, and the red star was visible in the sky. The time was near for their return. \"Hawk Talon, my grandfather's grandfather, had been chosen and taken to the spirit realm to serve the Great Chief Beyond the Sky. My bloodline had acquired much honour because of it, although he had left his son fatherless and needing to found a new lodge. \"Silver Elk was a buck with whom I had vied for Running Deer's hand. Because she had chosen me, he hated me. He boasted of how he would be chosen. His words were a taunt, aimed at belittling my kinsman's honour. Silver Elk's own line had no spirits who had ridden Deathwing and ventured beyond the sky. \"I was stung and responded to his taunt. I said that, if that were so, he wouldn't mind climbing Ghost Mountain and visiting the Abode of the Ancestors.\" Cloud Runner paused to let his words sink in, to let the warriors imagine the scene. The memory seemed fresh and clear in his own mind. He could almost smell the acrid wood smoke filling the young men's lodge and see the furs hanging from its ceiling. \"That was what Silver Elk had wanted me to say. He sneered and replied that he would go to the mountain if someone would accompany him as a witness. He looked straight at me. \"So I was trapped. I could not back out without dishonour. I had to go, or he would have counted coup on me. \"When she heard, Running Deer begged me not to go, fearing that the spirits would take me. She was a Shaman's daughter and had the Witching Sight. But I was young, with a young man's pride and folly, so I refused her. Seeing that I could not be swayed, she cut a braid from her hair and wove it about with spells, making it a charm to return me safely home. \"It was a three-day trip at hunter's walk to Ghost Mountain. Fear was our constant companion. What had seemed possible in the warmth of the lodge seemed dreadful in the cold autumn nights when the moon was full and spirits flitted from tree to tree. I believe that if either of us had been alone, we would have turned back, for it is a terrible thing to approach the places of the restless dead at night as winter approaches. \"But we could show no fear, for the other was witness, and our rivalry drove us forward. Neither wanted to be the first to turn back. \"On the evening of the third day, we met the first warning totems, covered by the skulls of those the sky warriors had judged and found wanting. I felt like running then, but pride kept me moving on. \"We began to climb. The night was still and cold. Things rustled in the undergrowth, and the moon leered down like a Witching Spirit. Stunted trees hunched over the pathway like malign ghosts. We climbed till we came to the vast empty plateau marked by the sign of the winged skull. \"We were filled with a sense of achievement and our enmity was, for the moment, buried. We stood in a place few men had ever seen. We had defied the spirits and lived. Still, we were on edge. \"I don't know what I thought when Silver Elk pointed upward. There came a howling as of a thousand roused ghosts, and fire lit the sky. Perhaps I thought the spirits had chosen to strike me down for my presumption. Perhaps I was so filled with terror that I thought of nothing. I know that I was frozen in place, while Silver Elk turned and ran. \"If I had been afraid before, imagine how I felt when I saw that great, winged shape in the distance and heard the roar of the approaching thunderbird. Picture my horror when I saw it was Deathwing itself, steed of the Emperor, chooser of the slain, Winged Hunting Skeleton. \"I bitterly regretted my folly, I could not move to save myself, and waited for Deathwing to strike me with its claws and release my spirit. \"I was surprised when the thunderbird stooped to earth in front of me and ceased its angry roaring. Still, I could not run. Its beak gaped, disgorging the massive, black-armoured forms of the chosen dead. On each shoulder, they bore the sign of the winged blade. \"I knew then that I was in the realm of the spirits, for Hawk Talon, my grandfather's grandfather, stood among them. I had seen his face carved on the roof pole of our family lodge. He looked old and grey and tired, but there was still a family resemblance. Cloud Runner paused, comparing his ancestor's return to his own. There was no laughter here as there had been among those Marines long ago. He understood now how glad the old man had been to see a familiar face. He was glad that Hawk talon wasn't here now to see the destruction of their people. \"Of course, I was overwhelmed, standing among these legendary warriors, speaking with my ancient blood-relative. I knew they had returned to choose their successors in the Emperor's service, and forgetting everything else, I begged to be allowed to join them.\" \"They strapped me to a steel table and opened my flesh with metal knives. I had endured the Weasel Claw ritual to prove my bravery, but the pain was as nothing to what I then endured. When they opened my flesh, they implanted things which they said would bond with my flesh and grant me spirit power. \"In a vision, the Emperor came to me, riding Deathwing , mightiest of thunderbirds. It was different from that which had borne the Sky Warriors home. It was a beast of spirit; the other had been a bird of metal, a totem cast in its image. \"The Emperor spoke to me, telling me of the great struggle being waged on a thousand thousand worlds. He showed me the races other than man and the secret heart of the universe, which is Chaos. He showed me the powers that lurked in the warp and exposed me to their temptations. He watched as I resisted.  I knew that, if I had given in, he would have struck me down. \"Eventually, I awoke, and I knew that my spirit belonged to the Emperor. I had chosen to abandon my people, my world and my bride for this service. I knew I had made the correct choice.\" Cloud Runner glanced around at the other Terminators. He hoped he had told the story well enough to catch his listeners' minds and remind them of their duty to the Emperor. He hoped he had reminded them that they had all made the same decision as he had and that they would once more make the correct choice. He shook his head and touched the charm of braided hair that he still wore around his throat. He wondered if he had made the correct choice all those years ago, if he would have been happier staying with Running Deer. The bright, bold vision he had possessed in his youth had faded and lost its glamour over the years of endless warfare. I never even said goodbye to her, he thought, and that somehow was the saddest thought of all. He judged that he had swayed many of the Marines, but when Lame Bear leaned forward to speak, he knew the struggle had only begun. \"I would speak of Genestealers.\" The big man said quietly. \"I would speak of Genestealers, their terror and their cruelty...\" Old old school lore, with the DA explicitly being American Indian themed was pretty cool. Too bad they got rid of it.",

E for context: Because I realized everyone obv hasn't read the sot and might be curious about what the Immortal 9th is, well before Sanguinis was found, the 9th legion was considered maybe the most unpleasant and scary of all the legions. Because of their over active eat people to gain their knowledge glands, they would eat their enemies similar to Kroot, but they were called the Immortal 9th because whenever members would die (might only be chapter master) they would eat them and absorb their memories and basically just become a new version of the chapter master, adopting their personality and mannerisms etc.",
