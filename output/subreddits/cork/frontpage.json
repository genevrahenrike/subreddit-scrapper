Last night at about 10pm I was driving home and a woman just hopped over the bridge on Albert's quay. She was obviously fucked on drugs, and in tears. I stopped my car and ran out to try and convince her to come back over the bridge railing, and in the meantime a few other people stopped and guards drove past, i was able to wave at them to stop too. After about 5 minutes of sitting on the edge she jumped off and the lads that were there ran after her and threw down a life buoy to rescue her. The guards just stood there. I honestly don't know what happened then because i left, there was no need for me to be there anymore and i did everything i could. An ambulance pulled up shortly after i left too. This is the second time in a year I've been in this situation, and one of the lads that pulled up said he was in this exact situation the night before. What the hell is happening to our city and country, and what the hell are we going to do about it. Is this really as common as it seems to me and why is no one talking about it??",

To this end I'm putting the feelers out to see if there are any other parents with autism that would be interested in this. Because Lord knows being a parent is hard, but having autism at the same time is like cranking the difficulty meter to max. Let me know your thoughts, I think we could build something here.",

      "content_preview": "Hello, I’ve been living in Cork for a few years but I’m from Donegal. When I go home I usually take a bus to Galway then take another bus to Donegal (I work from home so when I am in Donegal I usually stay for a couple of weeks). I have my driving license now and my N plates are just off so I was thinking I might try driving it the next time I go to visit. The thought of driving 6 hours by myself is daunting but I also know I might enjoy it, I do not have cruise control though. Just wondering if anyone does this journey regularly would you recommend any particular stops or if public transport is the way to go? Another note is that I don’t really need my car when I’m in Donegal so that is stopping me from deciding to drive there too",
