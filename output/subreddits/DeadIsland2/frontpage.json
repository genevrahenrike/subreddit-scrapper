Once I got to Venice beach I knew I had been deceived. There's lots to explore! And if you really take your time the game has lots of content. I'm only on my first character and I'm 25 hours in with only half the story done  and a couple side missions done. I will admit I have spent hours just messing up zombie limbs and messing with the gore system but that is part of the game and it is addicting in itself All in all I'm probably gonna spend hundreds of hours in Hell-A and I'm so happy from what I've seen everyone is wrong about the length and amount of content",
