Seriously. I loved it that in the parks in the last millennium we were free to wander around pick out rides at a moments notice based on what the line in front of us was and that we all got treated the same. I hate the idea in modern theme parks that either I’m the asshole paying to cut in line or I’m watching more privileged people cut in front of me. Are there any theme parks left in the US where I can just get in line for the ride I want and not worry what my social class is? I was a huge fan as a kid but I haven’t gone in decades. My kids haven’t been either - they haven’t asked but critically I haven’t tried to sell them on it.",

      "content_preview": "Hey! About a month ago I posted a six flags exit poll to multiple subreddits to put into a mega appreciation post! Past with the park: In my personal experience, this park was my childhood theme park. Some of my best days in my childhood were spent here. We came every year for multiple days and this park really sparked my love for theme parks. It took all of my firsts. My first teacup ride, my first carousel, my first flying carousel, my first coaster, my first wooden coaster, my first wild mouse my first outdoor drop tower, my first pendulum ride, my first big boat water slide type ride that gave big splashes, my first my first very high flying carousel, my first river raft, my first B&M and Intamin coasters. The great chase was my childhood favorite ride as a kid. I absolutely loved this thing. We always went as a family and it was so fun. I still remember how fast it was. I remember the ball house where there were a bunch of balls. I remember the water parks and wet rides and how wet we got how much fun we had drying off. All that good stuff. It was always a dream to go. That park. Even though it’s not the greatest park. I know that. In terms of theming it was the worst by a mile. But I love the rides, I enjoy the line up they have. Joker is a fun ride that’s all twisty. Superman is still in my top five of all time favorite coasters in general. Firebird is great despite how people  thought it bobbed their head (although it wasn’t really an issue for me for the most part.) Roar was always a great time. Wild One is charming and grew on me. Wonder Woman is not as scary as I thought (more on that later.) Harley Quinn is so thrilling and fun, always a fantastic time. And Batwing is legit the scariest coaster I’ve ever been on in my life by a mile. It was always a blast…when it was working lmao that ride was very iffy and despite going so many times I only went on that one two times. Although…I hated Mind Eraser…fuck that ride. That ride can die in an inferno. And Riddle Me This, High Seas, Flying Carosel, Minutemen Motors and Cyclone were nice to take a break from the intensity. All in all, these rides combined to make for a wonderful experince overall (at least in my opinion.) Why it’s closing: The reason why it’s closing on Nov. 2nd was not because it was one of the worser parks, but because the land was high value as it's sitting right next to the DC area. So, they dedicided the land was more valuable than the pakr itself. So they'll buldoze the land and try to sell the land. Although, they don't have a buyer set up so this could end up in disaster. I sincerely hope it does, because this park unlike some other parks in the chain had SO much potential to be one of their most profitable parks. It had the costumer base of these people who were right next to DC. It had some great coasters, all it needed was a little spruce up in the theming, replace some of the weaker rides with some amazing rides and this would've one of the best performing in the chian. But what kills me is that it's going out on a whimper...not a bang. It's a ghost-town, half the rides are closed, and no one cares...although that isn't the expericne I got when I went my most recent time. Poll Results: I ran a poll and I got about 18 responses. Here were the results. The demographic was mostly men, 83.3% were men...about 15 people. Two of them were non-binary (11.1%) and just One of them was a woman (5.6%). The age is a bit more interesting, most of them were 30-39 (about 44.4%), with teenages (13-17), young adults (18-29), and middle age (40-55) all tied for second most with 16.7% percent which is about 3 people in each group, and one person was in the group older adults (55-64) with only 5.4% of the poll. SO most of them were adult men/teenagers who had many things to say about the park. Although I did notice that the older people tended to have more things to say than the younger people. Question 1: What would you do to change the park if you could? Most answered by saying they'd want to renovate the existing rides, adding new rides, and having better maintanece, investment, and marketing of the park overall. Specfically RMCing Roar (from two seperate people, which is fair Lmao.) Question 2: How does the closure personally affect you? Most were met with either saddess for the park or indifference. I thought this one was kind of funny : \"Well i cant go to it anymore\". But one specfic part in someones response really resonated with me: \"My favorite coaster (out of over 300) is Wild One. I’m absolutely devastated that my daughter will never get to ride it with me as she’s still 4 inches too short to ride it. I’d do nearly anything to be able to continue sharing memories with my kiddos there.\" It was very heartbreaking to hear. Even though many people may not like it, it was very special to a lot of people and this specific person and myself. Question 3: What is your best and worst experiences with the park? There were a lot of interesting responses with this one. Many recalled the people who may have soured the experince for them (stealing, or getting caught in a mob of people). But there were also many great experinces like being able to go on rides multiple times. Question 4: How do you think this will impact the community around? Most talked about the workers who would be out of a job. Which is bet probably IS the thing that will be the biggest thing that comes from this. There were also just people saying how it would be a loss of a theme park option, leading to other parks being more crowded (which is a fair point to consider.) Question 5: What is one thing you’ll miss about the park? Most said the rides and the workers there. Which really was the main thing that made this park enjoyable. And the workers who really tried to make this park what it should've been. Question 6&7: Do you think the park will close before Nov. 2? Why do you think that way? We now know from the Six Flags schedule on the website that it won't. But I still wanted to talk about the results here. I know on some the reddit posts about this park that many people were \"calling it\". The poll is pretty split with this one. (35.3%) said yes and no. About 6 people in each group and about 5 people (29.4%) said maybe. When asked why, the responses were interesting. The people that said no say that Six Flags would get even worse backlash for it. That they'd have to refunds, that the fall would draw in more costomuers. The people that said that it would justified by saying half the rides are closed so \"what's the point\". Question 8: What do you think will happen to rides? Most that while the newer and great rides may be sold or relocated that most of them would probably get scrapped. Which is pretty realistic, most of the coasters there aren't really worth bringing to another park and all that. Questions 9: What is your favorite ride from the park? About five or six people said superman, and Wild One, Joker's Jinx, and Batwing got two people respectively. One person said Roar, Rajin Cajin, and some water coaster each. Question 10: If have anything additional to say, you can say it here Here are my two favorites: \"disclosure is nothing but corporate greed. If the land was cheap, it would not be this park. This park has a ton of potential and could rake in some revenue.\" \"This park deserved so much better than it got. This is a heavy, heavy loss and an absolute tragedy for the industry, especially given what could have been.\" Overall, a lot of people said that they would miss it, others were glad to see it gone or were rather indifferent. There were genuine heartfelt respones I will keep to my chest and think about for a long time. Interview: When I was at this park I interviewed a worker who worked the carnival stand. They said that they had really valued the friendships they had built there, that they made friends they would have made in any situation. They talked about how the clousure would destroy a good chuck of the market for young teens who wanted a summer job. How the closest park was now two hours away (which sucks.) How many parents would drop off their kids there so they wouldn’t be bored. When I asked them whether they thought it’d close by Labor Day they said that when they cancelled freight fest it got them worried. Which was quite a scare. Most recent personal experience: Now let me tell you about the most recent time I came to this park. I went with my uncle, dad, and two cousins. We spent pretty much the entire day there like you’re supposed to do. I went on August 3rd…a Sunday. I heard it was basically a ghost-town even on the weekends. Which had me worried. I liked short lines but I didn’t want it to be a complete ghost-town. But…it was busy. Not super busy or anything but it was decently busy. I had to wait a decent amount of time for rides like Harley Quinn, Mind Eraser, Jokers Jinx, and Wonder Woman. Which was shocking. Mind Eraser might’ve been like…45 minutes. Which is practically unheard of at this park. The worker I interviewed told me this was most people they’ve had since July 4th. That it’s been a complete ghost-town for the most part. Which is kind of crazy that we went on a busy day. What are the odds? Anyway, when we entered the Flying Carousel was closed as well as the Tea Cups. So we went on over to the Wild One as our first ride. It was fun, I remember it being rough. So it was weird. Although I actually do remember it being fun the second to last time I came as well. We waited a few minutes before going on board. Next we went on Voodoo Drop which was my first outdoor coaster. (Taking another first.) And it was pretty fun. I waited about 15-20 for this one because they only operated one of them. Next we went on Fire Bird and Roar as well as High Seas. Fire Bird actually hit my head for the very first time. It never did that before. Although there were always complaints for that, it never happened to me. But this time, it did. It was still pretty fun though. Roar was rougher than I remember as well. Probably the fact that it’s older and closing. High Seas was as comical as ever the screams are always fun. A simple ride. High Seas we walked on. Roar and Fire Bird we waited a few minutes before hopping on. We went over to Gotham City and hit Wonder Woman. Here’s the thing with Wonder Woman. This was one ride I never conquered. I’m absolutely terrified of this type of ride. It was only a few years back I finally rode on Flying Carousel with a bit of nervousness STILL let alone Wonder Woman which was the same thing but dialed up to craziness. I never really thought I’d ever do it but when it was announced the park was closing I knew it’d kick myself years down the line if I didn’t go so I just decided to go for it. It was actually predicted to be closed. But I was so happy and relived to see it was open! I was nervous, so I popped in my headphones and it really helped but it actually wasn’t that bad. Not nearly as bad as I thought. Also, as I was waiting I actually wasn’t scared which was weird but whatever. Then we went to Jokers Jinx. It was a good time. As usual. But it was a 20-30 minute long wait. The worker sounded a bit enthusiastic about his job unlike the previous ones preceding that looked like they wanted to commit suicide right then and there. It was kind of funny… but yeah great ride. We went on Harley Quinn twice. It’s amazing as usual. It opened later and we immediately got on it. The first wait was about 10 minutes or so. The second time was about 20-30 minutes again. Riddle me this already looked abandoned as the center of the ride had been taken out. Looked to be closed for the season and isn’t even listed in the site anymore. The entire section of whistle stop was completely closed and Superman and Batwing were closed. Although those two rides there’s still hope as the sign said they were waiting for the parts to come for rides to work before the park closes the worker told me it would probably be October before it opens again. Cyclone also looked abandoned and prepared for destruction as well. The park looked half abandoned half alive. It was kind of cool to see. But the park looked mostly alive though. We then went to steam town. Which was the renovated part. I wanted to go on the new ride there but the line was too long for me. (Real shocker.) So we just went on Mind Eraser. I don’t care about its bullshit new name. It’s Mind Eraser. So we went and it was about a 30-45 minute wait. Probably the longest we had to wait. Although it was cut short because the ride was down for maintenance for about five minutes and most of the line walked out so when it got back to function we basically got on almost immediately. I thought it might be better but I genuinely thought I was going to die and not in the thrill way in the way that the ride was going to self destruct. My cousin thought the same. And our picture is the embodiment of our feelings at the time. It was better than last time as I actually got hit last time…but it was still very rough. We went to the near entrance and the Tea Cups were open so we went and it was fun. It was walk on. Then finally, normally I wouldn’t do this for a Six Flags America trip. But I went to the Great Chase because it might be the last time I ever get to go. I asked someone to record us. When we were done I was in tears and the person who recorded the video for us asked me if it was because I got scared—man I wish that my worry. I told them no and thanked them for the video before leaving. We went to the shop and I bought a shirt with “Six Flags America” to truly remember it. We leave and that’s about it. TL;DR despite literally everything telling me it was going to be a ghost-town it was opposite. So, you’re never really going to know what you’re going to get at this park. Aside from Superman and Batwing. Almost every other ride we wanted to do was open! So I’d say it was very successful. If you’ve never gone there and you have the convenience to go—do it. You never know what you’re going to get and this park will close forever so might as well. Sorry for the long post lol. If you’ve read all the way to the end thanks for sticking around. Have a wonderful week!",

I’ll be in the States to visit Cedar Point on 19/09 for Halloweekends (hopefully it won’t be TOO busy) and can activate it then. I had some questions though: Is it really $99 for the whole of 2026? Every other add-on seems to be per month rather than an upfront cost. It seems too good to be true. Would I be able to use it for the rest of the year? I currently have a trip to Six Flags America pencilled in for early October and if this pass would get me in to SFA that would be fantastic. I have a US address that I can use for the pass. I’m also planning on a big coaster trip next year so honestly it seems incredibly worth it to go for it. Anybody got any clarifications or concerns or recommendations? Would love to know before accidentally getting in over my head. Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "Sometime between 2005 and 2010, I went to a theme park in the southeastern US and went on a river/lake boat ride which goes by a wooded area. About 40 or so yards into the woods, there was a 10-15 foot statue of what I can only describe as a Cloaked Grim Reaper holding a scythe. This statue was definitely not part of the theme of the ride and is not obvious to spot(I was bored and looking in the woods). This statue may also be on an adjacent property to the park. I believe I remember there are some homes farther back in the wood line, so maybe a homeowner put it up as a joke or Easter egg? My best guess is that it was Holiday World in Santa Claus, Indiana but I'm not able to say for certain. It could also be Dollywood, but Holiday World feels more likely. About 5 years ago, I was able to find a picture of the statue in Google images(very low res) but now it appears to either be buried or gone. I'm just hoping that someone here has some knowledge or maybe has seen it as well and could finally solve this myself. To make a false memory less likely, I have at least one family member on the trip that remember me pointing out the statue while on the ride.",

Scaring people was my passion — I lived for the jump scares, the screams, and the reactions. I was even told there were tons of videos of my character floating around online. At one point, my leads told me that having an actual scare actor in a wheelchair inspired more handicapped guests to attend Fright Fest, which honestly meant a lot to me. One of my favorite memories was the night the Vice President of Six Flags and his wife came through. Word was they loved to be scared — and later that night my leads came backstage just to congratulate me for scaring the hell out of them. That’s the kind of stuff I worked for. After 2019, I moved into other roles at the park — front gate, then Guest Relations after COVID. I worked any shift I could get. I loved being part of it all, whether helping guests or scaring them on the weekends. But then things started to go wrong. A new program rolled out in GR that everyone hated. When we were asked for feedback, I gave my honest opinion — but I accidentally hit “Reply All.” Within minutes I was pulled into a supervisor’s office and was told a full timer had wanted me fired. Even though I apologized and explained it was a mistake. The next day, I was written up. And not long after, another incident at Ticket Will Call sealed my fate. It was 125 degrees outside, the little A/C was set to about 70, and one coworker kept raising it higher. I finally raised my voice (but didn’t yell, didn’t swear). Later, I was suspended pending “investigation.” A week later, I was fired. The reason? They claimed I swore in front of a guest. I’ve been in customer service since 8th grade — I don’t do that. They told me there were four signed affidavits… except only four people were in the room, including me. HR also claimed they “heard” me swear, but there’s no audio recording in TWC — there never has been. And when I asked what exactly I supposedly said, they refused to tell me. I was put on “No Rehire” for 2 years. In 2024, I reapplied but was told I came a week too early. In 2025, I tried again. This time, I had to fill out a Change of Rehire Status, and I was told it’s “under review.” Here’s the thing: I know I’m not a saint. I made mistakes. But I also know I was good at what I did, and I loved it. Even my supervisors admitted I shouldn’t have been written up, yet those write-ups stayed in my file. I even requested my employment record in writing — which they’re legally supposed to provide in 30 days. It’s been 3 years. Nothing. So here I am, still wondering: Was I fired because I asked for accessibility changes? Or because a full-timer had it out for me over an email mistake? Most of the people involved have since quit or transferred. And me? I’m left with the one thing I can’t seem to get back — the chance to do what I love. I’ve been quiet long enough. I’m not cocky. I just live for the scare, and I was damn good at it. I just wanted to share my story. Thank you 1infectedpatient",

      "content_preview": "Hello ! I've recently stumbled upon a 2 years old video by George Browning about the French theme Park \"Le Puy du Fou\", titled \"the insane historical theme park with no rides\". The tone of the video and the comments were all very much praising the park for the quality of its show productions, and it's historical theme. Internationals in the comment were pleased to discover about this park they had never heard of and said it looked fantastic. To those who don't know, le Puy du Fou is a park that has no rides, only top quality shows with live actors, boats, horses, fireworks. It is themed to French history from the 14th century up to the early 20th century. This post is not about spreading hate against George, who clearly does not know about the controversies that this park is facing domestically. It is about raising awareness on the fact that this park is not historical, it is propagandistic. There is a part in the video in which George addresses some of the problems he faced when visiting, and mainly it stems from his inability to understand the language (I get it, and I'm sorry he couldn't) as well as the historical background that the park is built from. And that's fine, we can't all know about the history of every country we visit. In this part of the video, he says he found the trail of memory really grim, but mostly he just copypastes what the park's official communication says about the Terror (a period of political turmoil following the French revolution). The park's creators and executives are pushing onto the guests the idea that revolutionaries perpetrated a genocide against the vendéens (people living in vendee, a region in the West of France where the park was built). This is absolutely refuted by all historians. There were battles against pro-monarchy factions in vendee, but the people was never massacred in the name of the revolution, even less with the intent of destroying them because they were vendéens. Vendéen is not a religion, nor is it an ethnicity. However, this whole 'genocide vendeen' was invented in the late 19th century by far right catholic activists and writers who wanted to discredit the republic and the newly installed democratic institutions that they deemed decadent, since they got rid of monarchy and severed the links between church and state. Philippe de Villiers, the creator of this park, is a far right French politician, and I mean really far to the right. Just read the controversies on his wikipedia page. George presents him in a very neutral and romanticized way, just as the park's PR does. I think it's sad that they didn't do more research on the man. In reality, he has made a lot of racist and antidemocratic comments through the years, and he covered up his son's incestuous assaults on his other son. The whole park is imbued with nationalistic propaganda, christian evangelical morals and monarchistic nostalgia. Joan of Arc, a classic symbol of the French far right, is presented as a literal saint. The park spent 377k euros to buy an actual relic (which is most probably not even authentic) and present it to the guests, as if in a church. The Vikings are saved by Christian faith. The Revolution was wrong and violent and nothing that came out of it was really worth it. We had it so much better with our royals and nobles. This is the kind of takeaway one can get from the resolution of the shows at le Puy du Fou. There is nothing wrong romanticizing history, but pushing a conspiracy theory and far right ideology into guests is deeply unsettling. Then again, some shows in the park are fine because they don't go too hard on this stuff. The problem is have with this video is that what I've just listed is not quite easy to pick up if you do not know beforehand what the history of the revolution is, and what is the modern political history of France. But I get really dissatisfied when people praise this park just because they don't know any better. I think we should not let le Puy du Fou get away with spreading lies about history to push forward a blatant right wing agenda and I don't want other foreigners to fall into their trap unaware. What do you think about this ? Did you know about le Puy du Fou and it's controversies? I heard they have opened new parks in Spain and the Netherlands and are trying to expand to the UK. At least now you've been warned. TL;DR : le Puy du Fou is deeply rooted in far right conspiracy theories and I'm sick of hearing foreigners being brainwashed into praising it unbeknownst to the fact that it is a propaganda tool.",

      "content_preview": "A proper theme park is very expensive to build. Jazzland in New Orleans was built in the late 1990s and cost $100 MIL but the theming was was rather sparse. Islands of Adventure debuted in ?1999? and was the first theme park to cost $1 BIL. The Radiator Springs land in Disney's California Adventure ALONE cost $2.3 BIL. Admittedly, the theming of Universal and Disney parks is on an entirely different level compared to the likes of your average Six Flags. Challenges with Houston include the high cost of construction, the tariffs imposed by the tangerine tyrant, finding enough land that is affordable but not too far out, getting all the infrastructure needed into the park (water, sewage, electricity, and possibly natural gas). Add to all that that non-Disney/Universal theme parks are generally not cash cows. Run properly they make money but not hand-over-fist kind of money. That has real consequences because most investors want a quicker return. One other challenge is that the more investors you have, the more things said investors want customized to their liking. This can be a never-ending nightmare. On the plus side, look at the likes of Silverwood in Idaho, Adventureland in Des Moines, Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, and Kennywood in Pittsburgh, just to name a few. Those are much smaller municipalities and yet they still manage to support a park, thus with around 7 MIL citizens in the greater Houston/Galveston area, we are certainly capable of doing this. If the investor(s) were able to incorporate a water park, golf, tennis courts, and an RV park, it would become a major destination for not just Texans but folks from neighboring states, too. Big Rivers had big ambitions. Still does? IDK. But, I do know they at least once had the money to construct a park but not the money necessary to bring in all the utilities. That is a M A S S I V E expense. I believe it is inevitable that the Houston area will get another theme park and I don't believe it is going to take another 20 years to get it. I know patience is thin but I am highly confident something will come.",

Lucky Strike Entertainment (owner of bowlero) was the second highest bidder for the west Coast portion of their parks, and it was just let out that the deal was finalized. This acquisition is great news for castle park since they have been slowly declining over the past decade. Being lucky strikes new biggest asset, I have high hopes they will make the park great like it used to be! We are now down to 1 running coaster (Merlin's revenge) and they recently closed the dark ride inside the castle. Hopefully they can at least get the funds to turn the water back on in the mini golf.",

I love paper park maps, I think they’re great souvenirs, but most big parks (I frequent Cedar Fair/Six Flags parks) don’t have them anymore. I’d love to hang some up on the walls. Does anyone know if you can still get them at customer service or anything? I know this is a long shot and the answer is probably no but I thought I’d ask (:",

      "content_preview": "I’m in the early stages of planning a small amusement park. I have about 2 acres of land to work with, and I’m trying to figure out the most cost-effective game mix that will attract families and help me turn a quicker profit. I’ve been researching this for months, and the equipment costs are honestly intimidating. I need to be strategic about which games will provide the best return on investment, while still creating a fun, engaging atmosphere that keeps visitors coming back. I’ve been looking at wholesale manufacturers online and ask for vetted supplier names/experiences instead of direct links. Alibaba does list many carnival/arcade suppliers, but many are wholesale and prices/MOQ vary a lot. I don’t want to save money upfront just to deal with constant repairs or, worse, compromise on safety in the long term. One of my biggest questions is which games consistently perform well in terms of both revenue and popularity. I want to avoid the kind of novice mistakes that can sink small operations during their first year, like choosing games that are expensive to maintain, too niche, or fail to appeal to a wide audience. Any insights from operators or folks already in the industry would be incredibly helpful. I want to make smart choices from the start, balancing cost, safety, and fun, so this small park can grow sustainably and become a real hit in the community.",

We fly back to Ireland today but I just wanted to look back on the experience we've had here and man, it has been great! When we first started our park adventures last Tuesday, it was been nothing short but brilliant. We finished up both Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios, as well as visited Volcano Bay and Epic Universe for a day as well! If I was to pick a favourite ride, I would probably have to say Mine Cart Madness from Nintendo World in Epic Universe. That or Battle at The Ministry! Both were amazing rides! I am very much planning on coming back next September for Halloween Horror Nights and I am so looking forward to doing this! Thank you, Universal Studios for being such a great theme park! Can't wait to come back soon!",
