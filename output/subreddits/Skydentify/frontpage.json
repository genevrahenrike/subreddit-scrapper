The object was flying steadily from north to south, around 2–3 thumb widths per second at arm’s length, with no change in trajectory or speed. It was consistently visible, but at one point it suddenly flared up — very bright, like a star — for about 2 to 5 seconds, and then instantly returned to its previous brightness. No fading. I checked Stellarium, Heavens-Above, and N2YO — no match. At first, I thought it might be Strand-1, but the position and path didn’t align. However, after digging deeper, I found that Resurs-DK1 and possibly even Cosmos 2084 matched the trajectory at that time. Could either of these have caused such a flare? Anyone familiar with how these objects behave visually?",

One bubble in particular somehow remained intact as it went insanely high, and as it reflected the sunlight at different angles and was swept along by the wind its flight looked really weird and unexplainable like a bunch of videos I’ve seen of supposedly strange UFO/UAP objects in this sub. Made me realize that a lot of the videos we think are of extraordinary sightings have a really mundane ordinary explanation and a lot of people are getting hyped up over absolutely nothing.",

      "content_preview": "I had just eaten dinner at my parents house and got in my truck to head back to my apartment. Before I started my truck I sat in it for a few minutes while I was in an ADHD thoughts coma. Suddenly, a loud plane engine noise hit me coming from directly above. Usually when a plane gets closer to you, it is a gradual increase in volume, then decrease as it passes. This was as if a plane turned its sound off until it was right above me then turned the sound on. There was no gradual increase in volume, just suddenly like the sound spawned above me. Then I look up. I have never seen a plane fly this low before in my town where Ive lived for 19 years. It was low enough that if words were written on the bottom of its wings I could have read them easily without my glasses. Its lights were also unusually bright. There were no flashing lights, just one green on each wing and two white in the middle all parallel to each other. It was flying from south to north while our airport is directly west of where I was. Because It’s light were very bright and the whole “plane” was clear to see. It didn’t look anything like a commercial airplane or any other plane that I’ve seen before and was around the size of a bus. From what I describe it may sound like a regular aircraft but because it emitted no noise then was suddenly very loud, is why I’m bringing my experience to Reddit. Also because of how low it was flying and the lights weren’t flashing. If you’ve seen the recent that a New Jersey women took of a UAP while she was walking the track at a football field, my UAP looked extremely similar to hers. My phone was dead but since I didn’t realize this object was flying over me until it emitted noise directly above me, I wouldn’t have had enough time to capture it on film anyway. Mississippi has lot of trees so I was only able to clearly watch it for about 10 seconds. After this, I moved to my parents backyard to see if anything else was going on in the sky. I saw nothing else at first however, it sounded like there was a plane flying over me but I could not see any. This lasted around 5 minutes with the noise coming from a single direction that I had a clear view of. Then the noise instantly stopped. After trying to figure out where the noises were coming from, I eventually see something. It was what looked like to be a plane much higher up than the first one I saw and its altitude level was where I typically see planes fly over. I thought this plane looked normal but watched it pass over anyway. I noticed that there was no noise coming from the direction of this plane or anywhere else. Unlike the first “plane”, this second planes lights were flashing red and then white in a single pattern. Then the light flashing pattern became irregular and unpredictable. To describe the irregular flashing better- At first it was flashing red x 1 then white x1 repeating. Then it became white x 3 Then red x 1 White x 4 Red x 3 And so on with no predictable flashing pattern that normal planes have. This second “plane” was going northwest to southeast. What I’m about to discuss next I questioned keeping to myself because of how bizarre this story gets. The best way I can describe what happened next to this second “plane” goes as following- A small white dot moving at the speed of a shooting star collided with this second “plane” creating a white flash that reflected off the clouds above the plane. This 3rd colliding object was coming from north to south before colliding with this 2nd “plane”. Nothing happened to the plane though. It just kept moving like it was before until it was out of my sight. I couldn’t believe what I just watched happen. I thought it must have just been a shooting star but this object came From below the cloud line. There is also lots of light pollution so seeing a shooting star in general here would be difficult. I spent a lot of time watching the night sky here since all the sightings started in December. I had yet to see anything so I quit making the effort to after winter break. I thought all the recent sightings in the northeast U.S.A. was just built up hysteria and misidentifications coming from the hysteria causing people to look up in the sky more. Most the videos you see, look like planes but thousands of people are saying there is something off about them which you can only tell irl. The first plane I saw tonight matches what others are saying where it looks like a plane but something is off (flying very low, irregular noise, and brighter/different lights than normal planes). The second plane, I have no idea what I just witnessed. Does anyone have any explanations for what I’ve witnessed or have similar encounters?",

      "content_preview": "I'm truly curious as to what I saw tonight. I'm sure it wasn't an alien craft. Perhaps it was some type of drone? Maybe the experts can help me figure it out. I looked up tonight and saw an object flying across the sky. It was flying north to south if that makes a difference? It seemed to be flying at about the altitude where commercial jets would fly. Although it's hard to tell because it's dark out. I know this is unbelievable, but I reached for my phone to take a picture, and my phone was dead. It had died an hour before because I didn't charge it earlier today. So I was left to just watch it fly across the sky. If you would have just had flashing red and blue lights on it or red and green I would have just said that's a commercial airliner and went on. But there were two bright white lights on the bottom of it. Quite large lights. They seem to illuminate the complete bottom of whatever craft it was. I couldn't make out any silhouette or shape at all because of the darkness and the two lights reflecting down towards me. It was high enough up that either the lights weren't that right or they was too far away for them to produce any light below them other than what I was seeing. From where I saw it and to where I couldn't see it anymore must have been 15 seconds tops maybe less. So it was hauling ass. I basically watch the disappear before my very eyes. I'm not sure what it could be but maybe someone on this sub can give me some insight? Thank you and I apologize I didn't get a picture. Even though that sounds ridiculous. I wanted to add I'm in Nevada near Boulder City.",

      "content_preview": "\"Time: 1:41 AM ET till 3:15 AM ET Location: London, KY\" I stepped outside to grab a phone charger from my car when an inexplicable urge compelled me to look up. To my surprise, I saw orbs shimmering with red, green, and white lights, suspended and scattered throughout the sky like celestial jewels. They floated effortlessly, their colors pulsating gently, creating a captivating display that held me captive. After a moment of stillness, one orb began to glide elegantly through the air, its movement reminiscent of a metallic jellyfish or a donut, gliding gracefully in a box-like pattern. It was as if it was choreographed, each turn and twist executed with precision. Suddenly, it darted erratically, soaring high into the sky before diving down in what I can only describe as a breathtaking corkscrew plunge. The sheer agility of these orbs was astonishing, and it felt as if they were scanning the surroundings, their shapes morphing fluidly as they navigated above me. They seemed to be drawn to the natural elements around, particularly the nearby lake, as if the water held some magnetic allure to them. Upon noticing my gaze, the orbs appeared to engage playfully, performing bolder maneuvers to capture my full attention. They exhibited a childlike exuberance, dancing in the air with lights that intensified, culminating in a dazzling white glow that felt inviting, as if beckoning me closer. One orb then approached closer with a curious grace, hovering about 200 feet away, its brilliance cutting through the tree branches that framed my view, casting flickering shadows on the ground below. This experience lasted nearly two hours with orbs exhibiting no sound at all, just pure silence. Several orbs passed by, their movements fluid and harmonious while also erratic, while others lingered in the distance, their lights fading into the stillness of the sky. I have attached photos and video from that night. https://preview.redd.it/bkuy5hsf71ce1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/mxxy2qtg71ce1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/ufreqptg71ce1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/yw26lrtg71ce1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/cu381ztg71ce1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/8zjfiytg71ce1.jpg",
