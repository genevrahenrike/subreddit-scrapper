      "content_preview": "I just showed my bf the Lularich doc and he was in disbelief.. He’s actually a really well dressed guy so I know he notices when I wear things and I asked him if he could ever picture me in some of those prints we saw and he said no never lol He was blown away by all of it. I was tempted today so I went and looked up people who still sell the inventory and I sure found some FB pages. I wonder if it’s day 1 loyal people? One lady had a long post from a few years ago about how the doc sensationalized things and the people on the documentary were bitter and she never had a bad experience .. Funny because she had nothing recent aside from that that is Lula related but then she had other things on her page that she sold. It seemed like she had a day job I just don’t get how people felt selling not really cute clothes was such a cash cow? I mean I guess it was at one point but after the crash of it, I’m sure profits are nominal.. I mean less than 1% of the company made more than $5000 in 2023 (their income statement inflated numbers) These are the people who worry me… just very limited logic and common sense 🫠🫠",

Weren't these leggings famously cheap?? Why would companies give permission to use these branded characters? Or were they committing plagiarism?!? What's the story here?",
