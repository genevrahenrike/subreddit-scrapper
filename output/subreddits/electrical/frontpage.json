      "content_preview": "Hi folks, 1960 home and what clearly seems to be the original doorbell/chime. The chime finally gave up it's ghost and it just clicks/plinks. I located the transformer in the basement attached to a pull chain light.  It is an Edwards no. 890. It says 10 volts on it. 2 questions: 1 - most of the basic wired chimes I am finding say 16 volts. Is there a good chance these may work with my 10 volt transformer?  Obviously I will find out if I try...just curious if folks know from experience. 2 - if I do end up having to replace the 10v transformer with a 16v, I assume that the existing wiring running to the front/rear doorbells and chime would be sufficient? I really just want the easiest path to getting this working again. Not really in need of a ring/camera doorbell...just want it to make a doorbell sound again.  But, a new  transformer would give me the option of a camera doorbell eventually I guess... Thanks for any tips!",
