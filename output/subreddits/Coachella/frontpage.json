      "content_preview": "I just saw G-Dragon's concert in Vegas last night and he kept making references to the 20th anniversary of his kpop group Bigbang that goes down in 2026. He was teasing some sort of reunion or celebration of sorts and if it was to be a reunion tour, I feel Coachella could be the first stop they choose to pop that off next year. This reunion was supposed to have happened 5 years ago in 2020 but COVID happened and the group lost two members since, one to a sex crimes conviction and one choosing to leave on his own terms. Considering GD headlined Head in the Clouds this year and his solo tour has been promoted by AEG, both G-Dragon and BigBang has to be on GV's radar. 🤔 If anything, G-Dragon by himself could put on a really great set on Mojave or Outdoor stage, à la Jennie or Lisa? But bringing BigBang to the desert could be a great millenial foil to the impending BTS reunion that's due to happen next year too.",
