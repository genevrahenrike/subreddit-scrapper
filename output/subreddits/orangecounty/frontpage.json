      "content_preview": "First, I want to apologize for any inconvenience or uncomfortable feelings I might cause. I‚Äôm not here for a pity party, and I‚Äôm not here for a handout. I just want to illustrate the reality in all of this. There‚Äôs certainly reason to assume a homeless person might also be a criminal. We see it all the time. While I‚Äôm a sinner like everyone else, I‚Äôm also conviction-free, drug- and alcohol-free, non-violent, and generally a friendly dude. In 2022 to 2023, I started attending Miramar College in San Diego with the goal of becoming a pilot. In order to afford $600 for 2 hours of flight time with an instructor, and manage full-time college courses (as someone who isn‚Äôt very smart), I decided to live in a vehicle. For a while, I was safe. I would park, sleep, go to school, repeat. I completed ground school courses and intended to continue with the aim of becoming an aerospace engineer. Three months ago, I received a $125 ticket and a notice that an ordinance, already present across the county, would now be enforced. Vehicle dwellers would be arrested and have their vehicles impounded. I wasn‚Äôt partying. I never got out of my vehicle. The cop just assumed I was inside or did his best to find a crack he could peer through. Realizing there was a high chance I could lose my only shelter and everything I own, I escaped east to Arizona, where I knew I could find dispersed camping. My van isn‚Äôt an eyesore, but it‚Äôs over 30 years old and not the kind of thing you want to rely on in the wilderness. I looked for jobs nearby but couldn‚Äôt find anything sustainable. About a week ago, I dropped a comment on a YouTube video from a very cool aerospace company that restores vintage aircraft, while I was literally in the middle of nowhere. To my amazement, the interaction escalated, and I landed a dream job that pays well. A dream job, and once again, I apologize, in the city of Santa Ana. Obviously, it‚Äôs illegal to sleep in your vehicle here too. Obviously, parking is a problem even for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people. And obviously, my presence makes the problem worse. So what could I do? I walked into the police department and pleaded for answers, pleaded for advice. Dispatch told me that according to municipal code, it‚Äôs illegal to sleep in my vehicle (no surprise). So I asked: What can I do to keep this job, and what can I do to avoid getting towed and losing everything I own? They gave me a number for CityNet, suggesting I get into a shelter through their program. Day one: CityNet had no beds available. They told me to call every morning at 7:30 AM for a ‚Äúbed count.‚Äù That number has been a stark zero every morning for the past five days. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating when I turn on the news or read online that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs help available, but the homeless don‚Äôt want it,‚Äù and then I dial that number every morning, desperately trying to get help, only to find there is none. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to me that I don‚Äôt physically need the help, and that when a bed is available, I‚Äôll be taking the spot of someone who really does. Someone who is sick, shelterless, and hopeless.",

They recently sent out an email saying: ‚ÄúAfter thoughtful consideration and feedback from our community, we‚Äôve decided to remove reservations for weekends in September.‚Äù That‚Äôs good news ‚Äî especially for families who were frustrated by the unexpected shift to paid entry.

She was visiting the Target on 13831 Brookhurst St. Two men in a black van damaged her car in a fit of road rage. They followed her after she passed them in the parking lot, they were backing out and didn‚Äôt see her approaching so she passed them. There was no honking or gestures. I guess that made them mad so they lobbed a green metal cart towards her front passenger door, denting it in the process. My mom was so shaken she was unable to get a license plate or anything to help identify the men, other than they were white and had tattoos and were driving a black van. If anyone in the area saw something or has dash cam footage it would be greatly appreciated! This occurred this morning 9/1/2025 around 10 am A police report has been made. Thanks!",

So far I‚Äôve had a great experience! If you delivered at OCMC Fountain Valley, how was your experience in the hospital? Did you get your own room? Do I need to take anything when I deliver or do they provide items for me and baby postpartum? Please and thank you!!",

We‚Äôre thinking maybe the beach and/or a hike somewhere in Orange County? Priority is just seeing absolute most gorgeous shit possible & eating something delicious. If there‚Äôs a way to combine a brief hike (or just really pretty coastal walk) and the beach would be ideal. I know ‚Äúday‚Äù is subjective but we‚Äôre checking out of one spot at 10 AM in LA and into next one in SD at 4, don‚Äôt mind getting there a little after 4 but probably not much much later. So, what‚Äôs the absolute most gorgeous beach between the two? Where should we eat? Thank you!!!",

      "content_preview": "Hey y‚Äôall! I‚Äôve got my friend‚Äôs punk band based in Costa Mesa that‚Äôs looking for a drummer for a few upcoming shows they have in October. I‚Äôm playing bass with them for these shows and helping out with finding them a drummer. Ideally looking for a full time person that‚Äôs local to Orange County, but fill ins are welcome too. Looking for drummers 21+ with show experience, reliable transportation, and a great attitude. And if you‚Äôre a fan of Green Day, Bad Religion, and Social D, even better! That‚Äôs the style they‚Äôre looking for. Example: https://youtu.be/rKXRBGHH7L4?si=wO83ASQh4utESqk7 Shoot me a message if interested!",

I looked up on flight radar apparently they then went NB 73 and 405. A Huntington Beach PD helicopter also circled near Hoag for a while. I went outside but didn't see anything. Just wondering if anyone else heard it and saw what happened?",
