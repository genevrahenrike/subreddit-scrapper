      "content_preview": "I’m so fucking sick of these mind games you have to play with these interviewers. I had an interview the other day: Write a function for a 4 way stop. The goal is to move traffic through the most efficient way possible. Timing of the lights doesn’t matter. Assumed traffic’s only goes straight, no left or right turns to worry about. Assume all of the cars traveling either north/south or east/west are able to clear the intersection on their turn. I did a great job gathering these requirements, and communicating my thoughts, but doing so took so much time and was like pulling teeth to get anything out of the interviewer. Now if you read the problem, then you’d realize that because timing isn’t a requirement, there’s no need for a queue. I clarified that with the interviewer and then wrote a basic solution with a class, tuple for directions etc. Rejected. What was the fucking point of this question? Sure, I could add in timing next, but I just wasted half the time trying to pull these basic fucking requirements out of the interviewer’s head. I had a devops interview today and it was soooo refreshing. It was a chill conversation about K8s, observability tooling, and what types of SRE challenges my team faced. But the weird thing is, if don’t move forward to the next round, I wouldn’t even be upset because at least I was treated like an actual professional instead of like an 8th grader talking to their algebra teacher.",

A year later, I landed a remote dev job with a German startup. I was making in one month what people around me made in a year. Now I’ve worked for 3 international companies, traveled to 2 continents, and even renovated my parents’ house. If you’re in a place where opportunities feel impossible — keep grinding.

      "content_preview": "Hi redditors, I know LeetCode can feel overwhelming for beginners - especially when you’re close to interviews and don’t know which questions to focus on. Blind 75/95 and similar lists are a decent starting point, but let’s be honest: solving just ~100 questions usually isn’t enough to crack top interviews. That’s why I put together a curated sheet that organizes 360 problems into 90 core patterns . Yes, there are other pattern-based resources out there, but you won’t find this level of granularity in patterns anywhere else. Every problem in this sheet is sourced from real interviews in the last 6 months at companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Uber . I originally created this sheet for myself, and it personally helped me crack interviews at Salesforce (twice), Intuit, Microsoft, and several mid-range companies over the years. Sharing it here in case it helps someone else in their prep journey. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EEYzyD_483B-7CmWxsJB_zycdv4Y5dxnzcoEQtaIfuk Edit: created this discord community for people who want to solve this together : https://discord.gg/zxywjSuvDT",

Now I’m preparing for interviews again to switch companies, and I’d love to set up a similar system. Here’s the idea: We form a small group of around 10 people . Every day, we code together for 1 hour . On alternate days , one member is randomly selected to act as the interviewer. The other person becomes the interviewee. Before starting, the interviewee can say which topic they want to focus on (e.g., Arrays, Strings, DP, Graphs, etc.) and what difficulty level they’re ready for (Easy / Medium / Hard). The interviewer will then pick a question accordingly, run the interview, give feedback, and score the performance out of 100 . This way, it feels like a real interview environment —with different people, random selection, varying question styles, and constructive feedback. Over time, everyone improves both as interviewees and interviewers. If you’re preparing for coding interviews and want consistent practice in a supportive group, drop a comment or DM me!",

I am so mad about Amazon that I don't even bother to interview with them if this person is possibly my future boss, and I don't care if I will be blacklisted or whatsoever. FXXK you Timeline: Recruiter Reach Out: Early August Asked me to complete OA Passed OA in a week Took 2 weeks to schedule technical interview Technical Interview 1: 2 hr ago Senior SDE based in CA, actually a nice guy Format: Leetcode Medium Question Stucked half way, solved the problem with hint at the end (shouldn't have stucked, but I won't pass the shit show any way) Communication and vibe was actually decent, he actually cares about brining down the churn rate of the team, but I guess this team will always be a shit show if the principal SDE is shit Technical Interview 2: 30 minutes ago Principal SDE, FXXKER ASIAN PARENT Format: behavior (my son is so smart! he has a PhD from Stanford~) live coding (read my mind, and I don't care) Started with self introduction, and after self introduction he started bragging about his son \"my son went to Stanford for PhD, and he now works at HRT, you know prestigious trading firm ......\" \"you might not have the best vision for the industry, you know it's all about coding not LLM ......\" \"your school's CS is very XYZ but not ABC...\" on and on and on for freaking 30 minutes I honestly don't understand why his son is relevant in the interview, I guess he tried to bring it up because I went to the his son's same undergrad school. I tried to stay patient throughout the entire process, and tried to follow his conversation at certain point, but I honestly DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SON WORKS AT HRT OR HAS A PHD. I don't understand why would this take half of the interview time. This is the brewing of the shit show. After bragging about his son, he started saying something like \"I know your school's CS is not very coding heavy, are you ready to take the coding test?\" I felt it extremely weird for him to say that, as if he was assuming I was a terrible candidate or something, and I just replied \"yeah, I'm ready\". I mean, what else should I say? I'm not ready and please fail me?? Started live coding. The interviewer was initially trying to find and copy the question into the platform, but he couldn't find the question, so he started explaining the question in one of the abysmal way possible. (a bit of exaggeration, but it was extremely confusing) He started by framing the question as \"imagine your are building a tool in real life, you have n labeler of data, and m QA people of data, and you need to build a queue and write a class in FIFO basis\" \"you don't know how many data you have, and the data will be tested by QA people\" I probably only understand 30% of what he says, and the statement above was already organized for readability, his original statement was extremely difficult to understand I tried to ask clarifying question and try to generate cases, but he keep saying vague statements like \"this could be right or wrong, it's your choice\", \"well you need to think about it just like in real life\", \"it's your choice to use this or that, just finish that\" Half way through, he added some additional constraints on the question, but I wasn't sure if I was getting his idea correctly I started writing the code with utter confusion, and tried to ask if there is anything like input data format, type etc, and he just kept saying \"you know it's just like real life, you have to guess\" I was like ... ok? And I tried to guess what I was supposed to do without getting any meaningful feedback. Half way through, I could clearly see that his attention was on a different monitor, and he wasn't paying attention to the interview at all until I asked him something, and he would just give me another vague response. Time's up and I was still extremely confused about what I was supposed to do, and he finally remembered that he was in an interview and saying \"well it seems like you don't fully understand the question\", and I was like \"yeah, that's why I kept asking for clarification\", but he just kept saying \"well, this is just like working in real life, and you have to make some assumption along the way ...\" \"if you need to clarify everything it's like high school coding work\" etc Honestly, I am already pissed at the moment. I stay calm even though I felt disrespected in his speech. He said \"this would not be a pass, but hopefully ...\" Honestly I don't care what he say. The entire interview felt like a shit show the moment he started saying his son has a best paper award, works at HRT, majored in stats, used to not like coding but now code a lot ... It really surprised me that I could learn more about his son than the role in the interview process , and I think this states enough about the problem. He clearly cares more about bragging his son to a random job seeking new grad than actually conducting the interview . Conclusion I have never ever met such a disgusting interviewer. I interviewed with other FAANG roles, startup, and non-tech companies for multiple other roles over the last few month, but none of the other interviewer has ever let me felt disrespected or gave me so much rage and frustration in just one hour. I guess there is a reason why Amazon has terrible culture and the churn rate for the team is high if their higher management/engineer are like this. TLDR: If you are interviewing with Amazon, some of your interviewer may dedicate half of the interview time to brag about his son and started shaming you for not reading their mind. There is a reason why Amazon is such a shit show in so many ways if the principal SDE's is a retxxded axxhole Edit: grammar",

Second question explained everything but fell short of time to finish the code. Interviewer was overall happy. Feedback: Hire System Design This round went well. Question was not something direct which we find on Hello Interview. But it went well. Feedback: Hire Behavioral This is the round because of which I couldn't make it. Normal questions which are present in most forums. But I was asked 3 questions. But there were a lot of cross questions. Basically it went into all the deep details of the story I prepared. I did not lie at all. Feedback: could not clear the L5 standard. May be the work I do, or the way I presented did not show the impact of L5. Overall, profile not good for L5, and not down leveling to L4. Recruiter told me that for L4 coding has much more weightage, and I could not finish the code for second round second question. (May be that's why no downleveling). Cooldown of 1 year. Please pay attention to Behavioral, which I had read people don't do, and made I myself made the same mistakes. Disheartend but happy I went through this, would not have prepared design and coding if not for this prep. Keep grinding.",

I am also pretty confident with my foundational DSA knowledge (theory, implementation, etc.). However, I don't think this is enough nowadays. I am hoping to crack the realm of LC hards needed to break into top quants and other FAANG+ companies. The problem is many of these hards require some crackhead solution that I probably would have never come up with by myself if I had not seen it before. An example of a \"doable\" hard for me is Maximum Frequency Stack + Split Array Largest Sum. An example of a crackhead hard is Count Palindromic Subsequences , which seemed relatively simple but requires a 3D prefix/suffix sum or a 4D DP solution (was asked this in a real interview btw, had 30 min to read then solve). Also, I will occasionally come across a medium question that requires a less common approach (i.e. Union Find) and will completely forget that it was the right approach because I haven't seen a question using this pattern in a while. I've gone through the NC 150 already and am going through the NC 250 now, but even still I don't think it's building my intuition for the LC hards appearing at the Q3/Q4 level. Considering I'm now a junior, how should I be preparing in the next few months?",

(I heard it might be ~40 questions in 40 minutes?) What kind of pseudocode/programming logic questions usually appear? (Are they C/Java-style or more language-independent?) Do they also ask basic CS fundamentals (like OOPS, DBMS, CN, OS) or only pseudocode questions? What’s considered a safe score/accuracy to clear this round and move on to the coding round? Basically, I’m trying to understand the difficulty level, format, and preparation tips for this technical test.

Edit: Thanks for joining me ( reached 5 members ) 🔑 How We’ll Work Ownership System : Each month, one member leads a topic → selects resources, proposes problems, and kicks off discussions. Everyone rotates, so we all get exposure. Weekly Flow : 🖊️ Problem-Solving: Start with 20 minutes of independent attempt on a problem. 💡 Discussion: after the 20 minutes, If stuck, we brainstorm together. 🌐 Resources: If still blocked, we can look up solutions (editorials, blogs, or Ai) and learn the optimal approach. ⚡ Contest Mode: Enter LeetCode weekly contests. ⏳ Info Duration: 4-5 months Current size:  5/5 peers Timezone: Indian Standard Time (GMT +5:30) If you’re serious about accountability and want to grind consistently, DM me. PS: Serious learners only. If you’re not ready to show up regularly, this group is not for you.",

Some managers ask random questions not related to the role. A couple didn’t even seem interested or engaged in the discussion. Even when one call seemed positive, the outcome later came back as rejection. I’m honestly not sure what I’m doing wrong. Is this normal in team match? How many rejections are typical before a match happens? Any tips on how to handle uninterested managers and make sure I leave a strong impression?

They sent me a HackerRank that was pretty outrageous It was 75 minutes to answer 3 questions . The first question was build carousel  Card component from scratch in React with a list of like 30 requirements. The second Question was build 5 api endpoints in Express (they use fastapi) The last question was use AWS CLI to make a backup of A EC2 AMI, Find the security flaws within the previous instance, patch them, and them upgrade the instance. The kicker was it's recorded and you can't use the internet or AI. I've had 2 similar interviews in the past week and all of them wanted 996 with under the market pay.

      "content_preview": "I cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. (I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL) TLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident. Company Agnostic Tips Getting Your Foot in the Door: This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can. 1. Brush Up on Your Resume Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal. Use a standard, one column layout like Jake's Resume that is easy to parse for humans and bots. Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies. The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc. 2. Linkedin This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc. Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters. Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them. 3. Apply Generously I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one. A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer. A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most. Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers. Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet to help with this. Technical Interviews Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve 3 * 3 since they don't know what the * symbol means. Solve Neetcode 150 .  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it. Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem. After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either Strivers , Alphabet 150 , Blind 75 or Minmer's List of Varients . You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category. Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and Leetcode Discuss Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. You can do \"offline mocks\" on Leetcode Assessment or Interviewing.io 's AI Mock Then mocks with people on Pramp/Exponent (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like I Got An Offer (affordable but can be hit and miss) or Interviewing.io (pricier but more consistent quality) Tip : Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist . Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out. Behavioral Interviews \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level. Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each. As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer. Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through. Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work. Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable. I found Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide helpful Tip : When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\". System Design Interviews Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack. Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading Designing Data Intensive Applications and watching Jordan Has No Life . There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies. Read Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\" Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$) Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions. Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked. Tip : System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision. Offer Negotiation Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can. 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can. 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus. There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing. If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it. Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here. I found lots of good tips from Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice. My Personal Interview Experience Since some will ask how my interviews went Prep I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared. I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company. I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game. Meta (E5) Source: I was reached out to on Linkedin. Phone Screen: 2 questions in ~45 minutes. First was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged. Onsite: 2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode. System design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it. Behavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each. Apple (ICT4) Source: I was reached out to on Linkedin. Note: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. Phone Screen: 2 questions in 45 minutes. First was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed. Onsite: 7 hours over 2 days. A few standard technical rounds. A few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel. One system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard. Palantir (SWE, not FDSE) Source: I cold applied online, no referral. Phone Screen: Leetcode Medium, very standard Note, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions Onsite: 1 Leetcode medium, very standard. 1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution. 1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack. Hiring Manager Call: This started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round. Notes & Disclaimers I'm happy to answer questions in comments I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed. These are the resources and approaches I've personally used and recommend, I'm sure there are other good ones I am unaware of. I interviewed with Meta before codesignal, I dont know anything about that. I am not offering resume reviews nor my recruiter's email. No I don't know why you were ghosted, sorry about that though. No I will not share the exact questions I was asked. No I will not share which company I selected or where I am currently at. No I won't share my flashcards or behavioral doc Thank you anonymous internet stranger for the award, I'm glad this post has been helpful",

Approach1 : we can keep all the data related objects as entities without any behaviour (functions) and seperate the behaviour to individual service classes corresponding to each entity/group of entities and have the inmemory database in service class or create a new repository class. Approach 2 : we can keep all the data and functions in a single class and just add a Api class which has all the functions related to functionalities mentioned in the requirements and in the same api class we will keep the inmemory database of all entities so that we can access any objects data from the api class without accessing their services Which approach is preferred?
