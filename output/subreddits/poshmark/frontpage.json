      "content_preview": "🚨 DO NOT USE POSHMARK’S CONSIGNMENT PROGRAM 🚨 Poshmark’s new consignment program is a complete disaster, and I’m warning everyone to stay away. I packed a large, high-end-brand-filled bag (so full I could barely zip it shut) to send to a verified consigner through Poshmark’s new service. The items were great brands, some designer — hand-selected because I knew I’d be splitting profit with the consigner. The bag was picked up from my porch by a Posh-scheduled Uber driver, scanned, and marked “in transit.” An hour later, I get a message from the woman who was supposed to receive my items — and instead of my bag, she was delivered… a brownie. Yes, really. A single brownie. Thankfully, she opened a case right away and even submitted security footage of the Uber driver delivering it. But here’s where it gets worse: 🚫 Poshmark didn’t contact Uber. 🚫 They didn’t try to trace the driver. 🚫 They didn’t attempt to recover the bag AT ALL. Instead, they simply cancelled the bag within 3 hours of pickup and sent me an automated email saying it was “closed.” After following up with support (repeatedly), I was told the maximum credit they offer is $200 and that their terms say they’re not responsible for lost items — even though they were the ones who arranged the transportation and completely failed to follow through when something went wrong. That bag had significantly more than $200 worth of inventory in it — even with the 50/50 split. And Poshmark never even tried to find it. Uber is useless because I didn’t order the Uber myself so they can’t do anything due to confidentiality issues (stupid). 🔴 So here’s your warning: Do NOT send your items through Poshmark’s consignment program. Their system is flawed. And their “support” is worth nothing when your entire inventory vanishes.",

      "content_preview": "I want to preface by saying that I both sell and buy on Posh about equally so I understand both side but for the love of God: -stop modeling clothes that are too small on you- no one wants buttons that may have been loosened or a stretched out t shirt. And if it’s a larger garment, the item doesn’t look accurate on your body anyway so what’s the point? -Stop listing items under the incorrect size. NO a size large that looks small to you is not a small. 🥹 I understand if it’s a vintage item and sizing is off but in that case, include measurements. People who shop particular brands are familiar with that brand’s sizing so they know what to narrow the search down to if needed. -I’m not buying a used item from you plus paying $8 shipping for more or the same amount of money that I can buy it new for. I just liked a pair of Keds for my child on Posh that are listed for $65 figuring that they were listing high but would sell for lower…they sent me an offer for $58. I can go to my local shoe store and buy them for $40 + tax brand new. People can list items at any price they choose but I always wonder…why? Same goes for overpriced stained items, items from shein or temu etc -If something just needs “a quick wipe down” then do it. No one wants to buy your crusty, moldy (yes I have actually seen this) item ESPECIALLY at an unreasonable price. It’s worth the time to just wipe it down/wash.",

We've been selling for the last 2 or 3 years on Poshmark and I am so sick and tired of people bidding 50% or less of the asking price. Just about every platform has a minimum bid structure except for Posh. Lately, the trend is right at 50% or less and I'm tired of declining offers because I know it affects the algorithm. I feel like counter offers are pointless when someone is sending a bid for $20 on a $250 item. Maybe if they get enough messages at once, they'll finally do something about it.",

I recently started a Poshmark account to try and sell some high quality items that I’ve had forever and do not use anymore/have barely ever used (scarves, high end handbags, etc.). I’m curious how long it typically takes to make a first sale, I posted the items on Friday and no bites. Are buyers hesitant to purchase from accounts that have no other purchases, reviews, etc.? Any tips to make buyers more comfortable purchasing from a new closet? Any tips appreciated!",

I received a pretty large bag a few weeks ago and it took me almost a full day to take photos/ list because the clothes were wrinkled so I had to run a steamer on all of them before photographing. The listing photos are good, and I offered some discounts for people who had made bundles. The bag owner messaged me asking why I lowered the price and questioned my marketing plan for her bag. I’ve been replying nicely but then she sent me a bunch of photos she found of her clothes from the internet (like models wearing them and stuff) and asked me to update the listings. I was out of town and even had my page as “on vacation”. Today I see that she messaged me again and she wasn’t happy that I hadn’t updated her listings yet, and then she escalated the conversation to Poshmark support. I’ve received multiple other bags with items that have been selling well, and the owners of those bags have never questioned me. I am getting frustrated at her micromanagement. I told her I could just send her bag bag if she’d like but she hasn’t responded yet. I am starting to want to just stop the program altogether.",

      "content_preview": "I’m sending this letter to Poshmark support; please feel free to copy/paste, because the more of us that lean on them, the better. I will include in the comments a condensed version if anyone feels like slapping it on their social media accounts. They are robbing us sellers right now and I know I’m not the only one who feels this way. Dear Poshmark Support, I have been a loyal Poshmark seller for years, but I am writing to express serious concerns about the recent shift to AI-only handling of return cases and support requests. While automation has its place, the current system is resulting in a noticeable decline in service quality — particularly in fairness, nuance, and case resolution accuracy. When Poshmark staffed these processes with human representatives, the 20% commission was steep but justifiable — sellers could expect responsive, thoughtful, and fair resolution of issues. Now, without the labor costs of those human teams, that 20% feels disproportionate. Sellers are paying the same high fee for significantly reduced service. To put this into perspective: eBay charges a final value fee of around 13.25% (plus a small fixed amount). Mercari takes 10% of each sale. Depop charges 10% plus payment processing fees. Even Etsy, with its additional listing and payment processing fees, rarely reaches an effective rate of 15% unless using costly ads. By comparison, Poshmark’s 20% commission is among the highest in the resale industry — and that was before the reduction in human support. With the human element gone, sellers are now paying more for less. If Poshmark wishes to retain its seller community, I strongly urge you to reconsider your fee structure. A reduction to a rate more in line with other platforms — especially given your lowered operating costs — would demonstrate good faith and a commitment to fairness. Without such changes, sellers will inevitably shift their business to platforms that offer both better service and better rates. I hope Poshmark will take this feedback seriously and act to maintain the trust and loyalty of the sellers who built its marketplace. Sincerely, [Your Name] [Your Poshmark Closet Name] Edit: a lot of people are saying that Poshmark is great because they haven’t increased seller fees since 2011. If you look at the math though, they are not putting themselves out for us. They put us out for their own profit: They take a 20% commission—a percentage, not a flat fee. Prices of clothing have gone up with inflation. A 20% commission on a $50 sale in 2011 was $10. On a $75 sale today, it’s $15. That’s a 50% increase in dollars taken per sale without touching the percentage. Reduced service = higher effective cost. If you pay the same commission but get less in return (no human case review, reduced support quality), that’s effectively a price hike. You’re paying the same, but the value is smaller. The “savings” aren’t shared. Replacing humans with AI dramatically cuts labor costs. That extra margin isn’t going to sellers. It’s going to Poshmark. This is the same playbook we see everywhere in corporate America: Keep the percentage the same, let inflation do the work, reduce services to cut costs, and rely on brand loyalty to keep customers from questioning it. I’m not saying Poshmark shouldn’t make money. But we are the ones who take the photos, write the listings, ship the items, and now even deal with our own return cases adjudicated by an AI that lacks nuance and often even common sense, and get only canned responses to any support requests, even when they involve technical issues, while Poshmark simply owns an app that pretty much runs itself. 20% kinda looks less like a fair partnership and more like a bad deal.",

The streaks aren’t great. They’re pretty lame prizes, considering how much money they make off of every. Single. Sale. I’m considering leaving the app for another one like offer up or something.

And these are items that have been sitting for months and some even years. 3 of these items were made after I made offers to likers, however I make the same offers every week and only now did they sell. It is a daunting process if you have quite a few items in your closet and you do it on your own, but it’s worth it! Also the new feature where Poshmark rolls over your likes if your listing is over 60 days old is helpful as well so you don’t have to go back and delete old listings. So this is your sign to stop procrastinating and relist your items to make those sales! This happens every time I relist and I always regret not doing it sooner.",
