      "content_preview": "I am preparing my app for launch and my plan is to make it opensource, but as a lot of people who are in similar position, I am also worried about the future of the app. It's possible that one of the big companies can take the source code and push it down their larger distribution channel and essentially make my app redundant. I haven't researched this part properly, but I know there are some licenses that, on paper, prevents scenarios like this. I am not so worried about a company making this app their internal tool, but it would be nice if a company larger than certain size does this they have to purchase some sort of license to do  so. I guess my question is can I enforce such limitations on my open source apps using licenses so a big company neither distribute the product on their own or adopt it internally without any license.",

      "content_preview": "So basically my company is hiring another developer and I was talking with the HR manager and she said that she prefers when people in tech have a website or some sort of online presence so I decided to create an app that is somewhat a mix of Linktree and Linkedin to fix that problem, and it can also serve as a bio link. Users can choose a username, add their favorite links, CV and there's even a blog feature. You can end up with a cool domain like https://whoami.tech/cfds (me) with all your information. It's completely free and open source if you find the idea interesting :) (i built it pretty quickly on my free time so its probably still full of bugs but feedback is very welcome). https://whoami.tech https://github.com/s1lvax/whoami",

      "content_preview": "Hey r/opensource , I'm an 18 year old photographer and programmer. I've been using Lightroom for a while, but I always found it resource heavy on my machine, especially when working with large batches of RAW files. As a personal challenge, I decided to build my own RAW editor from scratch to learn more about image processing pipelines and see if I could create something more performant. The result is RapidRAW . It's a non-destructive, GPU accelerated photo editor built with Rust, Tauri, and React, with a custom WGSL shader pipeline for all image processing. The goal was performance and a small footprint - the entire app is under 20MB (which is less than the average RAW image :)). It's open-source under the AGPL-3.0 license and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It already supports a full RAW workflow, including: Library management, rating, and tagging Non-destructive editing with a sidecar file system Standard adjustments (Curves, HSL, Exposure, LUTs, etc.) Advanced masking (Brush, Linear, Radial) and lightweight, local AI masks for subject/sky detection Batch editing and a full preset system I also recently implemented an optional ComfyUI integration for generative edits. This allows for things like generative inpainting and object removal by connecting to a local ComfyUI backend, keeping the core application light while still enabling powerful AI features for those who want them. I'm sharing it here to get feedback from the open source community. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the tech stack, architecture, or any features you think are essential for a tool like this. Contributions are of course welcome, whether it's bug reports, feature suggestions, or PRs. GitHub: https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW Thanks for checking it out. Timon",

      "content_preview": "A couple of months ago, I launched a simple macOS utility to solve a personal frustration: the USB-C cable mess. All the cables look The same, all the speeds and capabilities are different. My app reads the data from IOKit to instantly show the negotiated speed of any connected device, so you can tell if your \"10Gbps\" cable is actually just a slow cable in disguise. I know this data is already available in System Information, but I found myself opening it too often. To my surprise, the app became very successful on the Mac App Store, telling me a lot of people have this problem! The thing is, my day job is a Linux Ubuntu machine. I wanted the same utility for my work setup, and I wanted to approach it with a different philosophy that fits the Linux ecosystem. I've built a Linux version from the ground up, and I've released it as a fully free open-source project on GitHub. It provides the same core functionality, but on Linux Machines: Reads from usb-devices to show device speed and version. Pulls power delivery information. Translates technical IDs into user-friendly names. While the Mac app is a commercial product to support its development, I wanted this version to be a contribution to the community that builds the tools I rely on every day. You can check out the full source code, contribute, or just grab the app from the GitHub repo here: https://github.com/connection-information-suite/usb-connection-information-menubar-linux I'd love to get your feedback, pull requests, or just hear your thoughts on it.",

It's becoming unsustainable as a volunteer effort. The challenge is being educational without being discouraging. Want to help beginners learn but also need to maintain project quality. Can't just auto-reject low-quality PRs but can't merge everything either. Started using greptile to do initial screening and provide consistent feedback formatting. Helps catch obvious issues and gives me a starting point for more detailed reviews. Still working on finding the right balance between automation and human mentoring. How do other maintainers handle this? What's your process for managing PR quality at scale while staying welcoming to new contributors?",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I am working on an embedded product using Yocto that launches a Qt Application at startup. I am trying to make sure we comply with open source licenses correctly, but I am a bit confused about the implications. Here is the situation: The application uses Qt6 . It also uses Qt Virtual Keyboard , which I understand is GPLv3 only . The rest of the Qt6 components we use are under LGPLv3 . From what I understand: Since Qt Virtual Keyboard is GPLv3, the whole application must be GPLv3 , which means we would need to make the source code of the app publicly available. Because Qt6 is LGPLv3, we must allow the end user to replace the Qt libraries with modified versions. But do we need to provide documentation or scripts for rebuilding the Yocto image, or is it sufficient to just not prevent the replacement technically (firmware signing, hardware locks...) ? If we used Qt5 instead, the LGPLv2.1 modules would not require the ability to replace Qt , so simply publishing the application source code would be sufficient, is that correct? I‚Äôd really appreciate clarification from anyone with experience in embedded Qt products. I want to make sure we comply without overcomplicating things for users. Thanks in advance!",

Its purpose is to provide a safe framework for studying and managing situations where aggressive anti-cheat software interferes with each other, such as conflicts between Riot Vanguard and other anti-cheat platforms. The project is fully open-source on GitHub: https://github.com/PalorderSoftWorksOfficial/EzAntiAntiCheat I‚Äôm looking for contributors interested in: ‚Ä¢\tKernel driver development ‚Ä¢\tSystem-level security research ‚Ä¢\tSafe experimentation with software conflicts and aggressive protection mechanisms ‚Ä¢\tDocumentation, testing, and tooling improvements Notes: ‚Ä¢\tThis project is intended purely for research and educational purposes. ‚Ä¢\tIt is not designed to bypass or disable anti-cheat systems for gameplay. ‚Ä¢\tImproper use may render software unusable; please use responsibly. Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are very welcome! If this post violates community rules please contact me instead of instantly banning me from the subreddit so i can fix the post from the issue!

And even if they worked, they‚Äôd cost ‚Çπ2.5k‚Äì‚Çπ4k/month , while still needing manual trade uploads. I couldn‚Äôt justify paying that much for something that didn‚Äôt even integrate with my broker. So for months, I just tracked my monthly PnL in Excel with two charts - cumulative PnL curve and monthly PnL bars. Eventually, I decided to build a proper tool that actually worked for us. It's called Arthveda and it's GitHub repo. üß† What it does today: ‚úÖ Import trades via Excel from Zerodha, Upstox, and Groww. More brokers integrations in development. üîÑ 1-click sync for Zerodha. Fetches today‚Äôs trades and syncs instantly. üìä Get insights like Cumulative PnL over time, PnL over time (grouped by daily, weekly, monthly), charges, win/loss stats, streaks, R-factor, etc. More insights in development. üìÅ Explore positions with powerful filters. Quickly drill down to exactly the position(s) you‚Äôre looking for. üîç Dive into any position - view entry/exit trades, holding period, charges, notes, and more. More powerful journal with features like rich text editor, uploading screenshots and tagging trades in development. I built it for myself and others who care about tracking their performance and improving over time .",

So, as a personal challenge, I decided to build my own from scratch. It's a simple android app with two versions: a full music player and a standalone converter. It can download entire playlists and is completely free to use. Here are the links to both: YouTube Converter : https://github.com/21Errors/YTConverter Converter + Music player : https://github.com/21Errors/YTMP3 The music player has a few minor bugs I'm still working on, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. I also have a web version in the works, but I'm still trying to figure out the hosting situation since it needs to run shell commands. I'd love for you to check it out, give me some feedback and maybe leave a star :D. It's a passion project, and I'd really appreciate any thoughts on how to improve it.",

There are load test at the bottom of the README.md Common Use Cases Staging Environment Validation. Forward 100% of production API traffic to your staging environment to ensure it handles real-world scenarios before deployment. New Feature Testing. Deploy new features to a separate environment and shadow production traffic to validate behavior without risking user experience. Database Migration Testing. Test database schema changes against real query patterns by forwarding production traffic to environments with new database structures. Load Testing with Real Patterns. Use actual production traffic patterns and volumes to load test your infrastructure instead of artificial load testing tools. API Version Compatibility. Ensure new API versions are compatible with existing clients by forwarding real client requests to both old and new API versions.",
