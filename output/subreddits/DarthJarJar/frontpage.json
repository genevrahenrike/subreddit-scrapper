      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share a take that blends fan theory, recent media appearances, and a bit of Star Wars speculation: how Disney could actually canonize Darth Jar Jar. So, most of you probably know the “Darth Jar Jar” theory—it’s been around for years. The idea is that Jar Jar Binks wasn’t just an annoying comic relief, but actually a secret Sith Lord manipulating events behind the scenes. There are tons of fan videos pointing out his suspiciously lucky moves, his strange influence on the Senate, and how he handed emergency powers to Palpatine. While obviously never confirmed, it’s become one of the most entertaining and persistent fan theories in the Star Wars community. Now, let’s talk about how Disney seems to be slowly warming back up to Jar Jar. He recently appeared as a playable skin in Fortnite, and he showed up in the LEGO Star Wars rebuild the galaxy. Of course, those appearances are far from canon—but they suggest that the character is no longer completely “taboo” in Star Wars media. It feels like the perfect moment to reintroduce him in a clever, lore-friendly way. Here’s where my theory kicks in and it’s partly inspired by a hidden detail in Andor Season 2. There’s an easter egg in Luthen’s gallery showing what looks like a Gungan skull… marked with a Sith logo. That detail felt way too intentional to be random. It planted a seed for me: what if the legend of “Darth Jar Jar” is rooted in Gungan history itself? What if Darth Jar Jar wasn’t our Jar Jar Binks but rather a historical figure from Gungan or galactic history? Imagine a new character or antagonist who draws on the legend of a Sith once known as “Jar Jar” maybe an ancient Gungan Force user who fell to the dark side. It could be a title passed down, or even a myth that turns out to be true (and explain why our Jar Jar is hated because he has the same name as a horrible person in gungan's history). That way, Disney could nod to the fan theory while giving themselves total freedom in how they present it. It wouldn’t retcon the prequels, but would allow them to play with the idea in a serious or creepy way. You could even imagine a holocron or a Sith cult referencing “Darth Jar Jar” as a forgotten master of deception and chaos. It’d be the perfect blend of fan service, mystery, and new lore—without turning the original character into something he wasn’t meant to be (at least in the official story).",

      "content_preview": "It's been three years since I've made a post. I couldn't remember my original account, so here I am on a slightly different account. I don't know what made me want to continue. Maybe just the reason that I left my commentary unfinished. I last left off with my analysis of \"Gungan Attack\" - found here: Evidence / Motives from \"Gungan Attack\" : r/DarthJarJar This is part of a larger analysis where I believe that Jar Jar Binks is Force-sensitive and a Force user - though, NOT, in fact, a Sith or Sith lord but more along the lines of a \"grey Jedi\" or someone who wields both sides of the Force for the purpose of \"balance\" to the two sides. You can find more about this idea here in a detailed analysis: More Jar Jar Theories (with Character Analysis) : r/DarthJarJar That being said, let's dive in. Jar Jar doesn't really play too much of a role in this episode, but there are a couple of interesting things that happen. One - At the very beginning, Riff Tamsin points out that two jedi, a senator, and a bumbling amphibian... \"I thought the Prince would be easier to capture than the four of you.\" Wait a minute. The FOUR? Does that mean Riff considers the bumbling amphibian (Jar Jar) an elusive capture? That's... very, very curious. I think it probably got Jar Jar's gears turning as well. This could be bad if people are onto him. But noticeably, Riff does seem to view Jar Jar as less of a threat since he puts the two Jedi in this eel prison thing, and Senator Amidala and Jar Jar are separately hooked up to this machine imprisonment. But this idea that Count Dooku at least might suspect Jar Jar (just a little) and has relayed a point for Riff to keep an eye on him gains a little more traction in another scene. He starts to monologue a bit about how he'd torture his prisoners, anyway, and that Count Dooku insists on capturing Prince Lee-Char. Then, as he's swimming around, he swims next to Jar Jar. \"And there is the slight chance that you are deceiving me...\" And it's very interesting that there's a close-up shot on Jar Jar here at the \"deceiving me\" part as he looks at Riff with a worried and slightly shocked expression. Probably wondering if his cover has been blown. It could also be a nod and suggestion from the creators of the show - \"deceiving me\" - close-up on Jar Jar Binks' face. And then Riff goes on to say: \"And holding back some information I could use.\" He's in front of Padme now. Then, he takes a bite of her helmet - cracking it and causing water to leak in. Fortunately, he is eventually led away from the, uh, torture chamber, because Prince Lee-Char has been captured. This gives the Jedi and Jar-Jar time to act. The moment Riff and his forces leave, Jar Jar immediately speaks up. \"Ani, meesa have an idea...\" He knows exactly what to do to save Padme. And yet, he holds off from doing it. This is because there might be a little too much water in Padme's helmet to try and seal it off with his \"Gungan waterproofing spit.\" He likely needs the Jedi to move the water out of her helmet before he can help. Anakin, of course, immediately dismisses Jar Jar (because he's considered \"The Idiot\" who has no good ideas and usually makes everything worse). Fortunately, before Jar Jar can say anything the other Jedi speaks up and tells Anakin they need to use the Force to push the water away from her helmet. This indirectly benefits Jar Jar because then he doesn't have to say what he was thinking (thus maintaining his covert status as \"the bumbling oaf\") while also accomplishing what he wanted in the first place. Of course, once they've accomplished their task, Jar Jar needs to get them to stop what they're doing. The Jedi believe they're doing the only thing that can keep Padme alive and are overly focused on that task. Jar Jar does not want to waste time (especially to people who aren't going to listen to him), and he doesn't want the Jedi solely occupied with saving Padme when they'll probably need their hands free later. So, in mere moments, Jar Jar suddenly shouts for Anakin to look out (a warning to help prepare Anakin) and might have done some Force shenanigans to have the eel attack Anakin. Without even missing a beat, Jar Jar suddenly spits his Gungan waterproofing on Padme's helmet sealing it and saving Padme without any trouble. I'd like to point out that if Jar Jar is a Sith as people claim, and if he's trying to push Anakin to the Dark side by causing him to lose someone he cares about (Padme), he could've easily done so here simply by NOT providing his help. And making the eel attack the Jedi - making them lose focus and increasing the water in Padme's helmet. And yet, he did not do that. Instead, he actually saved Padme's life. After that, Jar Jar doesn't really do anything else suspicious other than survive an EXTREMELY CHAOTIC AND DEADLY BATTLE where a lot of experienced soldiers (Gungan and Mon Cala alike) died. We don't see how he did this, sadly. Would've been fun. He just kind of disappears during the battle and turns up later.",

He pretends to be a clumsy person and fights in the style of Zui Quán, where you appear drunk and clumsy in order to be deceptive and unpredictable. A lightsaber form inspired by this doesn’t sound bad. Darth Domerick could also work, because Dommerik in Dutch means simpleton or idiot, which is what Jar Jar pretends to be. Would do you guys think his Sith name would be?",

      "content_preview": "The character Kosa-Yin Hadu originates from the Living Force campaign, a role-playing game setting within the Star Wars Roleplaying Game published by Wizards of the Coast. Specifically, Kosa-Yin Hadu was created by Adam Burns for The Kaluthin Are Always Greener , a 2002 adventure module that is part of the Almas, Sweet Almas trilogy.​ Maybe this Adam Burns guy was a true believer and did what he could to fan the flames of revolution? From the Wookieepedia page: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kosa-Yin_Hadu Kosa-Yin Hadu was a Gungan male Sith cult member who lived during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Originally a member of the Jedi Order, Hadu trained as the Padawan of Jedi Knight Kin-Ya Dosun, a fellow Gungan. In about 33 BBY, the pair was dispatched on a mission from the Jedi Temple on the planet Coruscant, but they subsequently disappeared. At some point, Hadu fell to the dark side of the Force and became a member of the Believers, a Sith cult that was based on the planet Almas. Circa 31 BBY, Hadu and the Mon Calamari Dark Jedi Gar Granga were sent by Garvin Delquist, the leader of the Believers, to poison Almas's kaluthin plants as part of a Believer plot to drive the Jedi—who operated a training facility on Almas—off the planet. However, the plot was uncovered by a group of freelance agents, who attacked and defeated Hadu and his Believer compatriots.",

      "content_preview": "Have not seen this idea elsewhere so I'm presenting it here. TL;DR: JarJar was meant to get cut up or fried in his duel with Yoda, and be revived as the Jedi Killing Sith cyborg Darth Grievous. This idea was instead sliced off of Jarjar during the Retcon, and presented as a new character, General Grievous. Always wondered about that character. Hardly the first Star Wars character to just pop into existence In Medias Res, run around being awesome, and die in the same film, but something about it felt weirdly hollow. Like he was meant to have something personal between him and the others, but it was just not there. This premise begins with the usual Darth JarJar idea, but moves forward to project Jarjar replacing Dooku in the final fight of Episode II. \"JarJar's Great Adventure\" was the original title and shows him to be central to the plot. In the final scenes he would be revealed as the manipulative master he always was. Anakin and Obiwan must now fight their lovable goofy friend, who continues to have \"no such thing as luck\" and whip their ass with Zi Quan including un-handing Lil Ani, woopsie! His exact same banter continues but becomes heinously evil very suddenly as it is shown to be a long con. This duel in Episode II becomes a deeply personal fight with a dark master who deceived and manipulated you before killing a bunch of your friends and setting your republic on fire with droid war. The reaction would be Stunned more than Angry, \"...Jarjar?? ...but...how?? No, that means you... you were there all along, in our minds, pushing emotions into our skulls so we'd- ...oh god\" \"Meesa thankin you muy muy for startin theessa Clone Wars. Beesa seein ya...or, would, if meesa not killin you now, woopsie!\" Only Yoda intervening stops him. Only Yoda is wise enough to not be deceived so easily by his distractions and gets the better of him. Anger then, would come later, deep and simmering, with Loss, Suffering, and a lil bit of Hate...and oh look a Sith trying to make a Jedi feel those. If Jarjar were to lose spectacularly, say, Yoda has the high ground and proclaims \"Over It Is, Jarjar,\" then Jarjar is left in tatters and pieces. Missing limbs, burnt from lightning deflection, ears mostly full of holes, pillars collapsed on him. Good riddance... Except: The single most Sith thing in Star Wars is to rebuild the defeated Sith to be More Machine Than Man. ...and what, then, does that look like? Why, here's a cyborg alien Sith right here for comparison. A Jedi killer who collects lightsabers aaaand...we've never heard of him before ever but now everyone knows him. The act of Retconjuration leaves as much as possible the same. This was a long conceived character and Lucas would preserve as much as he could. Easy path: sever the transformation story, just present The Transformed as a different guy. Occams Razor suggests that we don't need another Rando Dark Side Guy if we have a perfect specimen right here. How horrific would it be for Jarjar the lovable goofball to get Darthed and become a Jedi killing nightmare with four arms? According to the script he began Episode II able to talk normally, \"diplodialect\" he calls it, so all Grievous lines could be unaltered except for content filtering. But I imagine him fighting Kenobi and Anakin and making quips in his old dialect, but with that now modified Deep Darth Voice that General Grievous actually uses. \"Heheheh, greetins Ani, meesa sooo happy seein yousa here...howssa you mother, huh? Heheheh cough, wheeze \" Obiwan's \"Hello there!\" suddenly carries ten times the weight. And Anakin doesn't know it but when he faces Grievous, he is facing his own inevitable fate. And we now have direct investment with this character's disabilities and wheezing. We watched him get messed up. Just look into Grievous's eyes and tell me I'm wrong. Secondary result of this premise is kind of awesome: Dooku was never meant to be a Sith. Every Jedi in the script early on says \"Dooku? No way he's a terrorist, it's not in his nature.\" He has issues with the council but he's no Bad Guy. He is in fact a consummate Paladin...a better Jedi than I...and he happens to be the only Jedi who is CORRECT. The Republic IS controlled by a Sith Lord, and the whole Jedi Temple is doing his bidding. When Dooku confronts Obiwan, he says You must join me and together we will destroy the Sith!! He tells Padme the Republic is corrupt beyond saving and must be replaced, and Naboo would be welcome among them. I think in the Retconned timeline, this was played completely straight. Dooku was leading The Resistance. Obiwan now has a clue that something bad is going on, but still can't put the finger on it. Dooku in the new version then reports to Sidious that the war has begun, all part of the plan. Dooku in the original timeline is just being manipulated and deceived and it's JarJar who reports that the war has begun, in pieces on a med bed, and Sidious says \"Well done, my apprentice\" before leaving him to the Med Droids and walking away as Jarjar screams in agony. Dooku sees in Jarjar only a Secessionist Senator attacked by Sith-deceived Jedi and a powerful ally. Extrapolating forward, Episode III, Dooku captures the Sith Lord on Coruscant. Anakin sees Bad Guy Kidnaps Chancellor and attacks FULL SPEED as he does. NOW when Anakin kills Dooku, he's killing an actual Jedi...a pure and noble Paladin. The Best of them, in fact. This is SO MUCH WORSE than just killing a Sith who is a legit bad guy and morally acceptable target. It's only after Lucas casts Retconjuration on JarJar that Dooku has to become the Save What We Can and is tagged to be just another British villain, forced into the role. Now he's just another Sith to play swords with. And when Anakin kills him it's a -little- queasy but like also literally the highest authority in the land just authorized execution of a notorious war criminal and enemy leader. Meh, he had it coming.",

      "content_preview": "The orphanage courtyard on Naboo was quiet, save for the laughter of children watching the antics of Jar Jar Binks who pretended to be a clown. His exaggerated gestures and erratic movements were a familiar sight in Theed. But as the sun dipped low, two cloaked figures approached. Luke Skywalker and his sister Leia stepped into the courtyard, their presence halting the children’s laughter as an unspoken tension filled the air. Jar Jar Binks stood abruptly, his jovial mask slipping. His hunched posture straightened, his face void of its usual buffoonery. In a voice smooth and cold, devoid of the Gungan accent, he addressed the twins. “I wondered when yousa would arrive.” Luke ignited his green lightsaber with a snap-hiss. Leia, armed with her own saber—a brilliant blue blade—narrowed her eyes. “We know who you are,” she said. “The mask, the act—it’s over, Jar Jar.” Jar Jar smirked, his yellow Sith eyes glinting faintly in the waning light. He mocked them with his deceptive accent. “Over? Meesa act only just beginning. Yousa Jedi think yousa smart, but meesa been playing dis game longer than yousa can imagine.” Jar Jar extended a hand, and with a flick of his wrist, the children nearby fell unconscious, gently lowered to the ground by the Force. He stepped forward, his arms swaying in an exaggerated, drunken-like motion, feigning clumsiness even as he reached into his tunic to reveal a concealed lightsaber. The weapon’s crimson blade hummed to life, and the illusion of his comedic persona shattered completely. Luke attacked first, his strikes precise and powerful. But Jar Jar’s unorthodox fighting style baffled him. With a series of unpredictable spins and staggering sidesteps, Jar Jar evaded Luke’s strikes, using his long limbs to parry blows from seemingly impossible angles. Leia joined the fray, her movements graceful and disciplined, yet even she found herself disoriented by Jar Jar’s erratic yet calculated attacks. Jar Jar taunted them as they fought. “Yousa Jedi think yousa wise, but meesa smarter. Every stumble, every fall—planned. Meesa molded da galaxy, step by step, into chaos.” As the battle raged on, Jar Jar revealed the full extent of his influence. He admitted to engineering key events of the Clone Wars, subtly steering the Senate to grant Palpatine emergency powers, and even manipulating Anakin Skywalker’s descent into darkness. “Jedi … just puppets on strings that meesa pulled! Disgusting!” Luke, sensing the darkness radiating from Jar Jar, pushed deeper into the Force, finding clarity amid the chaos of the battle. “Your arrogance will be your downfall, Jar Jar,” Luke said. He synchronized his movements with Leia, the twins finally countering Jar Jar’s unpredictable style with their shared bond. Despite his agility and cunning, Jar Jar was not invincible. Leia’s blade grazed his arm, forcing him to retreat momentarily. He switched tactics, using the Force to hurl debris at the twins and create a whirlwind of confusion. But as he prepared to deliver a decisive blow, the young Mapo, his apprentice, stepped forward. “Master!” Mapo shouted, his voice trembling. “Why do you fight them? Isn’t this… wrong?” Jar Jar hesitated for the first time, the child’s plea cutting through his facade. Luke seized the moment, reaching out to Mapo through the Force. “You don’t have to follow him,” Luke said. “There’s another path.” In a final, desperate attempt to maintain his power, Jar Jar lashed out at Mapo, seeing the boy’s hesitation as a betrayal. But the act solidified the boy’s resolve. Mapo used the Force to shield himself, and with Luke and Leia’s help, he turned against his master. Jar Jar, realizing he was outmatched, unleashed one last burst of raw power, creating a massive explosion that rocked the orphanage. When the dust settled, Jar Jar was gone, leaving only his broken lightsaber behind. Mapo, shaken but resolute, pledged to train with Luke and Leia, vowing to undo the damage caused by his former master. Meanwhile, whispers spread across the galaxy of a shadowy figure still lurking in the Outer Rim, plotting his return…",

      "content_preview": "There's been a whole lotta (deserved) hype around Ahmed's new Mandoverse character, Kelleran Beq. You know, the BAMF Jedi who saved Grogu from Operation: Knightfall (the attack on the Jedi Temple during Order 66)... Kelleran Beq, nicknamed the \"Sabered Hand,\" was a human male Jedi Master who served in the Jedi Order. He was often assisted by the protocol droid AD-3 and the astromech droid LX-R5, and served aboard the starship Athylia. In 22 BBY, Master Beq worked in the Jedi crèche, tending to the younglings of the temple. During Operation: Knightfall, Beq successfully escaped the Jedi Temple with the aid of sympathetic Royal Naboo Security Forces members, fleeing Coruscant with the youngling Grogu. But, c'mon! Where's the love for the guy Ahmed played WHILE HE ALSO PLAYED (Darth) Jar Jar? Do you remember Achk Med-Beq, the conman? Achk Med-Beq was a human, present in the Outlander Club on Coruscant and conversing with Ayy Vida and a purple Twi'lek, when Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker showed up in pursuit of the changeling assassin Zam Wesell. Med-Beq was a known associate of Dannl Faytonni, who also attended the club that night. By the time Kenobi and Skywalker were assisting Wesell at the back of the establishment, Med-Beq and Faytonni were patrolling the second floor of the Outlander conjuring. But that's just \"canon\" so who cares? What about Legends... Achk Med-Beq was the criminal partner of Dannl Faytonni. Med-Beq was probably the more ambitious and inventive of the two. Faytonni almost ended the partnership after an unsuccessful case concerning a spice mine. Med-Beq and Faytonni fled to Coruscant. Eventually, the duo was imprisoned, but in 22 BBY they escaped from the CoCo Penitentiary via a laundry speeder, accompanied by another escapee, Llollulion. A detection message was sent, but the two crooks were once again active in the CoCo District. Faytonni had a sabacc party where the two could get uniforms of the Republic Judicial Forces. The two remained hidden for a time in the Outlander Club where female customers were lured away. When Zam Wesell was caught in the club, Med-Beq was mingling with the Twi'leks Lunae Minx and Ayy Vida. Med-Beq and Faytonni also became interested in the Swokes Swokes artist Oakie Dokes and asked Dokes to sponsor them in future projects. Faytonni was, as usual, very charming, but Dokes sensed danger. An advantage for both parties meant for a Swokes Swokes. Indeed, as much as \"wretches.\" How this deal ended was not known. Med-Beq also collaborated with the naive thief Magaloof. Together they snapped some business just Med-Beq lured Magaloof into a trap by convincing him to rob a jewelry store in CoCo Town. Magaloof the shop robbed empty but was restrained by Dannl Faytonni, who, disguised as Republic Officer, gave a sermon to the Leffingite. Magaloof hurried Med-Beq to inform him about the failed burglary, but Med-Beq had disappeared. With the spoils in their possession, Faytonni and Med-Beq went forward. In 22 BBY the two were still fleeing the Senate Commandos and still wore uniforms of the Judicial Forces. Captain Dannl Faytonni and Lieutenant Med-Beq stole the J-type star skiff of Padmé Amidala in order to escape but failed because the ship was programmed to go to the Galactic Senate upon takeoff. Achk Med-Beq striking a pose.",

      "content_preview": "Alright, when I first heard the Darth Jar Jar theory I was a bit skeptical however, after seeing the evidence I became convinced. My personal theory is that Darth Jar Jar was Lucas' original idea, but that he had abandoned by Revenge of the Sith at the latest dueto the backlash against Jar Jar (I also unfortunately don't think there are any plans to make Darth Jar Jar cannon , I feel like Jar Jar being comic relief has been ingrained in fans' minds after all these years for that to happen). But, let's say hypothieticallly George Lucas decided to stick with the idea of Jar Jar as the secret main villain, how would have episodes 2 and 3 played out? Here are my main questions and beliefs . Jar Jar's role: There is some debate about whether Jar Jar and Palpatine were co-conspirators or one worked with the other. My thoughts are this: since Jar Jar is supposed to be a counter to Yoda who is basically the head Jedi, it only makes sense for Jar Jar to be the Sith master and Palpatine his apprentice. The problem is , and this has used as the main evidence against the Darth Jar Jar theory is the Rule of Two, the idea that there can only be two Sith master and apprentice, which we see throughout the prequel and original trilogy. So then , how do we get around that? My thoughts are this, either Maul was tricked into beleiving he was a Sith apprentice or more likely, Jar Jar went against this rule, having two apprentices (one senior to the other)which would be a greater shock to  the Jedi and  the audience. I assume that Jar Jar, like in Phantom Menace would use his friendship with Anakin and Padme to manipulate their decisions. When would the reveal occur?: Since the theory postulates that the Darth Jar Jar reveal would mirror the 'I am your father' moment, which occurred in the second installment of the original trilogy  I believe it would occur during Attack of the Clones (since that is the second installment of the prequel trilogy). Also Lucas would need to give fans an explanation as to why he kept giving Jar Jar the spotlight after the backlash against him. But more importantly, how would the reveal happen? Would it be revealed just to the audience? Would someone get suspicious of Jar Jar, and then Jar Jar kill them, keeping his facade to the other characters? Or would he outright reveal himself as a Sith Lord ? I feel like it would be one of the first two, I believe Lucas would want to portray Jar Jar as a secret manipulator (also keeping the scene as Jar Jar swaying the Senate to give Palpatine emergency powers) like Palpatine but more obscure. Jar Jar would reveal himself as a Sith to the Jedi in episode 3 during Order 66 (probably sooner to Anakin). How would the Clone Wars play out?: I assume they would still occur but most likely the Separatist leaders would be different. The Darth Jar Jar theory postulates that Dooku was created as Jar Jar's stand-in. However, if Dooku was never created who leads the Separatists? Perhaps Jar Jar will take on a new junior apprentice that would take the place of Dooku. Or maybe Dooku would just be a regular politician and not a former Jedi, however, it would make more sense if the Serperatists had some force-sensitive people like Ventress (who would need a master)  to rival the Jedi. Jar Jar's fate?: My main theory after Jar Jar reveals himself to the Jedi during Order 66,  he duels his counterpart Yoda, then Palpatine  ends Anakin/Vader to kill him in order in order to become the Sith master and secure power as Emperor (maybe Jar Jar foresaw that Palpatine was going to betray him, and was going to use Anakin against him, but Palpatine somehow beat him too it). Vader would seemingly kill Jar Jar, explaining why he didn't appear in the original trilogy. However, Jar Jar would then be revealed at having survived. Midqueal series would show him manipulating events behind the scenes during the time of the Empire, and th sequel trilogy would have him as the main villain (perhaps canonizing the Jar Jar is Snoke theory) Let me know what you think about my questions, postulations, and own personal theories. I might write a episode 2 and 3 rewrite fan fiction featuring Darth Jar Jar!",
