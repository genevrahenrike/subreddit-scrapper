      "content_preview": "This is a bit wordy, but building up to what happened with this group. I felt that it’s such a great story that I wanted to write what I know about this group up to this point. Nodolly’s group was kept alive by Portia with remaining members from all streamer party, the Mountaineering Club, that disbanded after Act 3 Myunghoon (blade) and Chohong (artist) both quit shortly after and announced they won’t participate in the Kazeros race, leaving only Nodolly and Portia. They found members eventually, and named the party “로네다“ (short for Lost Ark Never Die), half jokingly because more than half of their group quit, but they wanted to keep the group alive. As the Kazeros the First race started, They progressed through gate 1 and gate 2 with respectable pace compared to other groups. At one point, they also reached gate 2-3 while there was no  first clear. Towards the end, blade and glaivier kept making mistakes at 2-3. bard was so frustrated and cried one night because they were so close but could not clear. Powder snow, who cleared the third, came as the 9th man to help shotcalling. Later the bard showed more frustration because the blade and glaivier did not improve. Portia called the bard out because the bard also died a lot. This interaction was very hostile and they ended up going offline. They got it together privately and decided to try more offline. During their offline tries, 7th, 8th and 9th clears happened in the span of 17 minutes on August 31st. This made the group become even more stressed to make it to the last place. (The paladin and bard are both college students and school is soon to start after this weekend. This was effectively their FINAL DAY). Many groups popped up showing their progress going into 2-3 (including Syla who had a great pull to almost clearing). At around 6 am on September 1st (korea time), 로네다 finally clutched the last place with the first ever hidden sidereal that no one has ever showed, which was tied to the achievement named “Friend” This honestly brought tears to my eyes how dramatic their clear was. I keep rewatching the moment they cleared, and I can’t keep myself from being so happy that their efforts did come to fruition. https://youtube.com/shorts/tNEq--YpSYg?si=9ghnuAYg8Bw_iCDT Lost Ark Never Die may have been created as a meme, but seeing that name as the last seat in the race felt so special. Thank you for everyone in that group for this insane cinema and entertainment.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I recently came back to Lost Ark after the big update, and I’m trying to figure out how to actually improve my gameplay and DPS. Yesterday I cleared NM T4 Brel, and I noticed my DPS was really close to a Valkyrie at 1680 ilvl, while I’m sitting at 1690. Here’s my uwuowo if it helps: link Right now I know I still need to work on things like gems (aiming for lvl 7s), karma, and accessories (buying high lows weekly). But my main question is more about gameplay and personal improvement: How do you personally get better at DPS during fights? Do you watch YouTube runs to learn the best timings to greed? Do you focus more on mechanics first and then optimize rotation later? Is there any point in weaving AAs between skills for Pred Slayer? I come from FFXIV, where rotations are super strict (ABC style), but Lost Ark feels way more dynamic. Should I try to stick to a “fixed rotation mindset” here, or is it better to play more fluidly around cooldowns and boss mechanics? I really love Pred Slayer’s mobility and playstyle, but my rotation currently feels like: apply synergy → dump big DPS skills on CD → fill with small skills. I’d like to know how others approach improvement, both in mindset and in practice. Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated",

I’ve seen like 5+ people here on this subthe last week already hone past 1690 and like some people in stoopz chat when they ask questions about what to do and when you check their char, it’s past 1690 Mokoko event won’t end until October so that is good enough time to invest in char like building up karma and gold for accs and stuff. Also u dont have to listen to me, do whatever you want and hope you get into groups https://youtu.be/NETgsJ66f9A?si=4p3tT-q4glWEswvC That video by stoopz will help a lot btw give it a watch! TLDR: Stay under 1689 ilvl Edit: Sorry about not explaining it clearly but I’m talking about the PARTY FINDER LEAF not the leaf next to your name when you are out in the world. There is a leaf next to your name when you are in party finder groups or when you are applying for groups party leaders will know you are a mokoko or not with that",

For me it would be: Walking through trixion for the first time after making my character in korean CBT, I was waiting for years like those ashes of creation fans and getting to finally play the game was great, the camera shots and the composition of the scenes as well as the graphics felt great. Progging Valtan: easily the best raid they've made to date, I remember joining a pug on EUW after finally getting full level 7 gems and we were all giga struggling, ended up getting the clear tuesday night after thinking we won't clear it first week. Raid felt super fair as everytime you failed it felt like your fault, no random aoe's or chip damage everywhere, hell valtan still fun to this day. Doing T2 abyss dungeons with random pugs and failing the mech constantly people arguing was giga tilting and super fun at the same time Getting the 10 clear title for brel (phantom legion commander) after weeks of constant struggle G1-G6 spam and jails and headaches My time playing on JP servers (any JP players still playing the game?), the community was super friendly, there was virtually no gatekeeping, one time I didn't understand a mech I think in oreha? And they tried their best to explain it to me in broken english until we cleared, nobody was hostile There was the classic sending よろしくお願いします！or よろ sometimes abbreviated to 4949 when joining any lobby.",

If I drop something like grudge or adre, I could get 300k out of my 20k gold. Even if I get something not that good, but still more valuable than 20k, it's a win. So did someone already calculated how much relic out of the 43 were interesting enough (>20k) ? Is it worth it to buy these if I only have like 40k unbound gold ? edit : decided I wanted to gamble because, eh, why not... got a 300 g engraving and a 20k one, so pretty damn shitty but I guess it was fun",

      "content_preview": "AGS has been posting W after W, and so in an attempt to ride some of that positive momentum, I wanted to pick one last idea that would solve one of the company's biggest pain points in the new player / player retention experience. The Problem: - Lost ark is in desperate need of giving mokokos face time with veteran players. The mokoko system \"kind of\" solves this problem, but if you look at the posts by mokokos after they lose their icon, they basically go back to getting no attention and getting gatekept. This cannot possibly be good for player retention. - Lost Ark has a lobby simulator problem. Time and time again people want to engage with the combat of the game but are either A) getting gatekept or B) spending too many hours building lobbies, failing, and recreating lobbies. Some players are afraid to apply to lobbies at all, so they just stick to solo mode. - Virtually every Lost Ark player just wants to play more of the **fun** part of the game. They want to look past progression, grinding, and all the other systems - they just want to go into a raid and blast sometimes. The Reality: - Vets don't want to waste their time with new players. Playing the game is time consuming as it is, so anything that becomes slightly inconvenient deters veteran players from interacting with the system. We have endless evidence of this - elixir nerfs, transcendence nerfs, chaos dungeon entry nerfs, guardian entry nerfs - people want more value for their time. So how do we solve all of these problems while also respecting their time? The Solution Lost Ark needs a daily roulette system. A roulette system is a match making (not gate keepable) queue system that grabs old, **NERFED** versions of raids and allows you to queue into any of them randomly - daily. Upon completing the roulette, you get bound materials. Since the materials are bound and cannot be traded, your life isn't over if you don't queue on all of your characters, **HOWEVER** it's totally worth your time and effort to do it if you want to push many characters. The progression restrictions are basically identical to an already existing system - Paradise/Hell/Crucible. Features Players can queue for rewards once per day on every character. Gates would be between \"Solo\" and \"Normal\" difficulty in terms of how challenging the content is. The gates should be trivial enough in difficulty that a few good players can effectively carry the run regardless of performance. Revives are basically infinite. On death, players eat a damage reduction debuff that persists for a few minutes to prevent inting for a mechanic. The rewards have to be competitive. They will not replace your gold earning rewards, and you have a *CHANCE* at mega juice sometimes (like an Azena Blessed Ember equivalent) just for running the raids. Any gold can be roster/character bound to prevent injection of gold into the economy. The raid is \"synced\" to that content within 30-40 ilvls. This way you aren't straight up one shotting the content, but you also are highly unlikely to be jailed with two or three veteran players. Subsequent entries (which you can do) are greatly diminished, but still provide rewards. Even if subsequent entries only gave SILVER I can name like 10 players that would spam this infinitely. Most if not all one shot mechanics are changed to only cause damage but can be resolved even if the party is failing. Utilize *checkpoints* (entire party respawns right before the mech) if it's a mechanic that new players should really, really learn. Provides a \"support aura\" that automatically gives support buffs (similar to how Solo mode currently functions) periodically to prevent awful queue times - 4 dps can still be competitive and clear the raid. You could tie the “matchmaking” button that no one uses on the dungeon finder screen into this system. That way, a player that is trying to queue into an individual dungeon would instead match into players that are queueing into the roulette system. On top of that, move the pet and mount rewards from raids like  HM Akkan/HM Kaya/HM Thaemine into this new difficulty that can be match made into so that people can easily farm it without sitting in party finder to find people to do it with.  As an aside, I really think having more sources of cosmetics that you can grind raids for would add a lot of content to the game. What This Solves: New players get exposure to veteran players. One thing that's missing in Lost Ark is new players getting side by side experience with experienced players in an environment where they can meaningfully contribute. People say “mokokos should play with mokokos” but that is nonsense. No other game segregates their experienced player base and new player base anywhere near as much as Lost Ark. Even if you do ultimates in FFXIV or M20+ keys in WoW, there is still a point in the patch cycle where you are highly likely to queue with a less experienced player. It’s an important interaction that helps new players get better - every now and then they need someone in the raid that knows what they’re doing. It lets people play the game more. Sometimes you just want to go into a raid and blast. Some people might argue that “it’s not challenging, so it isn’t fun” but that isn’t necessarily true. If you’ve played WoW or FFXIV you know it’s fun to go into lobbies as a super juiced player and run up the numbers on less geared players. That feeling is one of the main  dopamine hits in MMOs. Having a “meter” in the game later on like KR will make that experience even better. I know Smilegate doesn’t want to share meter info, but in this context showing how much DPS the top player in the raid did would give newer players something to aspire to and also let veteran players show boat a little bit. It hydrates previous raids and keeps the older stuff relevant. Plenty of people would do old raids for fun if a) it didn't take too much time and b) it wasn't piss easy. Players can see old mechanics. Currently, there is an issue where people might see a mech like Velganos in Brel despite never running Velganos. If old Vykas G1 wasn't a one shot mechanic, players could still be doing it to this day to learn the Velganos pattern for future raids. This provides an INTERMEDIATE STEP between Solo raids and Group content where mokokos can reasonably experiment without fear of failure. There are tons of players that play solo and are too afraid to ever go into group content, and this would be a smooth onboarding process for those players. I cannot stress enough how important this aspect is for the health and longevity of an MMO. Having a system like this would also take a *lot* of pressure off of people that feel like they need to make it to day 1 prog. Now you have stuff to do and you can progress at a reasonable pace with high autonomy - you don't **have** to make it to Kazeros day 1 because there's all this other stuff you can do that still moves you forward. You can take a break from the game, come back, and still have the option to queue for roulettes to help progress your character. Evidence of it Working: WoW and FFXIV basically both have this system. FFXIV's difficulties are a little more forgiving, but WoW's is also very simple to clear. In both instances they offer progression materials with diminished materials on subsequent runs. They also both break up roulettes into separate categories (Raids, Trials, Lv. 70/80/90, etc. in FFXIV; by expansion in WoW, Legion/BFA/etc). Lost Ark can do the same thing by breaking it up into major patches (Brel roulette, Kazeros roulette, etc). They also let players queue into individual dungeons but match them into people that are queuing in their roulette systems. Basically this system is exceptional for player retention and it's a healthy gameplay loop that allows players to progress without taking too much away from the key revenue streams of Lost Ark - and most of all, it would be fun. edit: As an aside, the reason I came up with this is I’m a returning player and I’m currently waiting on some friends to prog with. Until they’re actually ready, I don’t have much to do but solo raids and paradise. I would absolutely slam some roulettes every single day to kill time while I’m waiting for my static to be ready. I cannot possibly be the only person that feels that way. Right now I do chaos, guardians, and solo raids and then I’m left twiddling my thumbs. This solution is an a clear solve for giving a player like me - and many of the new players. Ao my point is the solve isn’t just for new players - it hits a lot of demographics. I’m going to be put on my unc hat for a second, but I used to ride really hard for a game called Wildstar 11 years ago. It probably had the most challenging raids/dungeons of any MMO - ever. The game was entirely marketed to the hardcore audience - so much so that barely 1% of the population got attuned for raiding, and less than .3% of the population managed to even kill a single raid boss out of the two raid tiers - and this was AFTER the number of active subscribers took a nose dive. Eventually the game entered maintenance mode and then hit end of service. My point is that hyper focusing on the highest end content is a recipe for disaster, and as a player that has parsed really well in every major MMO, it’s not worth it. You need casual content to turn casual players into hardcore players. Without it, your player base will always remain a stagnant, hyper fixated group of users with a specific ‘tism that you will literally never make happy. Making content for everyone that is accessible is the path to success for an MMO. Seeing casual content might not make every player happy, but eventually it will be veteran players’ turn to get content, too (like Kazeros TFM). I know people want content outside of raiding, and I get that. But it isn’t “one big feature” that’s going to save lost ark or bring in tons of players. It’s tons of good, smaller features - like this one - that hits both the core audience and attracts a new one. This specific one just sticks to what lost ark does better than any other game on the market, which is raiding.",

Are there any other reasons why you guys think that there are no artists in the bigger parties? Do you think that this has to be keept that way? I'll keep playing artist anyway since i find it the most fun to play, but feels bad to be the worst supp in terms of buffing. PD: im not complaining, i know artist have other strenghts like easy hp control of the party, cleanses, portals...",

      "content_preview": "The solution is YOUR Feedback towards AGS. And you rather bombard them with it quickly so we can get changes fast because Kazeros is approaching sooner than you might think. I did read some stupid comments in the other thread yesterday, but the truth is: The Smilegate director WANTS us to suffer. He fully intended for relic books to have such an abysmal droprate. When KR had their Golden Frog a while ago the market value of relic actually dropped a decent bit (AT THE START before it went up again to close it's original value before the frog). Remember that was during the same time KR also had the strike raid active for even more guaranteed relic book drops. That short time window alone was already enough for the Director to freak out on the next Livestream and tell people that he does not intend for relic books to be this cheap and will not extend the golden frog like the Strike raid. He literally said that while at the same time Grudge/Adrenaline Books were dangling between 250-300k gold each. Let that sink in for a minute what kind of ridiculous statement that is. Let me reiterate on that for a moment: In the game exist 2 types of Relic book Pouches / Drop Sources. Weighted drop pool and equalized drop pool. The golden frog in KR had equalized droprates, that means an Adrenaline book was just as likely to come out as it was to get a Necromancy book. Their current Thaemine extreme event shop gamba for Relic books is also equalized as far as I am aware. However even that is / was barely enough to even make a dent in the hyperinflated price of relic books. Every other source in the game is weighted, means which a Crisis Evasion book is much more likely to drop than any valuable engraving. All this scummy behaviour was fully calculated by the Korean devs at the start of T4. They fully intended to not have guaranteed relic book drops in the loot auctions after raids below 1700 ilvl. It is fully intended for relic books to drop in cubes with as low as sub 1.0% droprate in 1640 ilvl cubes while also being weighted towards trash books. I myself have 18000+ hours in Lost Ark now. I fully minmax everything out of my account as ethically as possible. I buy every mari lifeskilling pot since the start of T4 and do it. I play all 10 of my T4 characters fully unrested every single day. I do play the remaining 7 of my T3 characters for extra weekly silver, gems, cubes etc. I am another one of those silver billionaires. I do not bus, I do not have alt rosters or any multi account shenanigans. I swipe regularly between 200-500€ a month and as of right now I am still 30 million gold short of what I need for Relic books. (To have full Relic books on my main 6). I have enough to juice up the item level of my main characters to where I expect them to be for playing such a ludicrous amount but there isn't even anything left over to get any high level gems or Relic books to really make them pop off. You can check my Roster on uwuowo EU: Tilastra/Zerisina/Zisanya. At the current rate without ending up swiping even harder in this game I will not be able to afford these books before Kazeros drops. And that is quite a sad statement. That is without me even thinking about having another 20+ million gold for level 10 gems, or gearing my main character with High/High Accessories for Kazeros which would be another 10+ million gold, totalling a sum of 60 million gold short of what I would like to have for Kazeros. That is 12.000€ Who the fuck does Smilegate even think we are? Tier 4 has been the most and by far most predatory money grabbing shit I have seen in my gaming career ever. It is a point where I grind my stupid ass off every single day just to get pennies worth of progression in this game compared to what the endgame ceiling is (not even counting Sidereal Weapons). Regarding Paradise: Have you guys not wondered why we don't have 1700 ilvl hell keys yet? I can tell you why. It was fully intended from smilegate to NOT give us those yet despite them already EXISTING in the game files. Our goat Molenzwiebel already datamined all 6 when it launched. The 1580 Hell key reward table was only table 3 out of 6. 1640 Keys are Table 4/6, 1680 Keys are 5/6 and 1700 Keys are 6/6. And guess what? The 1700 Keys apparently contain Relic book pouches in the drop pool. https://preview.redd.it/ek5pr0alvogf1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6333b0c0ff1f0cc2243a9214a9db4e23815f2b3 The worst part is, that AGS apparently still has to cave into Smilegates demands over the calculated starving of giving out relic books. It is outright criminal for us to not get the 1700 hell keys just so us peasant players have a CHANCE to obtain Roster Bound Relic book drops. Guys it is YOUR duty to tell AGS to make changes to these systems and feed us with more sources of Relic books. I personally cannot make a feedback thread in the official discord as this clown Shieldmaiden just banned my ass back in may 2022 when I gave a polite, constructive feedback about this cringe Maykoko community Event due to it \"potentially provoking controversial opinions & toughts\". They are so worried about our progression that they are considering putting a weekly cap in how many Cube Tickets we may be able to exchange for hell keys in the August update. Please do not let them do that. We need every bit of bonus progression we can potentially carve out of them. The reality is: If we keep silent about this then we will just keep up eating shit from the Korean devs and their predatory P2W practice.",
