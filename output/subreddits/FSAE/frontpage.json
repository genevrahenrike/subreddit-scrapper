      "content_preview": "So I recently joined into a formula team and I was wondering in general the teams who participated in old events. How many members were usually working on building an EV? Mainly how do the teams usually split the members? Specifically i ask this because the team I am on has almost barely 3 to 4 people actively working only on electronics and electrical side. We are just figuring out circuit designs for TSAL, Precharge,discharge, APPS,BSPD etc pretty much almost the entire LV side. But I think this is way small of a number. So I just wanted some insights as to how many members do we realistically need working on LV side and HV side of an EV so that the work gets done with ease. I am new to all of this and the team itself formed a a few months ago. It would be helpful if Anyone who has worked in formula team previously could give the insights as to how to realistically plan team divisions and bare minimum members per team required !",

We had a succesful run and now we are optimizing the design and looking for points where we can make it rule compliant. We implement AS relay logic( when AS closes SDC and when to latch it open) using non-programmable hardware logic But after rechecking the rules and past year Technical Inspection sheet we couldn't find any rule asking us to implement a non-programmable logic also the rule which existed no longer exists(T14.4.1 from FS 2022), so now we are considering to shift this logic to software. Question 1 Is this acceptable under current rules ? Will the scrutineers object to this ? What do you guys do and what will you recommend ? Question 2: Currently our arcitecture is such that during ASB checks( intital check) if ASR presses the additonal TS activation button, the AIR will recieve ground and TS will be activated. Will scrutineers pose any problems as initial check isn't completed and TS gets activated even though we will not enter AS ready state ?",

We've previously used Carmaker but are looking to cut that tie due to the black-box nature and some future implementation goals, hence the fully Simulink-based approach. I'm having issues with the simulation rate. Our model runs on the target (speedgoat in the car) at a rate of 0.01s/step, but the integration and derivatives within, for example, the \"Combined Slip Wheel 2DOF\" model I'm using to simulate a real car environment, blow up at high tire slip. I've temporarily alleviated this globally using 0.001s steps, but any aggressive throttle or steering application blows up the simulation. I've attempted to make its parent block atomic and run 0.0001s steps, but the Fx relaxation integrator step size moves to 0 for some reason. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

The usual proccedure here is just to name the member that is going to take your place on the board, meet them once for showing what you have done and thats it. We stay in a group chat with all alumnis of our team but it is not very chatty. Why I am writing this is because the main difference with huge teams I have seen is the treatment of the alumnis. They participate in all stages of the year actively, as they even take some important decissions. So the question is, how do you treat your alumnis? How would you recommend to treat them and how use them? Thank you a lot!",

Right now, I see two options: A) Make torque distribution between driven wheels dependent on the steering wheel angle (The more you turn, the more torque the opposite wheel gets) - Easier way B) Develop a torque vectoring system...somehow - Harder way Of these two options, what do you think is the best one, and how could we achieve it if it's the second one?",

For teams that are running bored/stroked motors near the displacement limit (I was told 700cc) is the intake restriction creating any bogging/response issues at high rpm? How much performance gain have you guys noticed from bore/stroke/cam/high comp with the intake restriction? For boosted applications, has there ever been a team to run something like a fully forged and boosted 600cc sport bike motor? What sort of things did you run into with the intake and other restrictions? Lastly, what are some legendary powertrains teams have built that I should look into? Thanks!",

We’d really appreciate it if anyone could share: Any experiences using commercial inverters with Fisher motors. Recommendations for specific models or manufacturers that work well for torque/speed control and are suitable for FS requirements. Information on where to buy these inverters (reliable suppliers, FS partners, etc.). Any advice or references would be extremely helpful at this stage.
