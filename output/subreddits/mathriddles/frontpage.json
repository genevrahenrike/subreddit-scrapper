The Jesters Task Let ùëÜ be the sequence of the non-negative integers written on the cards, that is currently on the table. Set ùëñ=1, ùîç looks into his deck for a copy of the first ùëñ card(s) on the table. Whilst preserving order, he appends this copy of cards to the end of ùëÜ. Then, he erases the number on the rightmost card ùëÖ on the table, and rewrites it as ùëÖ-1. Increment ùëñ by 1, then repeat. ùîç repeats this action over and over again until he eventually writes a ‚Äú0‚Äù on the rightmost card ùëÖ.

There are only 3 sons who will inherit, and no other family members whatsoever. The problem now is that they all want whole camels and do not want to sacrifice and distribute any camel. How would they solve this distribution issue? Answer: They borrow another camel from somewhere so now the total is 18. This can easily be distributed in the fractions needed. 1/2 = 18/2 = 9 1/3 = 18/3 = 6 1/9 = 18/9 = 2 Adding them all now makes 9 + 6 + 2 = 17 So they return the 18th camel that they borrowed and now all of them have the fractions their father left for them. I cannot wrap my head around why dividing 18 and then adding them all makes 17.",

The prisoners also don't know anything about the other prisoners. Every prisoner is given a positive integer code; the codes may not be distinct. The code of a prisoner is known only to that prisoner. Their only form of communication is a room with a colorful light bulb. This bulb can either be off, or can shine in one of two colors: red or blue. It cannot be seen by anyone outside the room. The initial state of the bulb is unknown. Every day either the warden does nothing, or chooses one prisoner to go to the light bulb room: there the prisoner can either change the state of the light bulb to any other state, or leave it alone (do nothing). The light bulb doesn't change states between days. The prisoner is then led back to their cell. The order in which prisoners are chosen or rest days are taken is unknown, but it is known that, for any prisoner, the number of times they visit the light bulb room is not bounded. Further, for any sequence of (not necessarily distinct) prisoners, the warden calls them to the light bulb room in that sequence eventually (possibly with rest days in between). At any point, if one of the prisoners can correctly tell the warden the multiset of codes assigned to all 2025 prisoners, everyone is set free. If they get it wrong, everyone is executed. Before the game starts, you are allowed to write some rules down that will be shared with the 2025 prisoners. Assume that the prisoners will follow any rules that you write. How do you win?",

You know there can't be more than 20 pups in any one alley, and at least two, but those are the only averages. You ask a local, and he tells you that the no more than two alleys each, have the maximum or minimum number of pups, so only two alleys at most can have 20, and only two Alleys at Most can have two. At Least 4 Alleys have exactly 10 pups. and finally, there are no more then 150 pups in the area, that is the maximum amount there could possibly be.

On each of the four sides there are n>1 (some integer larger than 1) \"stations\" evenly spaced (the four vertices dont count as stations however the distance from a vertex to an adjecent station is the same as the distance from a station to an adjacent station). You can view these stations as points; point 1, point 2, point 3, ..., point n-2, point n-1, point n arranged cyclical around the sides of the sqaure (point 1 of top side will be on the left, point 1 of the right side will be on the top, point 1 of bottom side will be on the right and point 1 of the left side will be on the bottom) Now, you roll an n-sided fair dice ranging from 1 to n and whichever side the dice lands on you choose the respective station. You roll this dice exactly 4 times, one for each side. After you rolled the dice four times you connect these point such that a convex quadrilateral is formed (i.e connect points on adjacent sides) Question: What is the probability, in terms of n, that given the four stations the connected quadrilateral has area larger than 1/2? So the answer should be something like: Desired probability P(n) = n...(some expression). Note: I have not solved it myself (I came up with it earlier today), so I'm unsure of the level but I'm labelling it as medium for now (hope its okay that I havent solved it, but I'm interested to read your answers).",

      "content_preview": "In the indie game Undertale by Toby Fox (which you should play if you haven‚Äôt already), there is a tile puzzle in which each space has a specific rule, then a board is ‚Äúrandomly generated‚Äù (it‚Äôs not actually in game but for now just pretend). The rules for each tile are as follows: ‚ÄúRED TILES ARE IMPASSABLE! YOU CANNOT WALK ON THEM! YELLOW TILES ARE ELECTRIC! THEY WILL ELECTROCUTE YOU! GREEN TILES ARE ALARM TILES! IF YOU STEP ON THEM, YOU WILL HAVE TO FIGHT A MONSTER!! ORANGE TILES ARE ORANGE-SCENTED! THEY WILL MAKE YOU SMELL DELICIOUS! BLUE TILES ARE WATER TILES! SWIM THROUGH IF YOU LIKE, BUT, IF YOU SMELL LIKE ORANGES THE PIRAHNAS WILL BITE YOU! ALSO, IF A BLUE TILE IS NEXT TO A YELLOW TILE, THE WATER WILL ALSO ZAP YOU! PURPLE TILES ARE SLIPPERY! YOU WILL SLIDE TO THE NEXT TILE! HOWEVER, THE SLIPPERY SOAP SMELLS LIKE LEMONS! WHICH PIRAHNAS DO NOT LIKE! PURPLE AND BLUE ARE OK! FINALLY, PINK TILES. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING. STEP ON THEM ALL YOU LIKE!‚Äù Note: Green tiles in game act as a second free space, like pink. So, the question I ask is this, if we were to randomly generate a 5x9 puzzle board, what is the probability that the solution is a straight line? While the solution is a bit too complicated for me I have created a check list for what would need to be true for a straight line solution. First, check the line for any red or yellow spaces as they are impassable. Next, we should look for any orange space before a blue space without a purple inbetween. (Orange makes you smell like oranges, causing you to be bit by piranhas. Purple clears this effect by making you smell like lemons) Lastly, we should ensure that in the rows above and below the middle row, do not have a yellow space directly touching a blue space. (As a yellow touching a blue space causes it to become impassable) I really have no clue where to start with this but I would LOVE to see your attempts and feedback. (Also if someone could crosspost this to the undertale subreddit that‚Äôd be great I don‚Äôt have enough karma j-j)",

When the stream ends, output the most recent name you remembered. (I find this useful IRL to pick something at random from a list. I just repeatedly press / and rand on my phone's calculator.

He began walking at the same hour each morning, always from where he had stopped the day before - setting off each day just as the minute hand reached twelve. On the first morning, he entered the forest somewhere along its southwestern edge and walked due north, eventually reaching the northwestern edge of the forest in the early hours of the evening. He made camp there for the night. On the second morning, he walked due east, re-entering the forest and continuing until some time after noon, when he stopped somewhere within the forest and set up camp once more. On the third morning, he walked due south and finally exited the forest exactly at midnight. Reflecting afterward, he noted: On the first two days combined, he had walked 5 kilometers more than on the third. He walked at a constant pace of a whole number of kilometers per hour. Each of the three distances he walked was a whole number of kilometers. Based on his path, he calculated that the longest straight-line crossing of the forest would require walking a whole number of kilometers, and would take him less than a full day at his usual pace. What is the diameter of the forest, and what was the cartographer's pace? Assume that the forest is a perfect circle and his pace is somewhat realistic (no speed walking etc).

There, as punishment for their earthly conflict, he sentenced the twins to eternal guardianship of a great treasure they may never see or have, thus forcing them to work together in perfect equality and kinship for no material gain until the end of all ages. Mars, keeper of seasons and guardian of the mortal calendar, decreed the following: No shift may be shorter than a day or longer than two. The last two days of each week shall be entrusted to one twin alone, with the twins alternating each week. Neither twin can guard the same day of the week two weeks in a row. Subject to the rules above, the twins shall have an equal number of guard days over any given period of time. Terrified of the fate that might befall them if they fail to follow his decree, the twins asked Mars if they could turn to you for help. After some deliberation, Mars elected to address you in their stead, for the dead may not communicate with the living. He declared to you: ‚ÄúYou shall write to each twin a guarding schedule for a February that opens on the first day of the week and closes on the last. Each schedule shall be equally acceptable on its own, yet neither may be derivable from the other. You shall use only Roman numerals.‚Äù",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone üòä I‚Äôve been exploring prime number patterns and came across something curious. I‚Äôve tested it with thousands of primes and so far it always holds ‚Äî with a single exception. Here‚Äôs my personal conjecture: For every prime number p, except for 3, there exists at least one multiple of 9 (positive or negative) such that p + 9k is also a prime number. Examples: ‚Ä¢\t2 + 9 = 11 ‚úÖ ‚Ä¢\t5 + 36 = 41 ‚úÖ ‚Ä¢\t7 + 36 = 43 ‚úÖ ‚Ä¢\t11 + 18 = 29 ‚úÖ Not all multiples of 9 work for each prime, but in all tested cases (up to hundreds of thousands of primes), at least one such multiple exists. The only exception I‚Äôve found is p = 3, which doesn‚Äôt seem to yield any prime when added to any multiple of 9. I‚Äôd love to know: ‚Ä¢\tHas this conjecture been studied or named? ‚Ä¢\tCould it be proved (or disproved)? ‚Ä¢\tAre there any similar known results? Thanks for reading!",
