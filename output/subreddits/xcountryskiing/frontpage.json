We would use the trailer as a stroller and potentially bike trailer too, so it wouldn’t just be for skiing.",

The bindings are definitely cheaper and no longer move front to back for different glide. I’m now looking for a new pair and have no idea where to start. I ski without poles, so I’m definitely looking for skis that can take the brunt of the beating. Hobby skier, probably 3-500 miles a season. The shop is phenomenal but I don’t want to dash straight in there as I know they will recommend their brand. I’d like to stick around 1-1.5k probably. Suggestions?",

I live in the midwest and have access to both groomed and ungroomed property. Ideally, it would be nice to be able to ski on ungroomed farm and timberland that I have access to as well. The snow here doesn't get all that powdery or deep like it would in the mountains. More wet, or when it gets really cold, dry with an ice glaze. The terrain is comparatively gentle, rolling hills. I understand one pair of skis will be compromised in both directions here, but would something on the <68mm side work out for what I would do ungroomed? I was looking at something like the Fischer Adventure Crown 62, but would that be too skinny? especially with NNN BC? I am not particularly attached to any one ski at this point. Thanks!",

My watch is a few versions old, so maybe thats it.

Thats not a major drawback though so I mean if thats the only way than thats the only way. My strava and health app are linked up anyway, so it and apple workouts are interconnected.

I am putting together plans for a treadmill for classic rollerskiing and double poling (no space for a skating one). There is a commercial treadmill made in Sweden which claims a 1000 mm-wide belt. Has anyone used one and how easy was it to place the poles w/o hitting the non-moving part of the deck? Due to the constraints of my lathe, I cannot do a 1000 mm belt width -- the max I can do is 925 mm, preferentially narrower. Surely if one manages to stay in the middle of the belt and place the poles straight down, even 800 mm would be enough. Thoughts?",

We have a burley trailer and I would love to learn to skate ski at the Nordic areas. I have done it a few times and really enjoyed it. I’m an avid backcountry skier and really enjoy uphill skiing. My question: do most groomed ski areas allow trailers? I have not seen it on many of their websites. I saw an email today about a 2 day pass to a lot of the Nordic centers so I would be interested in keystone, breck, Frisco, gold hill, vail, CB Nordic centers. Just wanted to see if it’s generally ok before I commit to spending time at these, or figure out if a pass to one which absolutely allows it is a better bet. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I am looking to replace my iron-in glide wax. The ski shop sold me a block of Toko All-in-one Hot Wax universal together with my waxable classic skis a few years ago, but I am not happy with it. Last season I brought some friends for skiing and their skin skis that only got a 2 seconds spray-on treatment for the day by the rental shop were roughly as fast as mine which I prepared extensively the evening before. Disappointing. And yes, I brushed them thoroughly with brass, nylon and even horsehair ;) So after gathering a lot of info on this subreddit about the art of hot waxing I learned that not only grip wax but also glide wax should be chosen according to temperature and snow condition. I want to get Rex blue which a lot of you recommended and pretty much fits 90% of my skiing conditions. However, there are at least two blue gliders by Rex: NF21 Blue for 30-40€ and Glider Blue for 10€. Are they both used the same way? The Rex website says NF21 was developed as an underlayer but works well as a final layer. So is it better than the Standard Glider Blue when used as the only layer? And which one is it when you guys refer to Rex blue? I really don't mind spending more since I only go skiing for a few days a year and I recon that wax will last a decade anyways. So if I can buy myself some speed by choosing the NF21 I would happily do so. Thanks for all your shared knowledge on this subreddit, it's a pleasure to go through all those well informed and extensive posts!",

So what is it that is disliked with those? I am a recreational classic skier and those poles are probably unnecessarily high end for me but as they are on sale and only barely more expensive than the Quantum Q1 that I wanted to get originally I figured why not get something better. But if the quick release does not work well I might reconsider and get something else since that feature seems to offer a lot of convenience.",

I started xc skiing this winter and loved how fast skate skiing is so I started doing that. Since we had such a bad winter, there was only snow for 3 weeks. I used to ski for 1-1,5h for a distance of 10-20km. I have been very active my whole life with different activities. At the moment I train 5-8h per week, with 3 x Gym and 3-5h of endurance training. I have also done a few half marathons with times of 2:05 and 1:50 So do you think I will be able to complete the 62km race in february with my background or should I choose a shorter distance?

      "content_preview": "First, let me say earlier this year I was ragging broadly on aluminum rollerskis. Over the last two years I've primarily been opting for carbon/composite rollerskis over my aluminum ones. Well, a month ago I was having some challenges with tracking(including a wicked spill) on my go-to carbon classic rollerskis after changing wheels and decided to bite the bullet and get some IDTs that despite being aluminum get rave reviews for feel and most importantly given my recent experiences - tracking. First, let me say that the IDTs completely live up to the hype on the tracking front. They were perfect out of the box. Second, I don't know what kind of potential damper that may live between the fork and shaft connection but for all aluminum skis they aren't as harsh and buzzy as other aluminum classic roller skis that I've used. They do not have a cambered kick-like up/down compliance which my skigo carbons have but I would say I prefer the IDT rollerskis to the skigos. They track beautifully, feel nice and more stable, and just damp enough over bumps. I will say, the IDT standard 2 wheels are a touch fast for my tastes. I'm averaging 6 minute miles and even quicker on even moderate workouts. And ever since my spill I've been taking even gradual downhills easy. Finally, a question. With about 250 miles on them the rear wheels on my IDTs are starting to wear in line with the road camber (about 80% of my skiing is on streets; wear is more on the left than the right for both wheels). I suspect in two-three more weeks, new wheels will be not just needed but even possibly overdue. The fronts look pretty good on both. This was similar to my experience with the skigos too, that the rears wore substantially more than the fronts. On that note it would be potentially nice to use a slow ratchet wheel up front(which will be softer) and a medium freewheel in back to make the replacement costs sting less. Anyone else switched the ratchet wheel to the front on IDTs? Any feedback?",

      "content_preview": "One thing I've been historically told by coaches over the years is \"Don't lift too heavy, low weight high reps, only do body weight workouts, don't wanna get too heavy\" etc but why? I myself am a pretty lean dude, I don't think building up too much muscle is gonna suddenly make me snap poles or completely die on the first uphill of a sprint. I understand that you'd wanna cut back on hitting the gym during race season, don't wanna burn out muscles and especially not on race days. But why not in the off season? Surely having more strength to lend to pushing could help you reach further with each stride, in either technique. Is there a scientific reason why endurance athletes shouldn't be too jacked or is it purely some sort of wives tail thats just been passed on through generations of skiers? Of course everything in moderation, but I don't understand why strength training should be treated more like stretching rather than actually building strength lol.",

      "content_preview": "Do I use the same size poles on skis? I assume rollers are a little higher off the ground but then the tip doesn’t dig into the snow— does it even out? That sure would be convenient. We have a variety of swix, Rossi and atomic poles and the Swix tips seem to come off really easily and can be swapped to carbide tips. I haven’t figured out the others yet. Am I on the right track with the Swix tips being the easiest ?",
