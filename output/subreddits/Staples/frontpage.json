I don’t have a back up job and the job market in my city is crazy right now, but I couldn’t handle Staples anymore. Everyday it’s the same thing. I’m a Print & Services Sup, and the demands of the store were insane. Every associate has to reach a certain goal for Sales, STPPs, BTS donations and specific sales, Tech Easy, etc. A high, unachievable number. The amount of responsibility on my shoulders to make certain numbers was overwhelming. I was asked to micromanage my print team, which I absolutely despised, and to fix all the issue and know everything that was going on around the store. Mind you, I never had formal training for my position, I was hired with no experience and expected to perform like a pro. If I didn’t, my GM wouldn’t talk to me, or even say hi when I came to the store. They were always on a bad mood, and no matter what I would do, they’d always be displeased with me. Asking me to floor lead a certain area, but getting mad if my print team needed me and I had to prioritize them (I AM THE PRINT SUP!). I have so many stories of how badly I was treated by my management team and the customers. I’ve cried twice on the job, for a total of 5 seconds, before having to put myself together to go back to the floor and lead the team. I am so happy to be free of this. The next two weeks will be a breeze, I’ll keep giving my best, but there won’t be any real pressure. Now wish me luck, please. To a better job! 🥂",

      "content_preview": "I need advice on what to do, or if I should do anything in regards to leaving. For context, I started this job in print about a month ago and still have yet to complete my online training. When my print supervisor is not there I ask another supervisor who occasionally works in print what to do. A majority of the time he will completely take over what I am doing and will not show me how to do it. And times I am over in print center alone. I tried to call him to ask for help and he takes 10 to 15 minutes to come over and help while he sits in the office and does nothing. It is apparently known by all employees and our UPS driver that this employee does nothing. I mean literally nothing. The only times I ever see him out is if he is helping somebody with tech if he's going on a smoke break which he takes about every 40 minutes and comes in reeking of cigarettes or if he's going back into the office. And to top it all off today, I was told that I was about 55% for rewards when I'm typically around 70%. I was told that when I'm checking people out at the register, I'm to tell them that I'm doing a system update when in reality I'm typing in their information to set them up for the rewards program. It feels scummy and I don't care for it, if people don't want to do the rewards program, why do we push it so much. Our store is in shambles and I've only been here for a month and can see it clearly. What should I do🥲",

I'm the sole TSA backup in a store where the agent has missed over 170 hours due to call or our requests of in 2 months, the only one that really knows the tech dept. Been getting used to cover shifts in Copy & Print when there is no coverage. And all this as an RSS. Today I put in a request for PTO requesting to use pto for 5 days the week of 9/27 and 4 days the following week seeing as i have nearly 70 hpurs accrued and BTS will be over by then,  only for him to tell the copy sup that he has making the schedules to deny my request and then told me he wants me to push it back by month because the store can't spare me. Which prompted me to argue that I'm hearing I'm both too important to be away from the store yet also not important enough to afford a raise, which apparently the two are separate topics and thus means in going off topic.  As a result I've informed him there will be no more asking me for more hours beyond my schedule, no favors, or helping beyond what is required of my job. End of the day I know it's just proof of how little the company thinks of it's employees and I need to use this as fuel to find a new job but until one pulls through am I being unreasonable or asking too much?",

I remember that little cutter machine used to slip and struggle and jam up on double sided cards all the time. Our tech when I worked copy and print would come in and grumble that the machine isn't meant for double sided on coated stock, clean the rollers, adjust the tension, and leave, and it would work for a few days then start cutting crooked again. I promoted myself to customer a few years ago and I know they've made a lot of changes, many for the worse. But did they get that little cutter replaced in most stores or is everyone still stuck with it? Honestly I would just use the big cutter and I had programmed in cuts for bleed and no bleed cards, it was always better than that little cutting machine. Of course, obviously I know keep shit away from the edges, DOUBLE so on the back, and don't expect it not to be slightly crooked, you're using glorified copiers, not a digital press with offset registration calibration built in. (Man I remember those customers. \"Why isn't it perfect? It's done by machine not by hand!\" To which I look at the sad little color xerox machine and whisper to it \"it's ok, you tried girl, you tried, ignore the mean woman at the counter\") So yeah, my last minute ass doesn't expect perfection, just wondering if I'm still going to be compensating for that little disaster cutter.",

      "content_preview": "On God I don't know how much more I can handle. This year has been horrible and I've been really struggling with my mental health. This past month or two has been just horrible for me, especially the last two weeks (more like last year and a half but who's counting). (I PROMISE THIS ISNT ME RANTING ABOUT RETURNS MODS I SWEAR PLS i know about the new post system 😭) I work in print and I feel like all I ever do is returns and managing the registers or handle calling, binning, or taking over small jobs once I get there bc my sup. Tells me to. \"Rewards have gone down in print, lets bring it back up\" I go: I haven't been able to work Print in weeks besides a few small walk in jobs. I've been able to sign tons of non-print people up though because Back To School so I thought I'd hear something about that. Last night a priority customer came in and  so I finally get off of the return/register area to help them (never worked with them before) and the first thing they tell me is that they were looking for a sign of this material (the standard yard sign material) and I nod and go \"we can go those. Let me pull it up on the sight\" and I start asking them questions about the size and stuff and if they were looking for the yard signs. I show the screen and mention that the size they mentioned wanting for the yard sign wasn't avaliable and immediately the customer starts to yell at me telling me \"Don't start this with me. Check your site again because we've made these signs plenty of times\" and goes on with these demands and so I'm just kind of stunned by the sudden aggressive attitude because I was only just clarifying if they had wanted a yard sign since they just stood there and stared at the screen with the sign instead of responding to me. Then they had the audacity to go \"Sorry for getting sassy with you\" multiple times along with some other words, but obviously they didnt mean it, like yeah. Sure buddy. Normally I think I could've come back from it if it wasn't for the fact this kind of treatment from customers had been happening for the last couple of shifts that I've had, and before the customer had come in and I think I just reached a breaking point after that where I was just emotionally numb the rest of the shift. I was stuck in the bathroom contemplating my life for I don't really know how long trying to calm down. Unfortunately that wasn't all that happened that shift, but at this point I'm not surprised about what happened and how it went down and I'm not really pressed about it anymore because of how often it happens. Management can handle it. I just genuinely don't know what to do because I like my team I work with even if at times some of us get on eachothers nerves at times, and I like working print as I feel like I'm good with it and its something that I can sort of use my actual talents for. I just feel like I can't do anything right and no matter what I do it's not really appreciated or making people happy. I'm really trying my best I really am. I don't think it helps that my childhood dog died last month and I haven't really taken any time off besides the days off I've been given. I've scheduled for a few days off in September though, so I don't know if maybe I should wait and see how I feel after those days away. I don't know. I think I might just be burnt out because I'm having more bad days than good ones anymore. Any advice would be appreciated on what to do in my situation.",
