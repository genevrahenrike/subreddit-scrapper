Donovan Larrick, 16, lost his father overseas before he could walk. Kit Ketrey, 17, lost his mother to a heroin overdose. They work the counter at a failing pawn shop in small-town Georgia and keep the lights on with side hustles: fake jewelry, skimmed cash, unregistered pistols. At night Donovan sits on Luna’s porch, trying to save enough to move her out of the abusive house she is trapped in.The contract. Kit prowls shady forums from the shop’s back office and finds Nico Riggs’ post: $5,000 to kill Vicki Ramirez. It is sloppy and bitter but real. Terms are simple. A small crypto amount sits in escrow. The rest releases only after proof of death. The client wants Vicki’s phone and a photo of a playing card laid on her body as confirmation. Kit argues for walking away. Donovan sees five grand and a way to get Luna out.Vicki had a life insurance policy, and Nico saw her death as his only way to get back the money she’d taken in the divorce.The plan. They decide to stage it as a burglary. Stolen car. Gloves. A .38 revolver for noise control and a 9mm as backup. Tuesday night, because Vicki usually gets home from the salon late. They cut the breaker to kill lights and cameras, take the phone, drop the card, and go.How it goes bad. Vicki is not alone. Her boyfriend has two friends over watching a game.The doorbell camera has a battery, so cutting power does not blind it. It records their faces in partial profile and the stolen car’s plate fragment.A neighbor hears a struggle and calls 911. Patrol cars roll early.Inside, the boyfriend rushes Donovan. The .38 misfires on a bad round. In the scramble Donovan switches to the 9mm and fires. One friend tackles Kit. A second shot ricochets and kills the wrong man. Panic spreads.Vicki bolts for the kitchen, grabs a knife, slashes Donovan’s arm. Kit shoots her. She drops, gasping. Donovan sets the playing card and takes her phone because the forum requires both.They flee and drop a glove in the yard. DNA sits in the grass, and the doorbell camera has them anyway.Vicki is dead, but this is no “clean” hit. It is a triple collateral homicide on top of the target. The news calls it a massacre. The forum moderators freeze the escrow when the story breaks statewide. Payment is locked. Nico kills his account. There is no payday, only a manhunt.Escape. The doorbell video and a traffic cam caught their stolen Civic.A gas-station camera shows Donovan buying gauze and hydrogen peroxide with his cut arm twenty minutes after the murders.The 9mm casings match ammo Kit resold out of the pawn shop lot the week before.Detectives start canvassing the strip mall. Someone recognizes Donovan and Kit.They will be in cuffs by morning if they stay. They take cash from the safe, ditch the Civic, hop on a freight train and head west.The road. Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana. They change cars often. They lift wallets at truck stops and hand the cash back if there are kids’ photos inside. They sleep in foreclosed houses, they hitchhike, crash nightclubs, hop freight trains, and dodge law enforcement at every turnMorgan. Night has fallen, and Donovan and Kit leap from the slow-moving freight train onto the gravel shoulder, their legs burning, arms scraped, hearts hammering. Blood and sweat streak their clothes. They hitch a ride on the side of the Alabama highway, thumbing down a beat-up Honda. Morgan pulls over. She sees the cuts, the terror, the look of two kids who’ve been running too long, and doesn’t ask questions. She lets them in.Inside the car, the hum of the engine masks quiet laughter and whispered lies. For a moment, the world feels normal, almost safe. They talk, smoke, and breathe in each other’s company as if the night will hold them. By dawn, Morgan drops them at a roadside motel without a word. She leaves only a map marked with backroads and a trace of human kindness before vanishing into the shadows.Billy. In the streets next to a casino, Billy Tran stumbles in with a duffel and a tail. He has ripped a rigged dice game and owes the wrong people. Donovan and Kit corner him, expecting an easy score. Billy tells the truth and offers the car, the cash, and himself. By midnight the three of them are flying down empty streets like idiots who think speed is freedom.Pressure. Lafayette. Fake IDs, a packed club, \"What is Love\" on the speakers, a breath of air that almost feels like life. Then reality returns. A stripper’s keys become their next getaway. Headlines multiply. Four dead in Georgia. Two juveniles wanted. Police warn they are armed and desperate.Who is on their trail. Ulrick Birch, a private investigator hired by Vicki’s sister, tracks the darknet post through a cached image and public-library Wi-Fi near the pawn shop. He tips a task force and follows the boys’ wake of stolen cars and gas-station footage.Loris Delmar, a bounty hunter working a separate job, is after Billy on a skipped bond tied to the casino scam. Loris does not care about the murders. He cares about bringing Billy in. Their paths lock together once Billy rides with the boys.Local and state police coordinate as the doorbell footage circulates. The case is no longer a whodunit. It is a dragnet.A dark, tender, and violent journey through love, loyalty, and loss.",

I’ve been writing screenplays for 5 years now, sending out queries, cold emails, doing everything I can to push my scripts into the world, and usually, like many of us, it goes nowhere. But recently, I took a shot and cold-emailed some high-profile actors (through their reps), pitching a story and some key roles. I figured, what’s the worst that could happen? It goes ignored, nothing new there. But then, I actually got ayes. Then another. And another. Multiple big-name actors (through their reps) said they were open to reading the script. I won’t name names or share details, it’s still early and I don’t want to jinx it, but for the first time, it feels like I might be getting somewhere.I just wanted to share this moment with people who would get it.

      "content_preview": "Last weekI posted an open invitefor anyone to share 10 pages of their script with me on the promise I’d provide feedback. Although I underestimatedhow manypeople would take me up on the offer, I focused on getting through the stack.If you sent me your pages, thank you. While the strength of what I read varied, most everything had something I enjoyed or otherwise found interesting.I’ve a few stragglers still (please, please check sharing permissions when passing along a Google Drive link), but now I’ve read everything available, I’ve some observations to share. Hopefully these thoughts will be of use to some - particularly fresher screenwriters who are still finding their feet.EDIT:I’ve had multiple DMs asking me for new reads. I’m truly sorry, I can’t take on new scripts at this time. I wish I could, but I just don’t have the bandwidth.Your story starts on page one.I read multiple screenplays that opened with the trope of a protagonist being woken by an alarm or their ringing phone. These “ordinary world” scenes should serve to set up something about the main character and their life, but too often writers seemed to not know what to do or say on these pages. Instead, they meandered until it was just the right point in the day for the VERY BIG THING to happen.What would have served these pages better is starting with a bold cold open, or even just putting the inciting incident right up front. Basically, bring the audience in when the story is happening.Readers need to see characters in the mind’s eye.So many scripts introduced characters by name only. No age, no trait - nothing to anchor them in the reader’s head.A few screenplays didn’t introduce players, instead opting to have someone just appear out of nowhere and start talking. And I don’t mean an off-screen character who is later introduced in a line of action, but rather someone would just materialize as if they’ve always been there. When that happened, I had to scrub back through the pages to see if I had missed something.Remember, the writer has an obligation to properly present who and what makes up the story.Overly dense actions are a drag.I read way too many action lines (paragraphs, really) where this happens, then that occurs, followed by this other thing, plus that, and then another character does a thing… I did not enjoy reading them.Use negative space if you want to keep the reader engaged.Metaphors and similes require skill.A fair amount of writers used metaphors and similes to punctuate their action lines. While some used them to elevate their voice, others fell into the trap of thinking such toolsaretheir voice.When just about everything is compared to something else, the story becomes swamped by unnecessary details.Great writing makes for an easy read.The best 10 pages were easy to sink into. Those writers knew to only put on the page what was necessary to make each moment pop. More often than not, sentences were spare and each word was well-chosen.Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the comedies I read were particularly good at this. As someone who rarely works in the genre, it was a reminder of how disciplined such writers can be at making sure not a single line goes to waste.You must execute on your opening 10 pages if you want your reader to care about the remaining 100.In my sittings, I only read 10 pages - even if someone sent me their full script. Therefore, I can’t say whether any of them were great screenplays as a whole. But the few with truly excellent openings? I definitely wanted to read more.If the first 10 pages of your script aren’t up to scratch, there’s little incentive for a reader to stick around. Sure, a readermightgo through all of it because they’re obliged to, but don’t be surprised if they seemingly only skim the story or miss key details; having to drag your attention through a rocky opening makes it very hard to engage after that.",

      "content_preview": "Well well well, another year, another few hundred scripts read for the Austin Film Fest. Last year’s post seemed popular enough to warrant another go at it, so I’ve compiled a few more thoughts on this year’s entrants.Put yourself In the shoes of the audienceIt’s been said before to write the movie/show you would want to see, and there’s a lot of truth to that, but don’t forget that, ideally, people who arenot usare going to watch this someday. I’m not talking about trying to generalize for the lowest common denominator, which I think has been an ongoing Hollywood issue, I’m talking about closing your eyes, imaginingyouare a person who just saw what you wrote, and telling their friend about it. If they’re excited about what they saw, why? How would they describe it? Can they easily explain the premise without thinking about it too much? Are there moments that will make them excitedly say “what the fuck??” out loud in the theater? Will people be leaning back in tension during a scary moment and letting out a huge, stress-relieving scream when the scare happens? Do they need a little nudge to help them understand the plot? I personally get very excited while watching my own work through the audience’s eyes, it helps make writing feel more active and less like I’m just getting through the required pages.Transitions make a huge difference.It’s something not talked about enough when discussing writing “craft,” though Craig Mazin has mentioned it on his Scriptnotes podcast. It’s incredible how many scenes I would read that just end with no notice, we’re simply not in that scene anymore. Transitions help us know what and how to feel from scene to scene, and they don’t always have to be a big moment or anything, but even just noting a look from a character, a question, or an action, can make a big difference. Often scenes or sequences would end on a line that seemed kinda innocuous, something that didn’t leave me feeling anything in particular. If we were watching this, it’s just like the editor decided “we’re done here” and the next scene would begin. Similarly to the previous note, really close your eyes and watch your movie, did the scene really cut away the moment someone said their line, or was there an extra beat of the other character reacting? It’s one of the reasons why folks will recommend reading novels from time to time, because novelists know they need to end their chapters in a way that clearly feels like we’re wrapping up a moment before moving us on to the next chapter. Speaking of which…Act breaks mean something.I read a lot of pilots that included act breaks, mostly 5 acts, some only 3. Those act breaks you’re including in the headers aren’t just there as decoration and they aren’t there as some sort of symbolic formality. In fact, the act break heading isn’t the thing that should define an act break at all, the action within the script should do that on its own.If you removed the act break headers altogether, a reader should still feel them, meaning what’s happening in your story should define an act break, not a page number. So many pilots this year had act breaks that were simply there because “this is roughly the page where an act break should go,” but there wasn’t any evidence within the story that we were breaking from one act to another. You can borrow and re-use whatever structure you’d like, but an act break needs to be defined by something we can feel, a change, a decision, a betrayal, a discovery, SOMETHING. This goes with features as well, of course, but typically writers weren’t including act break headers within their features.Prove your plot to the readerIf your character is upset with their love life, feeling lonely, etc., and desperately wants a change, they can’t also be turning down dates left and right. If your character is a standup comedian and they’re hoping they’ll win a standup competition, they need to be incredibly funny. If your character is a detective, and they’re the best at what they do, we need to see them do some mighty fine detective work. There were several scripts this year that basically presented a world with no evidence, or loose evidence at best. It would be like saying your character is the best speller in the world, and their example is that they can spell “irregular.” This kinda extends to the “show, don’t tell” rule, where the worst examples are someone telling us something about the character but not actually showing us anything to prove that. It would be as if GOOD WILL HUNTING had people telling Will he's a genius and never letting us see him writing those iconic equations.Your characters don’t have to be “likeable,” but they do have to beinteresting.I think most would agree that “make your character more likeable” is an awful note. Your character can be a good person and do good things, but that’s not necessarily what makes a good character. You can have a character who hates everyone, a complete misanthrope, someone who would rather kick a cat than to save it, but if you make theminteresting,you’re on the right track. I read a script where someone hated their family and constantly made fun of them, but they were stuck on a vacation with them. They were cruel, unfunny, over dramatic, and whiny,and if they were interesting that would all be forgiven. But they weren’t, they brought nothing to the plot with them, never changed, they weren’t hiding anything, there was nothing bigger under the surface, they weren’t even particularly good at anything, yet somehow they were the center of attention during every scene and someone else fell in love with them immediately,and I had no idea why.In AS GOOD AS IT GETS, you’ve got an OCD-laden, misanthropic, bigoted sexist, and he hates dogs. Not very \"likeable\" at all. But you know what he is?Interesting.He’s an incredibly talented writer, there’s some deep hurt underneath him, and he’s willing to go to extreme lengths just to keep what he considers “normal” in his life. Another character I read was the favorite cowboy in town. He helped everyone, looked up to by all, he was the best shot (we only know that because another character told him that),and he was unbelievably boring.We never got to see how he made decisions, what he struggled with, or if he was particularly good at anything other than pleasantries. Likeable as it gets, not interesting in the least. If you’re at a complete loss at how you can make someone more interesting, just make them very good at something, and then take that thing away. At minimum you’ve got someone who stands out and now needs to relearn how to do what made them interesting in the first place.Context goes a long way.There were a number of scripts this year where a protagonist was going through a major life change, like the death of a parent, a divorce, or maybe being contacted by aliens. Great! Throwing a life-altering wrench at your protagonist is an awesome way to tell a story. The problem is these things all happened before the story began, and without any sort of understanding about who a protagonist was before these extreme events, it’s hard to tell how things have changed for them. MARRIAGE STORY starts in the middle of their divorce, but we're given an incredibly useful \"what I love about ____\" scene that shows everything we need to know about what's at stake with their relationship. Lots of rom-coms take the short cut of “hard working protagonist comes home to find someone fucking their spouse in the first 3 minutes,” which is obviously overdone, but it comes from a place of understanding that it helps to glimpse what “normal” looked like for their characters before the meat of the story really begins. It’s not a hard and fast rule by any means, but it does require a bit of nuance when determining when and how to pull the rug out from the audience. Speaking of which…Don’t hide the wrong thing.This is going to sound pretty specific, but I wouldn’t bring it up if it didn’t come up in more than one script. Imagine if the pilot for the show GHOSTS withheld any sense that the people Samantha is seeing are ghosts, and we’re left to wonder who the fuck all these people are? Or if it withheld that she had her accident in the first place, but there are just ghosts around. It would make for a confusing watch. Yes, we could consider watching the next episode to get some answers, but these aren’t the answers we should be asking for. Take a pilot like LOST, which is a show all about asking questions and teasing out answers (whether you liked the conclusion or not). They knew what to present to you in order for you to watch the next episode.But let’s pretend they hid the wrong thing; what if they withheld that the characters were on a plane at all, and instead we just picked up with them navigating the island with no mention of how they got there? The audience would feel something was missing, like the filmmakers forgot to tell us a crucial part of the joke for the punchline to make any sense. This is what I read in more than one script. There was a mystery here, but it was the wrong mystery.Don’t blow your best setups on the pilot.So many pilots this year had the potential for some really good set ups that could be paid off mid season or later, like a wife meeting with a divorce lawyer but having second thoughts and a husband secretly taking a mortgage out on their house but backing down at the last minute. By the end of the pilot, this information is revealed and dealt with, water under the bridge, and the plot will moved on like nothing ever happened. It’s such a waste of a set up that could make for some incredible drama down the line, and may very well be the secret weapon you need to keep your series going. If your sci-fi character has a robotic arm and doesn’t talk about it, you really don’t need to answer that in the first episode, that can be a big character moment for them that you can build toward. Imagine if Jaimie Lannister had a heart-to-heart with Ned Stark at the end of the GOT pilot about the truth behind his assassination of the Mad King. Sure, that’s interesting stuff, but instead we get an insane amount of character development from Jaimie through 3 seasons until he’s at his lowest before he reveals his feelings to Brianne. Don’t waste a setup like that.Why now?Your plot can’t begin simply because the protagonist decided it should (I read a script that included the protagonist saying “Or maybe… it’s time I make a change?” in the first page), it should be something that happens organically, even better if your protagonist is at odds with it, that way they can choose to become a part of the plot themselves. If you really want to write a series about a young person working in a retirement home, and your pilot is their first day, it shouldn’t be just because they woke up that day and said “you know what? I’m going to work in a retirement home.” There needs to be something that brought them there. Do they have a grandparent who doesn’t remember them, and this is how they get to keep an eye on them? Is this court mandated? Maybe a way to get closer to someone they have a crush on who works there? There's a million ways this could go, as long as the reason why it's happening WHEN it's happening in the script feels like something we can sink our teeth into.Things just happen.Recognizing this early will go a long way for scenes that would benefit from some added tension or drama (it works for comedy as well, but we'll get there). Often in these scripts, a character would be put into a situation where they would need to perform an action (rob a house, fix a car, steal a book from a library, feed their friend's fish, whatever) and they would simply... do it. Things would just happen, and then they would be done. Not every scene needs to be a complicated set piece, of course -- your protagonist ordering a coffee doesn't need to be a whole thing (though what/how they order can say something about them, as long as it's not yet another 40+ man ordering a black coffee from a Gen Z-er who has no idea what they're talking about) -- but you don't want to miss an opportunity to really earn the ticket we're potentially paying to see your work. If Character A breaks into Character B's house to steal the Macguffin, and later on Character B finds out they were there, that's an example of \"things just happen.\" Character A set out to do a thing, they did it without much hassle, and later Character B learned about it. Fine, that is undeniably plot. But if you're writing a thriller, you have a chance to take advantage of the genre you're writing in. Character A can break into Character B's house, and right when they find the Macguffin Character B can come home early, BUT set Character A in a part of the house where they have no idea Character B is home, and don't let Character B find any evidence that anyone's in their house at all. THEN you've got the audience in the palm of your hand, because they're the only people here who know that both of those characters are in the same house at the same time. You can then tighten that screw to your heart's content, letting those two characters get closer and closer to discovering each other, before you finally release us and allow Character A to escape.So what about for comedy? Say your protagonist has a big date, but they get diarrhea in the middle of it (we all remember ALONG CAME POLLY, I'm sure) and needs to leave. That's a scene where things just happen. Yeah you shook things up a little, and it's humorous, but this can be taken further. Remember that writing is often about challenging your characters and giving them a chance to show who they are through how they face (or don't face) a challenge. So what can we do here? We can start by giving the protagonist diarrhea BEFORE they've arrived to the date, so we already have that bomb ticking by the time the scene starts. Now every move they make, every word spoken, is going to come with the added stakes that they might shit themselves. But we're not done, because this is about challenging your characters, and a big thing that can help define your characters is to be specific. So you make them a medical professional, maybe a nurse in training, or an EMT, and their date knows that. You give this medical professional diarrhea before they get to the date, watch them sweat as they desperately attempt to get through it... and then have the person at the table next to them start choking.Now you've got a medical professional on an important date, desperately trying not to shit themselves, and suddenly they have to choose whether or not to give the Heimlich maneuver to the person next to them because if they do they will absolutely shit themselves.This is how you take advantage of your genre and ensure that things aren't \"just happening.\"Honorable mentions:- Read your script OUT LOUD to catch mistakes.- \"We see/hear\" is perfectly fine. If it's good enough for David Koepp, it's good enough for you.- The viewer can't read your script, don't depend on action lines to describe what can't be seen.- You might not be able to describe a thought, but you can describe a reaction.\"What the hell?\"in italics, for example.- Speaking of which, generally, if it helps tell your story without breaking screenwriting logic, go for it.- Spacial awareness within a scene is very important. Where are characters in relation to each other? Who's there at the top of the scene?- Don't get caught up in prose. Describing exactly how the sun is feeling on the skin of your protagonist should be rare.- Unless it defines their character, or is important to the scene, leave the wardrobe descriptions out, these get exhausting to read.- Keep the parentheticals of a character intro brief, and generally stick to what we're seeing or feeling about a character. \"She is the most popular girl in school but deep down she feels a little shy, especially since her dad left her mom and everyone knows\" is a no-no.- Be smart about what's possible to film/animate. \"His skin is also paper but doesn't reflect light\" is already too difficult to imagine.- Don't get too caught up on hyper-specific physical descriptions of actions. For example, \"she leans on her left arm with her elbow on the table and rests her head in her palm while she holds the phone with her right hand against her ear as she listens...\" is way too much. Leave that for directing.- Unless this is your shooting script and you're going over it with your DP, please leave specific shot choices out unless it's really important. Occasionally mentioning something like \"CLOSE ON HANDWRITTEN NOTE\" or \"EXTREMELY EXAGGERATED DUTCH ANGLE\" is fine if it helps tell the story, otherwise save it for your storyboards.BONUS (I'll keep updating this as more comments/observations come in):- I genuinely believe that every writer should work as a reader once in their life. You might never want to read a script ever again, but it will be an invaluable tool to give you insight into how others are writing, what mistakes they're making, and what separates a script you enjoy from one you don't. Not everything that makes a good script good or a bad script bad are very obvious, so this is incredible practice for recognizing what's working so it becomes second-nature.- I read 4 scripts this year where an inheritance came with an ultimatum. Not sure what to take from that, but clearly there's something in the air about that as a topic.- There were a LOT of scripts that reference TikTok, influencer culture, Gen Z slang, etc. There's nothing inherently wrong with this at all, and if that's the culture you can confidently write about then go ahead. Keep in mind that your scriptwillbe dated within a year or two. What seems topical at the time of writing it could be far in the rear view mirror culturally by the time something is produced, so just be aware of how quickly times change and don't get hung up in trying to chase something that seems relevant now.",

I had my laptop, inspired me to just do it. In the 2.5 weeks, I knocked out 88 pages and when we got home, I finished it... 125 pages. The next day, just started typing away and the flow and organics another one came about.  123 pages. I have no idea if they are good, it made me laugh along the way. My wife laughed at me laughing at myself, which is always rad. Found this subreddit and decided to join to take this stuff to the next level. I was and still am nervous as all hell, posting here right now, I posted in the Thursday 5-page Weekly Thread.

They thought these were credible and sent them to the mod team presuming guilt. Another user whose demands they shared was removed two years ago for misconduct that included hateful remarks about people with mental illnesses.They then engaged in strange, contradictory messaging by writing notes praising the moderation team and the subreddit--then immediately following them with wall of text complaints from banned users that Reddit has not seen fit to restore.This team of 5 active moderators works together. Anyone who wants to moderate this subreddit must actively be involved--not passive and disengaged for half a decade. We never take complaints private. We do all our collective business in modmail where the team -- and Reddit’s administration -- can see it.We have never, in the past six years, received a single complaint or sanction from Reddit’s admin. We have also worked with at least six embedded Reddit admin temporary mods to help them train in our methods. When they act on our reports or sanction users harassing us, it should end there.When one member walks away and performs none of the subsequent work, they no longer have the privilege of making decisions for this community. When that user finds themselves in agreement with liars and bullies, they become a liability to the entire mission of this subreddit - which is to help people write screenplays.It is because of that mission we’re precluding whatever drama or fallout this decision may bring down on us. This user had every chance for six years to show they were willing to work with us, but we chose to respect their choice not to engage.Now, completely out of the blue, they are engaging in bad faith - and in fact, sharing highly disturbing, conspiratorial remarks from outside of Reddit’s moderation system. We have repeatedly warned this user not to continue this and agreed this toxic behaviour is not acceptable. We warned Reddit ahead of time about possible backlash and they confirmed their support for our decisions. As this user has now engaged in said backlash--including airing several remarks fully out of context, and displaying outright contempt for the members--we have decided to permanently ban them.It’s deeply disappointing that we’ve had to do this, but we’re also volunteer people who are entitled to the same respect as any other user. Erratic behaviour and the violation of boundaries are the kind of things we minimize as best we can so the community can continue to move forward.

I'm happy to announce that my horror drama-thriller KILLING FLOOR was recently chosen as one of three Black List Featured Scripts for this month!It's NORMA RAE meets ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13. It was heavily influenced by filmmakers like John Carpenter, Sidney Lumet, and David Cronenberg.LOGLINE: When slaughterhouse workers go on strike and threaten the survival of their small town, an angry mob decides to go after their undocumented co-workers.I received two 7s on my evaluations, after which I made some changes. Verbatim from the BL evaluations:-\"Dark, powerful and all-around captivating\"-\"An arresting project, a fresh voice in the horror world, putting a spin on the workplace drama\"-\"Shines with ingenuity and originality, with a unique premise that embodies the social horror phenomenon of the late 2010s, like GET OUT and GREEN ROOM\"-\"There's nothing quite like it in the current marketplace\"I've had ten industry downloads, but nobody's reached out so far. But I know that's a somewhat common experience among those who were in the same situation.At this point, I'm trying to secure representation. I also have two other completed features -- a contained horror comedy-thriller and a buddy-cop action comedy that was previously optioned and is now available.Here's a link to the featured projects page:https://blcklst.com/featured-projectsThanks to The Black List for this honor and to this subreddit, and best of luck to everyone on their scripts!EDIT: Wow, this blew up. Thanks to everyone for their congratulations and compliments!",

      "content_preview": "So, i got feedback for my first draft from one of our two 'bigger' producers, i don’t know her personally and we’ve never worked together before (she’s not familiar with my writing). I‘m quite fresh out of film school and this is my first feature length film script that’s about to get produced.At the end of the script she marked the very last action paragraph and wrote: „this reads very ChatGPT?“. And i don’t know how to feel about that, or if i have to justify myself (not because she wants me to, but because i felt like that was an accusation that she just dropped into the notes, and you can’t respond to notes). I don’t know what it means to write 'like ChatGPT', especially because the last lines of a script always are more 'poetically charged' (you know what i mean).To be honest, i feel super embarrassed because i‘m not the only one who read those notes - but i know i have no reason to be embarrassed, as it’s not true. But i feel like for the next draft i‘m gonna be overly conscious about the way i write things to avoid such a note again, or worse: raise suspicion? I‘m a very insecure person at times and i‘m very confused about how i‘m supposed to write from now on.What the hell does it mean, when a human writes something, and then someone else says that human is plagiarizing AI? It‘s kind of stupid, that this could be something we all start dealing with now…",

I recently graduated and ever since have had many days where I feel lost/hopeless. (I’ve always struggled with depression but it was definitely better managed when I had the structure of school). I wake up and feel even worse at the thought of having to write (even though writing is something that usually brings me joy). I want to pour my emotions into my writing but it’s just so hard. The thought of sitting down to write feels so heavy and then I feel even worse because I’m supposed to be using this time to build my portfolio, and if I can’t even sit down to write how will I ever make it as a screenwriter? Of course there are occasional good days where I can write a lot, but many days I just prefer to take care of other stuff or lay in bed. Just wondered if anyone had any advice of managing depression while being a writer? It’s so hard to be motivated and I find myself dreading each day since I know I will have to write and don’t want to. Part of it is I’m scared I’m not ever going to write something good but another part is just good old depression making every task feel impossible and being so tired all the time.",

      "content_preview": "When your screenplay is hosted by the Blacklist website, how do they actually get it out to producers, managers, and other reps and stakeholders who are interested in acquiring screenplays? As a producer/financier, I receive emails from The Black List that share, \"The best screenplays our readers read last week.\" (If you haven't seen what that looks like before, I have a video on my Patreon that shows it, but the full text of that post is below, so no need to leave le Reddit).There are essentially two basic ways that the Black List makes screenplays available to producers like me:PATH 1:A self-service searchable website athttps://blcklst.com. Here, producers like me can log in and easily browse many screenplays that are hosted, tagged, categorized, described, and reviewed. This, of course, requires the desire to go to the website, log in, and proactively look for what you need. Not everybody knows what they are looking for. For those that are looking for something specific, they may not find it on the Black List's website. However, I think for many producers, especially those working in the sub $1 to $2 million area, this website is well organized and maintained. The thoughts from the readers are not always accurate, but I also think it's unreasonable to expect a reader on a website to do your entire job as a producer or manager who is looking for good material.PATH 2:An email list blast like the one in this video. This is actually pretty helpful to me as a producer, because I get the email and it doesn't require me to go hunting through the website. If something piques my interest, I can click and explore more details and get in contact with the writer. Most of the time, I don't click. But I still read them.WHO'S MOST LIKELY TO LOOK FOR YOUR SCREENPLAY ON THE BLACK LIST?Independent producers tend to be more nuts and bolts, more tactical thinkers, about what they are looking for. The Black List makes it easy to sort and pre-screen for certain elements prior to reading. They may have a specific distributor that they are scouting material for and hoping to get that movie into the production very quickly. There aren't as many layers of bureaucracy. If an independent producer finds the right script and they know a name actor that would be interested in it, it can be a very simple route to getting that movie set up.WHAT ARE THE ISSUES WITH SCREENPLAYS ON THE BLACK LIST?Like anywhere else in the industry, the best screenplays are going to get snapped up pretty quickly. \"Best\" is not just limited to the creative quality of the screenplay. It also includes practical realities such as the cost, the genre, the ability to cast the movie with talent that has sales value. There are some good screenplays on the Black List that will probably never get made just because the realities of the industry make it almost impossible to get it produced unless Brad Pitt wants to star in it.Over the years, I have read some good screenplays from The Black List website and come across some good writers. I have never financed or produced a screenplay from the Black List website (to my knowledge), But I have tried in the past. I have reached out to screenwriters and had conversations with them about it.My honest obstacles I've experienced with Black List screenplays: the screenwriters themselves. Some have no clue how the industry works. They don't understand what the value of their screenplay is. They don't understand what scares off producers that reach out to them.For instance, once I found a great contained horror screenplay. Although it was obviously inspired by a very well-known horror classic, there was enough there to make it unique in the hands of the right director. And the screenplay itself was so well written that we considered letting the screenwriter direct the movie. But then the screenwriter insisted that his girlfriend play the female lead in the movie. This was emerging as a deal breaker issue. I can't tell you how insane that is for someone with no career to insist that his girlfriend - who also has no career - star in this movie.It killed our interest. Who wants to deal with that?Could I have acquired the screenplay after that? Of course I could have. He would have cut a deal at the end of the day. But after you run into a certain number of roadblocks when you're working with someone, you just start to smell that there are other issues they are not telling you about. Especially if they are first time screenwriters. Could there be another writer who helped him write it that he hasn't brought up? Someone that is going to create a cloud over the chain of title?At a certain point, there are just other screenplays out there. Your screenplay is very valuable in and of itself as a piece of original material. Don't forget that. People need screenplays to make movies. And yours has value. But your screenplay is never the only screenplay out there. And if YOU are a problem, then producers will start to look at other options, which they almost certainly have in their inbox already.Are issues like that one exclusive to screenplays on the Black List? Absolutely not. I've encountered similar insanity on screenplays submitted by managers, agents, other producers, etc. But the few times I've actually gone after a screenplay on the Black List, I've encountered them.Is hosting your screenplay on the Black List worth the cost? That is up to you to decide. For some people it is an inconsequential amount of money. For others, it's too expensive.My recommendation would be to view it as one option among many to get your screenplay out there.It is neither a silver bullet to sell your script, nor a scam.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I hope you're all having a wonderful week.I have been pitching a pilot script recently and wanted to briefly share a part of my experience.Several weeks ago, I pitched to an executive who liked the core concept of my script but wanted the format of my pitch to change: a more concise summary, a character breakdown, and a tighter logline.After editing my pitch to include these, I did another pitch to the executive who stated that my pitch was a \"commercial way into the project\" and the work showed \"passion and promise.\" However, they passed on the script as they weren't interested in taking on that genre.Following that, I setup another pitch session.  In the meantime I reevaluated the pitch.   When I looked back at the feedback, \"I'm passing on the script because of the genre\" read to me as \"This pitch was dreadful and it doesn't convey the necessary elements of the story to convince me to go ahead with this.\"   I read and reread my pitch document and every sentence seemed wrong.   I expanded it greatly, changed the summary to be more detailed, added in a larger discussion on the themes by sacrificing some of the character breakdowns, added more of the plot to the logline...It was a much, much fuller pitch with way more of the wider thoughts on the piece as well as better explaining its purpose and what the heart of the story is.And my second pitch failed spectacularly.   The feedback I got: a more concise summary, a character breakdown, and a tighter logline.Moral of the story is, if an executive tells you something is good take them at face value.  Don't start questioning it or reading into the feedback as some hidden message.   Everything that I changed from that first time I edited is exactly what this second executive wanted to see.   I had a \"commercial\" pitch that I tossed away because I not only let my self-criticism get the best of me, I wasn't thinking enough like an executive and just put my own views into the newest pitch thinking it would be more of a sell because there's more of what I perceive as passion.Good luck to everyone on this journey and please if you get positive feedback...accept it and understand you got it for a reason.",

Better set-ups, better payoffs, different character introductions. Do you go back and tweak or surge forward with that initial draft and then go back?Do you sculpt the ear, then as you're sculpting the nose, go back to the ear during it? To use a random analogy.Thanks!",

For example, do I write down the exact camera angles from where I imagine something from happening, e.g.: „Character W stares at Character X, camera is at angle Y and is positioned at place Z“ Or is it just „Character A stares at Character B“? I also noticed many abbreviations written behind characters names sometimes, what do those stand for?I’m pretty obviously a Newbie to this, so I’m sorry for the loaded question!",

It sounds so simple, but essentially I have the shell of something I am really excited about, and when I go to outline the plot, I am stuck.This is almost an embarrassing question, I know.

She said my writings are raw and visceral. I won’t mention her name for privacy reasons, but she’s an author and has written a few popular movies.I’m not sure where to start. But I do have a couple ideas. She said she wrote books first, then wrote the screenplay.I’m a 50 year old traumatized struggling binge drinker. I write on misery, and for some reason over 100 million people relate and read my writings.I imagine it’s a tough gig to break into with no experience? Thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "My buddy and I have been writing a pitching a ton of TV show stuff for the last few years (got a development deal with Adult Swim out of it, which was super cool), but boy is it so frustrating to constantly make things you're proud of, show them to a few people in the industry, and then put them away in a computer folder for the rest of time.So, in an attempt to just get some work out there into the world, we've decided to take our favorite pilot script we have and stage a live table read in Manhattan next month (September 27). We've got a bunch of cool people in it (Chloe Troast from SNL, 4x emmy-winner Josh Gondelman, Broadway actor Natalie Walker, and a bunch of others) as well as a really great illustrator to do some character art for us.Obviously,I would love if people want to come and check it outor watch the livestream, but I also think it will just be a cool screenwriting experiment that this sub might appreciate. Will be interesting to see how it goes! Hell, maybe once we put the video online, it will be an interesting proof-of-concept to show around.The pilot is an animated comedy called CHRONICLES OF TREVOR.Logline: A ruthless businessman becomes the Chosen One after being sucked into a Narnia-like fantasy world.If people don't hate this, I will post the video (and screenplay) when it's finished, probably in October!",

I've been working on a screenplay for the past two months, and paying for coverage/notes along the way. However, the more coverage I receive, the more unsure I am about what the problems in the script actually are.I've gotten a Recommend/Consider, and Consider/Pass and two Pass/Pass. Some of these based on the same version of the scripts. I see a lot of inconsistencies. They are different readers, so I know perspectives can be different, but I think that's what makes it hard to target and fix problems.I am speaking to a great coverage guy on Fiverr, but I realize that I can't rely on the feedback of one person. So I am taking his feedback very seriously, but want to make sure I am covering my bases.Is there anyone here who can help me out, by looking through the current draft and telling me what they think? Note: I do realize that the budget would be high. Thank you all for your time 🙏Update: Trying again because I apparently did something incorrectly, but I figured out how to enable access on Google drive, so hopefully that fixes the issue.Apologies.

      "content_preview": "I’ve been trying to understand how movies like Jim Henson’s Labyrinth, Miyazaki movies, and even in some regards the Avatar (airbender) series manage to create this seamless background ambience of magic and wonder. I feel like a lot of world building information is conveyed just in the nature of the creatures in the background, their design, how they move and dress. In my mind, this is very different from modern storytelling which relies so heavily on exposition and dialog. How do you write this?I’ve heard the term “soft magic system,” but it’s more than that. More broadly, how do you script out show-not-tell subtly?  Not just the magic systems are done this way, but the whole universe seems so clear in these films - the political structure, the history, the subtle tension between minor characters. It’s not heavy-handed; it’s just coherent in the background. (Another film that comes to mind immediately, but less masterfully, is the Neverending Story.)",
