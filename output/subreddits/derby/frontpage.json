      "content_preview": "So I’ve come home off my hols and found flags plastered everywhere and felt quite disappointed about this as it feels quite like we’re pushing a point of view of a politician who I feel is stirring up hatred to try and win himself some votes. I’ve tried to engage with the folk putting up the flags on here to try and find out if I’m correct in suspecting this is another example of xenophobic ‘stop the boats’ politics but I’ve not gotten very far. I am English, but the current state of the country depresses tf out of me. I don’t think immigrants are the issue but I’m perfectly happy to disagree - arguing won’t help any of us! Would any of the folk putting up flags be interested in using some of that civic pride feeling in actually doing something to make Derby a nicer place to live? Embarrassing in my opinion to live in a city that is plastered in flags and full of ‘patriotism’ but also covered in litter. Could we arrange to do something about that? Maybe work together as a community to make England a nicer place to live? Anyone up for a litter pick? Jetwash some nasty dirty pavements? Make some flower beds into St George’s crosses or something rather than just putting up nylon flags with cable ties? Just interested to see if that would be something people would be willing to do?",

Anyone I speak to at Derby Homes basically answers with an 'I think it's just the kitchen area' response, rather than anything definitive. So my question to Derby Redditors is this: Will the survey be limited to the kitchen, or is it a full house survey? I think they'll likely check the fuse box area and plumbing, etc, but will they have to inspect the entire house? If just the kitchen, will I have to empty it entirely for the inspection, or just empty the cupboards and such? Thanks for any advice and info.",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys. Gf and I just moved to a new town (Derby), early 20s, just wanna meet some people honestly. We're both a bit on the nerdy side, we play magic the gathering a lot, we go out to karaoke and the clubs on occasion but we've not really met any proper friends from that yet honestly. The crowd at the city centre game stores tend to skew quite older/more interested in the game than meeting people, and they aren't really there to make friends. We tried a board game social club, they were all nice people, but kind of antisocial/didn't seem to gel with us super well. Any suggestions for young people? Thanks guys very appreciated. We can drive. If anyone knows of a good game shop with a fairly young n friendly community we'd really appreciate it, ideally near Derby, maybe in Notts",

I was wondering if they typically have something like a group chat for example for all the postgraduate students of the same course or something similar to that, just to be able to already connect with people in advance. I know there’ll be the induction week one week prior to the beginning of the course, and I will definitely attend that too, but I would love to be able to already connect with some people. I’m just always so anxious once the course starts everyone already knows each other and I will be like an outsider 😅😭. I have looked through the Uni’s website and everything but couldn’t find anything. Perhaps someone of you could help me? I’d really appreciate that ☺️.",

      "content_preview": "Most of the flags that have been draped over bridges, on lampposts, etc, just look a bit random and lost.  Whilst I don't particularly have a view for or against them, I generally think they look untidy and unnecessary. However, last night I ended up driving all the way down Nottingham Road from the Spondon roundabout to Pentagon Island, and realised that the flags along that particular road actually looked really nice. One key reason was the volume and consistency - literally every lamppost had one, so it looked \"official\" and intentional.  They looked so well done that I initially thought it was the council, before I realised that they were all just zip-tied on the lampposts. The second key reason was the height - they were all at the height of a 2-storey house, which meant that they had space to flutter and flare in the breeze without getting in anyone's way or being too much of a distraction.  I've no idea how people installed them all without a cherry picker. Finally, I think that the combination of the above two reasons meant that the whole effect was just pleasant background imagery.  Think Britain in Bloom but with flags.  It wasn't in your face, it didn't feel political, or trying to make a message.  There was no other signage, no association with protests, or violence, or partisanship, or anything negative, just a quiet celebration of patriotism like we'd get for the Olympics or a royal wedding. Anyone else seen those ones in particular and have a similar thought?",
