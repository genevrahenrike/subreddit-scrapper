      "content_preview": "For a few years, I started incorporating weightlifting into my life. I loved weightlifting so much, I would go to the gym 5-6 days a week, and eventually I got into running because of my running enthusiast coworkers. I pushed myself, and it was honestly one of the best decisions I have made. I loved it and it became my outlet. However, before running, I was in an auto accident that sprained my spine. This was in September- by May, I was able to run my first half marathon, and the stiffness of my back slowly started to subside. But... I also pushed myself a little too hard. I started noticing knee pain, and after a visit to my doctor, it was concluded that I had overworked it- I avoided the aching and eventually sprained my knee. So I unfortunately now cannot run long distance for a few months.My physiotherapist recommended that I strengthen my core to support my lower back, and my doctor suggested light activity on my knee. I now have full mobility on my knee but I can no longer push myself as hard as I used to, so I searched for other options. I looked into reformer pilates, and just had my first intro class today! My instructor was able to modify some of my movements to help support me. However, one of the concerns I have about starting pilates is the amount of calories I'll be able to burn to start my calorie deficit again, and the positive changes to my body that weightlifting and running was able to provide me; to grow muscle, and differences in growth. Would anybody be able to expand and share their experiences on switching to pilates?",

      "content_preview": "Hey folks!I hope this might serve as motivation to some. And I want to shout out my happiness to the universe of reddit!about 6 months ago I (35F) started training again after about two years of staying pretty much inactive due to an injury. Once I restarted, I realized that I enjoy it quite a lot, and soon, just 2-3 months in, I also started to notice improvements with my injury. Since I liked training, I trained about 3-6 times a week - often just for 30-45 minutes, while simultaneously cooking dinner 😂. For the first couple of months I was just training from home, following the programming a personal trainer did for me. I was using some dumbells, kettlebells and resistance bands. I've only recently joined a gym. This summer I also restarted swimming, which I do about once a week in a swimming class. So, currently I am training about 3-4 times per week, consisting out of 3-4 times weight lifting and 1x swimming training.Here's the changes I've noticed:obviously, I'veincreased in strengthandpacked on muscle. My arms lookbuffnow. My butt is bigger. I've never seen such gains before, even though I always cared about staying active even before my injury, but I've never followed a structured work out plan like this time before.My foot pains, the afore mentionedinjury, has greatly improved.myresting heart rate and heart rate recoveryafter exercise has improved - that was super impressive to notice about three months in!That's what I hoped for, kind of expected. But the following changes stunned me:one thing that has very slowly changed is that I'mno longer feeling anxious, hardly ever. Like WHAT???? I used to be the anxious type, feeling anxious in the evening, lying awake before falling asleep, etc ... this literally disappeared. It took me some months to realize it and think back that I haven't had a uneasy feeling in months. I am absolutely in shock/awe.I amfeeling more resilient. Despite of living through kind of challenging times right now, I've got a sense that I've got this and will figure it out with time.I feel just fine most of the days. Not feeling sluggish, overwhelmed, etc.my circadian rhythm is changing.I used to go to bed kind of late and would get up semi-late. Like going to bed between 11pm and 1am on a workday, and getting up the latest possible before going to the office. I thought I am not able to sleep before 11pm. Now I'm often tired after 9pm and it's not a rare thing to be in bed by 10pm. I *choose* to get up at 6.30am often now.Only potential concern:I stepped on a scale recently and realize I put on weight. before this my weight would only lightly fluctuate, and I did not need any effort to keep it stable. I'm the heaviest I've been in a long time. Up easily 4-5 kg. (I'm 1.75cm and 73 kg now) While I think it's partly muscle, I am also noting that I am much hungrier that I used to and I don't think I lost much fat at all, maybe even put on some. That's the only thing I am still getting used to, and I am a bit worried if it's really just the gains from the gym or if it's just me overeating a bit due to increased hunger and also potential changes in metabolism (hello 36, I'm coming for you!). It's a weird experience to suddenly not fit into pants anymore and brings up a self-consciousness that I still need getting used to.Over all, it's a great experience tho, I am SO GLAD that training has brought so many positive changes for me and that I get to experience the mental benefits myself.",

I understand training different muscle groups, training to failure, calorie defecits, etc. I know you can't spot reduce fat/tone/etc.What I want to understand is how to get that lean bodybuilder look that someone doing a bikini competition does. I know often bikini competitors are on very strict programs, work with coaches, and become EXTREMELY lean. I do not want to compete so of course wouldn't want to become \"stage lean\" but I do like the off season look that bodybuilders seem to maintain, and I'm just curious what they do to achieve that I'm not doing?Is it just extreme dieting? Speicifc macros? A targeted workout plan? Like I said they seem to have great physiques even in the \"off season\" so I'm just curious.Edit: To be clear, I’m not asking for some kind of “secret”. I thought my question made that clear. I very literally meant I know that it takes a lot of work. I wanted to know what that actually entailed. Like do they focus on specific lifts? What’s the macro split? What kind of cardio? My question is very literal. Again, not asking for a secret. Asking for details.",

I have built my strength up steadily and have lost some weight and inches in the process but have weighed the same for the last 6 months and haven’t really increased my strength much either. Everything just feels stagnant.So I decided based on my BMI and appearance to try a cut. Now, I can’t recover between workouts. My whole body aches, all the time, I just feel so beat up. I’ve tried to start GZCLP because I was no longer getting results from 5/3/1 for beginners and wanted something with less volume but I honestly just can’t hack it. I’m exhausted.Can someone please offer some advice. How on earth do I train effectively while I’m in a calorie deficit without feeling like a walking corpse all the time. I just want to lose some body fat while still building, or at least maintaining, muscle mass.",

      "content_preview": "Long-time lurker here, but wanted to share my story about coming back to the gym.TL;DR:GZCLP is an excellent program for someone looking to build strength or return to power lifting! I was scared my \"peak\" was in my past, but I'm now stronger than I ever was and feel like there is more to go! I'm not going to let gravity win without a fight.HistoryI'm 39F, a type 1 diabetic and started power lifting about 12 years ago as a way to become healthier and lose some weight. I was in medical school at that time and one professor mentioned that he often recommended weight lifting to his patients as a way to lose weight.This led me to reading Starting Strength (cover to cover) and learning how to power lift. I've been in love with lifting heavy things and putting them back down again since that time.Unfortunately, life got busy after school with training, though during the pandemic I did have some more time to get back into lifting (and building up a home gym)! I've never quite lifted as consistently as I did when I started.Recently, after life settled down, I realized that almost none of my clothing fit anymore (wearing scrubs and stretchy clothing definitely caught me unaware.) My lab results from my endocrinologist started looking worse and worse. I decided it was time to focus on my health before I hit the big 4-0.GoalsI wanted to build up my muscle, regain my strength, and get my diabetes back in check.My big goals since starting medical school were to bench 1 plate, squat 2, deadlift 3, and be able to do pull-ups.Before and After StatsDuration: November 2024 until August 2025 (with a 2-month break for gardening and vacations)Weight: 192 lbs down to 183 lbsBF%: Starting ~39% (Visual estimate/home scale) Ending 36% (DEXA scan)A1C (3-month moving average of blood glucose levels) Starting: 7.1% Ending: 6.5%DietI started with MyFitnessPal but became discouraged by lack of progress and sometimes inaccurate food entries. I switched to MacroFactor and began to see the scale move more reliably. With my diabetes, I was getting pretty insulin resistant as my weight had crept up so I had reduced my carbohydrates.I noticed that on my \"high\" protein days (prior to tracking) I was probably only getting about ~60g of protein. I hate the taste of most protein powders so I focused on creating high protein meals.I'm a huge foodie and love to cook (I can send recipes!) Suddenly it felt less like I was always craving food and began to look forward to the stuff I had made myself. I now hit 120-170 g of protein daily. I also found that \"Clear\" whey seemed to be more tolerable which helps me hit targets on days where I can't meet my macros.RoutineI ran GZCLP with its 4 day a week schedule. Some weeks I only got two days in and some weeks I got all 4 days in. I did not do much cardio, but did try to hit 10k steps daily. In April/May I spent a lot of time getting my garden put together so the program went on hold for the most part.I chose GZCLP because it had a nice spread between all of the big lifts and also added some accessory work that Starting Strength did not have. I liked the idea of the linear progression also allowing me to march steadily towards my goals.Measurable progress or achievementsxNovember 2024August 2025PreviousOHP75 lb (e1RM)100 lb (1RM)80 lbs (1RM)Bench Press98 lb (e1RM)139 (e1RM)90 lbs (1RM)Squat149 (e1RM)265 lb (e1RM)248 lbs (e1RM)Deadlift197 (e1RM)315 (e1RM)333 (e1RM)I changed all of my exercises over to my 1 rep max (1RM) or estimated 1 rep max (e1RM) to have some consistency across the chart. I used the Liftosaur program to run my GZCLP routine, which did all my progressions for me. This was much less painful than putting it into google sheets.Overall, I'm quite happy with my progress. I did not get as strong in my deadlift as I did with my other lifts and attribute that mainly to a lower starting weight. I can tell that I have a lot more left to grow there (my last set of the program was deadlifts 245 x 8).Other achievements:My waist went from 38\" down to 36\", so despite a lack of scale movement, I'm noticeably slimmer in the abdomen. I've also noticed that while I was serving as a model for ultrasound anatomy, my abdominal muscles were unusually thick! (See photo below) I would guess that is because I do my power lifting without a belt.I got a DEXA scan after my GZCLP completion since I've never had one before. I can see that my scan is already not very accurate, but the overall trend shows that I seem to have a good amount of lean mass. Although my bone density scores are messed up on the report, I still have a passing Z score. Unfortunately, my lumbar spine and pelvic bones do not seem to have appropriately contributed to the measurements.PhotosUltrasound Image of my Abdominal MusclesBone Density ScoreDEXA ScanMy Workout TrendsSummaryGZCLP was an excellent choice for regaining my strength back, but I still have a lot of work to do. While I am stronger than I was in the past, I still have a long journey of fat loss ahead. I think I could continue this program for a while longer before having to stop, but I am happy with the amount of strength I gained back. The heavy squats are too fatiguing for me to continue for now.What’s next? I’m starting up a hypertrophy program inspired by RP fitness, but will circle back to power lifting to get my deadlifts up further and maybe even try out a competition in the future!",

Please, is there anything else you can suggest to me that I should be doing? Stuff like particular stretches before or after, or when I should drink water, or any other exercise routines I should be doing, or specific foods I should be eating that are good for stamina, or I don't know what else.

I don’t often ever have a complete rest day - my weekly routine will ideally see me doing Pilates twice a week, running three times a week and strength training (full body) twice a week. I find it really hard to justify rest days as it feels like I’m being lazy, and with two small children I feel like I need to make the most of every opportunity I have to exercise in case I don’t get it on another day.My youngest son is 11 months old and teething, so sleeping really badly, and I’ve just started my period so am feeling rubbish anyway. Part of me wants to treat today like a rest day and just chill while he naps (if he naps) but the rest of me wants to just power through and do weights as I know consistency is importantly and exercise is really good for my mental health. I tend to suck at listening to my body and take determination and discipline to a bit of an extreme when I have a goal in mind, so thought I’d ask here to try and get some perspective!

      "content_preview": "For reference, I'm a woman in my early 30s. I'm not particularly awkward physically, but I have absolutely no concept of how to dance or hip movement ability, really. My lower back is really stiff, and I've started working out consistently in the last month to try to improve my health as well as some areas that feel like they need to pop (mid and lower back in particular).I say all of this to ask what exercises you guys would suggest for improving movement in my hips.Really I'd like to build up to a point where I can try to learn to dance a little. When I see people dance especially winding, or circular motions my brain literally does not compute, and I have no idea how a body can move like that, but I do know mine is not so relaxed or limber. Even with music, if it makes me want to move, it doesn't translate over to my body at all. I'm not open to the concept of dance classes (nor do I have the money for that), but I would really like to be able to move a bit more freely and not be so stiff when I do think about trying at home.I have incorporated stretching and occasional yoga at home to try to help, but I can't say if it's actually been helpful at all.  Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

I didn't get a new gym membership over th summer because I was unemployed and couldn't afford it. But I'm back to work now as a school bus monitor and want to start back up again because I've missed it.I feel terribly out of shape and part of my job requires me go climb up/ down a hill to get to my bus and to where my car is parked. Every day when I get to my car after my route, my hips hurt and I feel really out of breath.That being said, the closest and cheapest gym near where I live is a Planet Fitness about 2 miles from the house. Has anyone had experience with PF? Do they still offer free personal training? I feel that's why my journey stalled out before...I couldn't afford a trainer at my old gym and I'm kind of scared to do things I'm not familiar with because I'm afraid I will get hurt because I have bad form and don't know what im doing really. I've hurt myself before when I tried weight lifting un January 2020 and ended up so badly injured I was in pain for 6 months or so. The injury triggered a bad RA flare which didn't help things either.I'm not looking to lose weight...if I do, great. That's not my main goal though. I just want to be in better shape.",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I have been working out 5-7 days a week since 2016, but have been struggling with my momentum and staying engaged for honestly 2-3 years now. It seems like I feel so much less energetic and motivated — help!A quick background: 2016-2018: started working out in 2016 and did so 5-7 days a week, including cardio fitness classes, and lots of hiking. I was on weight watchers for 2 years and lost about 80lbs during that time. I was also regularly running and training for 5/10/15ks.2018: stopped weight watchers in 2018 because I realized it was fueling a bad relationship with my body and food.2018-2020: kept up with eating well, worked on healing my relationship with body and food, kept working out 5-7 days a week! Did gain some weight but overall felt really good about myself. Doing SoulCycle multiple times a week.2020-2021: slowed down with the pandemic. Had a peloton at home but basically gained back all my lost weight and then some.2021: started with a personal trainer 3x a week and nutrition coaching. My first workout back in 2021, I injured my knee and that’s been an ongoing arthritis issue to this day.2022-today: I can’t stop feeling like I’m half-assing everything. I can’t stick to my meal plan (which is very reasonable - I have a great trainer), refuse to get my steps in, barely phone it in at the gym… my trainer has given my every trick in the book it seems and I just can’t get my shit together. I do NOT want to go back to being restrictive but I would like to improve my fitness but I can’t even bring myself to try. I was also doing a boxing group class (my studio recently closed down), but even that wasn’t doing it for me anymore.What am I missing here? How can I get my energy and motivation back to do the right thing? I’m going through the motions (an object in motion stays in motion, etc) and making it to the gym, but it’s like pulling teeth every time and the motivation isn’t finding its way back.ETA: my wife is my workout buddy!",

My weekly routine is a mix of strength training, Pilates, circuit training, calisthenics, and reformer mobility/stretch, plus I get in about 8k to 9k steps daily.I just recently started to add running to my regular exercises where I run once or twice a week, about 3km to 4km each time.I've started seeing a pattern where on days when I run, I don't sleep well at night. It's either I can't fall asleep, or I sleep in fits and wake up every hour. The timing of my run in the daytime doesn't seem to affect this. It happens whether I run during my lunch hour or in the evening after work.I have anxiety and exercise helps me cope with it and I am usually out like a light because I'm tired after my exercise. So it's quite puzzling why running seems to have this effect on me. Just wondering if anyone has any ideas?I also take magnesium supplements in the evening about an hour before bed. The magnesium doesn't seem to have any effect on running days either.",

Almost like cracking a knuckle? No pain during or after but i worry, am i doing damage somehow? It's also just plain distracting!I have not had any injuries or other medical events so I assume it is about the change in equipment. Has anyone else had a similar issue or any suggestions on mitigating?I'm hesitant to run to the doctor just to get told \"don't do that then...\" after handing over my copay.

Body image / clothing – I’m really not happy with my body right now, and the thought of wearing skin-tight clothes is tough for me. 2.    Personal space – I’m not sure how I’ll handle people being that close during training. 3.    Fitness level – I’m not super fit at the moment. I’ve been weightlifting for a while, but I’m burned out and looking for something new that’ll give me some dopamine again. Despite all that, I really want to give it a try. For those of you who train: •    How did BJJ affect your fitness and mindset? •    Did it help you with body image or confidence? •    Any tips for handling the initial discomfort with clothing and close contact? Would love to hear your experiences. Thanks!",
