I was watching an old James video on my phone in the living room yesterday and my mom came by and said \"Am I the only one who finds his voice really annoying?\" I had no idea how to respond - and still don't. What do you say to that? Obviously she has no control over how it sounds to her but to comment on it like that? It feels weird. And mean. My mom doesn't usually say stuff like that but I am already paranoid about bothering or disrupting people when I watch things and am constantly asking her \"will this volume level be okay?\" And she always says it's fine, she can't hear it, it's not a problem. Should I say something? Should I just avoid watching James's videos when she's around? I'm so confused and honestly, kinda hurt. EDIT: Headphones aren't really an option for me due to sensory issues and the shape of my ears (it's a minor birth defect). And yes, I am very sensitive to comments from others about what I enjoy. I'm getting better but I still struggle with it and acknowledge it's a flaw of mine. It was just weird because she has never said anything before, even when I asked (probably at least a dozen times). But this time she said it unprompted. I'm gonna move past it and try to find a different place to be when I watch YouTube",

In this video, James mentions how Hazel (from Dream Home Decorator) has once again done some redecorating on the farm, and tells the viewer to check out the video in the description link...  But the video he links to this one, which is just Part 21 of the Cottage Living series. I went into the Dream Home Decorator playlist, and the only video I find where she redecorated the farm is this older one , which happens several episodes back. But from listening to what James is saying, there SHOULD be 2 farm redecoration videos from Hazel... right? I'd love to watch it, but I can't find it :(",
