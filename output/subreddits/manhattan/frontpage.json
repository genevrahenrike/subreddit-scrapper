I've honestly been a bit of a recluse the past year or so while I've focused on losing weight, and while I'm not near my goal, I just really want to try putting myself out there again. I'm 26F and 170-175 pounds depending on the day. I feel like in the past, every time I've gone out with a group of friends, they tend to get all the attention and I end up being the one standing back by the bar. I'm not like morbidly obese, but living in Manhattan where every girl my age could be a supermodel, it feels really difficult. Any recommendations where I could try my luck?",

      "content_preview": "Hi neighbors, I am writing this because I am honestly scared. I am actually terrified and I just want to know if anyone else is feeling this way or if I am alone. Lately, West 39th Street has been filled with encampments. When I walk through, I get screamed at. I have been spit on. I have been chased, yelled at, followed, and I have stepped on needles more times than I can count. Most of the people here are mentally ill and it is honestly terrifying. Sometimes it feels like living in a zombie apocalypse, especially between 8th and 11th Avenue and from 23rd all the way up to 45th. I am scared and concerned. I am so tired of feeling like this every single day, multiple times a day, just trying to get home. For what it is worth, I am a generous person and I always try to help when I can. Just last week I saw someone pleading for water and I went over to give him twenty dollars. As soon as I got close he suddenly screamed \"HOW MUCH,\" ripped the twenty from my hand and actually grabbed my arm, then ran off laughing. It honestly felt satanic. People nearby rushed over to check on me and there was a police officer nearby. He told me to stop giving money to the homeless because lately a lot of people who try to help are being robbed. I have reached out to the city council to tell them how unsafe and frustrated I feel. I have called the precinct to report what has been happening and the encounters I have had, but I am mostly told they are working on it but there is not much that can be done. The laws have changed. Loitering is not enforced. Drug use is basically legal now in NYC, even heroin. It feels like everything has spiraled. Am I the only one feeling this way in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and Hudson Yards? Is anyone else dealing with daily fear and these same kinds of experiences? I really just want to hear from other people living here. I need to know if I am alone in this or if others feel the same. If you are in the area and have stories, advice, or just want to talk about it, please comment. I am just tired of being scared in my own neighborhood. Thanks for listening.",

I‚Äôve completed my master‚Äôs degree in computer science, but the job market is challenging for individuals like me on a visa, i have applied to 15000 jobs till now but no success. Consequently, I‚Äôm seeking ways to earn a living. Although I had a part-time job that paid only $10 per hour, I‚Äôm looking for work-related opportunities in the tech industry or at least something that offers a better salary. This way, I can work while simultaneously preparing my applications and conducting interviews for full-time positions. If you have any tech-related job openings, such as data analysis or paperwork, or if you‚Äôre looking for desk jobs, I‚Äôm open to other work opportunities like dog walking, office reception, or any other job that can help me pay my bills. I would be extremely grateful for any assistance you can provide.",

      "content_preview": "Hello Manhattan! I‚Äôm writing this during my first pit stop on a spontaneous adventure! üòé I‚Äôm a 25F business owner, born and raised in Toronto, and I decided to take a few days off for my very first road trip‚Ä¶ with Manhattan as my first destination. I have zero expectations, but I‚Äôm beyond excited to explore everything the city has to offer. I‚Äôve already made a list of some must-try food spots, but honestly, it‚Äôd be way more fun to experience this city with someone genuine, interesting, and fun-loving. I‚Äôm looking for adults 21+ who enjoy good vibes, great conversation and a good time, someone who‚Äôs open to showing me around or just hanging out anytime before I head back Saturday night. Big highlight: I‚Äôm seeing Vybz Kartel at the Barclays Center tomorrow at 8pm! If you‚Äôre a fan or just down for a night of live music and energy let‚Äôs connect! üáØüá≤üáØüá≤üî•‚ù§Ô∏èI grew up listening to his music, so this is a dream come trueüôèüèæ Quick side questions for locals (since I‚Äôm learning as I go here): ‚Ä¢\tAny 24hr spots with an outlet I could use to plug in my hot tools and do my hair? (Yes, I‚Äôm serious üòÖ) ‚Ä¢\tIs it hard to find parking in Manhattan and in Brooklyn? Usually how much does it cost, and where would you recommend parking for a long stretch? (Asking because I know the streets are always packed, plus I have a deep fear of parallel parking‚Ä¶ mostly because I‚Äôm awful at it. If I try, I might block traffic for half an hourüòÇ). If you‚Äôre someone who values connection, fun experiences, and maybe a little adventure, send me a DM! I‚Äôm happy to exchange pics and connect on IG/X/FB first. Let‚Äôs make this trip unforgettable! üåÜ‚ú®",

      "content_preview": "I was visiting NYC last week for the first time. My wife and I got pretty drunk on our last day (some place in hells kitchen) and decided to head for our air bnb. I had not had so much to drink in about a decade and I got \"blackout drunk\"...besides, I never mess with tequila but somehow, that day I did (I could give reasons but it wouldn't mask the stupidity). I just remember waking up the next morning with one of my eye punched into. While I don't remember any of of how it happens,  my wife rememberes bits and pieces ...she says it was a really angry black dude who punched me on the sidewalk and cursed me a lot as I fell to the ground. He later yelled at her \"take him the fuck away from here.\" Going by pictures and videos just about 30mins before that ...we were very very jolly and danc-y..I don't think there is something I would've done or said to invite this punch. In our videos I am struggling with sitting on the bar stool there is now at I could move with intention to start a physical altercation. I possibly can't think of any exchange that would have led to the person punching me in the eye !! I returned back to my country and went to the urgent care clinic yesterday .. after multiple tests and a CT scan, turns out I have fractures on the orbital bone and nose as well as a tiny puncture in the retina. Then there is of course the   blaring black eye which is quiet the conversation starter. I work in healthcare and have no idea how to get back to work..... I am scheduled to see an ophthalmologist, optometrist, plastic surgeon and my family doctor for multiple follow ups this week. Havig a tough time processing this... -Is this normal for NYC ? -We got an Uber pretty much from the place I got punched since my wife members I couldn't stand up and she had to sit on the sidewalk besides me as she called an Uber... This means we have that address. Does this help me report this incident ? Should I report this incident or is it just a normal day in Manhattan ? PS- I ofcourse know about responsible drinking and not acting like a teenager with parents on vacation. And I am doing my share of contemplating about this unprecedented behavior. All I hope for is to not lose any degree of my vision (among other things). I want to laugh about it one day as I tell the story of my first trip to NYC. Any kind words are much appreciated :)",

I am a third-year medical student at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, NY and I‚Äôm on the recruitment team for the use of TC Cream (a botanical drug purified from Cnidium monnieri plant extract) for the treatment of psoriasis. Our dermatology department has had highly promising results in preliminary trials with little to no adverse side effects compared to a placebo. We are hoping to recruit more people in hopes to bring this treatment to the general public. In case you are interested, I‚Äôve attached our first abstract presented at the Journal of American Academy of Dermatology¬†here: https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(24)02322-3/fulltext The study is fully Institutional Review Board approved and is conducted in-person at the Veterans Hospital located in Brooklyn. I thought that this sub-reddit would be an amazing place to reach psoriasis patients who want to try an herbal remedy for their condition. It is at no cost and you will be paid for your participation as well as reimbursed for any travel if you require Uber/Lyft. If you: Have Psoriasis or knows someone with Psoriasis Are between 18 to 70 years of age Would like to utilize an herbal, botanical ointment for treatment Live in NYC Please feel free to contact me at justin.ong@downstate.edu to see your eligibility. Thanks everyone!",
