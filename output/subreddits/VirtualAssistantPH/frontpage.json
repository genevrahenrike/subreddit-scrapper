      "content_preview": "I have been working as a Bookkeeper, paid hourly, since October 2024. Last month, the company set time limits on tasks and restructured assignments. I was informed that my August timesheet would be adjusted based on these limits, which cost me 7 hours I actually worked. However last Saturday, I received an MS teams message from the operations manager that my salary from August to December would also be deducted for ‚Äúovercharging‚Äù 63 hours from May‚ÄìJuly. I found this unfair since I truly worked those hours, and no such policy existed then. I raised this to the operations manager, explaining that I was told the adjustment would only apply to August, but deductions for May‚ÄìJuly felt unreasonable. Instead of responding, she forwarded my message to the accounting manager, who claimed the tasks shouldn‚Äôt have taken me that long because she did it too before and she was \"fast\". I professionally explained differences in pacing and why some tasks took longer. Both OM and AM are Filipinos too. An hour later, without further reply, I received a termination notice via email and lost all access. I know situations like this happen in VA work, but honestly, I don‚Äôt know how to react.",

      "content_preview": "WAG NA WAG MAGREREFER SA FREELANCING ---- IF makakawork mo or directly kayo magkakatrbho. Sooooo. Been freelancing since 2019. Ever since working independently ang atake ng mga clients ko. Last year, I got this client STABLE AND PREMIUM client. Pays well 2 digits per hour 40 hours/week consistently. Then they decided to expand and hire more people sa department namin. BTW first VA nila ko in that department and my manager is super happy sa kung pano ako magwork. Company is Huge tlaga like around 600 employees in the US. My manager asked me last April \"do you know other people like you? We would love to hire more to give you extra hand. Yung manager ko promoted na sia to higher level so ang mangyayari I will be the lead. They also offered me pay increase. So I referred a good friend of mine as in goodfriend to! When I started sa freelancing sia rin katuwang ko but we never worked together under same department or yung directly impacting yung work ng isat isa. So I trusted her and put my name on the line for her. We both work with multiple clients that's why I thought would be beneficial if magrefer ako ng mpagkakatiwalaan ko however, dun ako nagkamali. Ang manager ko sanay sakin na bago nia pa maisip nagawa ko na. I am very proactive and always on top with my tasks. Very responsive rin ako. Kasi magaan naman ang workload. Despite of me having other clients, hndi ako nagpapabaya. Yan ang #1 rule ko sa sarili ko FREELANCING gives you the freedom to have as many clients as you want BUT make sure you can manage and to deliver. However, si friend unresponsive, under deliver lagi may missed and mind you 3 months na to. I am so stressed RN kasi imbes mapagaan yung work ko lalong bumigat because I have to cover for her. Instead ma delegate ko ibang tasks hndi, since mas marami siang tasks sa other clients. Pag may misses sia I would consistently remind her and nakakstress sa end ko yung ganon üò≠ I have this attitude na kesa sabihin ko nkta ko ng missed ggawin ko nlang. Same exact reason why I left CORPORATE. Kasi don ako na burn out. Sobrang nagsisisi ako nirefer ko sia to the point na I am thinking na umalis sa client na to and try to find different one kasi ayoko rin masira yung friendship namin. And everytime na mag reremind ako sakanya, ang daming excuses and feeling ko sia pa galit. Kaya lately I let our manager na makapnsin ng misses nia pero kasi as someone na expected to LEAD lalabas rin na misses ko yun. LAST THING I WANT TO HAPPEN IS MAGING MICROMANAGE AKO OR MAYBE GANUN NA GNGWA Ko now subconsciously kasi I kept reminding her things kasi lagi nia namimiss kahit pa weekly na yung cadence. Ayoko rin ng mina micromanage kaya nasstress ako lalo sa situation. Kahit yung simpleng pagsagot lang sa slack nireremind ko pa sia sometimes our manager would ask something and 30mins na lumipas wala pa siang sagot so I feel the need to remind her. ü•π Dont know what to do HALP.",

      "content_preview": "Accepting applicants from the Philippines only Hi everyone!  We're looking for Virtual Assistants to join our growing remote team. This is a great opportunity for professionals who want to level up their careers, especially those with backgrounds in QA, Training, Recruitment, or other coordination-heavy roles who are looking to transition into virtual roles powered by AI tools . Open Roles (Choose based on your interest and background): Executive Virtual Assistant ‚Äì Support executives with calendar management, communications, and project coordination. Ideal for detail-oriented professionals from QA, Training, or Recruitment looking to shift into a fast-paced remote role. Strong organizational skills, accountability, and comfort with PM tools and AI platforms required. Real Estate VA ‚Äì Assist with lead generation, CRM updates, scheduling, and transactions in a real estate setting. Great for candidates from coordination-heavy roles (QA, Training, Recruitment) who are organized, proactive, and ready to thrive in a tech-powered real estate environment. Bookkeeping VA ‚Äì Support financial tasks and operations using AI tools. Ideal for those with a bookkeeping or accounting background‚Äîespecially QA, Training, or Recruitment pros experienced in compliance and process work. Familiarity with accounting software and digital tools is a must. Customer Support VA ‚Äì Deliver responsive support via email, chat, and phone. Perfect for professionals from QA, Training, or Recruitment ready to pivot into customer-facing work. Strong communication skills and comfort with AI tools for efficient service are essential. Sales VA ‚Äì Drive sales support through lead generation, outreach, CRM updates, and pipeline coordination. Ideal for process- and communication-focused professionals (Training, Recruitment, QA) eager to contribute to sales in a tech-enabled setup. Marketing VA ‚Äì Support campaigns, data analysis, content planning, and email execution. Best for structured thinkers from QA, Training, or Recruitment transitioning into marketing. Strong digital skills, attention to detail, and eagerness to support strategy and execution are key. Job Details: Work Setup : Fully remote / work from home (WFH) Schedule : Mirror your client's preferred schedule, US business hours (fixed shift at the start but can be flexible depending on your arrangement with the client assigned to you) Employment Type : full-time preferred (40 hrs a week) but there are clients looking for part time (20hrs/week) Rate: Starting at $5.50‚Äì$6.00/hr , based on your role, skills, and experience. This opportunity is ideal for career shifters or capable newcomers to the virtual assistant industry, as the tasks are straightforward and not overly complex‚Äîperfect for building your experience and growing with us.

A: We match you with your assigned client‚Äôs preferred schedule‚Äîusually during US business hours. While shifts are fixed at the start, there‚Äôs room for flexibility depending on your arrangement with the client.

We will never be able to offer you $8, that‚Äôs too high for the Philippines. I wish you good luck with that. You don‚Äôt have to take the course. I‚Äôm not desperate, I have enough cold callers.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ seriously?? It‚Äôs so frustrating that some clients think Filipino VAs should always settle for low rates just because of where we live. We put in just as much effort, skill, and professionalism as anyone else globally. $4/hr doesn‚Äôt reflect the value we bring, especially when we already have years of experience and proven results. I get that budgets vary, but I really wish more clients understood that hiring a VA is investing in someone‚Äôs expertise, not just ‚Äúcheap labor.‚Äù Wala lang! Kainis lang. üò§",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I've been a VA for 6 years. I've managed to get high paying clients with flexible schedules and it's been good for me. I've had tech, E-commerce, logistics industry clients. I've been rank and file, mid manager, senior Management. But all throughout I've been isolated. Lagi akong direct clients no other pinoys in my previous and current work so I don't have a solid community. I never went through an agency myself. Or these paid online courses. I learned from my previous corpo job and YouTube. Point is, I don't know how an agency manages the business, the people, the training, etc. So I'm curious, how does one start an agency? I went back to the province (rural area less than 2k population)and there's an empty house in our compound that I can use as an office. There's lots of out of school youth here and stay at home mothers who needs work. There's college students here na bumabiyahe ng around 30 km per day just to go to school and uwian sila because they have to work in their farmlands or other parttime jobs. They're literate naman. And can use computers so I guess it won't be that hard to teach. I want to help our community. How did you start building your agency? How much capital? How did you market yourself as an agency to acquire clients? What permits are needed? If I am to use our other house as an office, would 2 units of PCs be enough for now?",

      "content_preview": "I just wanted to share na finally, after 3 months of being unemployed, finally I got a client and this is my first ever client in real estate, and he's so nice and very responsive kapag may mga tanong ako. Past few days nadepress nako kakaisip kung pano na yung rent ko, food and basic needs ko this month kase ubos na talaga budget ko and natutulala nalang ako hahaha, and then 2 days ago, this recruiter of mine na nakilala ko lang dito sa reddit pero american sya, texted me on discord na I got you hired! My reply was, \"FOR REAL?\", I didn't even do a thing, I just slept and woke up tapos may work na ko?!! Like \"DI NGA?\" hahaha. He typically did the pitch for me to get this first client of mine, and I'm beyond grateful to this guy. A little about me, I've been in the BPO for 6 years now, and last May I resigned from my previous job, toxic yung boss, tao, and onsite, and it's taking a toll on my mental health, yeah, the pay was good, but pagod na nga ako kakacommute, pagod pa utak ko sa dami ng workload dagdag mo pa mga toxic na tao sa paligid, I didn't deserve that! Di ko na din inisip mangyayari sa susunod, kase nagresign ako ng walang back up. I was able to get my final pay, and it was surprisingly big, haha, na nakapagbayad ako ng rent 2 months ahead. I took a risk and bought a MacBook laptop and a monitor because I've been planning to be a VA since then. Wfh, higher pay, like \"WHY NOT?\" I have skills, naman. Tried applying to multiple VA agencies, super powers- di nakapasa sa initial lol, tvh, nakapasa ako sa final interview pero after 3-days training, toink, tanggal hahaha Cried about it, but, sabe ko ok lang confident naman ako sa skills ko, prefer nila yung may experience, alam mo na, mas malaki makukuha nila sa mga yun kesa saming mga baguhan. then apply ulit sa Virtudesk- bagsak sa initial interview, nagloko internet ko that time, kaiyak, then magic- bagsak sa initial interview. Honestly, sa 3 months kong walang work at palaging nakakareceive ng rejection after rejection, ang exhausting pala nun no, di  nga pagod sa work pero pagod naman kakaisip pano nako makasurvive bukas, wala nakong budget and my bills are piling up and ang scary sa pakiramdam na parang nakakababa ng self esteem na parang gusto mo na sumuko. Dumating din sa point na kinikwestsyon ko na sarili ko, tama ba talaga naging desisyon ko na magresign sa previous work ko? even though, deep inside, I know, tama yung desisyon ko, kase nakuha ko naman pabalik yung peace of mind ko kaso nakakapanghina minsan maniwala sa sarili alam mo yun. and then \"tama ba na ginasta ko yung pera sa bagong laptop?\", magkano din yung it can support my rent for like next year. Like tama paba mga desisyon kosa buhay? hahaha. Sa 3 months na wala akong trabaho, lahat na ata ng makita ko inaapplyan ko na hahaha di nako choosy, kahit onsite inaapplyan ko na, gusto talaga wfh pero hirap talaga makahanp ng wfh ngayon specially sa mga BPO/inhouse :( Then, I remember the quote na nabasa ko somewhere, \"Once God is silent, he's preparing something greater, in his right time\", sabe ko kay Lord sa prayer ko, \"Kelan yung right time Lord, yung bills ko di na makapaghintay\" hahaha kidding aside, It's true, I'm a testimony, kung tingin mo tahimik si Lord ngayon, wait ka lang, ikaw naman yung magiging testimony next time. Just keep praying and keep your faith in him. Tomorrow start kona. Finally!!! Talked with the client earlier on Google Meet with my onboarding guy and it was amazing, no introduction, get to the point agad ano yung work at mga tasks ko and then done! Naalala ko tuloy mga va agency, like ang taas ng standard, papagawan ka pa ng introduction video na may requirements na dapat perfect yung angle at kabisado mo sasabihin mo, kainis no? but overall, I know I deserve this, God knows, I trusted and kept my faith kahit nagdududa nako minsan sa sarili ko. I'm soo happy na parang dami ko pa gusto sabihin hahahaP.S. Sorry haba :)",
