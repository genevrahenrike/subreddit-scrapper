We live just outside LA so I am planning on driving in Friday morning and leaving Sunday afternoon.  Right now the tentative  itinerary I have is Friday go to the zoo (she LOVES giraffes), hang out downtown and maybe hit a casino at night. Saturday take the tram to Mount San Jacinto and roam around, do a light hike (read that it will be cold and possibly snowing!) and Sunday check out a couple museums before we drive home. I'm open to any advice or recommendations on things to do and when to do them.  The things I listed are just kind of what stuck out to me.   Just want to make it a fun, easy going anniversary!",

Although it did take two phone calls,  I’m grateful they called me back. My experience was professional, quick, convenient and affordable for being after hours, 8:00pm. I spoke with Thomas at 8:32pm, he gave me a quote over the phone. I agreed to the pricing, he said he would be here in 30 minutes. 8:50 pm he was at my apartment complex.  For my job it probably took him less than 15-20 minutes to open my front door and make me two keys on site.  I was going to get my keys made at a kiosk, but I was very happy with the service so I decided to pay more for the convenience and support a local business.  I highly recommend this company. Thank you Thomas and LATC 🤙🏾",
