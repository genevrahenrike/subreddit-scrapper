      "content_preview": "As the film / TV industry in the US is really rough these days, and with the state of the US being what it is… I am about 50/50… maybe even 60/40 on thinking of leaving the US next year. A major part of whats holding me back is that more than being a filmmaker, I want be a TV writer. I havent seen much foreign TV outside of Canadian shows or Australian shows but I’m more so considering Canada since its closest to the US and I have some friends there. A big part of whats holding me back is that I just moved to LA and dont want to let go of my dream of being a TV writer in Hollywood. I havent even really got my foot in the door here yet :/ I would love to hear from any American filmmakers/TV writers specifically about moving abroad and what their experience has been like. Id love to know if its still possible to write for TV in other countries as an expat.",

So, out of curiosity, I decided to build my own simple file transfer service to share with the community. It’s nothing fancy, just a way to move files quickly, completely free Not trying to market anything here, just wanted to give back since this subreddit has been super helpful to me. If it helps even one person here avoid stress during delivery, I’ll call that a win. https://moretransfer.com Would love to hear what you think and get some feedback. Thank you in advance.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I’ve always wanted to be a film director. I work closely with my mom on all of our projects, she’s basically my producing partner, and we’ve been building things together for the last few years. My main interest is in drama and action, somewhere in the space of Breaking Bad for TV or Kill Bill for film. A few years ago, I made a short film called BILLIARD as a pure passion project. It’s 30 minutes long, slow, philosophical, very dialogue heavy, with (what we think is) great cinematography and acting. It’s the kind of thing I want to make, but honestly, it might come off as boring to some audiences. We still haven’t released it publicly because we don’t have the funds to properly promote it. That same year, I made a completely different short for class called ELI & NOAH EAT A POPEYES CHICKEN SANDWICH. It’s basically a stoner comedy, and I didn’t expect much from it… but somehow it got into the Atlanta Film Festival. During its festival run, my mom and I put most of our focus on it, thinking maybe it could have legs as an episodic. She believes it has a shot at being picked up, so we even shot a second episode. We released it today, but it hasn’t gotten the buzz we were hoping for. Of course it's only been a day, we're thinking with viral marketing it can be given a bit of traction. I have high hopes for it. Now I’m honestly not sure what the next step is. Should I keep trying to push the episodic idea? Go back to creating projects that are closer to my voice, even if they’re harder to market? Or should I take a step back and focus on building smaller work to get noticed first?

You can see it with the AI generated trailers that they make, and the crazy thing is that it doesn’t even look that bad. In the future, you won’t be able see the difference between what’s real and what’s AI, so why would production companies spend millions on paying directors, writers, DOPs, editors and actors when they can just make AI do the work for free? If I ran a production company, I would’ve forbidden that. We need our movies to be made by humans, so it’ll feel real. That’s something that is worth spending money on, we’ve seen it with movies today. If AI takes over the film industry, movies will suck and kids’ dreams will be shattered.",

      "content_preview": "I was the Assistant Director—and at times, even acted as the Line Producer—on the film The Barista, which wrapped in May 2024. I still haven’t been paid. When I called out the director and producers on social media, they threatened to sue me for “embarrassing” them. The producers and director of the project are: Brian Shackelford - Director/producer Joyce Fitzpatrick - Producer Marc Harris - Producer Carolyn Nelson Henry - Producer Vivian Matito - Producer David Skato - Producer Doug Schwab - Producer I was hired at the very last minute—literally confirmed the day before filming began. All I was told: It would be a 10-day shoot. The script was over 100 pages. “Most” cast and crew were confirmed (they weren’t). The crew constantly changed, key roles were filled last-minute, and locations were still being found during the shoot. There was no production designer or production assistants—I did much of that work myself. We finished filming in 9 days. After that, they vanished. No communication. No payments. Crew members and agents began contacting me about money they were owed. They also broke promises to my friends who helped as PAs, refusing to pay them because they “didn’t have cars.” I drove them to set myself. Serious misconduct: An actress had a contract clause requiring an intimacy coordinator. The producers ignored it. When her agent complained, they dismissed her as “acting out.” She was later injured during a fight scene, and the producers’ response was: “It doesn’t matter, we got the shot.” I’ve filed a complaint with the California Labor Department and will continue speaking out. I may never get paid, but I won’t stay silent while people like this exploit others. Evidence & conversations here",

Work/productivity), and because of that, I'm hoping to get one with the best possible camera for video recording on the fly, so I can use this for semi-professional projects until I can afford a dedicated video camera. I've narrowed down my preferences to the following: -iPhone 17 Pro Max. Pros: expected to be the highest quality camera, Cons: expected to be the highest price. -Pixel 10 XL Pro. Pros: Seems like great quality for the most part, and rivals the iPhone 16 Pro Max in many cases. Cons: AI enhancement sometimes looks a little artificial, and I'm not the biggest fan of how much Google is leaning into AI. -Samsung S26 Ultra. Pros: The new Pixel/iPhone might push Samsung to really step up their camera game in the next phone. Cons: Samsung seems to be following Google in how much they are using AI in their videography/photography software. Obviously, one of these phones is released, and the other two we haven't seen yet. If the iPhone or S26 releases and 💩s the bed, obviously they will rule themselves out. But based on performance of prior brand models, and expectations of improvements in upcoming models, what would you go with?",

      "content_preview": "My entire life I've been completely consumed by film (among other things). I've always had it in the back of my mind that I'd like to someday get into filmmaking myself, but never did take any actionable steps to get there- I guess kind of like now, I've always been intimidated by the craft, as it encompasses so much, majority of which is well beyond my understanding. But I guess, how can I understand (and subsequently be intimidated by) something I've never actively studied- have only ever dreamed. I think something I freak myself needlessly out with is looking at the scale of the productions/films I consume- obviously dipping my toes into the shallow end of the kiddie pool won't look anything like that... yet despite knowing so, it's still a strange barrier/scare-tactic I impose on myself. There's so much I'd like to write about and portray via film, but am so incredibly scared off and intimidated by this image I've conjured up in my mind of all that it is, even if I know the bar to entry is just a camera, which I've got (a DSLR that does video, plus a damn iPhone)... Of course it'd be a dream to someday be recognized, but I'm not so deluded to expect that of the first several dozen things I do, if I even ever end up doing so many things (even just small-scale shorts)... Yet even knowing nothing is riding on this, I still have this aversion of actually taking the first baby steps, whatever they are. Maybe I don't have anything important to say after all, and this is my minds way of keeping me at bay- I don't know. Any advice for a chronic over-thinker like myself who's looking to get into this later in life, at the ripe old age of 35 1/2?",

As such, there are tons and tons of things I learned while doing and am still learning now. Like I never understood negotiating rates with below-the-line crew in order to manage the budget until I was on the hiring side. I didn't know that festivals had a preference to film premieres, even for short films. Most importantly, I didn't realise how much having a legally registered production company with a 3D-animated ident and a cool website legitimised you as a producer (this is true for where I live, not sure about the rest of the world). What are things you wish you knew about producing that you only learned much later?",

It was a massive production that is being made for a major streaming service with several very well known actors. I was only brought on for 1/4 days in this location shoot and even though I got there early, delivered film to a local post house twice and overall avoided getting yelled at for anything for the most part I’m still worried I somehow did terrible, all because the Key PA hasn’t texted me back, which is stupid because he pulled me onto channel 2 and said I did really well and said the same thing again before sending me to drop more footage from the day at the post house. Is this feeling of impostor syndrome common or am I just losing it? Sorry for the rambling lol.",

I have added 10+ new packs this month including distant fireworks which I was able to record at a gathering in Risan, Montenegro, Some horror suspense FX and atmospheres I designed from recorded and CC0 content and some room tones of different variations along with some light rain recordings. With Squarespace it does ask for a lot of personal information so you can use this site to make up fake address and just use a fake name and email if you're not comfortable with providing this info. I don't use it for anything but for your own piece of mind this is probably beneficial. There is only one pack for sale on the site for 4.99 and can only be purchased through PayPal. You do not have to purchase this to use any of the samples on the website all are free and CC0. This pack is just for people who would like to download all packs in one go and all the packs not on the site The price helps cover the bandwidth as this file is hosted on a separate platform to Squarespace as it is too large for it. It also helps me cover the costs and helps me keep the website running. Again you do not need to purchase this pack to use the samples CC0. Just take them free and use as you wish. These sounds have been downloaded millions of times and used in all sorts of creative projects, especially the Foley packs and the Atmospheric Loops. I think filmmakers can get a lot out of the wide range of sounds on the site, especially for building immersive soundscapes and adding detail in post. Useful categories include: Field Recordings (e.g. forests, beaches, roadsides, cities, cafes, malls, grocery stores, etc.) – great for background ambience and location building. Foley Kits – ideal for adding realism to scenes through detailed sound design (e.g. footsteps, abstract ambiences, etc ). There are thousands of these. Unusual Percussion Foley (e.g. Coca-Cola Can Drum Kit, Forest Organics, broken light bulb shakes, Lego piece foley, etc.) great for stylised transitions, title sequences, or abstract sound design moments. Atmospheric Loops, Music, and Textures – useful for mood setting, emotional moments, or filling out quiet scenes. Feel free to use anything you like, everything is CC0, so no need to credit me or the site. Just grab what you need and make cool stuff. I'd love to see what you create if you feel like sharing! Join me at r/musicsamplespacks if you would like as that is where I will be posting all future packs. If you guys know of any other subreddits that might benefit from these sounds feel free to repost it there. Phil",

      "content_preview": "I'm asking this for a friend, she sent me this text. I have a conundrum and I want you to pick one and tell me why. If you were a baby filmmaker with 1 directing, producing & writing experience (no film school, little technical equipment experience, just YouTube and hustle), would you pick opportunity 1 or 2 if your goal was to continue to build a personal portfolio, network, and get the on-set experience to capably manage my own in the future as a director: 1: This camera assistant workshop ( https://caps.sheridancollege.ca/index.cfm?method=Certificates.CertificateNameInformation&int_certificateID=40 ). 9-5 for two weeks, hands-on learning, taught by a unionized expert. about $1,600 in fees or 2: Just plain buying sound equipment in order to apply for un / low paid, entry level location sound recordist work (I've taken a workshop so I'll know how to use the stuff). Hoping to buy a mixer/recorder, shock mount, etc and the tally will come out to about $1,600-$2,000. I'm grateful to have savings that'll cover either opportunity, but I can't pay for both right now. Which would you do with my goals in mind? Also noting I have no preference to be skilled in camera or sound, just technically skilled in something.",

      "content_preview": "I really wish someone would make movies that adapt Shakespeare’s plays faithfully — same plot, same characters — but with all the dialogue translated into modern English . Not loose modern reimaginings like 10 Things I Hate About You , and not “set in modern times but still using the original text” like Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet . I’m talking about films that mirror the plays line-for-line, only updating the language so they’re easy to follow for modern audiences. The setting itself could be modernised or kept in the original time period — either would work, as long as the dialogue is fully updated. Does anything like this exist, or is it just a dream project waiting to happen?",

We have a indie feature film where a character only texts using emoji's, and just want to make sure we stay clear of any issues during production. Do we have to make our own custom emojis for this? Or is just using the default ones in Apple's ios fine to show on screen. Thanks for your input.",
