Plus, I haven‚Äôt researched (overwhelmed with info) so if anyone has suggestions on where to park, walk, and picnic with a view I‚Äôd appreciate your suggestions. (I do know to pack lots of water, food & sunscreen). Our first trip without our kids so relaxing, easy-going & spontaneous is the theme! Thank you!üôè",

      "content_preview": "I found out yesterday work is sending me to Tempe at the end of Sept.  I would love to stay the weekend and drive up to the GC, as I have never been there.  I invited my parents to join me; they have never been there either and it's a bucket list item for both of them.  My mom doesn't walk well, so I've limited hiking to ada trails.  A quick search, I found the Rim Trail that also follows the shuttle.  So we could walk part of the way, and then ride the rest to see more.  Maybe even allowing my dad and I more walking than my mom can do. Two different possibilities for days: We could arrive at GC Friday night, have all day Saturday, and hopefully find a later Sunday flight and have time to drive to airport Sunday morning.  This was my first thought due to already taking off quite a bit in Aug, but maybe a bit too rushed?  Maybe not if we just did the shuttle/shorter hikes? If I could swing the time off, we could have two full days (Monday-Tuesday).  However, without the ability to do a longer day hike, do we need the time?  How long does it take to drive/shuttle around the South Rim and see the stops?  The more time we have, the more we can see/do, but I also know our activities are limited and downtime doing \"nothing\" is asking for drama between the three of us.  I have to keep them busy! So: thoughts on how much time we really need? Are there other ADA trails (short or with shuttle stops frequently enough to jump on when needed)?  Favorite ADA hikes? Anything I'm not thinking of?",

I finished chemo recently and my parents and I figured if we're ever going to see the National Parks we should go now with whatever health we have left. Dad might help with some driving but he has mild Parkinson's so I will be the main driver. My original itinerary was the following overnights (8/31 EDITED TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR): Day 1: fly into Las Vegas early morning, get rental, show parents Las Vegas highlights Day 2: drive to Grand Canyon and stop at Hoover Dam on the way- Day 3: GC Day 4: see highlights of Desert View Road while leaving GC, drive to Page do 89A road and see Horseshoe Bend sleep at Page Day 5: do Upper Antelope Slot Canyon  before driving to Monuments (2 nights Gouldings and The View) Day 6: Monument Valley Day 7: drive to Moab if get there early enough after 4pm can drive into Arches without car reservation Day 8: Arches National Park early morning - if time, late afternoon do Mesa Arch Day 9: drive to Bryce Canyon On way to Bryce stop at Canyonlands early morning to see Mesa Arch (parents will not be able to do Delicate Arch at Arches NP so figure they should do this instead) Day 10: Bryce Canyon Day 11: Drive to Zion spend most of day there Day 12:  Zion Day 13: back to Vegas and then evening flight back home We were going to Page see Upper Antelope Canyon, Horseshoe Bend and possibly Navajo Bridge on the 89A. I had called one Upper Antelope Canyon tour company that told me it was ok for my parents to go through the Canyon and then go back the way they came in to avoid the staircase and that they do this with the elderly and young children. With that exception in mind (and after watching the videos of the slope and height of the staircase) we decided to book a tour. When I got the email it made it very clear that EVERYONE in our party HAD to go through the staircase and if the tour guide deemed anyone in the party not healthy enough to do this, we'd forfeit our reservation and not be refunded. We no longer want to risk doing Upper Antelope Canyon and will be getting a full refund (we're within the refund cancellation period). I now have an extra day in the beginning of the trip. I know my parents don't want to do the mule trips down to mid canyon (I might do this on my own if there is time), so I'm not sure why we'd need an extra day at GC unless we just wanted to relax a bit in the beginning before the rest of the road trip. They have never been to Las Vegas and are not foodies, but I think they'd love a good magic show. With the extra day in either Vegas or GCNP, I was thinking maybe we could still detour to Page but just see Horseshoe Bend and do the 89A drive to Navajo Bridge. Would love your opinions on this itinerary.",

      "content_preview": "Inspired by this comment on a parallel post about running route options , and frustrated with how hard it was to find a simple map that didn't require constant zooming in and out and getting e-lost, I decided to make a simplified \"transit-style\" map of the main trails in Grand Canyon National Park. I started by piecing together the loops mentioned in the comment linked above, then remembered that Jamil Coury has a video of Walmsley doing an alternate R2R2R on Bass , which led to the second version below that includes the full Tonto from Garnet Canyon and the road linkages used by this FKT. I had fun putting this together, and thought maybe it would be useful to someone else, even if just to help internalize the lay of the land.

      "content_preview": "Did the Grand Canyon this past Spring, and after researching here a bunch and then going over there to do it all, I figured I would share the itinerary that we did and enjoyed very much. The trip was 5 days, with 2 days lost to travel so really 3 full days to experience the Grand Canyon. We really wanted to see as much as we could, as we likely won‚Äôt get back out there in this lifetime. So, these 3 days were definitely packed full of activities, with next to no time spent at the hotel. I also admit we did have a little bit of a preference towards more touristy, commonly visited destinations. We flew into Phoenix and were targeting the South Rim but bounced around all over. We got a hotel in Williams, as it was a perfect central location. Here is what we did: Day 1: Started out by driving up to the Grand Canyon National Park first thing in the morning. Walked the rim and took 1000 pictures, did the Bright Angel Trail (only a mile or so down, through the two arches before coming back up), and had lunch in the park. Stopped in Tusayan on the way out for some ice cream and chocolates. Grabbed dinner in Flagstaff (NiMarco‚Äôs Pizza) and did a little nightlife. Day 2: Drove out to Grand Canyon West first thing in the morning to do the Skywalk. If you come from Williams, you also pass the Joshua Tree Forest, which is cool to see and take a few pics of from the side of the road. The folks that operate the park seemed to have heard the feedback everyone was saying about being a tourist trap, and they are at least letting people bring out phones and take their own pictures now. Is it still a little pricey? Yes, but there is nothing else like it in my opinion. Worth doing once in your life, and there are some other nice areas in that park worth walking, such as Guano Point. We wrapped up at Grand Canyon West around noon, and began our next drive, this time to the Hoover Dam. On the way we stopped at the best hole-in-the-wall hot dog joint, Hot Diggety Dog of Dolan Springs. Once at the dam, we did a tour of the power plant as the dam tours weren‚Äôt running that day, but it was still a cool experience as you are going on an elevator hundreds of feet down inside of the dam structure. We also walked up on the Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, also known as the Hoover Dam Bypass. Great view from up there. We wrapped up the evening with dinner and shopping in Williams, which is a great little historic Route 66 city. Day 3: We started day 3 by driving east out to Page to do a half-day river rafting trip. They take you out on a motorized boat, very calm waters. You go through Horseshoe Bend, see some wild horses, dip your toes in the water or swim if you‚Äôd like, and stop on the banks to view the petroglyphs. Seeing the canyon from both the top and bottom was a must for us. We grabbed lunch in Page and then did a tour of Lower Antelope Canyon, which was breathtaking. Before leaving Page, we also stopped at the overlook at the top of Horseshoe Bend so we could see the area we had just rafted through from a higher vantage point. Was worth doing as the view there is great. Grabbed dinner on the road, and did the Canyon Coaster Adventure Park when we were back in Williams. On the surface to those who have not been to the area, it may not sound like a lot of activities. Until you draw out everything I mentioned on a map and see how much area you are actually covering. We spent 5-7¬† hours in the car each day, but we also saw such a wide range of landscapes and views. This type of trip might not be for everyone, but there is also no way to do everything I mentioned in one trip without doing a fair deal of driving. Hope this helps at least one person out there who is planning their trip!",

One of our party climbed the ladder to the rope hanging out of the canyon and pulled himself up. He‚Äôs partly visible at top left. The river is in the foreground; I must have taken this pic from the boat. I‚Äôm sure the ladder and rope have long since vanished. The rock unit looks like the Muav.
