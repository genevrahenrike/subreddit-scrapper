      "content_preview": "Been testing Aura VPN recently and here are some quick facts for anyone curious: Platforms: iOS & Android (no desktop clients yet). Protocol: Runs on WireGuard, so connections are generally fast and lightweight. UI: Very simple, one-tap connect/disconnect. No unnecessary clutter. Streaming: Worked fine for Netflix/yt during my testing, smooth playback. Privacy: Claims no-log policy, but no independent audits yet. Torrenting: Limited to mobile, but WireGuard helps maintain stable speeds. Servers: Smaller network than big providers, but covers main regions. Overall feels like a minimal, mobile-first VPN that does the basics well without trying to overload you with features. Has anyone else tried it for day-to-day streaming or public Wi-Fi security?",

Been getting \"You have been blocked for malicious activity\" across increasingly high numbers of websites all using cloudfare. Everything from cooking recipe sites, gaming websites, tech news sites, ebook sites. The issue is persisting and becoming increasingly frustrating as it's taking longer and longer of constantly refreshing servers trying to find an ip that's not borked just to browse the internet normally. I will say this issue has primarily been on mobile Nordvpn though I don't use nordvpn as much on pc nor do I browse much on pc so I can't correlate pc being OK or not. Tried posting issues on nordvpns reddit specifically and post was immediately removed by reddit filters? Any other vpns struggling with similar issues? Is cloudfare targeting all vpn traffic?",

One use case that I hear many people talk about is to stream movies illegally. I personally know people who got billed by their ISP for illegal streaming, so I do understand this concern. Using a VPN will obviously hide your IP, but it will transfer the responsibility over to the VPN provider. If the ISP is punishing these copyright violations, why wouldn’t the ISP of the VPN server do the same thing to the VPN provider? I mean, at the end of the day, the VPN server allowed this activity in the first place. The VPN provider may have a zero-log policy, but the ISP of the VPN server may keep logs and use them against the VPN provider. Is the VPN provider taking bullets for us then?",

Proton and Mullvad seem to offer better reputation. Surfshark meanwhile is really cheap (Great for student like me) and seems to offer more features for the ONE subscription.

I was previously with vpnarea with a subscription, before they just vanished. I am looking at switching to either Mullvad, or to Windscribe, ideally using the companies own gui apps. Mullvad has more servers (730) Is in Sweden (14 eyes) They offer 5 simultaneous connections Kind of have a browser extension? They have support for 3 linux distro's (debian, ubuntu, fedora) Windscribe has fewer severs (178) Is in Canada (5 eyes) They offer an unknown amount of simultaneous connections. (within reason basically) They have a firefox extension They have support for 6 linux distro's (debian, ubuntu, fedora, centos, arch, opensuse) Both of them seem to tick most of the same boxes otherwise, Mullvad would have more payment options. It is good that I have 2 solid options, but I have no idea which one to pick, I am leaning towards Windscribe, but the lack of servers could be an issue. I am in the southern hemisphere, in a country on the verge of destroying internet privacy (Australia) Using Manjaro KDE (Arch base. Official repositories and flatpak preferred distro) Using Nobara Custom KDE (Fedora base. Flatpak preferred distro) Android 14 Total: pc, mini pc/htpc, phone, plus potentially girlfriend's laptop and phone. Mullvad's 5 connection limit is a bit tight, but possibly okay. Hoping for some input from people who have use either, or both, especially with linux and android experience, but that is only part of it.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share my horrible experience with Surfshark VPN in the hope that it helps others avoid going through the same nightmare. December 2024: I purchased a 2-year Surfshark VPN plan for $66.45. I used a brand-new forex card for the transaction. March 2025: I got logged out of my account. I received an email saying that the registered email on the account had been changed. I hadn’t done this. I immediately contacted Surfshark. Surfshark responded saying that someone contacted their support team and provided my payment information, and based on that, they allowed the email on the account to be changed. 🤯 Since March 2025, my Surfshark account has been compromised 5 times. Yes, FIVE. After the third time, Surfshark told me they had “flagged” my account and that going forward, any request to change the account email would require a valid bank statement. I felt some relief… but then it happened two more times. Today, on July 28, 2025, it got hacked yet again. So much for account flagging and secure procedures. They failed to protect my account repeatedly, despite being notified. They also failed to follow their own so-called “security policy” regarding account changes. Why This Is a Serious Red Flag? Either Surfshark is being actively exploited and not disclosing it publicly… Or their internal procedures are dangerously flawed, allowing anyone with partial info to hijack accounts. Either way, it shows that your data, identity, and money are not safe with them. Avoid Surfshark at all costs. Their support is incompetent, their system is vulnerable, and even after you get hacked multiple times, they’ll shrug their shoulders. If you value your privacy, go elsewhere. You're better off with a VPN that takes security and accountability seriously.",

      "content_preview": "Hi all. Looking to start using a VPN. Take a look at news from the UK and you might see why. Im looking to use a pair VPN, I dont trust the free options, they must be getting money to operate, if they're not charging for the service I feel like I won't like their revenue source. With that in mind, I've narrowed things down to NordVPN or Mullvad. The general consensus seems to be that Nord is the best of the very well known VPNs, although some seem to feel the fact its so well known and seen in so many sponsorships is a bad thing. Mullvad seems to be less well known by the masses, but those that know of it seem to give it high praise. My own feelings distill down to this, Mullvad seems to be better for privacy, you dont have to hand over any personal data to create an account or pay if you dont wish to, and its been proven on several occasions that they dont keep logs or anything. Nord, by contrast, may not be quite as robust on privacy, but it seems to offer more features, such as a password manager. I am, however, a little suspicious when I look at their packages and see they are offering amazon vouchers for taking out anything more than their basic package .... thst just feels off, like something dodgy is going on behind the scenes. Id like some opinions on how the two stack up in others opinions if you wouldn't mind, as well as anything I may not have considered that I should.",

      "content_preview": "As of July 25, the UK rolled out that age verification law for adult sites including Pornhub. Basically, you now need to hand over your ID just to watch adult content. Wild. If you're not cool with giving up your personal info to random third-party verification systems based in US (understandably), here’s a super simple fix: use a VPN. A VPN hides your UK IP and lets you appear as if you're browsing from somewhere else like the Netherlands, Belgium, wherever. This way, you can unblock Pornhub in UK without going through any verification stuff. There are tons of VPNs out there. They cost around $3/month and give you both privacy and access. I usually check this comparison table if I am looking to renew my VPN subscription. Lately, I’ve Been using NordVPN (got it with “ redditoffer ” coupon discount), but in the past I’ve also tried Surfshark and it did the job fine as well. Once you download the app, just pick any non-UK server (Germany, Belgium, Spain), hit connect, and boom Pornhub unblocked. No more Big Brother breathing down your neck. It also works for other sites like xHamster, XNXX, YouPorn, Redtube as well as Reddit NSFW subs etc. Whole thing takes like 2 minutes. Ah, also, my advice don't use free VPN's, I know many people will think it's a good idea, but they also sell your data and are trash, just a heads‑up.",

I'm sure that the AmneziaVPN developers could have simply specified the maximum possible values for the key length and other encryption parameters in the parameters. But for some reason they didn't do that. For example, when installing OpenVPN-Cloak, I can't change the encryption type. Unfortunately, the encryption parameters are not specified in the scripts. The encryption parameters, such as the type (RSA) and the key length (2048 bits), are hardcoded in the source file amnezia-client\\client\\3rd\\QSimpleCrypto\\src\\include\\QRsa.h These are the weakest possible encryption parameters supported by the OpenVPN standard. Instead of elliptic curves, they specify in the openssl parameters to use RSA in its weakest version: 2048 bits. I suspect that the other protocols in AmneziaVPN are also programmed with parameters that are most vulnerable to hacking. What do you gentlemen think about this?",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been using Surfshark VPN for a while now, so I thought I’d share my experience with this top-rated VPN. If you’re thinking about getting a reliable and secure VPN, here’s why I think Surfshark might be worth it. First of all, I travel a lot, and that means I often have to rely on public Wi-Fi at hotels, airports, and coffee shops. Let’s be honest public Wi-Fi is not exactly the safest.. That’s why I started using Surfshark it ensures my personal data stays private no matter where I am. Surfshark has a strict no-logs policy. For me, knowing that my data isn’t being stored or tracked makes me feel much more secure online. It’s one less thing to worry about when browsing or handling sensitive information like emails or banking. One of the standout features for me is that you can protect unlimited devices with just one Surfshark subscription. I use it on my laptop, phone, and tablet, and it’s also great because my family can use it too - all for just about $2/month. Plus, I used found a coupon code, \" redditspecial \", that gave me an extra discount to make the price even better. Another thing worth mentioning is that Surfshark has over 3,200 servers in 100 countries, which means I never have to worry about slow connections or limited options. It’s reliable and works seamlessly wherever I am. Also, Surfshark also works on pretty much all devices there are such as Windows laptop, IPhone, IPad, etc. One last thing that I want to mention is Surfshark offers additional features like ad-blocking and cookie pop-up blocker. Both of those made my browsing experience much smoother, no more stupid ads nor cookie pop ups on every website. To sum up, Surfshark really ticks all the boxes for me - it’s affordable, easy to use, and super reliable. It’s honestly one of the best VPN options out there if you’re looking for a VPN compatible with various devices. I hope this review helps. If you have any questions about Surfshark, feel free to let me know.",

Nord Does not work with custom DNS. NextDNS is a must for me. I'd rather do without a VPN than lose NextDNS. Otherwise, this has the best features. SurfShark WireGuard configuration is not compatible or does not work on my brand of router. I used Ubiquiti, which is a known unresolved issue. All the on-device features work great. But if I can't get it to work on my router, it's not very useful overall. Proton This comes highly recommended. It has the fewest features and is missing a critical one. There is no selective auto-connect. VPN must be left on all the time or set to manual connection. For example, I can't set the VPN not to use cellular data or not connect when at home, since I have VPN enabled on my router. If I set it to manual, I'm bound to forget to turn it on when away from home. Not to mention, my family members will never turn in manually.

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I recently installed ProtonVPN on my macOS and noticed something odd: a system extension called “com.apple.networkextension.app-proxy ProtonVPN Plutonium” listed under System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions. The strange part is that there’s no official documentation about this extension anywhere on ProtonVPN’s site or support pages. It’s like it appeared out of nowhere, under a codename — Plutonium — which doesn’t explain what it does or why it’s needed. I reached out to ProtonVPN support and posted a question on their official subreddit r/ProtonVPN , but here’s what happened: Support responded quickly at first, saying they didn’t know what the extension was and that my question had been forwarded to the developers. I was told to wait for further feedback. Meanwhile, my Reddit post was never actually published — it remained stuck in the “Post is awaiting moderator approval.” status. However, a comment appeared almost immediately under the post from the Proton Customer Support Team account: \"Hey, we're waiting on feedback from our devs on this one and we'll get back to you as soon as we have any info on the matter. Thanks for your patience.\" Then... silence. For the next two days, I received no response from support, and my subreddit post remained unpublished. Finally, on the third day, I got answers from both channels: From ProtonVPN Support (email): \"I am following up regarding your concern about the Plutonium extension. We have consulted with the developers, and I want to inform you that this is an internal codename for an upcoming feature that was already announced for our macOS client, but is not live yet, and because of that, the extension doesn't have the official name yet. I cannot share any further details for the time being, but I'd suggest following our Blog or social media channels for any news and updates. Once again, accept our apologies if this has caused any inconvenience.\" From the ProtonVPN Reddit moderator: \"This is related to an upcoming feature that's pending release, so thank you for your understanding in us keeping the post behind automod, and thank you for your patience while we had the chance to respond back. An announcement about said feature is coming in due time so stay tuned. We can't say exactly which one, but to give you a hint, it's on our current roadmap.\" ========================================= To be honest, this all feels a bit troubling: We’re talking about a system-level network extension that gets installed automatically, shows up in macOS settings, and has zero official documentation , aside from an obscure codename: Plutonium . The subreddit post was deliberately held back — confirmed by the moderator themselves — which comes across, frankly, as an attempt to control the messaging. Telling users to “follow our blog” is a strange approach when a low-level system component is already active on people’s machines. I’m not making accusations, but this isn’t the level of transparency I expect from a company that positions itself as privacy-first. If anyone else has spotted this extension or is able to monitor its behavior (e.g. via traffic analysis), I’d appreciate any additional insight.",

      "content_preview": "If you’ve suddenly found yourself unable to access Pornhub in Georgia, Wyoming, or South Dakota or anywhere else in America, you’re not imagining things. These states have introduced laws requiring strict age verification for adult content. In response, Pornhub ban has blocked access entirely. So if you’re wondering how to bypass porn ban, the answer is simple: use a VPN. It’s the only reliable way to hide your real location, avoid state-level blocks, and access the content freely and privately. How to bypass the porn ban with a VPN? Step-by-Step: Get a trusted VPN – something with no-logs policy if you want anonymity (steer clear of free VPNs). I like to refer to this comparison table when I am looking for a new provider. My top VPN choices: NordVPN – discount code “ redditoffer ” Surfshark – discount code “ redditspecial ” Connect to a country or state where Pornhub isn’t restricted. Here are a few safe locations: Canada, Mexico, Any U.S. state not affected by bans (e.g., New York, Washington, Illinois, Colorado) Unblock Pornhub and enjoy the content as usual. Your new IP will trick the site into thinking you’re in a non-blocked location. No bans, no issue. Why Is pornhub banned in these states? In early 2025, Georgia, Wyoming, and South Dakota passed laws requiring porn sites to verify age with a government ID. Pornhub said “no thanks” and blocked access entirely, citing privacy concerns and calling the whole system risky and invasive. At the moment there are 17 states with a Pornhub ban. So here’s the easiest way to bypass porn ban, and any restricted content in your location.",

It worked for browsing and YT, but during gameplay the ping became inconsistent. Also it starts nudging you toward paid plans pretty quickly. Planet VPN This one honestly surprised me. No registration, quick install, just choose a country and connect. I picked a US server, and was able to launch and play Helldivers 2 without connection drops or major lag. It doesn’t let you choose cities, only countries, but for my needs that was fine. I’ve kept it installed since. If it holds up long-term, this might be the only truly free one worth using. ProtonVPN (free tier) Very limited locations. I tested the US server and performance wasn’t great. The app is polished, but speeds felt intentionally throttled. Might be fine for general privacy needs, but not for gaming. TunnelBear Friendly design, but 500MB/month is not usable for anything serious. It's basically a live demo. Wouldn’t recommend for games. If anyone here knows of other actually free VPNs that work decently for online games (preferably no login required), please drop them below. I’m specifically looking for long-term use, not free trials or token-based systems. Thanks in advance.",

      "content_preview": "(Disclaimer: I'm not sponsored by any provider) So my Surfshark subscription was ending, and I figured I'd try out the other provider: NordVPN. Been using it for a month now, here are my experience. Talk about speed stuff first. It's a 9 vs a 10. Nord's upload is faster, but for downloads, Surfshark sometimes pulls ahead (on the SG server for me). No major complaints there, it's a solid tie. But Nord completely falls apart for the user experience. They stuck in the past. On Android, the little quick-settings toggle (the button on the same pane with wifi, bluetooth, brightness,...) is a perfect example. With Surfshark, I can set a fixed server there for a one-tap connection. With Nord, It just connects to the \"fastest\" server, which for me is a virtual server in Thailand... useless. To make it worse, if you long-press the toggle, it just dumps you in the generic Android App Info screen (the one for uninstalling the app lol) instead of opening the actual Nord app. Maybe it really want user to uninstall it. On the other side, Surfshark opens its own app, which is just so much more convenient. This clunky design is everywhere. The main app, the Linux client (which is a mess), even the browser extension – they're all just... ugly. Surfshark's interface is clean, modern, lets you favorite servers for quick access, and just feels thoughtfully designed. Nord only gives you a \"recents\" list and feels like they haven't bothered with a design update in forever. It really feels like Nord is a stubborn old company that's just coasting on its name. I see no real investment in their product's usability. Meanwhile, I've seen Surfshark consistently improve its UI over the last 2 years of my sub, and they're still testing new UI stuff, like they actually care about the user experience. TL;DR: Speeds are similar, but Nord's UI/UX is frustratingly outdated and clunky. Surfshark is miles ahead in user-friendliness and design. Definitely a vote for Surfshark.",

Users report that cancelling is difficult, and in some cases, the service gets cut off immediately - even if time was still left on the plan. If someone disputes a charge with their bank, Proton reportedly locks the entire account - which may include ProtonMail access, if both are linked. The 30-day money-back guarantee has been criticized for including vague restrictions and sometimes not being honored. Some users have described the experience as deceptive or even scam-like. The law firm is gathering stories for a potential class-action lawsuit.

      "content_preview": "In today’s digital world, businesses rely on the internet for communication, file sharing, and managing customer information. But the more we use the internet, the more we risk exposing confidential data to cyber threats. This is where a VPN, or Virtual Private Network, becomes a useful tool. VeePN is a VPN service based in Panama, a country known for privacy friendly laws. It works by creating a secure tunnel for your data to travel through, making sure that everything you send and receive is encrypted. Once connected to one of VeePN’s many servers across 60 countries, your original IP address is hidden. This means hackers, internet service providers, or even public WiFi snoopers cannot easily track your online activity or steal sensitive business information. One of the main reasons companies use a VPN is to protect data while working remotely. Employees may need to access files or apps from public networks when they are away from the office. Without a secure connection, their activity could be monitored, or worse, intercepted. With VeePN, all of that information is kept private, reducing the chance of data leaks. Another important feature is VeePN’s strict no logs policy. It means that your online activity is not stored or tracked by the service. This adds another layer of trust, especially for businesses that handle client data. Plus, VeePN supports up to ten devices at once, so a single subscription can help protect an entire small team. Overall, a VPN like VeePN offers a simple way to keep business data private and protected. While it is not a complete security solution, it does play a key role in reducing risk and securing communications in today’s connected environmet https://veepn.com/",

      "content_preview": "I was confused regarding whether OysterVPN offered a native GUI Linux app -- they claim \"yes\" and several online reviews also say a Linux GUI is available (but these sloppy reviewers obviously didn't bother to verify that claim).  To their credit, a few recent online reviews observed that the only Linux options were CLI and/or manual config. To resolve this confusion, I contacted Oyster's online chat support, but they didn't respond.  Now I know why. When you click on the \"download Linux app\" link on OysterVPN website, it doesn't actually download anything at all, but redirects users to instructions for downloading a package with the Terminal and manually configuring OpenVPN in Linux - non-GUI, of course (and no mention of Wireguard for Linux users). I guess I don't understand OysterVPN's business plan. You make false claims about your product in ads and on your website. You don't respond to prospective customer queries.  Not a great strategy for building trust among customers or reviewers . . . in a sector where \"trust\" is really the only thing that matters.  I don't see how they're going to grow this company if they can't be honest right out of the box. In the VPN sector, as far as I'm concerned anyway, you only get one strike and you're out. I won't be dealing with OysterVPN -- ever -- even if they do eventually develop a Linux GUI. Oh . . . and while they're at it, OysterVPN needs to get a damn security audit.  They've been in business since 2023. There's literally no excuse for failing / refusing to have their claims of \"complete privacy\" audited.",

The purpose of creating this post is to help others know which VPN works in China and which Vpn is eventually the best in terms of speed & price so that you don't have to waste money trying various VPNs as i did when i moved to China 4.5 years ago. CAUTION : NEVER BUY MORE THAN A MONTH OF SUBSCRIPTION FOR ANY VPN VPNs that i have tried; Astrill VPN - Pros: Real region switching, up to 5 devices Cons: Expensive @ $30/month, Disconnections, Expensive ExpressVPN - They lie that it works for China, but once you install you'll realize it doesn't. NordVpn - They lie that it works for China, but once you install you'll realize it doesn't. Surfshark VPN - Doesn't work TunnelBear - Doesn't work WannaFlix - Now Their payment system is broken as well! Steer away from them. V2Ray Stable, Multiple Procotols but speed is not the greatest. The region is always the same regardless of the server. I must say this is the best-priced VPN for Quality. A steal! FlashVpn - Works but is unstable Hotspot Shield - It's just a scam PROTON VPN - It doesn't work, won't even connect My own V2ray Custom server - Stable, but slower speeds (atleast for mine) LetsVPN Pros: Cheap @ $6 a month / Best Speeds so Far / Instant Connection Cons: Only 2 devices ( So technically it's not cheap anymore ) The Winners : LetsVPN for now Recently i came across a thread on Reddit, probably in the same sub and somebody mentioned LetsVPN. This changed my life completely, it's the fastest I have ever experienced and the price is literally the best you can ever find. It's stable on both PC and Android ( haven't tested on IOS ). Feel free to share your experience. Feel free to share your experience or name a VPN that's not on the list and I will try it and add it to the list. (I was just told by a fellow Redditor that i can add the coupon code, and benefit not only the subscriber but myself also) . It'd be really nice if you can use the following IF you decide to go for LETSVPN. FOR DISCOUNTS P:S After having a positive response from the community, I will be updating this post on weekly basis so please keep an eye. Many thanks.",

As a user and holder of one such LTD, the notification that they were pulling my Subscription which I paid for only came after 5 years of no marketing emails from the company, and hit my inbox last night at 8PM in my local time. The body of the message is copied below as a comment, but I want to raise my caution about this company. They are currently hiding behind two commonly copy-pasted concepts in every TrustPilot review related to the backlash--emails were \"sent\" but had a high \"bounce\" rate, and because it was an asset-only deal back in 2023, they are absolved of any responsibility. As far as I'm concerned, they purchased the name, the brand, the servers, and the user base. They may claim they are not responsible, but as the saying goes: \"if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, looks like a duck, swims like a duck, flies like a duck, and is indistinguishable from a duck, then it must be a duck.\" Avoid them like the plague. They have no honor, and there is no reason to trust them. To VPN•Secure when you come here inevitably: I hope tarnishing your brand was worth it, and that the costs of a ruined reputation and all the negative attention was worth more than honoring the original LTDs.

This is why i tried to cancel the service, originally. Now for the best part, when the subscription expired, they presented my expired card information and told the card company that this was a reoccuring payment that I approved. The card company called me as their sniff test was this may be fraud. I said this was not approved and that i had followed the instructions on the website and removed my account information from the site. They said they would handle it but when the statement arrived there wss the charge. PureVPN convinced them that the charge was legit. So now the credit card company is doing a claw back for the money abd I have a permanent block on the vendor for the card. Not only is the service not fit for use but they will go extra lengths to try and recharge your card once you remove your payment information following their instructions. They are not a trustworthy vendor, please use my experience as a warning and pass this vendor up.",

Suddenly, streaming gets blocked, my banking site acts weird, or I can't get accurate location info. So I looked into split tunneling VPN. Basically, split tunneling lets me choose exactly which apps or services go through my VPN and which ones skip it. It's been super chill so far. I did a bit of digging and here's what seemed legit: 1. NordVPN: pops up everywhere online. People seem to trust it a ton, and it works smoothly on the stuff I use - like Windows, Android, and Android TV. Fast speeds, lots of secure servers, and seems like it handles streaming and even torrenting pretty reliably, which is cool. 2. Surfshark: feels like really solid value. Not only does it have split tunneling across Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and even a browser extension, but you can hook up literally unlimited devices per subscription. Major bonus points if you're sharing with fam or roommates. 3. IPVanish: it kept coming up for customization options. Apparently nice if you're a techie or you're into playing around with advanced settings. It has split tunneling for Windows, Android, and Fire TV users specifically. Other names like TorGuard and CyberGhost VPN were mentioned too, but honestly looked kinda limited or pricey compared to the rest. I noticed there's a list of coupons for VPNs here, so could be useful when picking one too. Enjoy.",

Even on reddit I saw some mentions of layoffs and this leak that has been discussed here recently is just the cherry on top. Does anyone has any insights whether it makes sense and is it safe to drop some money into the service for another year? (I mostly use it for streaming so I need the VPN to work properly).

I work at remote locations are rely solely on employer provided WI-FI, it is usually very restricted and closely monitored and you have no privacy whatsoever, so using a VPN is a must but they often block the most common VPN servers. I used Surfshark before Nord to generally good results but it was lacking in some aspects, when my subscription expired I switched to Nord thinking it was an upgrade and boy how wrong I was.. my main issues with it were and still are: - Sometimes you are automatically logged off your account on your device, or you are trying to use a new device and it's impossible to log in when NordVPN servers are blocked by the network, and Nord doesn't try to hide the fact that it's a VPN at all (managed to bypass this by installing the free version of Proton VPN, connect to VPN there and then log into Nord) - Some networks have pretty good VPN filters and even Nord's Obfuscated servers aren't able to bypass it (Proton's free version Stealth servers are able to bypass it every single time) - On some networks the restrictions are so bad that you are barely able to use the internet unless you use a VPN, NordVPN decides that I'm not connected to the internet and says \"you're offline\" and doesn't even attemp to connect, but when using Proton free version it just connects without any fuss, ironically only then I'm able to use NordVPN. I know I only compared it to Proton and other VPNs could be better or worse I don't know, but in my experience I was able to use a free VPN in the most restricted networks without any issues whatsoever, while using an expensive paid NordVPN I wasn't able to bypass the most basic restrictions, I honestly can't wait till my subscription is expired and I will never come back to NordVPN. Any suggestions for which VPN would work best in my case? TL;DR: NordVPN sucks on restricted networks—can’t log in, obfuscated servers fail, and it often won't connect at all. Free Proton VPN works way better. Not renewing Nord.",

      "content_preview": "I keep seeing mini Mullvad vs. NordVPN comparisons pop up in VPN subreddits, so I figured I'd compare them properly. I've researched both, and I know how much conflicting info is out there, so I wanted to put it down in a way that’s easy to understand. The best VPNs list in this sub helped me gather some information on these two VPN providers, so in case you don’t need an extensive review - it’s a great place to check both of these VPNs quickly. Here’s what I covered: Price difference Servers and Security Customer Support User Experience (browser, apps) Privacy Additional features Price difference NordVPN offers different pricing plans, starting as low as $3/month for the basic plan and going up to $8/month for those who need additional tools like NordProtect. Reddit users can also get an extra discount with the coupon code REDDITOFFER (it's from that table) . Mullvad has a single price of $5.19 for everything. I think it's their rebellion against the pricing models that other VPN companies use, but it also means they offer limited features. They never run any special discounts and even state that in their FAQ. While the flat rate might seem appealing, in the long run, you don’t really save compared to VPNs that offer long-term plans with more flexible pricing. Servers and Security NordVPN Offers 7200+ servers in 118 countries, which is one of the biggest coverage any of the VPN providers have in general. All of Nord’s servers are RAM-only (no data storage, automatic data wipe on reboot). Nord offers various specialty servers such as: P2P (good for torrenting and file sharing) Double VPN (for extra security and encryption) Onion Over VPN (combines NordVPN with the Tor network for extra anonymity), Obfuscated servers (helps bypass VPN blocks for streaming and similar platforms) As well as Virtual Location servers (provides IPs where Nord doesn’t have servers). NordVPN owns all the servers, and only Nord’s staff can access them. NordVPN has a dedicated IP option (which is helpful for avoiding CAPTCHAs and accessing IP-restricted networks). Threat Protection feature is available to block malicious websites, ads, and phishing. Mullvad It offers 690 servers across 47 countries, which is very small compared to other big players in the market. Mullvad runs both RAM-based and disk-based servers to ensure flexibility and performance. While disk-based servers provide certain operational benefits, they retain some data, which (if a server were ever compromised) could be at greater risk. Mullvad also discloses that about half of its servers are rented, which could be a potential risk, as server hosting providers technically have access to them. Specialty servers include: Obfuscated Servers (for bypassing VPN blocks) MultiHop (routes traffic through two servers for extra encryption and privacy) SOCKS5 Proxy Servers (useful for torrenting or geo-restricted sites without full encryption). Customer Support NordVPN offers 24/7 live customer support, email support as well as FAQ, and a large knowledge base. Mullvad only offers email support and a knowledge base, so if you have a problem, you might end up waiting longer for a solution by emailing back and forth. User Experience NordVPN offers user-friendly desktop apps that are easy to navigate. Its iOS and Android apps are basically identical, and they feature features like split tunneling, kill switch, and the ability to pause or auto-connect. Nord also has a wide range of native apps, supporting Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Android TV, and Apple TV, along with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browser extensions. Mullvad’s desktop apps are also easy to use, allowing quick access to Preferences, Advanced Settings, and server selection. However, on iOS, Mullvad lacks features like split tunneling but its Windows version is more feature-rich than macOS. Mullvad offers apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, as well as their private browser. Mullvad currently offers a Firefox extension in beta, but there’s no Chrome version available. Privacy Both VPNs use advanced AES encryption standards with 256-bit keys and follow a strict no-logs policy, ensuring that user information is completely private and inaccessible to third parties. With Mullvad you can create an account completely anonymously as it doesn’t require your email address and even accepts cash payments. Other than that it offers all the popular payment methods. NordVPN accepts convenient payment methods such as credit cards, cryptocurrency, PayPal, and others. You can purchase a NordVPN subscription in a retail store if you want to pay in cash. Additional Features NordVPN NordVPN offers SmartPlay, which allows seamless streaming of geo-restricted content by automatically choosing the best server for accessing streaming platforms. NordVPN offers their custom-made Meshnet network that allows users to create secure connections between trusted devices, even if they’re on different networks. Mullvad Mullvad’s client is open-source, meaning anyone can inspect the code and contribute to its improvement. Mullvad does not offer traditional browser extensions like NordVPN, but it has a Mullvad browser based on the Tor Browser that they claim is safer for browsing. My two cents: Overall, Mullvad vs NordVPN are two rather different VPN providers, each specializing in different areas. NordVPN is feature-rich and offers solutions for a broader audience, with specific tools that may appeal to many users. Mullvad, on the other hand, is focused on privacy but may lack some of the features others offer. I find NordVPN to be the better option for a better price but both of these VPNs may suit you differently. What’s your experience with those two?",

      "content_preview": "So I noticed last week that I have been billed 12 bucks on SurfShark despite not ever subscribing to it - thanks to automatic renewal I have been paying for a service I don't use around 200s worth - so I figured I'd try to get my money back (since all I remember is logging in to the service via google during a free-trial period, didn't like the service nor did I use it so I left it like in a couple of hours or so). So, I got in touch with their support, first via live-chat where there was a reasonable lady and she told me to get in touch to support via e-mail since it's more personal information that we're dealing with. However, the email dude says I'm not eligible for the 30-day refund since the timeline has gone down, despite the last billing been on 02.04.2025. He tells me to message them from the e-mail my account is on so they can confirm my identity - welp, I do as they say and send a message from the registered e-mail to confirm my identity. Low and behold, the next message they send me is: \" || || ||Hey there!   Thank you for your reply. Hope you are doing great.   I appreciate you confirming your identity as the account holder.   And no worries, I have now changed your registered Surfshark email address as per your request. Additionally, our official help center page has a variety of helpful articles covering a wide range of subjects. Please feel free to browse it and see if any of your questions are answered there: https://support.surfshark.com/hc/en-us Enjoy the rest of your day, and if you have any further questions, I will look forward to hearing them. | So they changed my e-mail although I didn't request it. Tried to send them a message saying that I didn't ask for an e-mail change etc. but I got marked as spam . So much for looking forward to hearing me lol. I get that this is my fault in a way for not being vigilant enough and looking through the terms of service but even those are weird. On one hand they're saying they offer 30-day back guarantee without any other info but once you delve down, they actually say that it's only the initial purchase and that they don't usually even give refunds after 30-days . And they don't send reminders/notifications on subscription renewals that are only 1 month. So yeah, can't recommend.",

      "content_preview": "Last year I purchased Nord and had a blissful 9-ish months. Worked as advertised, had the occasional blocked-site hiccup but otherwise smooth sailing. Then, out of the blue, it became completely unstable. My speeds slowed to a crawl and sites wouldn’t load. I spent so much time managing the slow downs and blocked sites that it became a burden. Of course I did all the requisite troubleshooting and even spent time with folks on the Nord subreddit to try to salvage it. Others seemed to be experiencing similar but there was no obvious cause that we could all point to. Eventually, I got so frustrated that I cancelled my subscription (and, fwiw, their customer service around this issue was kind of shit). Prior to Nord, I’d had a subscription to SurfShark but I didn’t like how predatory (shark, amirite?) the company felt. Like, I couldn’t get away from the constant drumbeat of them trying to sell me stuff. Anyway, I miss having a VPN and I want the number one rated product on this sub’s list (Nord) to work right for me. Thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "Proton VPN review FREE VERSION REVIEW The free version is an excellent way of getting a basic VPN for limited use without any cost. Proton is one of the very few VPNs that offer a free VPN with unlimited bandwidth. PROS Free, unlimited, bandwidth, strict, no log policy Reasonably good speed. Very stable CONS Only 1 device  allowed. The free version only offers 4 countries. You cannot choose the country you want, although you can keep switching the servers every few minutes. This could pose a challenge if a user wants to connect to a particular country for a particular use. At this time, the free servers are in USA, Netherlands, Poland and Japan. At times due to congestion on a particular server speed will get reduced. This is mainly because of the fact that servers for free VPN users are dedicated and at a particular time if the number of free users are high, especially in the evenings, the server response will be slower. Net shield, which protects against ads, trackers, and Melbert is not available on the free version. PAID VERSION REVIEW PROS Excellent connectivity. 10 devices allowed on 1 account. Strict no logs. Very good speeds and stable. Wide list of countries and cities. Net shield, which protects you from ads, trackers, and malware is available on paid version. Really useful. For true anonymity, payments can be made by cash. Not many VPNs have this feature. CONS Sometimes you have to switch a server to optimize speeds. You have to find a good deal online, otherwise it is expensive. SUMMARY Overall, Proton VPN is excellent with strict no luck policy. They do not sell your data. Cash payment option available for complete anonymity. Free version with unlimited bandwidth available. Paid version is one of the best VPN products available in the market with excellent safeguards for privacy. 10 devices allowed.",

      "content_preview": "While I was researching a new VPN for long term commitment, I got Surfshark and ExpressVPN to test out for a month (they both had 30-day money-back). Now after I’ve used both and gave them a proper test run, I’m glad to share my take on both. Spoiler: Surfshark won, hands down. Prices First things first - price. I wanna say Surfshark offers some of the best value you’ll find in the VPN game (if we’re looking into premium providers only). ExpressVPN is great, but it’s definitely on the pricey side Surfshark, on the other hand, gives you a full-featured service for a fraction of the price. You’re getting unlimited devices, tons of server locations, and smooth apps that work on just about any device - and it’s more than 2 times cheaper than Express (+- $2 vs +- $4). If you’re looking for solid performance without paying premium prices, Surfshark is the way to go. Discounts Ofc I looked for coupons before purchasing. This subreddit had a code “redditspecial” for Surfshark but nothing for ExpressVPN. I Googled even further but seems like Express doesn’t really do any discount campaigns, so I did not manage to get the price down even a bit. Servers and locations Both VPNs have a lot of servers, but Surfshark is coming in hot with 3.2k servers in about 100 countries. That’s a massive network, and honestly, I didn’t have an issue finding a server in the location I needed. I can say the same about ExpressVPN - they have 3k servers in 105 countries. It’s all there. Simultaneous connections Here’s where the big Surfshark vs ExpressVPN difference occurs. Surfshark is offering an unlimited device feature. I’ve got Surfshark running on my laptop, phone, tablet, TV, and my partner’s devices—no issues whatsoever. ExpressVPN gives you a solid 8 devices per account, but if you’ve got more gadgets than that, Surfshark’s unlimited plan is a total game-changer. Speed I did not perform any numerical tests, yet from a non-techy user perspective, I noticed that Surfshark made my speeds drop way less than ExpressVPN did. Privacy and security: When it comes to security, both Surfshark and ExpressVPN are rock solid. You get the standard measures like AES 256-bit encryption, kill switch, split tunneling, DNS leak protection, and support for WireGuard on both. On top, Surfshark has implemented some neat features like Dynamic MultiHop, which goes above of what a double-VPN feature could do. I found it highly useful keeping in mind those geo-blocks are getting smarter and smarter. If you have any critical privacy needs, it might be worth knowing that ExpressVPN is based in the British Virgin Islands, whereas Surfshark - in the Netherlands. Nonetheless, both providers are certified to have no-logs policies, so it shouldn’t be an issue either way. My verdict on Surfshark vs ExpressVPN At the end of the day, I decided to go with Surfshark. Sure, ExpressVPN has that premium feel, but when it comes to affordability, features, and value for money, Surfshark just had the edge. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly VPN that can handle pretty much everything you throw at it, Surfshark should be at the top of your list IMO.",

No email, pay by cash, no log, no,payment info - nothing. Due to limited IPs it can sometimes be blocked on certain websites. You can work around by changing servers until the web site does not block you Only 5 devices per account Best VPN overall with speed, complete privacy Nord One of the largest number servers in the market Good speed Disconnects when used for long periods 10 devices per account Limited anonymity as you need email and credit Proton Good to excellent speeds Multi hop is also reasonable Disconnects or buggy when used for long periods Reasonable number of servers 10 devices per account Good anonymity - need email but can pay by cash. You can probably create a Proton mail just for VPN to get around What are your thoughts  and experiences",

ProtonVPN, the service many of us have trusted for privacy and security, has just announced a partnership with Bald and Bankrupt - and honestly, I’m shocked. This move raises some serious red flags, and I’m not the only one questioning it. For those who might not know, Bald and Bankrupt has been involved in some deeply troubling controversies. There are credible accusations about his involvement in sex tourism and exploiting vulnerable communities during his travels. You can find all the details in the Bald and Bankrupt Dossier , which sheds light on his actions. Despite this, ProtonVPN has decided to team up with him—something that feels completely out of sync with their supposed values. Proton has long promoted privacy, security, and ethical business practices , but how can they justify this partnership? Aligning themselves with someone accused of exploiting vulnerable people doesn’t exactly scream \"ethical.\" It’s a tone-deaf move, and I know I’m not the only one who feels this way. If this is the direction Proton is heading, I won’t hesitate to switch services. I trust companies with my personal data and online security, and this partnership has completely shaken that trust. I expect better from a company that positions itself as a leader in ethical VPN services. I’ll be looking elsewhere for a more responsible option.",

      "content_preview": "Hello there. We want to let you know that we're going to be enforcing tighter and stricter rules when it comes to this subreddit moderation. The reason for this being that for quite some time we've noticed that the subreddit is being spammed with numerous bots that keep advertising Proton VPN. We are not sure whether the Proton team ( u/andy1011000 ; r/Proton ) is aware of this or if someone is doing this maliciously but we're taking action to combat the number of spam the moderators are dealing with on the daily. We hope that you understand our reasoning. Thanks, r/vpnreviews team",

      "content_preview": "What the title said. The problem is it was a year ago and there is no way to prove that it happened now. I am sure that I cancelled autorenewal because I already got burned once and that time it was my fault: signed up with them to a very good 2 year deal and then forgot to cancel in time. They did send a warning email that my old deal is expiring, but I missed it, so I got slapped with a price that was more than 2x what I paid before iirc. Obviously this is on purpose, so refunds only work for new subscriptions and you can't get out of paying this significantly increased price. Tried writing to their support just in case they were feeling nice, but that was useless because support did not even read my very clearly worded email and told me to just refund through their automated system, right after I told them that is not possible, I am technically not eligible for a refund and basically just trying my luck. Fair play, I paid for my stupidity. But even my stupidity has some limits, despite the likely fake Einstein quote, so I immediately went into settings and turned off autorenewal, feeling at least some small relief that it's not going to happen again. Today I received an email informing me that autorenewal of my subscription is coming in 30 days. I am not happy.",

      "content_preview": "TL;DR: a good option for businesses with remote or hybrid teams. Hey everyone. As there’s no specific subreddit for business VPN reviews, I’m posting my thoughts here because I wish I had found such a post when I was trying to choose a provider for our team. We recently tried out and ended up buying Nordlayer, which is Nord’s business VPN (NordVPN is obviously for personal use). Context I’m not super experienced with networking, so apologize if this review misses any technical details. I work at a startup with about 30 people where we don’t have a dedicated cybersecurity team or a big budget for it. Our team is hybrid, and a few people work entirely remotely. Everyone has work laptops, but sometimes personal devices get used too (which is ofc not ideal). We don’t handle super-sensitive data, but we still have stuff we’d hate to lose. If someone’s laptop got hacked on public Wi-Fi, it’d be a BIG problem for us… So, the two main things we needed were: a business VPN to secure connections , especially in public places single sign-on because we use Google Workspace Also, what was important for us: Ease of use Affordability Support that makes sense Nordlayer kept coming up when I Googled, and a few people from other companies mentioned it when I asked around. It seemed worth trying since they offer a free trial. We’ve been using it for almost a year now, so I think it’s time to share some thoughts. What I liked The pricing was pretty straightforward. We started with a free trial and then decided to buy it Our account manager was super nice! Always available and quick to respond The tech support was awesome, too. I needed help during setup, and they were really supportive We went with the Lite plan (25 licenses, billed annually). We also added the Device Posture Monitoring feature, which blocks non-compliant devices like personal laptops from the network. So here’s the breakdown: Lite plan for 25 licenses: $2,400/year Device Posture Monitoring add-on: $450/year Total: $2,850/year I noticed now that on their subreddit r/nordlayer_official , they have a 10% off code: NL-RDT-10. Not sure if that’s the best deal right now, so you might want to check around. There are higher-tier plans with features like a fixed IP address, but we didn’t need those. What we got Pros A business VPN with shared gateways. You can connect through the country you need, and your traffic is protected. This was our top priority for remote/hybrid work and for when people travel. Device posture security , which lets us restrict access to certain countries and block non-compliant devices (like personal laptops, phones,  tablets etc.). The speeds are decent . Sometimes, there’s a bit of lag during video calls, but otherwise, it’s solid. The app is easy to use . Customer support has been amazing ! They reply within minutes and actually *help* solve issues, which so far were mostly setup-related questions. Some features included in the Lite plan: Session duration controls that log everyone out after a set time Download protection that scans downloads and blocks anything malicious Web protection stops access to harmful websites MFA, SSO, auto-connect, and usage dashboards Different VPN protocols, so if one fails, it switches to another automatically Cons You need at least 5 users to get started Sometimes, the connection drops, and you have to reconnect manually Captchas show up more often when browsing, which is annoying Final thoughts For us, NordLayer has been a solid solution. It’s not perfect, but it gets the job done. It secures public connections, blocks malicious sites, and prevents access from certain devices. I’m sure it can do even more depending on what your company needs, so I’d recommend considering it as a reliable option.",

      "content_preview": "Never again will I signup for VPN discounts during Black Friday, Cyber Monday or what not. I have used several VPNs over the years but none as bad as TorGuard. It offers a good number of country choices but is pointless as none of them connect right away. You have to try several times before you get connected to the network but even then the speeds are pathetic. This low speed means video streaming etc is out of the question. Now, take this with a pinch of salt but my long standing account on a forum got banned after I logged into it using their German IP. I cannot 100% say this caused it but I have strong reasons to believe this VPN is reason. The only good thing about this VPN is the software which shuts down the browser when the connection is lost so to keep your IP from being exposed but the downside is that your browser keeps shutting down all the time because the connection is never stable!",
