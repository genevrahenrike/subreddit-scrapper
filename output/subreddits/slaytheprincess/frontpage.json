Let me out of here!\"] Narrator:\"You try but the door is locked from the outside\" Voice of the Hero: You can't just keep us in here. Maybe we can try break our way through it. [Try to break your way through the door] Narrator: Despite your best attempts, it's all seemingly in vain. You throw your shoulder against the hard surface of the wooden door but all that meets you is a throbbing pain. Voice of the Hero: We're really locked in here. We'll have to try and find ourselves another way out. [Proceed Back down the stairs] Narrator:\"You proceed back down to the bottom of the stairs. This would have been so much easier if you'd taken the blade like you were meant to do . Voice of the Hero:Easier for whom? Narrator: Easier for everyone. Look at the mess you're in. Princess: I heard the door slam. They locked you down here too didn't they? [Explain how your unable to break through the door and how we need to find another way out] Princess: But where would we even go? You can't break through the door. That's the only way out that's even here. The only other possible way would be the window. Voice of the Hero: Well we have to get out of here somehow. Either that or we can try to dig our way out of here. Narrator: Are you hearing yourself? Those are iron bars covering the window. They're not going to just \"pop right off\" if you give them a tug. How would you even dig your way out of here in the first place as well, you have absolutely no digging tools to get through solid rock . Voice of the Hero: Well it can't even hurt to try , what other options do we even have. [Suggest digging your way out] The Princess: Are you sure we'd even be able to do that? We don't even have anything to dig with. The only possible thing would maybe be using my shackle as a scoop almost or maybe one of the bars if you manage to pull one off. That's not to mention how we'd get through the rok. [Try to pull off the iron bars] Narrator\"You step up to the damp stone basement walls, the iron bars of the window situated above, reaching upwards you clasp a hand around the cold surface of the iron. You give a light pull, as expected nothing happens. Voice of the Hero: Then we might not just be pulling hard enough. Try to give the hardest you can. They have to be rusted at least a little bit. [Pull with all of your might] Narrator: \"You puul with all of the strength that you can summon. You pull and pull and pull and pulll and pull, until eventually. The bar starts to give and eventually it snaps tearing of its base with a metallic scraping. It's a miracle that you even managed to get this off. A miracle that you won't be able to repeat. You fall to the ground. Exhausted. You look up at th princess, a look of understanding comes across her face. The Princess: So the window's a no go too? *Sigh* If I could just get out of these chains then I know we could get out of here together. Narrator: \"She barely hesitates before raising her arm to her mouth, her teeth tearing through her limb with the determination of a trapped wolf. As she rips flesh from bone, from behind you you hear the clang of bouncing metal. It's the blade from upstairs. Your not sure how it got down here but if there was a time to strike. It's now. Voice of the Hero: Or we could use it to get her out of her chains. Narrator: \"You won't like what happens if you do that\" [Cut her free] Narrator:\"Fine. Wearily pulling yourself to your feet you pick up the blade in your hand and put it to her ragged wounded wrist. Just above the unyielding chain binding her to this place. You cut into her flesh. The blade is sharp, it takes little effort to cut through the bone of her arm. Her chain falls to the ground, the limb following suit.\" Voice of the Hero: She didn't so much as utter a sound throughout the entire thing. Narrator: \"No. She didn't.\" Narrator:\"She smiles softly as her gaze meets yours, her blood rhythmically dropping to the ground. Voice of the Hero:It's like she isn't even bothered by the entire thing Princess: Thank you, now we can both work to get out of here. Narrator:\"No. You can't just let her escape into the world. No , I can't just let her escape into the world.\" Princess: I don't know how much help I'll be, but I'll do my best to help get this tunnel dug Narrator:\"As she turns to pick up the iron bar. Your body steps forward raising the blade\" Voice of the Hero:You can't just do that!\" Narrator: \"Watch me\" Princess: Wh-What're you doing? [Warn her] Narrator\"Your body lunges forward, blade held low. But the exhaustion from your little plan earlier hasn't abated you just yet. Your tired body stumbles over itself. Sending you careening into the basement wall. You hear a snap from your shoulder as you connect. A large chunk of the wall crumbling off. Princess:Something's come over you. Hasn't it? You know you don't need to do this right? Narrator: \"Your body, tired so it is, lunges forward once more, blade ready to sink into her heart. But the princess dodges stumbling back as she does so.\" Narrator: Stop it. Stop trying to resist me. I'm trying to get you out of here alive! [Resist] Narrator:\" As your infuriatingly rigid body refuses to move. The princess takes a cautious step forward.\" Princess: i-I'm sorry. I'll try to be quick Narrator:\"Iron bar in hand. She brings it down with all her might, that being much more than you would have guessed her body could dish out. You feel your bones shatter. It's agony, but you aren't dead yet.\" Voice of the Hero: Keep it together, we can get through this, it'll give her the time she needs to get out of here. The escapes already been started for her. Narrator: Have you forgotten the crucial detail that if she gets out of ehre then it will be the end of us all? Well you won't be getting the honour of stopping that now. You'll be dying down here with every bone in your body broken. You have literally doomed everyone. Princess: \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Narrator: Whatever she bashes you with the pipe again and again and again and again and again. Bones breaking, crunching and piercing your organs. You feel all of it . Eventually you collapse and the princess turns towards the hole you unearthed. Beginning to dig her way out of it. She turns back one last time as you lay on the floor dying. Princess: I'm so sorry! Narrator: \"Then she disappears into the hole. But you don't get the time to experience the consequences of your actions. As soon enough, everything goes dark and you die.\" Chapter II: The Miner Narrator:\"You're on a path in the woods. At the end of that path is a cabin and in the basement of that cabin, is a princess. You're here to slay her. If you don't it will be the end of the world. Voice of the Hero: If he doesn't remember what's happened then maybe its best to leave it that way. Voice of the Delvish: Yer damn right it's best to keep im in the dark. Might leave us to the tunnel this time around. Hero: Weren't we wanting to save the princess last time? That's like the entire reason we came up with the tunnel idea in the first place. Narrator:\" Last time? What would you be talking about? This is the first time either of us have met.\" [It's true. We've been here before and you got us killed] Narrator: \"Let's say that hypothetically that this is the second time that you've been here. If \"I got you killed\". I must've had a very good reason for it. That reason probably being that I was trying to get you back on the right track after you were going to fail in doing your job. But lucky for you that hasn't happened. You have a chance to do this right. Voice of the Delvish: Who gives a shite! She dug a tunnel out of that there basement last time rather speedy I must say. She'll be gettin erself out just fine. Narrator: Listen. I'm going to have to get you to ignore that little voice's comment, she's stuck in there for the time being. But if you don't get to this quickly the entire world is on the line. So I advise you get moving. [Proceed to the cabin] Narrator: \"A warning. Before you go any further. She will lie. She will cheat. She will do anything if it means to keep you from slaying her\" Voice of the Delvish: Savin the Princess. Slaying the Princess. All I say that we should do is dig with the princess. If that happens then the only thing you'll be needin to slay is my appetite! *Laughs* Narrator: \"Just ignore him. But if it gets you to the princess then all the better.\" [Open the door to the cabin] Narrator:\"The inside of the cabin is almost dim and dust choked. Walls being nothing but exposed rock lined with what seems to be coal dust. The floor rough beneath your feet. It resembles more an abandoned entrance to a mineshaft than a cabin. The only furniture of note is a mine-cart. Several mining tools and a pristine blade are placed inside. The blade is your implement. You'll need it if you want to do things right.\" [You haven't said anything about the mirror on the wall] Narrator: That's because there isn't a mirror. There's the cart, the blade sitting in the cart, and the shaft leading to the basement. There's nothing else in here. Voice of the Hero: There's definitely a mirror Narrator:There isn't Voice of the Delvish: Will the two of ye stop squabblin! We've been graciously provided this here mine, whether by the Princess or whatever powers that be! We should learn to appreciate it and take our pick and get to the diggin! [We'll get to that soon enough. But for now I care about whether or not I'm being lied to] Voice of the Hero: As do I. Narrator: I'm not lying to you. Use your eyes, there is no mirror. Why would I even lie about something so meaningless? What good would a mirror even do? Let you waste time preening yourself instead of doing what needs to be done? [Approach the mirror.] Narrator:\"You walk up to the wall next to the entrance to the basement. It's a wall. There really isn't much to see here. Voice of the Hero: What are you talking about? This isn't a wall, it's a mirror. Or at least it will be a mirror once we wipe off that grime. Voice of the Delvish: Of course there's grime on it! Ats the beauty of bein in the mine! [Wipe the mirror clean] Narrator:\"you reach out and rub your hand against the cabin wall. I hope you know how ridiculous you look right now. [Take the Pickaxe] Voice of the Delvish: Yes! Are ye finally feelin it like I do? [Enter the Basement] Narrator\" Entering the passage to the basement you find it lit with rows of flaming torches, each embedded in their place along the stone wall. The passage's floor lines with wooden planks and support structures. Though just up ahead you find that the passage's ceiling has given in. A large boulder blocking your path. \" Voice of the Delvish: Our first excavation! What're ye waitin for? Let's take a crack at it! Voice of the Hero: I'll admit you made the right call taking the pickaxe here. We wouldn't have a hope getting past it with the blade. Narrator: While yes the little voice may have been correct about this one thing. What are you to do once you get through? You can't exactly slay her effectively with this pickaxe of yours. Voice of the Delvish: Aw quit it! Fer now the dig is it's own reward! Narrator: \"And so you dig, and dig and dig and dig. It is exhausting work. Though each fresh swing of the pickaxe cracks a chunk of rock away, bringing you ever closer to your goal. Voice of the Delvish: Now I know something to bring those weary bones back into shape! Narrator:\"And what would that be?\" Voice of the Delvish: A song! I'll start for ye: 🎶\"Brothers of the mine rejoice! Swing, swing, swing with me. Raise your pick and raise your voice! Sing, sing, sing with me. Down and down into the deep Who knows what we'll find beneath?. Diamonds, rubies, gold and more Hidden in the mountain store\" 🎶 Come on brothers join on in! Voice of the Hero: I'll give it a go. Though I haven't really sang before. Voice of the Delvish: Aw don't be embarrassed! It ain't about sounding good, it's about havin fun sigin yer heart out! Narrator: \"I shall be refraining ,thank you.\" Voice of the Delvish: Are ye sure? Narrator:\"Very much so\" Voice of the Delvish:\"Alrighty then, altogether now!\" [🎶Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone. Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home. Skin made of iron, steel in our bones. To dig and dig makes us free. Come on brothers sing with me! I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole. Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole. I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole. Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole. 🎶] Narrator: \"And so it goes on. You dig through rock and stone, shifting dirt aside when necessary. Though when you do strange carvings are almost scene on the tunnel walls. Though you seem to be too engrossed in the singing to notice. Eventually though, your efforts are finally paid off, and you break through.\"Narrator: As you chip away at the opening little by little you find a dim light seeps through. Seemingly from several flaming torches posted around a central chamber. Voice of the Delvish: Keep at it lads! We're nearly there! The stone'll be singin yer praises if you continue like this! Voice of the Hero: You're right! We can really do this. This time things will go different. Princess: Is that ye birdie? Had my hopes ye'd return and here ye are!. Would help ye out if I could. But I'm chained up to this wall. Narrator: Okay, as much as I'd like to remain in denial , I guess what you said back in the woods really was true. [Of course it's true. You don't think we'd lie about dying?] Voice of the Hero: Yeah, did you really think we were lying about something as serious as that? Voice of the Delvish: Hey! Narrator: Not so much lying, but rather I must have been in denial. Voice of the Delvish: Are ye guys listening?!? Voice of The Hero:Denial? Voice of the Delvish: Ye guys need to pay attention! Narrator: Well how do you think you got back here? Did time simply rewind itself, or were you instead transported into another world entirely? I'm clearly not involved in whatever the two of you are involved in. So no matter how much i want to be, the contingency has come into play, I'm not the first of me you've likely met. Voice of the Delvish: WILL YE FECKIN LISTEN THE TUNNEL'S GONNA COLLAPSE!!!!! Narrator: As the voice grows impatient , the good reason becomes clear. From above you can hear the distinct sounds of rocks shifting above, sounding like there's mere moments until it gives way. There's no time to open up the rest of the cavern. You just need to shimmy through what's made. As quick as your body is capable of throwing your pickaxe through the hole made you shimmy through, the sharp edges of the rocks scraping against your skin as you move by and leaving trickles of blood. With each pull the rocks shifting gets louder until as you pull yourself free and tumble into the chamber below, a cacophony rings out as the tunnel completely collapses. Looking ahead the princess's eyes widen as she stands up as best she can almost in a reflex, to get a closer look at you. Her coal dusted attire faintly illuminated by the light of the torches, you see a glint of metal as you notice that several other deals of mining equipment are hanging from a rack on the far wall. Princess: Jesus are ye alright?!? Ye're bleedin! Hero: Are we alright? Only got some scrapes...at least I think  so. Voice of the Delvish: Why the hell were ye blabbin on about a \"contingency\" when the stones were tryin to entomb us? Narrator:This whole \"second\" shot at things is a contingency for should you fail what was supposed to be a one and done. I really should have said less than I already have. So good luck. Voice of the Delvish: One more thing. Why'd ye speak in crazy talk back in the woods? If ye'd let us mine everything'd be so much easier. Narrator: I really needed for you to think you'd only been here once, maybe I'd be able to close this whole pandora's box. But maybe I wanted to be the first of me that you'd met. Not wanting to face the alternative. Voice of the Delvish: I'll have to thank ye for finally spellin things out. Voice of the Hero: i get it now. Wouldn't it be pretty upsetting to find out that you'd not be the first version of yourself? At least we know what happened before. We should try to count ourselves lucky there. Narrator: He gets it. You're lucky, so try not to waste it by messing up again, alright? Voice of the Delvish: Enough of the depressin shite! The lass gave a question so we'd better answer. [Check yourself over] Narrator: You check your body for any notable injuries, you pull your hands away from an area on your lower stomach with a sharp sting. Looking down you see the confirmation. Fresh trickles of blood run down light wounds. It's nothing major , while you may not have the blade if you pick up your pickaxe you'll do your job just fine. Voice of the Delvish: Ye better not feckin suggest that! Ye're pickaxe is just fer treatin the stone with the upmost care! Narrator: Well if you would have listened then for the upteenth time, if she gets out the world will end. Voice of the Delvish: Feck the world! Ye need to realise we've made our choice already! Narrator: Do you realise what your implying when you say that? There are people out there. Living, breathing people . Voice of the Delvish: Would they have been the ones to lock her in here? Narrator: Of course!!!!! Who else would have locked her here? [I agree that we've already made our choice. So shouldn't we respond to her?] Voice of the Delvish: Aye, ye can't be keepin the lass waitn. Princess: Are ye alright? Or has the mine dust gotten to ye> Ye've been starin fer a bit now [Sorry about that, Is it alright if we talk a bit before we get you out of there?] Princess: Alright. As long as ye're keepin yer word and not gonna leave me like last time. [Sit down with her] [Do you know exactly what happened  after I died?] Princess: Well I'm sorry for abandonin ye like that but I tried to dig my way out of the tunnel, but it felt like i was gettin nowhere. Next thing I knew *poof* here I was! Voice of the Hero: I guess knowing something is better than nothing. Even if it's not much. Voice of the Delvish: Bettin she's even more in the dark than we are! [Everything look different. Would you know why?] Princess: Sorry, I really have no clue. Is it alright if I ask you a question? [Go ahead] Princess: Why'd ye try to kill me? [A creepy voice in my head tried to take over my body] Narrator: After telling you about the very fate of the world. You're just going to call me creepy?!?!? Voice of the Hero: Well to be fair you were at least a tiny bit creepy during that moment. Narrator: I had a very good reason to do what I did! But you're not going to want to hear it are you? *ugh* Fine, whatever. Princess: A...voice? Are ye sure yer not mad? What'd a voice be wantin me dead for anyway? I've done nothing but sit here. Narrator: I can assure you that since she's here she's certainly warranted it. You already know what she'll do if she gets out of here alive. [He keeps going on about how you'll end the world. But to be honest I feel like I should side with you more than him. I've seen nothing to prove his point.] Princess:*sighs* Thank ye for at least givin me yer kindness again. I'm sure ye meant it last time too, ye really looked like ye were holdin somethin back. [Let's see what I can do to get you out of here] Narrator: Holding the chains in your hand you feel that they're way to solid for you to even imagine breaking them apart. Princess: Figures,  ye can't really be lookin for a key upstairs since that's caved in, since it seems to have come down to it, I don't really mind losin an arm. Voice of the Delvish: If i'm right bout what yer thinkin ye'll be doin absolutely none of that! There's a perfectly good link at the wall ye can take the pick to! [Try to shatter the link on the wall] Narrator: Taking the cool wooden handle of the pickaxe in your hand. The princess steps aside. Giving you ample room for you to carry out this mistake. You wind your arms back and swing. With a loud clang of metal on metal the link is weakened. Princess: One more and Ye'll hav done it! Narrator:Again, mustering all of your strength you swink and with one last clang the link breaks off from the wall. The princess is now one step closer to freedom. You genocidal maniac. Voice of the Delvish: Aw shut yer whinin, she's done nuthin to be trapped down here. Princess: Thank you so much birdie!  We can finally get out of this blasted basement.  That there tunnel that ye've duc for yeself seems mighty unstable. Best be making one of our own. Voice of The Hero: She's probably right to not want to head back up there again. Who's to say that both of us don't get crushed , this time as well? Narrator: Chain dragging against the ground she strides over to the shelf on the far wall and picks up a pickaxe of her own. Princess: Lucky for us we've got what we need right here! Voice of the Delvish: Let's get started on this! [Dig with her] Narrator: The both of you approach a patch on the wall and begin to dig. With the two of you working at this, you're making a quick work. Soon the stone of the basement wall is broken away and you begin to tunnel. Onwards and upwards until you break through into a rather large cavern. The ceiling of which seems to be made of....stone bricks. The Princess: We're nearly there! Just need to break through the floor and we'll be home free! Be careful though, floor could be gettin unstable. [Dig through to your \"freedom\"] Princess:  Are we out? Were the hell are we? Voice of the Hero: I'm with her here, I thought we'd be outside by now? Voice of the Delvish: Have ye not seen the carvins on the wall? [Mention the Carvings] Princess: Hey yer right! Who'd be leavin stone carvings here out of all places? Narrator: Who do you think? The Princess and you in tow approach the almost ornate carvings and begin to read. Reading about the Princess's wrongdoings that you so stubbornly refused to acknowledge. Voice of the Delvish: No... she can't have...these hafta be lies of some kind. Princess: L..Lies that's what these are! Someone must've put these here to mess with our heads. That's what's happening! Narrator: Yet she has, you read on and read of countless tragedies carried out by her hands, all the lives she took by commanding the very earth beneath her feet. Princess: You ain't believin this right birdie? We haven't known each other for long but you should know at least what I'm like! Hero: I...I don't know, I want to believe her but these... Voice of the Delvish: Well ye best be beleivin her lad! I tend to think myself god at judgin character and she's no monster I tell you! Narrator: The truth etches its way into her. Eventually you'll understand. Every new thing you read of breaking your spirits more and more. By the end of it the Princess is distraught Princess: W...Why can't i remember anything. If I did everything here then where are they, why can't I see them? My brain's refusin to tell me! Narrator: In tears she collapses to the floor...broken Princess:  Why can't I remember? By God's..I..i i'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Narrator: She's finally accepted the truth. The truth that everyone out there is real. You? You won't have time for that. Voice of the Hero: Wait...what do you mean? Narrator: The Princess's comment about the floor's instability had been fully right, as the floor begins to shift , loud cracks and splintering beneath your feet as the ground almost ruptures and finally gives way, sending the both of you tumbling through the cavern beneath, the wind rushing against your face. You don't get a chance for things to be different, because soon enough your face meets the ground. Everything goes dark. And you die CHAPTER III: For Rock and Stone [I do plan to continue this eventually, but here's where I'll leave it for now, please forgive any typos that may be here as I think I'm a bit too tired to fix them now. I'll make sure to fix them in the continuation]",
