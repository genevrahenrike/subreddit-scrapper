I never went gluten free because frankly I just found it way too hard with a busy life and constant fatigue. Also, being 18, you really don't care about your health at that age. Now, I have a ton of health issues and pay much more attention to health and take vitamins/supplements. Recently, two thyroid tests have come back showing hypothyroidism. The problem is I can't go on thyroid meds because they can cause drug induced lupus which I've had before. I read online that celiacs can cause or at least worsen hypothyroidism. Looking for some anecdotal evidence here  if anyone with thyroid issues got better after quitting gluten? I'm still planning on going gluten free now, but looking for opinions. Also any tips for newbie gf would be appreciated",

      "content_preview": "Husband is shellfish allergic as well. Surprisingly pleasant, each place except PP brought over a manager to discuss all of our allergies. I’m allergic to wheat, not celiac. I’m very happy to report I did not have a reaction to anywhere. •Dinner at Calhoun’s G’burg — ordered original ribs and a loaded baked potato. Manager told me the rib sauce is not recommended for celiac because of mostly likely cross contamination, but that most people like me don’t have a reaction. She did say they were going to cook the ribs wrapped in foil to better accommodate the shellfish allergy for my husband since we split a full rack. Food was very good. •Breakfast at the Pancake Pantry G’burg — I was nervous for this one. They have gluten free pancakes on the menu, but I don’t entertain things like that for me since it’s 99% sure to be made with eggs. I ordered plain hashbrowns, bacon, and a banana. I was very happy and actually full. Hashbrowns were pretty big and I got 4 big ass pieces of bacon. •Lunch at Five Guys G’burg — I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (yes, I was on vacation, I had bacon back to back meals) no bun and lettuce wrapped, with fries. He asked if it was preference or allergy and then clearly marked the order as allergy. It was so good. We have Five Guys at home, but I’m pretty cheap, but again, vacation. •Dinner at Local Goat PF — I ordered grilled salmon, broccoli, and caramelized mashed potatoes. The salmon was really good, I wish the broccoli had some sort of seasoning, but the mashed potatoes were the best I’ve ever had. •Dinner at Alamo Steakhouse PF — I ordered the 1lb bacon steak burger, garden salad, and mashed potatoes. after the manager assured me it was prepped gf and egg free, they still put a cup of mayo on my plate. It was alright I guess since the mayo wasn’t touching my actual food but still not happy with that part . I did olive oil for dressing and then pipetted some lemonade on it lol. The burger was HUGE so I basically got 2 dinners out of it. The burger was amazingggggg. Potatoes were alright compared to LG haha. •Dessert at Mad Dog’s PF — I got a soft serve twist in a cup. It was pretty watery and metallic tasting. Do not recommend. It’s exhausting telling servers and managers my allergies but I found actual food to eat and I was very very happy with the food experience overall.",

Yesterday I had chips from the chippy (cooked separately so gluten free) but wasn’t thinking and put vinegar all over them before realising. Then thought I may as well eat the crisps in the cupboard that had barley in them and see how I fair. Was fine last night and thought wheyy..Now I’m bent over with cramps and have diarrhoea 😵‍💫 also woke up with achy joints and a puffy face.",
