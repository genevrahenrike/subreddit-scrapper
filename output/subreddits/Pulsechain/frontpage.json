      "content_preview": "Sorry for this bearish post. I'm just not convinced Pulsechain is going to give anyone life changing gains before the end of this 4-year cycle, which is likely done by January 2026 at the latest. Of course I keep my fingers crossed, but I can't imagine retail demand coming over here. Most people want to click a Buy button in their Coinbase app on their phone. I really don't see them trying to bridge funds over. There are too many other shiny objects to chase in crypto and with much lower paths of resistance. As for the sac funds I keep hearing about and how they could get loaded into the ecosystem...I guess I'm really skeptical of that too and I feel like the impact would be so short-lived that not many would benefit as whales would see that and make their final moves and say adios suckas! Now, I suppose there could be a chance of PLS getting back to the .00008 to .0001 range. That's the most realistic possibility I see right now. If this does happen before the end of the year, how many of the holders in the red are gonna sell and get the hell out, providing further downward pressure all over again. Pulsechain has been an utter disappointment and I don't care what the Maxis and RH sycophants say. A lot of these people were live streaming and marketing the idea that there would be huge price performance from the beginning. There are also SO many cringe influencers and grifters in this space that it makes us look embarrassing. They're also trying to promote other oddball coins and utilies that get hacked/rugged/rekt, and pump.tires nonsense, and various other prc20 copies from all over the place. I won't deny that pTGC and pDAI sparked a lot of excitement and optimism in the chain over the last year, though. But isn't this because the \"core\" coins have performed so horribly and holders are desperate to find gains anywhere they can? I feel like time is running out for Pulsechain. I really thought there'd be some kind of sustained price performance for PLS and we'd be over 50+ Billion market cap by now with perhaps some big crashes along the way but always maintaining at least some level that was 5x-10x over sac price. sheesh.....I feel like such an idiot. lol. I think Covid and lockdowns must have fried my brains when I decided to go invest in all this. The massive risk was not worth it. (yeah brah, only invest what you can afford to lose! lol yeah ive heard the bit.) Now imagine all the money you invested over the last 4 years into Pulsechain and HEX and instead invested in BTC, ETH, or even the freakin S&P 500! Again sorry for the bearish post. This is just me venting. A lingering question I have is what's the future of Pulsechain if it never pumps before the end of the 4-year cycle? Is it just a dead chain forever? Could a sustained pump happen between cycles when no one is paying attention because of some RH manipulation to force the glory out?",
