It was filled with big, gay bears and maybe they had an all year Christmas trees. There were three or four different rooms, by the side of a road. I know this is a terrible description. But does anyone know the heck we are looking for?",

We talked for awhile, and I felt like we really hit it off.  However, when she left to make her flight, she looked at me like \"this is the part where you get my number.\" In my pea brain I was thinking long-distance, logistics... blah blah. Anyway, I screwed up and didn't ask. Timing is everything in life. She really charmed me and kept coming back to my mind. I couldn't find her online, so this is my Reddit Hail Mary. Here's what I have: First name is Drina, Dreena, Dreana, not sure how to spell it?  Definitely not Adriana as I called her that and was corrected. Black/Asian mix 27, but possibly 28 June bday, Gemini (was still celebrating it in July) Military Brat, used to live in Okinawa Works in medical field, mental health Two sisters, both with similar names as her Big crush on Jalen Hurts I got nowhere online. Hoping you guys can come through for me.",

I started looking online for help and it’s honestly overwhelming. I keep seeing tax relief and tax resolution options but I don’t even know what the difference is. Everything feels like a sales pitch. I’m scared to trust the wrong company and make things worse. Has anyone here in Fort Lauderdale actually used one of these services and had it go okay?

I work from home, so ideally i’m trying to find a 2b apartment or 1b with a den for the office, and to fit a sofa, so I could have guests. Hoping to find something with a good pool, gym as I stay at home most of my time and would like to have a nice view and to chill after work. I would Loooove to keep the budget under $2500, but I only found a handful of properties that “kind of” match. Does anyone know communities that would have a rooftop pool, but would still be manageable money wise? Also should I get a realtor or not? I heard that some properties give 2 months off and 1 of them goes to the realtor if you use their services. Do the realtors have access to more community properties that are not listed anywhere? Or is everything on zillow mostly? Thanks ahead!",

      "content_preview": "Is anyone else completely fed up with the excessive use of leaf blowers here? I get that it’s an expedient for lawn care companies, and those of you who own these landscaping companies most likely aren’t boots on the ground and instead are delegating the work & don’t realize how excessively they are used. I live in the downtown area, and it’s constant! One day a company will blow leaves over here, the next day, another company will blow those same leaves back over there. Can we just live with a few leaves in our grass? Why are we blowing leaves out from under bushes and destroying the topsoil that is needed for soil health if the plants and essential animals like worms and bugs? Yesterday, I watched lawn care workers blow a parking lot like there was no tomorrow. At one point they were blowing for several minutes, but there was no dirt or leaves moving the the ground was bare! Are they just running out the clock? I don’t get it. They came back TODAY and did the same parking lot all over again that they just did yesterday. I feel so bad for the people in the little townhouses adjoining. The parking lot has to deal with this 2 days in a row at 7 am, and for what?! There has to be a better at of doing things. Maybe electric leaf blowers that are at least less of a noise pollutant, and also since they are battery-run (which are used in other States where they are banned)  will be more mindfully used? EDIT: For people who say we HAAAAAVE to have gas-powered leaf blowers. They have been banned in multiple municipalities across several states, including NY, CT, NJ, MI, OR, CA, MS, MA, and Washington DC — Marblehead, MA, in particular, has beautiful landscaping and does not use leaf blowers. DC hasn't used a gas-powered leaf blower since 2018. Which makes it more baffling that people think we can't live without them here. Here is what they do: Yes I used chatgpt for the copy and paste instead of typing it all out. I already knew a lot of this already though. Vacuum trucks / leaf loaders: Many towns schedule \"leaf collection weeks\" in the fall where residents rake leaves to the curb. A large vacuum truck (often attached to a dump truck) drives through and literally sucks up the leaves. Those leaves are then hauled to composting facilities or municipal mulch sites. 2. Street sweepers: Cities often use mechanical street sweepers to collect leaves along gutters. These sweepers are slower but keep roadways and storm drains clear without blowers. 3. Electric leaf blowers & battery-powered equipment: Some towns (especially in NJ suburbs) have transitioned their public works crews to commercial-grade battery blowers, which are quieter and emission-free but usually require more frequent charging and battery swaps. 4. Manual raking & collection bags: In smaller towns or areas with less tree cover, municipalities may simply require residents to bag leaves in paper yard-waste bags for curbside pickup. Waste haulers then collect these on designated days. 5. Composting & mulching on site: Some municipalities encourage “leave the leaves” programs, mulching them directly into lawns with mulching mowers or encouraging backyard composting to reduce hauling costs. Examples: In Illinois, cities like Evanston and Naperville rely heavily on curbside collection with vacuum trucks and paper bag programs. In New Jersey, towns like Montclair and Princeton do scheduled curbside leaf vacuuming in the fall, while others (like parts of Bergen County) require bagging. So — instead of relying on gas-powered blowers, municipalities lean on a combination of vacuum trucks, sweepers, bagged collection, and electric equipment to keep streets clean and compliant with new environmental rules.",

We went to court for not being able to plant the grass in time and I saw an entire department of managers and workers being paid to bother residents about having grass, while other homes in my community are way worse off than us and I can't even go to my local businesses without being approached (anyone who drives down broward blvd. Will know what I mean). It seems that local government has mixed up their priorities and as someone who was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale,  it's very sad to see that they would rather harass residents than solve bigger problems.",

I have 2 dogs and have been looking for 1st floor units with a private patio entrance for convenience and also tall ceilings. However, I’m a little nervous about being on the ground floor there. Has anyone ever lived on a 1st floor unit here and faced any issues with security or patio furniture getting stolen, did units lack sunlight, etc? A building I’m looking at  has a 1st floor unit coming on the market in a few weeks on 4th ave facing Aviah. Wonder if it’s worth it or to just go to a higher floor. I know this is an odd question, thanks in advance.",

We will just Uber to the cruise port so I am not concerned about free shuttles and all of that.",

I've been getting beef from Winn Dixie so far since I heard it's good quality. Wild  Fork is frozen meat & seafood, but I want them ready to cook. Target's produce are packaged in plastic and are expensive. I'm looking for veggies like broccoli that aren't wrapped in plastic, but rather out in the open and that I can hand pick. Also, any Asian grocery stores in Fort Lauderdale? I know there's a KimchiMart opening in October, but I been to the one in Hollywood, but fresh salmon there was $14 for a small piece nor did I even find tofu. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I know you guys probably get this question a lot but using the search function wasn’t fruitful. I’m looking for things to do/take my kiddo to before we leave at the beginning of the week. She’s not a “face buried in electronics” type of kid. You’d think she was a fish in a previous life, loves the water. We’re from a landlocked state and we don’t take trips like this often and I’d like to make the most of it. Over the last few days we’ve gone to the beach, searched for shells (high on kiddos list), went on a snorkel tour, and we’re doing the Jungle Queen sightseeing cruise tomorrow. Food/restaurant suggestions are welcome as well! We don’t have a rental car, just something to keep in mind when making suggestions. Edited to add: We are staying near Las Olas Beach. Thank you in advance!",

Las Olas would be an out-of-towner usually. Anyone seeing this or just me?",
