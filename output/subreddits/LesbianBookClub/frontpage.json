      "content_preview": "SPOILERS, obviously. I just finished reading this book and had some thoughts. I'd love to hear yours too if you've read it. Regarding Lottie- I know she was no saint, given how she had to survive, and she tricked Alice into what should have been a suicide mission to kill Sabine. However, she was in an abusive relationship that spanned hundreds of years. She was physically and emotionally abused and terrorized in really fucked up ways (don't get me started on her watching Sabine break her lover's neck). So I don't blame her for her actions, even if she is morally flawed. She didn't turn Alice and never meant to even see her again. This makes it a strange choice for Sabine to turn Alice, make her forget, and leave her no clues as to how to find her or Lottie. If she were following Lottie, she would have known this was a one night stand. And it goes without saying that she probably saw Lottie's goodbye note in the dorm room. Turning Penny I can understand, as that's part of torturing Lottie. The fact that Alice even found Lottie again is impressive. What was Sabine's plan here if Alice had never found Lottie? I can understand Alice's rage at Lottie for even involving her in this mess. But her rage (culminating in two murders) left me unsettled, because what kind of vampire will she be in 2, 3, 400 years? You either become a monster (Sabine) or try to keep the monster in check (Matteo, Charlotte). The last line about her hunger was chilling and seemed to suggest she would become a Sabine eventually. This book belonged to Maria/Sabine, and then to Lottie/Charlotte. Their stories and then story together were beautifully told. Alice's part didn't feel like it fit. And her story was more her sister's story, so I didn't really connect to her character ever. To be honest, I skimmed her flashbacks. It felt like reading two different stories. If, say, Lottie had been falling in love with Alice and they had been seeing each other, I could understand Sabine turning or killing her. No doubt this book is excellent, but the ending felt a bit rushed and unfulfilling. What did y'all take away from it?",
