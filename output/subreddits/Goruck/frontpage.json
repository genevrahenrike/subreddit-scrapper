      "content_preview": "MacV 2 mid = Likes: comfortable, wide toe box, great grip on most surfaces, stable, non waterproof, ventilated, and drys fast . Dislike: coyote color (would like a dark brown with black soles like regular boots. Something that doesn‚Äôt say desert GWAT). The heal cup pinches the inside of my heal and rubs it raw. Summary: would wear them more, but the desert GWAT thing. Mackall = likes: comfortable, wide toe box, great grip on most surfaces, stable, non waterproof, ventilated, and drys fast. Dislike : narrow heal cup and heavier than they look. Summary: these things are tanks that will take abuse and got the distance. Rough Runners = likes: comfortable, breathable, non waterproof, great grip on pavement, and drys fast. Dislikes: not a wide toe box (like the first two). Not great lateral stability, white midsole, irregular heal cup. Summary: comfortable, but have grown accustomed to the wider toe box and more stable shoe. Ballistic Trainers = Likes: stable, light weight, breathable, drys fast, gum mid sole color (on some options), and good heal cups. Dislikes: not a wide toe box, (like the first two) and slippery on wet surfaces. Summary: great gym shoes or EDC shoes as long as it‚Äôs a dry surface. Just my views. YMMV. I got all on sale or 2nd hand (NWT). They all have a roll to play, but no clear true love.",

I‚Äôm stuck between¬†black¬†and¬†dark oak. My reasons to go  for the black color: My go-to color. I never get tired of it. Matches my style and looks. Complements the rest of my collection. My reasons to go for the dark oak: Develops a nice patina over time. Goes nicely with all the black gear I already own. It just looks kinda badass? I'm female if that matters. Does anyone here¬†own both colors¬†and can share side-by-side photos? Or tell me which color you prefer? Any insights would be hugely appreciated! Thanks guys!",

I wanted a bag to quickly put my laptop and notepad into, and carry a water bottle and other odds and ends too. The shoulder bag fits my needs perfectly. The thing I like the most is how quick and easy it is to get my stuff in and out. I can set the bag next to me and pull everything out much easier than with a backpack. The shoulder bag also stands up nicely on its own, but it does have a slight lean to one side. The bag is a bit over built for my needs (more padding than feels necessary), but overall it‚Äôs a great fit. If you have any questions me let me know.",

I‚Äôve read through the threads here and I still feel the need to ask a couple questions. I got my Rucker 4.0 a couple months ago. I use it 5-6 days a week for roughly 1-3mi paved rucks in south FL. Great addition for a little extra workout oomph and I really enjoy it, but I just can‚Äôt seem to dial in the comfort aspect. About a mile in my mid back begins to hurt so I start playing around with the straps‚Ä¶loosening/tightening/etc. I carry a 30# long plate after about a month of using a 20# plate. Today I added a 10#= 40# and it wasn‚Äôt bad but then my L pinky finger started going number about 1.5mi into my walk. My sternum trap is roughly an inch under my clavicles and I cinch my bag up as high as I can without going too tight around my underarms. Any advice?  Should I back down to 30#, keep at the 40#, any kind of adjustments recommended?  Just curious",

But there are times where I would lend my pack someone who would accompany me on some rucks. My gr1 26 is a bit too long as the bottom hits right at my belt line. Annoying. It would seem that the gr2 has the same hight/width as the 4.0. Bonus that it has more compartments. This isn‚Äôt a bag I plan on throwing around. That‚Äôs for my 4.0. But having something for edc and rucking would be nice. Note: I would use a Shaddox with plates. Otherwise, pack towels around a dumbbell when travelling.",
