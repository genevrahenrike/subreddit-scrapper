She stepping me through how to play and tips and technology and such and I just got disarmed by Austria as Sardinia Piedmont, the economy hurts my tiny brain so im just spamming factories everywhere as I constantly have money, taking any land costs a million infamy and this game is worse than league. I have thousands of hours in league and this game makes me want to kill myself more. But I cant quite. I need to finish a game of Victoria 2 so I have said ive played it and enjoyed it. Why does conquest take 22 infamy. Why do i need to get a technology for the invention and then another technology to also get that invention to actually have a chance of firing hrierjihijerhijerhijreihjreijhre. I want to die. This is the first game that has made me want to kill myself I genuinely can not think of a game that has made more depressed. I'm not even mad at the game the game just makes me feel empty and suicidal. I don't want to play anymore but I have to finish it. I have to unite italy. I feel emotionless like im just going through the emotions. I feel empty playing this game. Its so ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my brain hurts so much please just kill me this game is actual misery. im 22 years in and i feel nothing anymore. It doesnt hurt anymore its just an endless void and suffering. I feel empty.",

There is a shortage on sugar, tobacco, and coffee which makes my pops not get their everyday needs but since i like to play tall i dont want to conquer rgos. should being a gp fix this?",

      "content_preview": "Hello. I saw a post asking about the Great Powers of the morden day and the debates surrounding it and I decide join in but I have actually managed to calculate what the scores would look like going by Victoria 2's two scores of military, industry, and prestige using proxies and the world total as the base. Basically the persentage of each score the nation has out of the entire world. The proxies are: Military: military budget Industry: manufacturing output Prestige: reserve currency The prestige thing was hard but I use reserve currency as a proxy to show much faith other nations have over the nation. For the EU countries multiples the Euro's use as reserve currency by the persentage of GDP that country contribute to the EU. This does have the side effect of inflating the score of EU countries but hey in game maybe you get a prestige boost by being in the EU. Here's the list: Great Powers: United States: 36.84% China: 13.62% Germany: 5.37% Japan: 4.33% United Kingdom: 3.19% France: 2.45% India: 1.94% Italy 1.91% Secondary Powers: 9. Russia: 1.89% 10. Canada: 1.74% 11. Australia: 1.57% 12. South Korea: 1.43% 13. Spain: 1.29% 14. Saudi Arabia: 1.25% 15. Poland: 1.25% 16. Turkey: 1.02% Hypothetical unified EU would be second at 20%.",

Lowering taxes on which class, exactly? The lower class? How does that work, exactly? Wouldn't it be smarter to increase taxes on the upper and middle classes instead, so that they demote to craftsmen? Also, I would like to know the exact number of bonuses that various levels of literacy rates provides for the promotion of craftsmen.",

      "content_preview": "I read in a lot of older posts here, that the meta is to fight a war in the 1840-1850s to get as many reforms passed as possible. So you declare an estabilish protectorate or demand concession war against an unciv, that you could easily win otherwise. Then after 2 years of not doing anything, the ticking warscore expires, after you don't occupy their territory and they will start sending a white peace offer every few months. When you reject this, you get +1 militancy and +10 war exhaustion which also raises militancy. You can use this, to pass as many reforms as you want in a span of a few years. Then you peace out with them, after only 1-2 reforms left, that you want to pass, because the militancy will be elevated for a while even after peacing out, thanks to the war exhaustion. Does anyone do this? And does it actually worth it? Ruininig your country for 5 years in terms of economy, moneymaking, just to get healthcare, education, assimilation, etc reforms passed very early?",

I then tried Egypt but found it too easy and boring, I tried the orange free state but I somehow managed to glitch the event chain and Transvaal remained a British puppet, effectively ending my game as the boers due to me being surrounded. I am currently considering playing either the Ashanti or Transvaal, I would prefer to play the Ashanti but I’m worried about a lack of flavour and a impossible war with Britain, Transvaal however looks more fun as I think I actually have a chance and boers had a lot of flavour when I played orange. Also I have had test runs as both the madhists and Transvaal when I got bored playing Persia and tag switched to them. So Ashanti or Transvaal? maybe another nation? It’s hard to find recommendations for Africa in vic 2 other than the big 3 (sokoto,Ethiopia,Egypt) so I hope yall can help me out here",
