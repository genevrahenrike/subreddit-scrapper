      "content_preview": "Hello all, I've been going through the mega thread and attempting to utilise the resources there alongside the retro game Corps guide. However, I've hit a bit of a snag because while the specific binary files have been specified, there are at least 2-3 different types of bios files that can be downloaded for the systems I'm after. In some cases it is easy to see which one should be used because they line up to the name of the emulator but in other cases they don't match up ie PS1 has 3 but I intend to use PPSSPP - Gold? A bonus question is whether game cube ones are required as I've heard conflicting messages about that. Much appreciated all Edit: I understand that the files are within the zip folders but how do you know which zip folder to open? For example the I intend to use Duck station for PlayStation but the zip folders on the mega thread have Beetle PSX, PCSX - ReARMed and Swanstation.",

I modded a Wii that will be a gift for a friend, using the ModWii Wizard from https://wii.hacks.guide/ guide slight bit out of date, but not much, and it works, got Priiloader, USB Loader GX, Homebrew Channel, YAWM ModMii Edition, etc installed. Did a backup of my NAND also, to have. But the issue I'm having is the games, I just feel like I'm loosing my mind. I just want to get some games onto the SD / USB and have it like a channel, so less hassle for my friend. Looking at the creating Wii Game Shortcuts ( https://wii.hacks.guide/wiigsc ) I've the Wii, SD and USB if needed, have YAWM Modii Edition, ran WiiGSC ModMii Edition, but getting no where. The games that download from the net are .iso, but windows can't open them (So I can't mount them), I've tried to use ISO to WBFS (Failed to convert),WiiBackupManager (doesn't go anything), Wii Converter GUI (looks like it's doing something but then fails, leaving a temp 1kb file), WiiGSC (That fails also), I've tried it on a number of different games I've downloaded.. If I put ISO on the SD Card, it won't work, if I try to put on the USB it's larger than 4GB so can't as it's fat32. With most of the tools give a similar issue. But surely it's not the ISO? I mean, I've downloaded different games from different sites and each time the .iso gives this error. The Wii is a gift and I would like to get the games added for my friend. But right now, it's a massive pain in the arse. Years ago when I had a Wii, I don't remember it being this difficult. Any help, would seriously be helpful. Below is the error I'm getting trying to use WiiGSC ModWii Edition. Any helpful guides you know of that just work, what am I missing here? https://preview.redd.it/wii-modded-with-homebrew-v0-rb51a83jkulf1.png Thanks all so much for your help and advice.",

Right now I want to start playing Sapphire on my laptop simultaneously but the megathread shows 2 options: Myrient and Internet Archive. I read the discussion about decrypted and encrypted ones too, that's where my confusion began, does it affect the way cheat codes are implemented or the trading mechanishms? Because I downloaded my ruby file from another place and its the euro version. The mega threads mention their versions as USA. Sorry I'm not really technical so a lot of jargon goes over my head. In my defence, I did search up the old threads and tried looking to see if there was any answer to my confusion. But I just couldn't make sense of it.

Everything I look up it just shows how to play psp games on ps vita and stuff like that nothing at all about actually taking SD card out plugging into PC and downloading files onto it... so I'm just confused on how to do it cause I know with my 2ds xl and psp go you had to go into specific files even create a file in some cases so if anyone has a link to a video or anything like that that would be much appreciated",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I recently got an RG40xxV and installed Knulli on it. I’m from Germany and loaded the Europe ROM sets onto the SD card. What I noticed is that GBA and GBC ROMs in the Europe version are almost twice the file size compared to others. My assumption was that these multi-region ROMs actually include multiple languages (English, German, French, etc.), and that you can either select the language when starting the game or configure it in the emulator settings. For example, I’d like to play the Pokémon GBA/GBC games in German, but I can’t find any option in Knulli to change the region/language. Does anyone know if my assumption is correct? Are the European ROMs really multi-language, and if so, do I need to change something in Knulli to play them in German, or does the game automatically pick the language somehow?",

      "content_preview": "I've seen this issue in some posts of this subreddit, but the solutions given in the comments are stuff that I've already done. I have my SD card in FAT32 I got the enhanced DSi version (from the megathread) I've already played many other DS games in my DSi XL already, such as pokemon HG, MKDS, Kirby Super Star Ultra, etc. But the only one that doesn't seem to work is Pokémon Black. The only thing that happens when I start the ROM (on TwilightMenu) is an infinite white screen? If anyone knows how to solve this issue, I'd appreciate it. Many thanks!",
