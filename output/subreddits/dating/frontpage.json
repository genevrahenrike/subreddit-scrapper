      "content_preview": "Hey ladies, something occurred to me last night while i was stoned and thought i‚Äôd share on how women should flirt with men if they want to really get his attention. And like honestly, SO few women do this. Theres only a handful i can think of and they really stick outSo what started this is that this girl that i recently became friends with often comments on things about me like my style, my apartment being ‚Äúnice and decorative but masculine‚Äù and stuff like that. And it really sticks in my head and feels incredibly flattering.  Its like shes admiring my masculinity in different ways and that makes me feel very masculine. I dont think shes even flirting that much‚Äîshes just very observant like when she tells stories for example, but it makes her very likable and got me thinking about why it sticks out in my mind.So then I remembered another time where i was at a wine bar talking to a girl who was a friend of a friend and i absentmindedly swirled what was left of my wine and finished it, and she said something like ‚Äúyou did not just do that‚Äù and i was like what and she told me and was basically saying it was very suave. It really made me feel very cool and manly and i cant even remember who that was but i remember that complement.And then when i was young like high school, i remember this one girl who would make me crazy. She was very physically flirtatious but she would also make comments about me being strong or whatever. ‚ÄúOh your arms are so veiny‚Äù that typa shit all the time (she was trouble and broke my heart lol)But heres the thing: you can make comments like this about anything. It can be so stupid or mundane. Like a guy you like picks up a TV, you mention how strong he is. A guy can grab something, you comment how tall he is. It can be mundane but if you complement him as being manly and take notice, it will be incredibly flattering and get his attention. ‚ÄúYour hands are so big‚Äù ‚Äúyou have a very cool masculine style‚Äù ‚Äúhow much can you bench? Oh wow!! You could bench me!‚Äù Even ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre suuuch a man‚Äù in like a flirty kinda funny wayi mean shit, its too easyBasically, men want a woman that makes them feel masculine. This doesn‚Äôt mean anything weird it just means noticing, complimenting, and expressing that you value him for masculine traits and behaviors",

      "content_preview": "Let‚Äôs stop pretending. Most people today aren‚Äôt looking to connect they‚Äôre looking to be entertained. Distracted. Validated. They want someone to talk to until something better pings their phone.What‚Äôs ruining relationships isn‚Äôt timing or circumstance. It‚Äôs the lack of honesty in intentions. People enter with uncertainty but speak like they‚Äôre certain. They offer closeness but hold the door open behind them. They want comfort without responsibility. They want to feel cared for without being expected to care back in equal measure.And when they‚Äôre met with consistency, they hesitate. They start pulling back. Not because anything went wrong, but because there‚Äôs nowhere to hide. They‚Äôre used to being surrounded by confusion so when clarity enters the room, they panic.And then there‚Äôs people like me. I don‚Äôt trade in ambiguity. I don‚Äôt half commit. I say what I mean, I follow through, and I don‚Äôt ask questions I‚Äôm not prepared to answer myself. When I give, it‚Äôs not performative. It‚Äôs not an attempt to win anyone over. It‚Äôs because that‚Äôs how I operate.But that kind of clarity unsettles people who are used to instability. They call it ‚Äútoo much‚Äù not because it is but because it forces them to confront what they‚Äôre not ready to match.I offer consistency. Not conditions. I don‚Äôt disappear when it‚Äôs quiet. I don‚Äôt flinch when it gets difficult. I stay. I ask questions. I listen. I give a damn. And somehow, that makes me the strange one.They fumble it. They overthink it. They pull away before they‚Äôre even close. And then they rewrite the story to protect their ego saying I was too intense, too available, too forward. When in reality, I just wasn‚Äôt performing.I wasn‚Äôt dressing up what I felt. I wasn‚Äôt holding back to seem mysterious. I was honest. I was steady. And they couldn‚Äôt meet it.But I‚Äôm not bitter. Just tired. Tired of giving to people who haven‚Äôt built the capacity to receive. Tired of being handed uncertainty in return for clarity.They remember eventually. Not with regret, maybe. But with awareness. That they once had something that didn‚Äôt need translation. Something that didn‚Äôt shift based on mood or distance or fear.By then, though, I‚Äôm not waiting around. I don‚Äôt recycle efforts. I don‚Äôt chase comfort in familiar places that once called me ‚Äútoo much‚Äù just because I wasn‚Äôt holding back. I",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm personally looking for something long-term and I‚Äôm not into short-term relationships at all. But I‚Äôve noticed something interesting while using dating apps, and I wanted to hear if anyone else relates.People whodon‚Äôtmake ‚Äúlong-term only‚Äù their top priority on dating apps usually turn out to be more genuine and enjoyable to talk to. They live in the present, focus on the connection, and if things naturally grow into something serious, that‚Äôs great. If not, you still part on good terms.Meanwhile, the people who loudly push ‚Äúserious relationship only‚Äù from the very beginning often:Feel like you have to ‚Äúwin them over‚Äù as if they‚Äôre a prize.Carry a lot of emotional baggage from past relationships.Come off as overly cautious, guarded, or even a little transactional.Ironically, the vibe often feels heavier and forced with the ‚Äúlong-term only‚Äù people, while the more chill ones sometimes end up being actual long-term potential.",

I will be the best gf, I promise\", included some pics of herself, etcAnd that hit me like a ton of bricks. I am not an attractive guy either and despite what women say, I know for a fact that short fat ugly men aren't well received by any means.But I never thought I'd see that from a woman.We're extremely self-absorbed as people and I think more of us should shut up when other people talk about their experiences rather than assume that they don't have it as \"bad\" as we do. I see that all the time, people belittling and dismissing other people's experiences and feelings just cos they don't understand them.I did really see myself in her not because I'd ever put up with such a partner (women wouldn't really do that anyway -- i.e. have a \"relationship\" with a man they were too ashamed to be seen in public with) but cos I can understand how desperate she was to please her future bf, how lonely she must 've been feeling and what terrible self-esteem she must have.",

Ten years ago it felt simpler to meet people through friends, work, class, even the apps, or just being out. Now it seems like apps dominate, but the paradox of choice + endless swiping makes connection feel disposable. Ghosting is basically standard, and it feels so much harder to build momentum past a couple dates.I also wonder how much bigger stuff plays in: the pandemic gap, more WFH/social isolation, cost of living stress, mental health burnout, safety concerns, and growing political/values polarization. On the flip side, we‚Äôve got clearer conversations around consent and boundaries, and more visibility for different relationship styles‚Äîso maybe it‚Äôs not ‚Äúharder,‚Äù just different skills needed?If you think dating has gotten harder, why? What changed‚Äîpeople‚Äôs expectations, communication norms, timelines for commitment, or something else? If you think it hasn‚Äôt, what‚Äôs working for you?

Everyone is jaded and no one takes responsibility for how they treat one another. What someone does to one, that person will in turn do the same to another.I was recently talking to a friend who was upset about being ghosted by a person they really liked and I asked, have you done the same to someone else? They responded yes and I said well that person may have also been ghosted before and just adopted doing the same thing. Its all a cycle where people who start off being kind and caring about others end up cold, distant, and avoidant.Every action someone takes has a direct impact on how people subsequently treat others which is why we've ended up in this mess. If you call someone out its always, \"they aren't entitled to a response\" or \"you don't owe anyone anything\". The lack of decency and respect permeates throughout the broader society leaving us all unsatisfied and upset.",

Time actually felt like it slowed down so I could take in every detail‚Ä¶Turned out he was single, and we slowly started talking more and more. Eventually we started making plans together, casually, without any pressure, since it seems difficult to even make friends at 30+ years old. I knew that the only way I‚Äôd end up dating anyone was if they were playful and truly friend material. No more a-holes.He didn‚Äôt even know I was single, I guess, and agreed to go UFO watching at a local spot that was known for sightings.Long story short, we talked and talked and flirted in a warm spirited and twinkling eye kind of way. We didn‚Äôt jump, we just observed each other and agreed to do stuff like that more often.We did. Every weekend and we haven‚Äôt stopped for 2+ years. I‚Äôve never been this close to anyone, so effortlessly. I‚Äôve never felt like it was so easy to love someone else. I‚Äôve never felt this accepted by anyone and celebrated. It far exceeds the loves I thought I had once, and it‚Äôs been the sweetest and most soul melting experience.Keep on being open to what‚Äôs out there‚Ä¶ even if it feels like it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo late‚Äù.

Not from him but from my ex whom I dated 10 years ago, we‚Äôre still close and talk often. He‚Äôs one of the most jaded, realest people I know, and never sugarcoats anything for me. If I can count on one person to truly tell me how it is, even if it hurts, it‚Äôs him.I explained a bit of my situation to him. Told him about the date, the immediate aftermath, and the family emergency without going into many details. Again, I want to respect his family‚Äôs privacy because I never doubted the validity of the story, just the severity with the timing.His advice? Text the man. Actually, his exact words were, ‚ÄúModern dating is crap, but you don‚Äôt have to be. You believe the family emergency so who cares if he‚Äôs just not that into you. Show up and support him, because that‚Äôs what good people do, and you‚Äôre a good person.‚ÄùSo I did. I texted him asking for an update. Then offered to bring him beer from a local brewery, and pizza from the place he told me he loves, on my free night next week. To take his mind off things. I showed up with genuine care, intention, and a plan.And it worked. He texted back immediately.A long full update on the situation, an apology for leaving me hanging, and suggestions for pizza toppings. We texted late into the night, until it was me that finally suggested that we both go to bed. His texts were no longer just polite, but had a flirty edge again, and excitement.Obviously, I can‚Äôt predict where things will go from here, but let this serve as a reminder that sometimes you should send that text. Leaving the ball in their court, isn‚Äôt always the best option.",

Going to America in a couple of weeks but maybe after that?‚ÄùThis is where I was so confused since she was the one who messaged back so I thought it would be a Banker she was interested. In the past at this point I was way to needy and tried to always get a day still in the cal. But this time I replied with ‚ÄúNo worries, yeah let me know after that‚ÄùWas the above a good response to put the ball in her court without looking desperate? She didn‚Äôt respond to that specific message but has continued to keep making small talk and asking questions so I haven‚Äôt been rude and ghosted but have kept responding (but now not asking to many questions back) and won‚Äôt be iniating the chat when it dies.Wanted to see if there is anything I could have improved this time for the future or have I played it completely fine and she‚Äôs just keeping me as a back up?Im still getting used to the whole online dating, last time I had a similar thing and the girl kept stringing me for 4 months for a second date before ghosting so this time I‚Äôm trying to protect myself and be more ruthless",

I'm in a cycle of seeing couples and wanting to be in a relationship, then being happy that I'm single at times.I want love but I'm scared of commitment. All the guys who I've talked to, once they indicate interest in me, all my attraction for them vanishes and I lose all interest in them. Even if I had liked them back, I'd distance myself from them, eventually cutting them out of my life. I've had regrets about those times especially when I fumbled a great guy who I met last year.  When he asked me out, my heart dropped although I've been enjoying his company the whole time. When I cut him off, I felt bad for weeks. The worst part is he wasn't the first guy I did that to.To be honest, I don't want to date. I want to have someone to go home to and talk to about anything ever. I want to have someone to be vulnerable with and open up to. Someone I can be myself around. Someone more than a friend. But doesn't that come from dating first? I want love but I don't know anymore tbh. Why do I avoid love? Idk if I'm even incapable of loving someone.I guess we accept the love we think we deserve.",

And now that everyone is ditching dating apps, companies are popping up to create dating event, but it‚Äôs still like dating apps. It‚Äôs designed to get as many people possible in a single room for a finite amount of time. It just replaces the venue from online, to in person. But the problem stays the same.And just like capitalism, people treating dating the same. Just as how people trying to hire entry level jobs and requiring 3 years of experience, in the dating world, people are pretty much asking ‚Äúwhat you can bring to the table,‚Äù like it‚Äôs a job interview. And just like how in capitalism, how companies stopped training people, the same thing is happening with people. I‚Äôm not talking about someone who is a psycho, but if someone makes a mistake or have certain faux pas, that‚Äôs a deal breaker. It is only then left with people with an insane amount of requirements.I think we can break the cycle, but it is gonna take huge effort from everyone.

      "content_preview": "So I met this girl in a social party and at first, we never really talked. My friend was talking with her and I tried to intervene but the talk was not so smooth so I just bailed. But then again in another night inside a club, I coincidentally met her again. I just said fuck it and striked a convo and surprisingly I got her number somehow(I was drunk so not sure how I ended up with a number tbh).So we kept texting back and forth and I figured out she was actually an organizer of some social gathering. I made my friend join there and we had a good time as a group. We didn't talk that much in person but we were teasing each other in texts lol.But the days after that, the texting seemed to get slow, and we started to talk less so I said again fuck it and told her if she wanted to have a drink together and she said she was busy this week but got a fixed plan next week. At this point I wasn't sure if she was really interested in me since we barely texted and she and I had like 8+ years of age difference(She was a uni freshmen while I'm a grown ass office worker).So today we met and we were awkward at first cos I was so worried that I might say dumb shit and she will think of me as a boomer type shit. But she kept reciprocating well to my surprise so I kept pushing it. We talked about life and struggles and figured out we had a really similar past. She seemed so wise for her age so I kept complimenting on that.I ended up buying her the dinner, but then she told me she wanted to give me a gift. I told her it's okay, you can buy me a dinner next time but she kept insisting that she will buy me a gift and will pay for the next one. I was kinda confused at this point but okay? We went inside a cafe and she bought me a whole 3 slices of cakes! I said omg this is too much but was so nice of her.We ended up spending a little more in the cafe and noticed we both love coffee so we promised to visit my favorite cafe for coffee tasting next time.So now I feel very good but also still confused if she's really interested in me. Cos firstly, we have a huge age gap and I'm not sure if she met me as a date. Secondly, she is very focused on her social gathering organizing so she might've just met me to promote her place more. Thirdly, she mentioned that she values her friend more than her relationships so if she would be in a relationship, she has to meet a guy who would make her switch up this priority, which I found it a little bit hard thing to do.So I guess I still need to meet her more to figure things out but what do you all think? Do you think this might have a good outcome? Is she interested in me?",

But I‚Äôve noticed how invisible I can be in my every day life. I have a life that revolves around routines. I lift weights 3 times a week I train jiu jitsu 3 times a week, and I go jogging. Along with work, and being a single dad I still find time to go out on a Friday/Saturday night and have a few drinks.People will tell you live your life and what happens, happens. Keep putting yourself out there. But the pressure to do all the stuff I listed to keep my mind and body in shape, well that‚Äôs not enough I still need to go out and approach a woman. It‚Äôs just frustrating out here for guys and I‚Äôm sure it is for women too. But I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the same type of pressure, the amount of courage it takes to approach a woman in a social setting even worse if she‚Äôs with friends, just to get shut down can break a man‚Äôs spirit.And I won‚Äôt even go over the dating apps and how performative and fake they feel. Even if I match with a woman it‚Äôs easy to tell she has multiple conversations going at once. I‚Äôm getting to the point where I‚Äôm checking out. I know I‚Äôll get into my routine and 2-3 years will go by without even noticing and that scares me. But I‚Äôm not sure what other choice I have, I‚Äôm wondering if any other guys have made the same decision and what has been the outcome? Do you eventually get use too it and adjust or is there always that nagging voice in your head? I‚Äôm interests in peoples experiences and views on this.",

      "content_preview": "Hi,We had 6 dates,live about 2 hours apart. I came to his city for the 6th date, before that he came to me but I said it's no problem for me to travel too.During that date he asked me about the trip abroad I've mentioned before. And because before the 6th date we haven't seen each other in a month I said maybe it's best to keep it local for now to which he agreed. I tried to be friendly and agreeable when saying that.So we agreed on the weekend at the nature park instead.Unfortunately, later I thought that maybe this would be too much....I haven't heard from him since Saturday and wonder if my anxious ass d√©terr√©e him ? I never meant to upset him or accuse him of anything, it just takes me a while to get used to someone.Our conversation :August 27, 2025: Him: \"Good morning, give me a heads up which weekend works best for you to go to the nature park?\" Me: \"Good dayüòä maybe the weekend of September 6th? üòä Maybe even starting from the 5th Friday\"Him: \"Hey, thanks for info. I'll confirm whether I can make it those days because today I learned that I might have to go on a short project to Switzerland before the project in AustraliaMe: Hey, also thank you for infoüòä Actually I wanted to ask you if it would be okay from your side to just meet up for now instead of a whole weekend? I like spending time with youüòä but we don't know each other super well yet. I hope that's okay for youHim: \"I don't know if it's okay ü§£, but no problem if that's how you feel.\"August 28, 2025: Me: \"haha what do you mean, that you don't know?\" Him: \"It was about the word haha, slang used again haha ü§£\" Me: \"Good day, ah I used the wrong word again, right? Sorry üòÖ\"Me: \"I'm a bit confused about what you mean üòÖ Because from your message yesterday you said 'if you feel that way'. Today you say something different, that it was about the word. Sorry but these last two messages stand separately, I look at them and don't know how to interpret them üòÖ What do you mean 'how I feel' because I'm getting confused\"Him: \"'How you feel' I mean that if you don't want to go somewhere with me then I understand. It's not okay news for me, but I think I'll survive it...\"Me: \"Hey, we got a bit misunderstood, I would very much like to go somewhere with you, to the nature park or somewhere else. Could we book separate rooms? I prefer not to rush such things. Would that be okay?\"August 29, 2025: Him: \"Good day. What things and who said there should be the same room?\" Me: \"Good day, I wanted to make sure about separate rooms/beds, I wasn't assuming anything from your side, sorry if it sounded that way. Physical things\"August 30, 2025: Him: \"Good day, I wish you a nice weekend with mom!\" Me: \"Good day, thank you\"There were no messages from him since. Not sure if I should just leave it?It's been 3 months but only 6 dates and both of us were very busy.Tl;dr is this man done with me or just hurt? Me-F33, him M47UPDATE :So, I decided to reach out to him yesterday. This was our conversation and from what I understand he's checked out now... Not sure if this is my fault or this would hace happened anyway eventually : Me: \"Hey, how are things, everything okay? üòä\"Him: \"Hey yes everything's okay. How about you?\"me: \"Good too, how's work going, were you at the workshop?\"Him: \"Yes, partly at the workshop and partly worked from home. How did the weekend with mom go?\"me: \"Good, we went to listen to live music at the Hop, I can show you sometime. On sauna in this city , I'd like to go back there sometime. How about you, did you decide to go to your sister's?\"Him: \"I'm glad the weekend went well. I'm sure you'll have the opportunity to go back there. Yes, I was at Dominika's and spent the weekend with family.\"Me: that's great, glad you managed to go and had a nice time.Please ignore the quotes, too many to delete, i had to translate this quickly from another language but yeah...

      "content_preview": "I (F22) had been dating (M24) since April of this year (but we‚Äôve known each other since the end of 2023). We hung out a little bit at the beginning of last year before I decided we‚Äôd be better off remaining as friends, then blocked him due to obvious resentment and spiteful comments towards me thereafter. We reconnected this year though, and I felt like he had changed and being romantically involved this time might be okay. I was wrong.A few weeks ago, we were eating at a chicken place and I noticed he had something going on with his bottom teeth. I knew they were really crooked before this moment, but I couldn‚Äôt tell in this moment if it was just chicken pieces lodged in between them because of the position of them or if it was tartar/plaque. I was going to try figuring it out by saying I thought he had some food in his teeth, but felt the moment of opportunity passed by the time I was mentally processing it all so just made a mental note to try to peep it again at a different time. But before I had to kiss him again.We work together (ik big mistake üò≠) and while working together just a few days ago (and after the initial incident), I realized it wasn‚Äôt food‚Ä¶ it was tartar build up. I tried to figure out a way to politely and gently bring it up and had so much anxiety about doing so. He worked the next shift after the one we had just worked so I felt it would be better to send him a text after he finished his second shift and not bring that up right beforehand. I wait until I know he‚Äôs off and text asking if I can bring up something to him. He replies I could so I start off saying ‚ÄúI mean this in the gentlest way‚Äù and continue saying how at first I thought maybe it was food but then realized it didn‚Äôt look like it was that. And that I know that might be something that‚Äôs hard to stay on top of or maybe financially inconvenient but provided resources that help for free. I also mentioned how my teeth aren‚Äôt perfect or anything either to not make it seem like I was coming for him.He got madddd. He replied ‚Äúmf just told me to brush my teeth. Yeah you got it.‚Äù Then confirmed his dentist said it was tartar/calculus and continued on about how he does get them cleaned, but ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt for some months now‚Äù so that‚Äôs why the tartar is visible but thanks for bringing up his insecurity. He immediately shut down the convo for the night by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to you tomorrow.‚Äù Then first thing he sent the next day was ‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre bringing up things gently, you have dry hands and need to use more lotion. ü§£‚Äù Which was wild to me because the day before this, he ALSO showed me how dry and white-creviced HIS hands were‚Ä¶ he had tartar and dry hands in the same day. And still no mention of a game plan for the tartar or even a reason as to why/how he let it get so bad. Just deflection. Mind you, I never even ‚Äútold him to go brush his teeth‚Äù because I already knew that level of tartar could only be solved by a dentist. I sent some final messages to him then immediately blocked him‚Ä¶ Again. And realized that he genuinely is just always going to struggle with having difficult conversations of things that bruise his ego (whether intentionally or not).I just don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs mad at ME that he has tartar in HIS mouth. He‚Äôs been kissing me with that! Talking about eating me out with that! And talking about taking my virginity with all that (which I‚Äôm so grateful we never got to either of those points). Sometimes I would taste something off when we‚Äôd kiss but I assumed it was food because any time we‚Äôd be making out would be after dates‚Ä¶ Once when we french-kissed, my tongue ran along something on his bottom teeth on accident and It felt sharp and threw me off but I thought it was just his teeth. I felt so sick to my stomach once I saw that months after the fact. And it‚Äôs like he cared more about the fact he was embarrassed over anything else. I‚Äôve told him I have immune issues and knowing he had all that bacteria caked into his mouth and felt that was okay is just so shocking to me. I know he said it‚Äôs been ‚Äúsome months‚Äù but I don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs been that recently either because he hasn‚Äôt gone since we‚Äôve started dating, and by the looks of it, it doesn‚Äôt even look like he‚Äôs gone months before we started dating either.I feel mad at myself too that I didn‚Äôt notice earlier!! I knew that his bottom teeth were really crooked so I feel like him being tall + certain angles/afar it just looked like his teeth? I feel like I would‚Äôve noticed earlier but I really mostly saw him at night or would be walking/talking side by side to him and either way he doesn‚Äôt really talk in a way that exposes his bottom teeth often. But yeah. Idk if there was a better way to handle this but ghosting and blocking him without at least communicating felt wrong, and I genuinely thought having a convo about it, he‚Äôd WANT to fix it. I‚Äôve learned to trust my initial gut feeling because he never should‚Äôve been unblocked from the first bad experience I had with him.",

      "content_preview": "Shit‚Äôs kinda depressing tbh. Just hit 24 a few months ago and I guess you can say I hit a belated quarter life crisis. Started reflecting on my life at this point, what I‚Äôve done, what I‚Äôve accomplished, what I haven‚Äôt, etc.Then coming to the realization that I‚Äôve lived this long without any real dating experience, hit me a bit hard thinking about it one night. I‚Äôll see many couples younger than me roaming about, I‚Äôll look back on all my peers getting in and out of relationships back in high school.All these experiences I never got to have. That young and ‚Äúfiguring it out as inexperienced people‚Äù stage I just never got to experience. To the point where I fear I‚Äôd be too inexperienced by the time I actually do find someone, they‚Äôll see my age and expect me to know certain things to do in relationships by this point.Closest thing I‚Äôve had recently is a few make out sessions with an a coworker but we never got passed that point. It honestly sucks being where I‚Äôm at at this age. I know some people tell I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt feel this way, a relationship isn‚Äôt everything‚Äù but how many of these same people have gotten to my age with ZERO experience?Shit hits harder some days than others.",

She is 21 and I am 28. Apparently even a 6 year difference is too much and they only want I think what like a 2 or 3 difference at most.Honestly this seems to happen to me a lot. Apparently I need to focus on people more my age but thing is no one my age appeals to me. Like a lot of them have kids or have settled down and stuff but I'm not wanting that with just anyone you know. I want my own kids someday and I've also not been in any relationships or had any kind of romantic or sexual interactions in the past 5 almost 6 years.No one catches my eye or interest. People tell me I am too shallow or maybe am too picky and the fact I don't like people my age is a problem but idk is it really though?I need some advice or something because I'm already someone who has been hurt a lot in life and is already hesitant to open up or get close to anyone anymore because I always end up hurting.The times I do try then one of these situations arise.Please can someone help. Do I have a problem?",

I've had professors/lecturers sit in the lecture seats and turn their whole body to stare at me for minutes long during the lectures their colleague was giving (and yes I'm sure this happened).I'm not boring or mean, even my male friends say so, but to the men I've met I'm just a fantasy, not a girlfriend, not a wife, hardly human.

      "content_preview": "Hello,Just thought I'd share this with you, be interested to get other opinions on this. I was DJing at a dating event recently held in Cardiff, in the UK. It was ran by a quite a successful company and matched people based on their Al Gore Rhythms - People who can dance like Al Gore at parties and other get togethers. Mainly for heterosexual dating aged between 20-40. Couple of things I noticed :-The people who actually to go these completely alone (not with a supportive friend, or single friend) have an unbelievable amount of courage. I've done stand-up comedy before and wouldn't find it as nerve-wracking as this experience.My DJ partner and I (both single males) met the organizer's sister who was running the evening. She said something really interesting things about what she noticed about these events. She said that there's normally 1-2 men who are very good looking that get the most attention. They often say something like \"to be honest I'm not really sure what I'm looking for\" which then gets them even more attention from women based on their apparent lethargy. She also said that the men who appear to give less of a f*ck about whether they find someone or not whether in dating events, or indeed in life, are instantly more attractive to women.(This kind, informative lady ended up getting really drunk and going home with my DJ friend who is good looking, single and really doesn't care about women so I suppose there's something in that)From a woman's perspective - Is there any truth in that? The less you care the more attractive you are in dating events / the early part of dating?",

      "content_preview": "There's an interesting dynamic at play when people talk about meeting people through hobbies, and I see it all the time. If a person wants to meet others \"organically,\" one of the first pieces of advice they'll get is to meet people through hobbies and things that they enjoy. However, that advice is only applicable if you have social, group-oriented hobbies. If your hobbies are individual things like knitting, collecting things, cooking, reading, working out, etc., that advice probably won't apply well to you. However, if you say that, the response will then be \"well, broaden your horizons and get new hobbies,\" but at the same time, people will also tell you \"don't join new hobbies just to find people to date.\"See how conflicting that can be?If I have hobbies, they're not good enough if I'm not meeting people through them, so I should get new ones.If I get new ones solely to meet people because I wasn't interested in it on my own, then that's wrong too.All I'll say is that not everyone wants to be in a run club or join a rock climbing gym, but the more people get told to \"get new hobbies\" that'll let them meet people, the more people you'll get who are only there to meet people and they don't care about the hobby.My best advice would be that, if you have a solo hobby, go do it in public. If you like to read, don't stay home and read. Go to a cafe where people are. If you like to knit, go do that at a park where people are. If you like to work out, consider deliberately going during peak times when other people are there. If your hobby only requires you, just change your environment. You might not need to change hobbies altogether.ETA: This is not a statement about my own hobbies, I'm just making an observation.",

I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first because he did seem innocent enough in person and he was cool with going out and doing stuff and we started texting more. Then the last time I saw him at the end of July, he got argumentative/bothered with me because he didn't like two of my opinions on his favorite artists (they're really popular, and all I said was that they're corny and overrated, nothing worse). After we hungout that day, I messaged him 3-4 times and he didn't reply to any of them. And then he randomly messages after a month like nothing happened.At this point, I'm kinda done with him and I say a couple VERY rude things (about his dick..) AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE but the ghosting made me feel bad so it was only fair I got to make him feel bad too. So now I'm worried if I get back on hinge, he's going to see my profile on his feed and report me. It's really hard for me to meet people organically in my town so apps are the only thing I got, so that'd be pretty bad because if you report someone, it can get their profile banned. What should I do?I was honestly thinking of messaging him again and just being straight up that he's flakey as hell so he knows at least where my insults were coming from, but I don't know.

      "content_preview": "I mean statistically speaking there are more men who don't want kids than women (edit: okay, my error, likely more an equal amount of men to women, nowadays), but I seem to never run into said men anywhere. If I do, they are typically polyamorous, and I am not. I'm curious, where are you guys going in looking for women to date? Are you online dating? Are you mostly offline and out in the wild? Going to certain social or activity groups? Is there a certain dating site you're finding child free people on? I'm just wondering because it's been like trying to find a unicorn even though it shouldn't be.",

      "content_preview": "I don‚Äôt have any prospects in my friend group for dating, and the apps do not work for me. I‚Äôve been trying my best to go and meet people, but lately I haven‚Äôt had any connections develop that were longer term. I‚Äôve asked female friends in particular if they know anyone and they do not. The only time this did happen was by luck when a guy in the group knew two people.I am coming to the conclusion I may have to just suck it up, start going to bars, and cold approach women. I have done this before but I sometimes had nervousness when approaching women, because when approaching a stranger for the first time, it‚Äôs hard to know what to say. During the times I have approached, I usually gave women compliments and then tried asking them about their interests for a period before offering to take them out. The last few women I did this with didn‚Äôt respond back to text messages the next morning.I just don‚Äôt see any options at this point. It‚Äôs discouraging but I‚Äôll keep pressing on, and gather up the courage to cold approach strangers.",

      "content_preview": "Context: 6 weeks ago we met, we spent every day for 1 week together and very much enjoyed each others company. He (28) came to my city, and is in the process of moving here. At the end of the week together, he had to go back to where he lives now, and before he left he told me he has no interest in pursuing other people, that he would like to only focus one person at a time.We talked for the past month, texting a lot and a few hour long calls. This past week he suddenly pulled away and I (25) asked him, if everything is okay, if he would like to pursue seeing other people and specifically if he is using dating apps ‚Äî he said ‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt even have time to relax I don‚Äôt have time to go out‚Äù.My friend who is in his area matched with him on a dating app yesterday and he asked her out for drinks. She sent me the screenshots.I am not the one who wanted to be exclusive, that was him, so it leaves me confused why he would do this. I provided such easy opportunities to be honest, and he chose to lie instead.At best, he is deceptive and a liar.I told him I thought we had a spark, that I felt foolish and that I think he love bombed me without meaning to. He said ‚Äú what , why , where is this coming from‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt answer because I have nothing to say. This morning he messages me hello. I was quite infatuated with him until I saw he is a liar. Should I respond at all? If yes, what to say? I am not one to ghost people I care about, but he clearly doesn‚Äôt care about me so maybe it‚Äôs the best option.TLDR; Guy that asked Me to be exclusive still active on dating apps after saying he is not. Do I ghost or say something?",

      "content_preview": "The dating scene is horrible. Men fear to approach, women are drained on dating apps, it doesn't seem to work for anyone.I believe single women want to be approached, but it needs to be in a certain way that feels safe and not creepy.I know every person is different, sure, but I think society needs to create new rules for approaching strangers with the intent to date.So I ask women to come up with the new rules, I'm sure men would be happy to follow any kind of script.Where is it okay, when is it okay, how should we try. It sounds lame, but in my knowledge, back in the day (like a 100 year ago), there was generally a space and time and a method to do this. Let's try to recreate that.If we could come up with something that men could follow, and women would be kind to men following the rules, even when they are not interested, we could get somewhere.I know people want it to be natural and random, the world became way too complicated, it doesn't work anymore. These signals are making a lot of people unsure, leading to mistakes and awkward situations. And the usual, just \"act normal\", doesn't help.I know a post like this won't do anything, but maybe if women fired up their social media, and do a call to arms with their fellow women to shape the rules they want to be approached, men would happily follow your needs.We, men, are (generally) not trying to make anyone uncomfortable, we just don't have any proper guidelines to follow.There are so many stupid online trends, let's try to do one that actually helps.",
