      "content_preview": "I would consider myself average when it comes to looks and I‚Äôm in good physical shape, I‚Äôm a 43M been back in the dating scene after a divorce for about 2 years now. But I‚Äôve noticed how invisible I can be in my every day life. I have a life that revolves around routines. I lift weights 3 times a week I train jiu jitsu 3 times a week, and I go jogging. Along with work, and being a single dad I still find time to go out on a Friday/Saturday night and have a few drinks.People will tell you live your life and what happens, happens. Keep putting yourself out there. But the pressure to do all the stuff I listed to keep my mind and body in shape, well that‚Äôs not enough I still need to go out and approach a woman. It‚Äôs just frustrating out here for guys and I‚Äôm sure it is for women too. But I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the same type of pressure, the amount of courage it takes to approach a woman in a social setting even worse if she‚Äôs with friends, just to get shut down can break a man‚Äôs spirit.And I won‚Äôt even go over the dating apps and how performative and fake they feel. Even if I match with a woman it‚Äôs easy to tell she has multiple conversations going at once. I‚Äôm getting to the point where I‚Äôm checking out. I know I‚Äôll get into my routine and 2-3 years will go by without even noticing and that scares me. But I‚Äôm not sure what other choice I have, I‚Äôm wondering if any other guys have made the same decision and what has been the outcome? Do you eventually get use too it and adjust or is there always that nagging voice in your head? I‚Äôm interests in peoples experiences and views on this.",

      "content_preview": "I genuinely didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have an update so soon, or at all if I‚Äôm being honest.I was feeling pretty good all day yesterday about my resolve to not text him, I went to work, to the gym, and while I was sad, I didn‚Äôt let myself mope.In the evening, I got a text. Not from him but from my ex whom I dated 10 years ago, we‚Äôre still close and talk often. He‚Äôs one of the most jaded, realest people I know, and never sugarcoats anything for me. If I can count on one person to truly tell me how it is, even if it hurts, it‚Äôs him.I explained a bit of my situation to him. Told him about the date, the immediate aftermath, and the family emergency without going into many details. Again, I want to respect his family‚Äôs privacy because I never doubted the validity of the story, just the severity with the timing.His advice? Text the man. Actually, his exact words were, ‚ÄúModern dating is crap, but you don‚Äôt have to be. You believe the family emergency so who cares if he‚Äôs just not that into you. Show up and support him, because that‚Äôs what good people do, and you‚Äôre a good person.‚ÄùSo I did. I texted him asking for an update. Then offered to bring him beer from a local brewery, and pizza from the place he told me he loves, on my free night next week. To take his mind off things. I showed up with genuine care, intention, and a plan.And it worked. He texted back immediately.A long full update on the situation, an apology for leaving me hanging, and suggestions for pizza toppings. We texted late into the night, until it was me that finally suggested that we both go to bed. His texts were no longer just polite, but had a flirty edge again, and excitement.Obviously, I can‚Äôt predict where things will go from here, but let this serve as a reminder that sometimes you should send that text. Leaving the ball in their court, isn‚Äôt always the best option.",

And it just feelsrightProgression and just the overall hard talks, talking about sharing keys, and long term goals (as relocation for one of us would be necessary). I stayed with him for two weeks as I am a teacher and didn‚Äôt think of a better way to spend the remainder of my summer. And in those two weeks we had those conversations, opened up about our past selves, and what we learned in our previous relationships. And we have each met our respective parents.

      "content_preview": "Hi,We had 6 dates,live about 2 hours apart. I came to his city for the 6th date, before that he came to me but I said it's no problem for me to travel too.During that date he asked me about the trip abroad I've mentioned before. And because before the 6th date we haven't seen each other in a month I said maybe it's best to keep it local for now to which he agreed. I tried to be friendly and agreeable when saying that.So we agreed on the weekend at the nature park instead.Unfortunately, later I thought that maybe this would be too much....I haven't heard from him since Saturday and wonder if my anxious ass d√©terr√©e him ? I never meant to upset him or accuse him of anything, it just takes me a while to get used to someone.Our conversation :August 27, 2025: Him: \"Good morning, give me a heads up which weekend works best for you to go to the nature park?\" Me: \"Good dayüòä maybe the weekend of September 6th? üòä Maybe even starting from the 5th Friday\"Him: \"Hey, thanks for info. I'll confirm whether I can make it those days because today I learned that I might have to go on a short project to Switzerland before the project in AustraliaMe: Hey, also thank you for infoüòä Actually I wanted to ask you if it would be okay from your side to just meet up for now instead of a whole weekend? I like spending time with youüòä but we don't know each other super well yet. I hope that's okay for youHim: \"I don't know if it's okay ü§£, but no problem if that's how you feel.\"August 28, 2025: Me: \"haha what do you mean, that you don't know?\" Him: \"It was about the word haha, slang used again haha ü§£\" Me: \"Good day, ah I used the wrong word again, right? Sorry üòÖ\"Me: \"I'm a bit confused about what you mean üòÖ Because from your message yesterday you said 'if you feel that way'. Today you say something different, that it was about the word. Sorry but these last two messages stand separately, I look at them and don't know how to interpret them üòÖ What do you mean 'how I feel' because I'm getting confused\"Him: \"'How you feel' I mean that if you don't want to go somewhere with me then I understand. It's not okay news for me, but I think I'll survive it...\"Me: \"Hey, we got a bit misunderstood, I would very much like to go somewhere with you, to the nature park or somewhere else. Could we book separate rooms? I prefer not to rush such things. Would that be okay?\"August 29, 2025: Him: \"Good day. What things and who said there should be the same room?\" Me: \"Good day, I wanted to make sure about separate rooms/beds, I wasn't assuming anything from your side, sorry if it sounded that way. Physical things\"August 30, 2025: Him: \"Good day, I wish you a nice weekend with mom!\" Me: \"Good day, thank you\"There were no messages from him since. Not sure if I should just leave it?It's been 3 months but only 6 dates and both of us were very busy.Tl;dr is this man done with me or just hurt? Me-F33, him M47UPDATE :So, I decided to reach out to him yesterday. This was our conversation and from what I understand he's checked out now... Not sure if this is my fault or this would hace happened anyway eventually : Me: \"Hey, how are things, everything okay? üòä\"Him: \"Hey yes everything's okay. How about you?\"me: \"Good too, how's work going, were you at the workshop?\"Him: \"Yes, partly at the workshop and partly worked from home. How did the weekend with mom go?\"me: \"Good, we went to listen to live music at the Hop, I can show you sometime. On sauna in this city , I'd like to go back there sometime. How about you, did you decide to go to your sister's?\"Him: \"I'm glad the weekend went well. I'm sure you'll have the opportunity to go back there. Yes, I was at Dominika's and spent the weekend with family.\"Me: that's great, glad you managed to go and had a nice time.Please ignore the quotes, too many to delete, i had to translate this quickly from another language but yeah... It hurts.",

And me being stupid, I'll probably trying too hard nowBut I've asked her and she said there's nothing I've done wrong and to stop overthinking. I guess I should pull back too. Reply with less, maybe even leave her on read, not that she's done that to me. I've just been in this situation before and it's not nice. This girl claimed she doesn't reply if she's not interested but I feel like she's hoping I just stop replying but I'm too scared to do that. I guess I'll just have to do it and see what happensThen again, if it's not open and honest communication, I probably don't want this too. Just doesn't help she's really attractive and my type üòÇ",

      "content_preview": "So I was talking to this girl and trying to get to know them and we see how we vibed together and yeah sure we seem to be getting along pretty well as friends somewhat even if we don't really have anthing in common or any common interests or hobbies.However she has admitted that while she does want a relationship, I however am just too old for her. She is 21 and I am 28. Apparently even a 6 year difference is too much and they only want I think what like a 2 or 3 difference at most.Honestly this seems to happen to me a lot. Apparently I need to focus on people more my age but thing is no one my age appeals to me. Like a lot of them have kids or have settled down and stuff but I'm not wanting that with just anyone you know. I want my own kids someday and I've also not been in any relationships or had any kind of romantic or sexual interactions in the past 5 almost 6 years.No one catches my eye or interest. People tell me I am too shallow or maybe am too picky and the fact I don't like people my age is a problem but idk is it really though?I need some advice or something because I'm already someone who has been hurt a lot in life and is already hesitant to open up or get close to anyone anymore because I always end up hurting.The times I do try then one of these situations arise.Please can someone help. Do I have a problem?",

      "content_preview": "Hey Everybody,I joined this subreddit a month or two ago, at the time, I was on the back foot, a gal I had been talking to had ghosted me. I was REALLY into that girl at the time and was absolutely devastated, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still hoping things could work out, but I've been doing a lot of self-improvement, and whether or not I ever see her again isn't the world ending Ragnar√∂k that I felt it was in the past. As I just mentioned, I've been through a ton of self-improvement recently, I've still got a ways to go, but I've crossed some hurdles recently and I wanted to share some stuff that might be of help to a lot of people on here. This is gonna be a bit of a read, so strap in if you're interested.A lot of people in this subreddit, myself included for a time, get really bent out of shape when someone doesn't like us, or rejects us. I've seen a lot of people say things like, \"I just love so deeply,\" or, \"I'm just not cut out for this modern heartlessness.\" Everyone is different, so your background may be rooted in something different than mine, but usually, the pain of someone rejecting us tends to be rooted in insecurity, and not the claimed, \"pain of a pure heart.\" In my case, I realized that I was a real control freak, and that control was an effort to protect my insecurities. I spent a great deal of my energy each day, trying to be what I thought would get people to like me, both day to day people I'd encounter, and love interests. If I met a girl I liked, I'd romance the hell out of her, I'd figure out what she liked and really try to conform to what I thought would get her to like me. This was exhausting and always failed, trying to be someone else has a shelf-life that lasts around as long as you have the strength to keep being someone you're not. When you try to control other people's perceptions of yourself, you end up controlling yourself as well. This is something that has been plaguing me my entire life, but I never broke through and figured it out until now.I think too many people try too hard to be someone they're not in dating, too many people are afraid to let go of the control and be who they are, and that really hurts you in two ways. First off, you can't be you, you're stilted and uncomfortable, you don't get to show your best side to people, you come off generic. This also hurts your chances during that stage when your interest is shopping through multiple opportunities. Secondly, it gives life to relationships that should not be, if you aren't really the person you make yourself out to be, you'll pair up for a while with someone who isn't cut out for you. You'll end up having a fun time with someone who isn't going to work long term, and be devastated when things fall out in the end. If you'd have just been real, you both might realize you aren't meant to be, and you can both move on to people that work better. That last point may sound kind of dreary to some, but in my experience, hard conforming to try and make something work, is a sign that you don't really love and respect who you are. If you don't get that sorted, your life is going to suck. I'm working on fixing that now, from the small progress I've made in recent days, my life is so fulfilling and full of happiness that I usually found short lived in the past. This leads very nicely into the next point.I see a lot of people in this subreddit, bemoaning the adage, \"take some time off and learn to love yourself.\" If that line bothers you, then you need to do just that. I've had an immense amount of peace this week after these recent discoveries of my trying to control people's perceptions to cover my insecurities. I'm currently taking a break to recoup and rebuild after that little breakup. I want to and plan on continuing to date in the future, but I have hit a point recently of \"self-love\" that I haven't had before. I want someone in my life, I don't want to be alone, I want a life partner to share this journey with, but I also respect myself enough now, that I know that if I don't find someone who works with me, that I'm going to be okay. I've been going to therapy since this whole ordeal went down and I've really zeroed in on my need to be authentic, that journey has led me to appreciate who I am as a person. I realized that I judged myself, and others, so harshly in the past. We are all human beings, we all deserve happiness and meaning. Life isn't a horror movie, we don't need to just survive, its okay to go out and have fun for the sake of fun, life doesn't have to be so dreary. When you realize all of that, you suddenly respect yourself more, you take an interest in yourself more. I now have meaning in my life, born from within myself, and I don't need other people's approval for this. These realizations have given my life meaning, and while I want a companion, my freedom of self is so wonderful, that I'm willing to go solo if I don't find someone who works with me.All of this really changes your view on life and dating. When you embrace yourself, when you realize that you are who you are and it doesn't matter, nor can you control, what others think of you. It takes you out of a desperate place of basically begging the dating scene for whatever it will toss to you. You can make demands and realize when someone probably isn't a great fit for you. This doesn't mean you're perfect, we are all flawed, but self-reflecting, and deciding to change something because you believe that change is good, is totally different from the desperation of a whipped dog, desperate for its master's praise. So yeah, take some time off and fix yourself, love yourself a little. I know this isn't easy, the last month or two have been a nightmare of anxiety and depression for me as I've waded through the chaos of rejection. I know my journey isn't over, I know I may slide back occasionally, but I'm breaking through to something new and I'm learning that things don't have to keep being the way they have been. You don't have to keep looping through the same pain, you don't have to keep playing this lousy game. There is hope.That's gonna be it for now, if you got this far, thanks for your time, I hope this was helpful. The journey to true self-love and a meaningful life is definitely not easy. Like the title of this post, its a light in the dark, a light of hope, and a light that exposes your own pain that must be addressed in order to get to somewhere better. The beginning is always tough, especially if you're reeling from the pain of rejection. I have a mantra that has helped me through these times, \"one foot in front of the other.\" If you need to go get something in your house, you walk to that thing. You may not want that thing, but if you just walk towards it, you'll get there. If you're standing in a shadowy place, and you see the light, walk towards it, even if you don't feel like it. If you seek self-improvement, you will not always feel like doing the work, but if you do what must be done each day, regardless of your feelings, you will continue to make forward progress. Its one foot in front of the other, how you feel doesn't cancel out what you know. Thanks for reading, I know this was a little personal, but I've seen such a change in my life recently and I wanted to share it. Hopefully this helps some of you on this journey and spreads some light on the way.",

And now that everyone is ditching dating apps, companies are popping up to create dating event, but it‚Äôs still like dating apps. It‚Äôs designed to get as many people possible in a single room for a finite amount of time. It just replaces the venue from online, to in person. But the problem stays the same.And just like capitalism, people treating dating the same. Just as how people trying to hire entry level jobs and requiring 3 years of experience, in the dating world, people are pretty much asking ‚Äúwhat you can bring to the table,‚Äù like it‚Äôs a job interview. And just like how in capitalism, how companies stopped training people, the same thing is happening with people. I‚Äôm not talking about someone who is a psycho, but if someone makes a mistake or have certain faux pas, that‚Äôs a deal breaker. It is only then left with people with an insane amount of requirements.I think we can break the cycle, but it is gonna take huge effort from everyone.

      "content_preview": "Hello,Just thought I'd share this with you, be interested to get other opinions on this. I was DJing at a dating event recently held in Cardiff, in the UK. It was ran by a quite a successful company and matched people based on their Al Gore Rhythms - People who can dance like Al Gore at parties and other get togethers. Mainly for heterosexual dating aged between 20-40. Couple of things I noticed :-The people who actually to go these completely alone (not with a supportive friend, or single friend) have an unbelievable amount of courage. I've done stand-up comedy before and wouldn't find it as nerve-wracking as this experience.My DJ partner and I (both single males) met the organizer's sister who was running the evening. She said something really interesting things about what she noticed about these events. She said that there's normally 1-2 men who are very good looking that get the most attention. They often say something like \"to be honest I'm not really sure what I'm looking for\" which then gets them even more attention from women based on their apparent lethargy. She also said that the men who appear to give less of a f*ck about whether they find someone or not whether in dating events, or indeed in life, are instantly more attractive to women.(This kind, informative lady ended up getting really drunk and going home with my DJ friend who is good looking, single and really doesn't care about women so I suppose there's something in that)From a woman's perspective - Is there any truth in that? The less you care the more attractive you are in dating events / the early part of dating?",

      "content_preview": "There's an interesting dynamic at play when people talk about meeting people through hobbies, and I see it all the time. If a person wants to meet others \"organically,\" one of the first pieces of advice they'll get is to meet people through hobbies and things that they enjoy. However, that advice is only applicable if you have social, group-oriented hobbies. If your hobbies are individual things like knitting, collecting things, cooking, reading, working out, etc., that advice probably won't apply well to you. However, if you say that, the response will then be \"well, broaden your horizons and get new hobbies,\" but at the same time, people will also tell you \"don't join new hobbies just to find people to date.\"See how conflicting that can be?If I have hobbies, they're not good enough if I'm not meeting people through them, so I should get new ones.If I get new ones solely to meet people because I wasn't interested in it on my own, then that's wrong too.All I'll say is that not everyone wants to be in a run club or join a rock climbing gym, but the more people get told to \"get new hobbies\" that'll let them meet people, the more people you'll get who are only there to meet people and they don't care about the hobby.My best advice would be that, if you have a solo hobby, go do it in public. If you like to read, don't stay home and read. Go to a cafe where people are. If you like to knit, go do that at a park where people are. If you like to work out, consider deliberately going during peak times when other people are there. If your hobby only requires you, just change your environment. You might not need to change hobbies altogether.ETA: This is not a statement about my own hobbies, I'm just making an observation.",

      "content_preview": "I first met this one guy on Hinge months ago, but he's been kinda weird and an asshole from the start (invites me to his house on the 2nd date for a \"chill date\", then ghosts me for 1-2 months and comes back pretending he \"thought he replied\". I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first because he did seem innocent enough in person and he was cool with going out and doing stuff and we started texting more. Then the last time I saw him at the end of July, he got argumentative/bothered with me because he didn't like two of my opinions on his favorite artists (they're really popular, and all I said was that they're corny and overrated, nothing worse). After we hungout that day, I messaged him 3-4 times and he didn't reply to any of them. And then he randomly messages after a month like nothing happened.At this point, I'm kinda done with him and I say a couple VERY rude things (about his dick..) AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE but the ghosting made me feel bad so it was only fair I got to make him feel bad too. So now I'm worried if I get back on hinge, he's going to see my profile on his feed and report me. It's really hard for me to meet people organically in my town so apps are the only thing I got, so that'd be pretty bad because if you report someone, it can get their profile banned. What should I do?I was honestly thinking of messaging him again and just being straight up that he's flakey as hell so he knows at least where my insults were coming from, but I don't know. Thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "I (F22) had been dating (M24) since April of this year (but we‚Äôve known each other since the end of 2023). We hung out a little bit at the beginning of last year before I decided we‚Äôd be better off remaining as friends, then blocked him due to obvious resentment and spiteful comments towards me thereafter. We reconnected this year though, and I felt like he had changed and being romantically involved this time might be okay. I was wrong.A few weeks ago, we were eating at a chicken place and I noticed he had something going on with his bottom teeth. I knew they were really crooked before this moment, but I couldn‚Äôt tell in this moment if it was just chicken pieces lodged in between them because of the position of them or if it was tartar/plaque. I was going to try figuring it out by saying I thought he had some food in his teeth, but felt the moment of opportunity passed by the time I was mentally processing it all so just made a mental note to try to peep it again at a different time. But before I had to kiss him again.We work together (ik big mistake üò≠) and while working together just a few days ago (and after the initial incident), I realized it wasn‚Äôt food‚Ä¶ it was tartar build up. I tried to figure out a way to politely and gently bring it up and had so much anxiety about doing so. He worked the next shift after the one we had just worked so I felt it would be better to send him a text after he finished his second shift and not bring that up right beforehand. I wait until I know he‚Äôs off and text asking if I can bring up something to him. He replies I could so I start off saying ‚ÄúI mean this in the gentlest way‚Äù and continue saying how at first I thought maybe it was food but then realized it didn‚Äôt look like it was that. And that I know that might be something that‚Äôs hard to stay on top of or maybe financially inconvenient but provided resources that help for free. I also mentioned how my teeth aren‚Äôt perfect or anything either to not make it seem like I was coming for him.He got madddd. He replied ‚Äúmf just told me to brush my teeth. Yeah you got it.‚Äù Then confirmed his dentist said it was tartar/calculus and continued on about how he does get them cleaned, but ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt for some months now‚Äù so that‚Äôs why the tartar is visible but thanks for bringing up his insecurity. He immediately shut down the convo for the night by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to you tomorrow.‚Äù Then first thing he sent the next day was ‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre bringing up things gently, you have dry hands and need to use more lotion. ü§£‚Äù Which was wild to me because the day before this, he ALSO showed me how dry and white-creviced HIS hands were‚Ä¶ he had tartar and dry hands in the same day. And still no mention of a game plan for the tartar or even a reason as to why/how he let it get so bad. Just deflection. Mind you, I never even ‚Äútold him to go brush his teeth‚Äù because I already knew that level of tartar could only be solved by a dentist. I sent some final messages to him then immediately blocked him‚Ä¶ Again. And realized that he genuinely is just always going to struggle with having difficult conversations of things that bruise his ego (whether intentionally or not).I just don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs mad at ME that he has tartar in HIS mouth. He‚Äôs been kissing me with that! Talking about eating me out with that! And talking about taking my virginity with all that (which I‚Äôm so grateful we never got to either of those points). Sometimes I would taste something off when we‚Äôd kiss but I assumed it was food because any time we‚Äôd be making out would be after dates‚Ä¶ Once when we french-kissed, my tongue ran along something on his bottom teeth on accident and It felt sharp and threw me off but I thought it was just his teeth. I felt so sick to my stomach once I saw that months after the fact. And it‚Äôs like he cared more about the fact he was embarrassed over anything else. I‚Äôve told him I have immune issues and knowing he had all that bacteria caked into his mouth and felt that was okay is just so shocking to me. I know he said it‚Äôs been ‚Äúsome months‚Äù but I don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs been that recently either because he hasn‚Äôt gone since we‚Äôve started dating, and by the looks of it, it doesn‚Äôt even look like he‚Äôs gone months before we started dating either.I feel mad at myself too that I didn‚Äôt notice earlier!! I knew that his bottom teeth were really crooked so I feel like him being tall + certain angles/afar it just looked like his teeth? I feel like I would‚Äôve noticed earlier but I really mostly saw him at night or would be walking/talking side by side to him and either way he doesn‚Äôt really talk in a way that exposes his bottom teeth often. But yeah. Idk if there was a better way to handle this but ghosting and blocking him without at least communicating felt wrong, and I genuinely thought having a convo about it, he‚Äôd WANT to fix it. I‚Äôve learned to trust my initial gut feeling because he never should‚Äôve been unblocked from the first bad experience I had with him.",

This past week he suddenly pulled away and I (25) asked him, if everything is okay, if he would like to pursue seeing other people and specifically if he is using dating apps ‚Äî he said ‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt even have time to relax I don‚Äôt have time to go out‚Äù.My friend who is in his area matched with him on a dating app yesterday and he asked her out for drinks. She sent me the screenshots.I am not the one who wanted to be exclusive, that was him, so it leaves me confused why he would do this. I provided such easy opportunities to be honest, and he chose to lie instead.At best, he is deceptive and a liar.I told him I thought we had a spark, that I felt foolish and that I think he love bombed me without meaning to. He said ‚Äú what , why , where is this coming from‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt answer because I have nothing to say. This morning he messages me hello. I was quite infatuated with him until I saw he is a liar. Should I respond at all? If yes, what to say? I am not one to ghost people I care about, but he clearly doesn‚Äôt care about me so maybe it‚Äôs the best option.TLDR; Guy that asked Me to be exclusive still active on dating apps after saying he is not. Do I ghost or say something?",

Men fear to approach, women are drained on dating apps, it doesn't seem to work for anyone.I believe single women want to be approached, but it needs to be in a certain way that feels safe and not creepy.I know every person is different, sure, but I think society needs to create new rules for approaching strangers with the intent to date.So I ask women to come up with the new rules, I'm sure men would be happy to follow any kind of script.Where is it okay, when is it okay, how should we try. It sounds lame, but in my knowledge, back in the day (like a 100 year ago), there was generally a space and time and a method to do this. Let's try to recreate that.If we could come up with something that men could follow, and women would be kind to men following the rules, even when they are not interested, we could get somewhere.I know people want it to be natural and random, the world became way too complicated, it doesn't work anymore. These signals are making a lot of people unsure, leading to mistakes and awkward situations. And the usual, just \"act normal\", doesn't help.I know a post like this won't do anything, but maybe if women fired up their social media, and do a call to arms with their fellow women to shape the rules they want to be approached, men would happily follow your needs.We, men, are (generally) not trying to make anyone uncomfortable, we just don't have any proper guidelines to follow.There are so many stupid online trends, let's try to do one that actually helps.",

Had a single phone call the night before to finalize our plans.We met the day of, and she was even prettier than her pictures. We spent about an hour at the cafe and decided to relocate to a Mexican restaurant. She tried something she‚Äôs never eaten before and loved it.We spent a solid 90 minutes there then we decided to walk around a nearby lake. We‚Äôre in Florida so it was HOT during the day but I didn‚Äôt even care; I just wanted more time with her.5 minutes into walking, she said it was too hot (lol) and she wanted to chill out a bit. I asked if she wanted to leave, and she clarified that she wanted to sit on the grass by the water. We ended up chatting for about an hour, pretty much laying down on the grass.Our feet were playfully touching, and her eye contact was piercing into my soul. She had a certainlookin her eyes and I was sure she wanted a kiss. I told her I wanted to kiss her. She looked bashful, a bit surprised, and excited all at once. I‚Äôm not one for PDA but I couldn‚Äôt help it. It wasn‚Äôt simply a peck, it was fantastic.We hung for a few more minutes then decided to leave. I asked for her hand as we walked back to my car, she obliged. After driving her back, I got a few more kisses. Hoping to see her again this following week.I know there‚Äôs been some discussing about whether or not to ask for a kiss. In all honesty, I don‚Äôt think I had to ask based on her body language and energy. But I wanted to show my respect for her while directly communicating my intentions. And I‚Äôm very glad I did.

He got my number from my friend.He then disappeared and didn't text me again. Till 3 yrs later and this dude is texting me tk visit me.I 100 percent say no cause I was doing so well. Thing is, I posted myself ans that's how he started texting me.We end up in the same college. He sees me from a far. He tells his friends to mention his name and he has a studio ans penthouse. I ignore them. Then at least we were never in the same class. I spoke tk other guys Till one time I was at this event in school, I was about to leave and few mins later, I see him ans his friends behind far away. Am like walking fast caus this is weird. Why couldn't he let me go? He was the one who was rude when I was interestedI later texted him, and we were cordial. He hugged me in the rain( I don't believe thos happened either) and asked how I was doing. He high fived me and greeted me. Till one time i was at the club and he came sat around where I was instead of with his friends.he saw me stand up for myself to sb. He then smiled snd smirked at me.I could feel him following me with his eyes.he was staring for long and them his friends shouted his name in a flirty way loudly ans I sneered at them. ONE. he can try ans talk to me. Instead he ignored me again.So we greeted each other ans I could tell maybe he is irritated by me and I made a mistake being friends wirh sb who rejected you. Then eventually, I got tired of his sneering and blocked him everywhere on mediaI meet with him again. Coincidence, and he stares at me in my eyes. I couldn't look at him. I had blocked him for a while. I had moved on mostly even in college, its just he keeps starign until you are like, maybe if i try we can date but thats it.He never once texted me to hang out.just staring.then he also avoids meThis story is almost like fate. I don't believe in fate but we kept meeting so coincidence.i had feelings for the guy ans he hasn't even tried anything.but he staring why?So I'm having a hard time moving on. Caus what was I thinking texting this ex? He never initiates ever. I would like to meet newguys but he keeps confusing me. I ignore him ,he tries harder to stare ,smile..but when I approach even as cordial, he sneered at me. Any advice on moving on. Be kind in replying. Its being going on for too long on and off",

I had to take a 6 month break from kissing, but ended up dating someone new during this time (I fully disclosed the mono situation and we didn‚Äôt kiss). After the 4th date, this dude pretended to slap my face and pretended to play punch my sides randomly while cuddling (like not actually doing it, but making the motions like he was going to). I told him it made me uncomfortable when he played like that and to stop. Instead of trying to understand my perspective, he got upset and said he didn‚Äôt like my tone or attitude in telling him so (which I dead didn‚Äôt say it loudly or rudely at all. Just very straightforward.) Blocked him.Reconnected with someone else after my 6 months no kissing hiatus (someone who had already been blocked for odd behavior  previously but I convinced myself it‚Äôd be different this time) and this dude had a layer of tartar caked into the bottom of his teeth. Which I didn‚Äôt realize until well after we had been making out. I tried to bring it up gently over text so we could come up with a solution together (bc why would I wanna be kissing that) and instead he got mad at me for ‚Äúbringing up his insecurity‚Äù and said my hands need more lotion üò©How is it thee FIRST person I dated and was finally able to kiss after mono, had all that going on with him too. I feel like the mono + tartar combo pack of people back to back is just the universe telling me to keep my body to myself.üíÄ I‚Äôm not going out of my way to pick people who lack hygiene or who have diseases so idk what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt know subconsciously what‚Äôs going on with who I am picking.They‚Äôre all different races, heights, looks, personalities, etc. The only common thing is they‚Äôre either my age (22) or a few years older max. And ig the other common denominator would be me! But I dead do not be starting stuff! üò≠ I‚Äôm vocal about what makes me feel uncomfortable/difficult convos but I appreciate and expect the same with someone I‚Äôm seeing. I just feel like this is the world‚Äôs way of saying I just need a break. I‚Äôm tired of my health/well-being being jeopardized and my block list getting full. I haven‚Äôt even gone all the way with anyone yet and these experiences make me feel like it‚Äôs not in my cards to, at least not anytime soon. Like I have to feel super emotionally and physically safe. And yes ik testing is a thing + protection but the way things are going rn, I‚Äôm scared at this point imma catch something off the rip. I‚Äôve stayed jumping from one to the next thinking they‚Äôll ‚Äúbe the one‚Äù but at this point I actively wait forthebad moment. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to be perfect, but I don‚Äôt think it should be like thissss üíÄEdit: not to mention. The very first intimate experience I had was with a guy my friend had been trying to set me up with. We mess around a lil at her party and everything seemed great. I spent the night at her house with another friend. Woke up the next day, go to my car, and see that he had drunkenly sideswiped my vehicle on his way out the night before!! üò≠üò≠ he admitted that he had but didn‚Äôt want me to go through insurance. I wanted to. He blocked me and never fixed it. The swipe is still there to this day lol. It‚Äôs like everywhere I‚Äôm constantly reminded of these experiences or given these signs.",

We used to work together, separate parts of the building. Then hung out, spent last summer hanging out and getting to know each other. Didn‚Äôt talk from summer last year to January and rekindled in February.She is the love of my life. I want to marry this woman. She is most definitely, the one; however, we still have a few goals before we officially tie the knot (even though we have already started calling each other husband and wife).Although our emotional support for one another is so much better (I was having a hard time also). She does not like to talk about what‚Äôs bothering her. If it is something I did or relationship wise we talk about it, but personal goals and career she will keep to herself when it‚Äôs bothering her and shutdown. I never know how to best support her. I‚Äôve asked her and she doesn‚Äôt know either (she‚Äôs not used to being with someone who wants to help them).I don‚Äôt want to force her to talk, but nothing feels right. Giving her space and letting her talk when she wants, feels bad. When we do talk about it, she gets so in her head that it makes things worse because she doesn‚Äôt believe anything anyone says to her (she does this with family also). I‚Äôve tried to do a little of both, space with check in and that doesn‚Äôt work either.It literally hurts me to see her like that. We just came back from a trip to my hometown and when she left I was broke to tears. I just want to take all the pain from her. I wish I could just take whatever she feels and endure it for her.I‚Äôve tried affirmation, telling her how much I love her, reminding her of how smart she is‚Ä¶ everything I could think of. We end up talking about it eventually within the next 48 hours, but I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs okay. I know we have to do what‚Äôs best for us but I also want to support her the best I can.Just here to check if maybe there‚Äôs anything else I can do. Thank you all in advance.",

I know I‚Äôm gonna get roasted in the comments but I genuinely like her even if she does yell at me. What should I do? I‚Äôm so obsessed with her and I‚Äôll do anything for her to give me another chance.(edit 1) thanks for all the comments. I‚Äôm finding it difficult to move on and I keep dwelling over the past. Idk if it has to do with me being a Pisces or just me not wanting to let go and hopefully it will work out. Looking back I did keep chasing her and that made me look desperate (which I am) and made me look bad. I don‚Äôt know if this is a good idea but I was thinking of getting her a necklace and just apologizing, I was gonna get it for her birthday but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be the one to celebrate with her unless she comes back and we work it out which I doubt would happen.(Edit 2) sorry I can‚Äôt reply to you guys the bot keeps deleting my reply cuz I don‚Äôt have enough karma. As for the update I‚Äôm still lost, I have never felt like this and I‚Äôm beating myself up cuz I missed my chance with her. My self esteem is at its lowest and I can‚Äôt sleep. I still think about her and the moments I have been there for her and spent with her and it‚Äôs just replaying in my mind over and over again, I try to distract myself but I still see myself going back. I‚Äôm really kicking myself rn and even know I‚Äôm hurting myself I still do it. Has anyone gotten through this what has worked.",

I recently had a first date with someone from Hinge after we were talking for about 2 weeks (week on the app and week through texting, by her admission she's said she has never been in a long term relationship, she's my age (she just turned 39)).  We literally had so much in common too, we were both into gaming, D&D, history, books, musical interests, I could keep going on. Anyway, we went mini-golfing and connected really well (it was an indoor place), they had some arcade games we played together as well. All in all we played probably 3-4 rounds, had food and got drinks (non-alcoholic), over a period of 4 hours. When we parted I asked if she had fun and maybe I could get a 2nd date soon to which she agreed. Fast forward to the next morning I get a text from her saying basically she's been thinking about it since she left, I'm a wonderful guy and how we both want families that it's best not to have a 2nd date with me, so naturally I asked her why she thought that way and she gave me the line that she didn't think we have a lot in common. I know we had a connection and we do share quite a bit in common, I am naturally puzzled by this behavior. The last several dates I've had it's always been the same MO. I'm a wonderful guy but they can't date me because x, y or z. I can understand if there were glaring red flags but there wasn't any. Am I just missing something here?",

I suggested going for a coffee and a walk so it's easy to chat and get to know each other and he agreed. Fast-forward to today, we reaffirmed we were both happy to meet and go on said walk and the way we were talking about it put me under the impression that the walk was essentially part 1 of the date, then we'd head elsewhere (looking back it's possible I got the wrong end of the stick though? Not sure).But um... that's not what happened. We met and went for a walk for literally 15 minutes chatting before he wanted to head back (so the walk was 30 mins total). I was a bit confused and asked him if we wanted to go do something else or end the date there and he essentially said no to doing something else in a longwinded way.Now I'm not delusional, a guy wanting to cut things that short normally means he isn't interested but during said walk he was very like... romantic, wanting to hold hands, hug and seemed super interested in me in general, constantly complimenting me. He even asked about my birthday and insisted we put our birthdays down in eachothers phone calendars? But then on the negative side again, on the way back I double checked if he was sure he didn't want to go and do something else today and he gave some excuses about needing to head back again.To add an extra layer of confusion, the date ended with him kissing me (I didn't initiate) and he seemed to genuinely want to take me out on a second date for a coffee or movie and made some jokes saying things like \"as long as you don't unmatch me that is\".My head is just spinning because of all the mixed signals, like I've literally gotten back home within an hour of leaving??? I wasted so much time getting ready for no reason and barely got to know him. Did we just get some wires crossed and this was a perfectly normal first date or was he actually not interested and all those other things were just him putting on a show?I have messaged him to tell me when he's home so we can talk about how things went but I've made this post in the meantime as my minds racing.Positive update: Apparently he did just have things to do (still not 100% sure why he would agree to a date if he had to rush off so quickly but hey) and has showered me with tons of compliments over message + he has asked me out again later this week. Obviously I'm going to have to make sure the dates a little longer this time though haha.Negative update (3 days later): We continued messaging normally for a few days but he ghosted me completely on the day of our supposed second date. Not sure if that means my initial gut instinct of something being off was right or he just had second thoughts afterwards but either way he sucks for ghosting, bullet dodged.",

      "content_preview": "So, Me and this girl Matched on a dating app, She instantly messaged me first. Very engaging conversation..talking about common interest, hobbies and abit of flirting. The next day I asked her if she wanted to go on a date during on the weekend, she agreed later during the say she asked me if I wanted to do something that evening instead. I agreed and we met, the conversation was great, flowed naturally no awkward silence, no thinking what to ask next or anything like that, we shared so many things in common like hobbies, interest and also views in dating and relationships. 2 hours go by and date ends..I walked her to her car and tell her I had a great time and wanted to see her again. She said she felt the same way, that she felt the chemistry and suggested planning a second date for that same weekend and we shared a quick hug and a kiss. We text abit later that night and her last text to me was \"I enjoyed your company, Thank you so much for tonight and im looking forward to see you this weekend too\"  all great until that point..The next day(day before the second date) I sent her a short text late morning asking how her day was going. No answer for the entire day..no biggie, people get busy etc so I left it at that. Later in the night  I tried giving her a quick call. No answer. Found it odd, at that point she was radio silent for 24+ hours.The next day(day of the date) I sent a confirmation text in the morning. No answer. Hours later I called because at that point it was odd not getting an answer or an update of any sort especially the day we were supposed to meet. So I called and she asks \"who is this\" I felt confused, means she didn't even saved my number and before I can get another word in she hangs up and blocks my number.I felt so many things at once...confusion, frustration, sadness and anger. I really don't understand what happened. Everything was good, how can that change overnight without a strong reason and even if somehow she had second thoughts...why not just communicate it?? I  would've appreciated the honesty, accept her decision with class and move on but ghosting someone and leave them hanging like that its cruel..there's no closure and my mind is just wondering \"what did I do?\"I feel like I got hit with a punch in gut... Made the mistake of getting overly excited  and regretting it hard..Any advice here would help",

I'm 25, neurodivergent (I have dealt with depression for over a decade, too), and I'm a bit below average looking, but I have no problem talking to people and making friends - I have lots to say, I like to yap, I'm always asking questions, and I know when to be quiet and listen. I have worked on myself for many years, both mentally and physically. I went from being unable to even leave the house on my own, to travelling to far away cities to see bands without any help. I lost 20kg in about two years by going to the gym consistently, again with no help. I try and be self-aware, improve myself, and make a real effort. I'm really trying, as much as I possibly can.I am a lover - I seriously enjoy talking to people, doing small acts of kindness, and helping as many people as I can. I'm ready for a relationship, to finally experience something deeper and also physical - I'm curious, eager, and very willing - but nothing works out. My friends say my dating app profiles are perfectly fine and they don't understand why I am getting no matches. I post on dating subs and get no replies, I have tried reaching out to people, asking girls out on dates, approaching IRL, going to events, but nothing materialises; it feels like I am genuinely cursed to never find someone, no matter how hard I try and no matter what I do... No matter how forward I am, no matter how flexible I am with my schedule, and no matter how accommodating I am.I should also say that, beyond physical touch like hugs, I have a high libido, which makes the situation even worse, because that is something I enjoy and want to enjoy with a partner. I am lonely and so damn frustrated at my inability, and I get even more frustrated when I am told to work on myself, or to simply wait, both of which I have heard a hundred times already.What more can I do besides what I am already doing? It's constant waiting, and I am tired.",

Well, I just broke up with a guy and that was a big factor. We dated less than a couple months and it was long distance so we weren't around each other that often. I noticed he smelled salty (it is summer and I'm sure he was sweaty, not musty though usually just salty smell) but yet it's like he never wanted to shower. He also wore nasty smelling shorts one time (slept in them multiple nights) and I tried to hint that I didn't like them, he didn't get the hint, so I just flat out said his shorts stunk (thankfully he changed them then).Before our first nice date we had been in the heat all day, I took a shower and got ready and asked if he wanted to take a shower at my place or if he needed to go back to his hotel to get ready and he was like \"oh I'm fine\". Then last weekend we went swimming in a pool. I took a shower before getting ready for bed. I'm like \"are you going to take a shower?\" and it was like the same reaction \"oh, I'm good\".NO. YOU'RE NOT.TL;DR - Everyone needs to bathe, wear deodorant, smell nice and look nice. Idc who you are.",
