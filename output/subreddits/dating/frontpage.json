I do my best to avoid looking at ANY woman (besides making sure to check my surroundings for threats since I live in a major city), but I‚Äôm worried that it might be noticeable? The problem here is that I saw a tiktok post recently with a bunch of women in the comments saying it bothers them when their man doesn‚Äôt even look in the direction of a drop dead gorgeous girl because it means their man finds them attractive (because there‚Äôs no way a man wouldn‚Äôt wanna at least take a glance at her). Is this how most women feel?",

      "content_preview": "Recently, I saw a \"meme\" or rather, some people would upload the dating profile of a woman who was probably in her mid30s or so (meaning, she wasn't just starting to date) and on her bio she had written something like \"I know I'm ugly and if you don't want to be seen in public with me, that's okay, we can work around that. I will be the best gf, I promise\", included some pics of herself, etc And that hit me like a ton of bricks. I am not an attractive guy either and despite what women say, I know for a fact that short fat ugly men aren't well received by any means. But I never thought I'd see that from a woman. We're extremely self-absorbed as people and I think more of us should shut up when other people talk about their experiences rather than assume that they don't have it as \"bad\" as we do. I see that all the time, people belittling and dismissing other people's experiences and feelings just cos they don't understand them. I did really see myself in her not because I'd ever put up with such a partner (women wouldn't really do that anyway -- i.e. have a \"relationship\" with a man they were too ashamed to be seen in public with) but cos I can understand how desperate she was to please her future bf, how lonely she must 've been feeling and what terrible self-esteem she must have.",

      "content_preview": "I know Reddit is a particularly negative place but I see way too many posts on here about \"all the good ones being taken\" or being \"left behind\" re dating in your 30s. I also used to hear a lot of pressure about it IRL, things like \"if she's still single at 30 it's for a reason \". I had internalized a lot of that when I turned 30 and felt so anxious that I'd \"missed the train\" so to speak. Well at 35 I have to say my lived experience has been completely the opposite: I love dating in my 30s! I feel personally so much more accomplished and I know and love myself so much more than ever before. The women I date are also very self actualized and interesting, everything feels so intentional and communicative. We have some money to go on cool dates, and interesting stories to laugh about along the way. In general it just feels like we treat one another with more kindness and compassion that only comes with the pain of aging. And for me that's been beautiful. It's true, tits are saggier and foreheads are more ample, but acknowledging and accepting one another for our flaws has been liberating too. We're all too old to be instagram models now so fuck it. If you're reading this and worried about dating in your 30s, don't give into the negativity and bs. I think there are a lot of reasons why this might be some of our best years for romance.",

One of my good friends is an acquaintance of hers and introduced us. When \"Sarah\" said it was good to meet me, it took me a few seconds to process what was going on. I was looking into the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. This woman is 5 leagues above me. I came to and we chatted for a few minutes then she walked off to her friends. Throughout the night that's how it went. Chat for a few, take pictures together, or take a shot then separate for a bit. I'm sitting at the bar minding my own business and I can see her in my peripherals staring at me. I look over, we lock eyes, and I didn't know this was actually a thing, I always thought it was something people just said. But I got tunnel vision. Noise quieted down, everything in my peripherals and all around her became blurry, and the only thing I was able to see clearly was her. When we were near eachother, I'd feel this magnetic aura that was pushing me to get closer. I put my arm around her waist once and she looked up at me, I looked down at her, we locked eyes for the 20th time, and she just had the biggest, most genuine smile I've ever seen. We exchanged contact information before I left and a week later met at a local park to take a walk. The date was supposed to be an hour or so, but it lasted 4. That magnetic aura was still there and the chemistry was something I'd never experienced before. We never really stopped talking the entire time, and when we did, it wasn't awkward or anything. It was simply peaceful. We were holding hands within 30 minutes and had our 1st kiss a half hour after that. It really did feel like we'd been really good friends for years. It just felt..different..it felt right and I'm excited to see what happens. I should also share that she's expressed the same feelings, so this isn't a one-sided thing.",

I‚Äôve been wanting to talk about this whole situation with him for a long time, but thought he just didn‚Äôt care so there was no point.

People enter with uncertainty but speak like they‚Äôre certain. They offer closeness but hold the door open behind them. They want comfort without responsibility. They want to feel cared for without being expected to care back in equal measure.And when they‚Äôre met with consistency, they hesitate. They start pulling back.

It took me a year but I got over it. I started dating again. I still had feelings for him but I allowed myself to forget. I dated some other men but unfortunately things didn‚Äôt work out. One day, he reaches out to me asking to be friends. We start talking again and it feels like he never left. We talk every other day and start meeting every weekend. The feelings are still there and I tell him and he says he‚Äôd marry me. That‚Äôs when I knew something was off. I asked if we could start as friends and take things slow. We still hung out but we weren‚Äôt dating so when he flirted with me or got too close I was uncomfortable. He took it badly and said it‚Äôs too hard to be friends. I had a meltdown and it was over after that. We spoke about a month later but went no contact. I dated other people. I reached out a few months later and the same pattern started. Phone calls for hours. We didn‚Äôt meet up though. Then we agreed to stop talking as we were growing codependent. I reached out again a couple months later. We were very civil. I thought maybe I could be friends with this person. Then suddenly we started flirting and I felt uncomfortable. I told him we can‚Äôt do this. It‚Äôs not healthy. I told him that I still do have feelings for him but really want to be friends. He doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me. He‚Äôs attracted to me. He likes talking to me. But that‚Äôs it.

Guy 2: Say you like hiking The other guys agree Guy 1: But I don't like hiking... Guy 2: No, you just put that because it stops the fatties matching with you Resounding agreement (To put anyone's mind at ease, a manager then went over and had a go at them.) My question is do guys actually do this or is this a small group? Does anyone know guys that do this? Or has anyone caught out guys they're dating who said they like hiking but have never hiked before? Edit: line spacing",

      "content_preview": "Saying this with reference to NYC but im sure many other places can all relate to it. The dating pool is trash because we're all creating it. Everyone is jaded and no one takes responsibility for how they treat one another. What someone does to one, that person will in turn do the same to another. I was recently talking to a friend who was upset about being ghosted by a person they really liked and I asked, have you done the same to someone else? They responded yes and I said well that person may have also been ghosted before and just adopted doing the same thing. Its all a cycle where people who start off being kind and caring about others end up cold, distant, and avoidant. Every action someone takes has a direct impact on how people subsequently treat others which is why we've ended up in this mess. If you call someone out its always, \"they aren't entitled to a response\" or \"you don't owe anyone anything\". The lack of decency and respect permeates throughout the broader society leaving us all unsatisfied and upset.",

Time actually felt like it slowed down so I could take in every detail‚Ä¶ Turned out he was single, and we slowly started talking more and more. Eventually we started making plans together, casually, without any pressure, since it seems difficult to even make friends at 30+ years old. I knew that the only way I‚Äôd end up dating anyone was if they were playful and truly friend material. No more a-holes. He didn‚Äôt even know I was single, I guess, and agreed to go UFO watching at a local spot that was known for sightings. Long story short, we talked and talked and flirted in a warm spirited and twinkling eye kind of way. We didn‚Äôt jump, we just observed each other and agreed to do stuff like that more often. We did. Every weekend and we haven‚Äôt stopped for 2+ years. I‚Äôve never been this close to anyone, so effortlessly. I‚Äôve never felt like it was so easy to love someone else. I‚Äôve never felt this accepted by anyone and celebrated. It far exceeds the loves I thought I had once, and it‚Äôs been the sweetest and most soul melting experience. Keep on being open to what‚Äôs out there‚Ä¶ even if it feels like it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo late‚Äù. This life is strange and beautiful, and yes, very tough too.

      "content_preview": "TLDR - Been single my whole life and struggle with dating. I wish I could know what it feels like to have a woman to connect with. Today is my 34th birthday. While I have so much to be grateful for and be excited about with another year, I just feel...alone. It dawned on me that I'm 34 years old and I've never had a girlfriend before; haven't even been able to go on a first date in basically 3 years. Actually I just found out the last woman I did go on a date with just got married; that's how long its been. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine just trying to get past step 1 would ever be this hard. I've enjoyed my time being single though. I actually love my alone time and the solid friendships I've made over the years. I just wish I could now know what it's like to be on the other side of the coin for once. I'm not really looking for advice because I know strangers on reddit can't help me, I'm mostly venting. It just sucks knowing you've already kinda followed every piece of advice people usually tell men to follow to be more successful in the dating world, yet you still can't see a glimmer of success: Get into the best shape your life, ‚úÖ. Become financially stable, ‚úÖ. Learn to be confident and have a fun genuine personality, ‚úÖ. Wear nice cologne and find nice fitting clothes that work for you, ‚úÖ. Put yourself out there and create a good social circle of both men and women friends, ‚úÖ. Just live your life, be your authentic self and become what you want to attract, ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ. Alas, I still struggle to get any interest from women...it's just never mutual regardless if it's in person or dating apps; hell I don't even get matches on apps anymore. Its been a barren wasteland on those things ever since I turned 30. Friends, family and even strangers I meet every day all tell me I'm personable, funny and just a solid dude. Even a random customer at work I was helping the other day said, \"how the hell is a handsome guy like you single? Let me call my granddaughter\" üò≠ I love to cook, be outdoors hiking or paddle boarding, go dancing, I'm family-oriented and wanna be a dad someday, I'm generous, have cats, love to try new things, hit the gym, and a low-key nerd; basically a jack of all trades. Most important of all I'm emotionally intelligent and know what I want out of life and a partner. I've tried bars, clubs, board game nights, rock climbing gyms, parks/museums, singles mixers, asking friends to set me up, cold approaching, joining hobby and meetup groups etc etc...and not a single solitary \"sure that sounds great, here's my number.\" That or I get the classic I have a boyfriend.  Even going to church is a dead end since it's just younger kids or married folks. I legitimately have never been on a date with a woman whom I've met in real life before. I've even done some light traveling to Canada, Hawaii, Texas, Cali and Chicago to name a few for leizure. Despite leaning on the more introverted side, I truly feel like I've made an honest effort to become a desirable man, socialize more and put myself out there. In fact I just went to another singles mixer this weekend and had a good time despite the age range leaning kinda older (it was mostly men). I'm not desperate or hyper focused on it, I just want to be a normal man and have a healthy dating life. I'm tired of being known as the \"nice guy who's easy to talk to\". I want to be called charming, sexy, lusted after and desired like everyone else does. I want to know what it's like to have woman put her head on my shoulder, feel safe and comfortable and enjoy my company. Not trying to pretend to be perfect because I'm not. I definitely have flaws and lazy moments like everyone, but I know you don't have to be perfect or rich to date. I also know not every woman is going to be attracted to me, just like I'm not going to be attracted to every woman. But to have not met a single girl in 3 years whos mutually interested in me back for this long makes me feel like I'm cursed. I never get a wink a wave a smile, nothing. I've also never in my life had a woman make the first approach on me either, so definitely not waiting for that to magically happen. I could see if there was something horribley wrong with me, but it just makes me feel even worse knowing there isn't any real reason for my failures; I'm attractive, in shape and actually put in effort. Part of this is my fault I guess. I became an introverted recluse all of my twenties due to bullying, so I wasted most of those years and got a late start. Didn't even have my first kiss until I was 27. I've come such a long way though and busted my ass not just for dating, but just to be happy with myself, and I truly am. Now that I'm in the prime of my life, I crave intimacy; someone to look forward to seeing at the end of the day. I wish I could just have a genuine hug more than anything. I remain optimistic though that I might meet someone special who sees in me what I see in myself. I even have the word patience tattooed on my wrist for goodness sake; but how much longer do I have to wait for my turn? üòÇ Anyways, I'm taking myself to PAX West. Today's the last day here in Seattle. Cheers üçª (Queue Michael Bubble - 'Havent Met you Yet')",

Only party benefiting is the social media company getting engagement and more eyes on ads. you try to mark the content as \"not interesting\" but the algorithm already knows that on average it generates high engagement, so similar content will appear I am sure the exact same thing happens on the other side just with the sexes flipped.

      "content_preview": "Okay, so here's the deal. I recently had a first date with someone from Hinge after we were talking for about 2 weeks (week on the app and week through texting, by her admission she's said she has never been in a long term relationship, she's my age (she just turned 39)).  We literally had so much in common too, we were both into gaming, D&D, history, books, musical interests, I could keep going on. Anyway, we went mini-golfing and connected really well (it was an indoor place), they had some arcade games we played together as well. All in all we played probably 3-4 rounds, had food and got drinks (non-alcoholic), over a period of 4 hours. When we parted I asked if she had fun and maybe I could get a 2nd date soon to which she agreed. Fast forward to the next morning I get a text from her saying basically she's been thinking about it since she left, I'm a wonderful guy and how we both want families that it's best not to have a 2nd date with me, so naturally I asked her why she thought that way and she gave me the line that she didn't think we have a lot in common. I know we had a connection and we do share quite a bit in common, I am naturally puzzled by this behavior. The last several dates I've had it's always been the same MO. I'm a wonderful guy but they can't date me because x, y or z. I can understand if there were glaring red flags but there wasn't any. Am I just missing something here?",

      "content_preview": "Whenever i see advice about nerdy guys just needing to be more confident or how plenty of women love nerdy guys, I can't help but call bs sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I get that some nerdy guys do fine in dating, but my experience has not reflected that at all. When I was straight up \"shy and nerdy,\" I rarely got attention from women. On the apps, or irl. Most girls just saw me as a friend at most. I wouldn't even say I was that bad looking. I'm better looking now for sure, but I hardly think I was ugly. Now, I changed my entire demeanor. I'm still \"shy and nerdy\" to some degree, but I let my hair grow, I am outdoorsy now, go to the gym, and play guitar. I got a lot more dates and have a gf now. To give you a comparison. When I was \"shy and nerdy,\" I was stood up by the only match I had on the apps that said yes to going out. I had 10 first dates in the first couple of months after my demeanor changed.",

      "content_preview": "So, Me and this girl Matched on a dating app, She instantly messaged me first. Very engaging conversation..talking about common interest, hobbies and abit of flirting. The next day I asked her if she wanted to go on a date during on the weekend, she agreed later during the say she asked me if I wanted to do something that evening instead. I agreed and we met, the conversation was great, flowed naturally no awkward silence, no thinking what to ask next or anything like that, we shared so many things in common like hobbies, interest and also views in dating and relationships. 2 hours go by and date ends..I walked her to her car and tell her I had a great time and wanted to see her again. She said she felt the same way, that she felt the chemistry and suggested planning a second date for that same weekend and we shared a quick hug and a kiss. We text abit later that night and her last text to me was \"I enjoyed your company, Thank you so much for tonight and im looking forward to see you this weekend too\"  all great until that point.. The next day(day before the second date) I sent her a short text late morning asking how her day was going. No answer for the entire day..no biggie, people get busy etc so I left it at that. Later in the night  I tried giving her a quick call. No answer. Found it odd, at that point she was radio silent for 24+ hours. The next day(day of the date) I sent a confirmation text in the morning. No answer. Hours later I called because at that point it was odd not getting an answer or an update of any sort especially the day we were supposed to meet. So I called and she asks \"who is this\" I felt confused, means she didn't even saved my number and before I can get another word in she hangs up and blocks my number. I felt so many things at once...confusion, frustration, sadness and anger. I really don't understand what happened. Everything was good, how can that change overnight without a strong reason and even if somehow she had second thoughts...why not just communicate it?? I  would've appreciated the honesty, accept her decision with class and move on but ghosting someone and leave them hanging like that its cruel..there's no closure and my mind is just wondering \"what did I do?\" I feel like I got hit with a punch in gut... Made the mistake of getting overly excited  and regretting it hard.. Any advice here would help",

He got my number from my friend. He then disappeared and didn't text me again. Till 3 yrs later and this dude is texting me tk visit me.I 100 percent say no cause I was doing so well. Thing is, I posted myself ans that's how he started texting me. We end up in the same college. He sees me from a far. He tells his friends to mention his name and he has a studio ans penthouse. I ignore them. Then at least we were never in the same class. I spoke tk other guys Till one time I was at this event in school, I was about to leave and few mins later, I see him ans his friends behind far away. Am like walking fast caus this is weird. Why couldn't he let me go? He was the one who was rude when I was interested I later texted him, and we were cordial. He hugged me in the rain( I don't believe thos happened either) and asked how I was doing. He high fived me and greeted me. Till one time i was at the club and he came sat around where I was instead of with his friends.he saw me stand up for myself to sb. He then smiled snd smirked at me.I could feel him following me with his eyes.he was staring for long and them his friends shouted his name in a flirty way loudly ans I sneered at them. ONE. he can try ans talk to me. Instead he ignored me again. So we greeted each other ans I could tell maybe he is irritated by me and I made a mistake being friends wirh sb who rejected you. Then eventually, I got tired of his sneering and blocked him everywhere on media I meet with him again. Coincidence, and he stares at me in my eyes. I couldn't look at him. I had blocked him for a while. I had moved on mostly even in college, its just he keeps starign until you are like, maybe if i try we can date but thats it.He never once texted me to hang out.just staring.then he also avoids me This story is almost like fate. I don't believe in fate but we kept meeting so coincidence.i had feelings for the guy ans he hasn't even tried anything.but he staring why? So I'm having a hard time moving on. Caus what was I thinking texting this ex? He never initiates ever. I would like to meet newguys but he keeps confusing me. I ignore him ,he tries harder to stare ,smile..but when I approach even as cordial, he sneered at me. Any advice on moving on. Be kind in replying. Its being going on for too long on and off",

The next day we chatted and I told her although we both wish it would have gotten intimate in that way that im glad it kind of didnt because if we get to that point id love to take her on an actual date first where we both aren't half cut and know what's going on in the moment and she agreed and heart reacted my message on FB messenger. This was on Saturday and now I haven't heard from her since, she has heart reacted a couple things on my facebook since then(changed my profile pic and she liked it) I have no idea what the hell I did to prompt this ghosting from her if thats what shes doing to me and if she is ghosting usually doesnt bother me but after the night we had it makes no sense to me.

      "content_preview": "If you hang out casually with a guy (without sex) can it turn into a relationship or is it already doomed from the start? Like if you‚Äôre just hanging out at his house without him putting a lot of effort into formally dating, or without having deeper conversations, texting or calling all the time. That seems to be the direction I‚Äôm headed with a guy: The first date he showed up late, we went out to a couple of bars, there was a show and we played games. Had great chemistry. We both got tipsy and he asked me to make out. Then asked me to go to his place. I told him I don‚Äôt have sex early on and he said we didn‚Äôt have to. I asked him what he was looking for and he said something ‚Äústeady‚Äù. He showed me around his place and to meet his animals and we started talking, then making out. He kept trying to escalate to sex, but not in a way that was uncomfortable for me. Honestly I feel like he was testing me to see if I would. He didn‚Äôt seem like he wanted me to leave, but eventually I did. Our second date (which he didn‚Äôt call a date when we planned it) and was also very informally planned, we just hung out at his place. Honestly I suggested it since I wasn‚Äôt feeling too great and he kept pushing back the time. He made dinner, we watched a show that he thought I would enjoy (which I did), started heavily making out, but I set the boundary of no sex again. Then he fell asleep and when I was about to leave, pulled me in to cuddle all night. It was honestly really sweet. Kissed me goodbye in the morning and let me know we would hang out again. TLDR: Just interested to hear if something more casual at the start has ever led to anything more meaningful i.e. a relationship for anyone? Or is he is he just hoping that I will eventually give in to sex, since he‚Äôs basically giving me fwb energy in terms of intentionality.",

I suggested going for a coffee and a walk so it's easy to chat and get to know each other and he agreed. Fast-forward to today, we reaffirmed we were both happy to meet and go on said walk and the way we were talking about it put me under the impression that the walk was essentially part 1 of the date, then we'd head elsewhere (looking back it's possible I got the wrong end of the stick though? Not sure). But um... that's not what happened. We met and went for a walk for literally 15 minutes chatting before he wanted to head back (so the walk was 30 mins total). I was a bit confused and asked him if we wanted to go do something else or end the date there and he essentially said no to doing something else in a longwinded way. Now I'm not delusional, a guy wanting to cut things that short normally means he isn't interested but during said walk he was very like... romantic, wanting to hold hands, hug and seemed super interested in me in general, constantly complimenting me. He even asked about my birthday and insisted we put our birthdays down in eachothers phone calendars? But then on the negative side again, on the way back I double checked if he was sure he didn't want to go and do something else today and he gave some excuses about needing to head back again. To add an extra layer of confusion, the date ended with him kissing me (I didn't initiate) and he seemed to genuinely want to take me out on a second date for a coffee or movie and made some jokes saying things like \"as long as you don't unmatch me that is\". My head is just spinning because of all the mixed signals, like I've literally gotten back home within an hour of leaving??? I wasted so much time getting ready for no reason and barely got to know him. Did we just get some wires crossed and this was a perfectly normal first date or was he actually not interested and all those other things were just him putting on a show? I have messaged him to tell me when he's home so we can talk about how things went but I've made this post in the meantime as my minds racing. Positive update: Apparently he did just have things to do (still not 100% sure why he would agree to a date if he had to rush off so quickly but hey) and has showered me with tons of compliments over message + he has asked me out again later this week. Obviously I'm going to have to make sure the dates a little longer this time though haha.",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôve had bad experiences with every person I‚Äôve dated. Whether I‚Äôve met them online or in person. A guy I dated end of last year gave me mono. I had to take a 6 month break from kissing, but ended up dating someone new during this time (I fully disclosed the mono situation and we didn‚Äôt kiss). After the 4th date, this dude pretended to slap my face and pretended to play punch my sides randomly while cuddling (like not actually doing it, but making the motions like he was going to). I told him it made me uncomfortable when he played like that and to stop. Instead of trying to understand my perspective, he got upset and said he didn‚Äôt like my tone or attitude in telling him so (which I dead didn‚Äôt say it loudly or rudely at all. Just very straightforward.) Blocked him. Reconnected with someone else after my 6 months no kissing hiatus (someone who had already been blocked for odd behavior  previously but I convinced myself it‚Äôd be different this time) and this dude had a layer of tartar caked into the bottom of his teeth. Which I didn‚Äôt realize until well after we had been making out. I tried to bring it up gently over text so we could come up with a solution together (bc why would I wanna be kissing that) and instead he got mad at me for ‚Äúbringing up his insecurity‚Äù and said my hands need more lotion üò© How is it thee FIRST person I dated and was finally able to kiss after mono , had all that going on with him too. I feel like the mono + tartar combo pack of people back to back is just the universe telling me to keep my body to myself.üíÄ I‚Äôm not going out of my way to pick people who lack hygiene or who have diseases so idk what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt know subconsciously what‚Äôs going on with who I am picking. They‚Äôre all different races, heights, looks, personalities, etc. The only common thing is they‚Äôre either my age (22) or a few years older max. And ig the other common denominator would be me! But I dead do not be starting stuff! üò≠ I‚Äôm vocal about what makes me feel uncomfortable/difficult convos but I appreciate and expect the same with someone I‚Äôm seeing. I just feel like this is the world‚Äôs way of saying I just need a break. I‚Äôm tired of my health/well-being being jeopardized and my block list getting full. I haven‚Äôt even gone all the way with anyone yet and these experiences make me feel like it‚Äôs not in my cards to, at least not anytime soon. Like I have to feel super emotionally and physically safe. And yes ik testing is a thing + protection but the way things are going rn, I‚Äôm scared at this point imma catch something off the rip. I‚Äôve stayed jumping from one to the next thinking they‚Äôll ‚Äúbe the one‚Äù but at this point I actively wait for the bad moment. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to be perfect, but I don‚Äôt think it should be like thissss üíÄ Edit: not to mention. The very first intimate experience I had was with a guy my friend had been trying to set me up with. We mess around a lil at her party and everything seemed great. I spent the night at her house with another friend. Woke up the next day, go to my car, and see that he had drunkenly sideswiped my vehicle on his way out the night before!! üò≠üò≠ he admitted that he had but didn‚Äôt want me to go through insurance. I wanted to. He blocked me and never fixed it. The swipe is still there to this day lol. It‚Äôs like everywhere I‚Äôm constantly reminded of these experiences or given these signs.",

      "content_preview": "It's as the title says... I'm incredibly touch starved and it is getting worse with each passing month. I'm 25, neurodivergent (I have dealt with depression for over a decade, too), and I'm a bit below average looking, but I have no problem talking to people and making friends - I have lots to say, I like to yap, I'm always asking questions, and I know when to be quiet and listen. I have worked on myself for many years, both mentally and physically. I went from being unable to even leave the house on my own, to travelling to far away cities to see bands without any help. I lost 20kg in about two years by going to the gym consistently, again with no help. I try and be self-aware, improve myself, and make a real effort. I'm really trying, as much as I possibly can. I am a lover - I seriously enjoy talking to people, doing small acts of kindness, and helping as many people as I can. I'm ready for a relationship, to finally experience something deeper and also physical - I'm curious, eager, and very willing - but nothing works out. My friends say my dating app profiles are perfectly fine and they don't understand why I am getting no matches. I post on dating subs and get no replies, I have tried reaching out to people, asking girls out on dates, approaching IRL, going to events, but nothing materialises; it feels like I am genuinely cursed to never find someone, no matter how hard I try and no matter what I do... No matter how forward I am, no matter how flexible I am with my schedule, and no matter how accommodating I am. I should also say that, beyond physical touch like hugs, I have a high libido, which makes the situation even worse, because that is something I enjoy and want to enjoy with a partner. I am lonely and so damn frustrated at my inability, and I get even more frustrated when I am told to work on myself, or to simply wait, both of which I have heard a hundred times already. What more can I do besides what I am already doing? It's constant waiting, and I am tired.",

Started reflecting on my life at this point, what I‚Äôve done, what I‚Äôve accomplished, what I haven‚Äôt, etc. Then coming to the realization that I‚Äôve lived this long without any real dating experience, hit me a bit hard thinking about it one night. I‚Äôll see many couples younger than me roaming about, I‚Äôll look back on all my peers getting in and out of relationships back in high school. All these experiences I never got to have. That young and ‚Äúfiguring it out as inexperienced people‚Äù stage I just never got to experience.

      "content_preview": "I (F22) had been dating (M24) since April of this year (but we‚Äôve known each other since the end of 2023). We hung out a little bit at the beginning of last year before I decided we‚Äôd be better off remaining as friends, then blocked him due to obvious resentment and spiteful comments towards me thereafter. We reconnected this year though, and I felt like he had changed and being romantically involved this time might be okay. I was wrong. A few weeks ago, we were eating at a chicken place and I noticed he had something going on with his bottom teeth. I knew they were really crooked before this moment, but I couldn‚Äôt tell in this moment if it was just chicken pieces lodged in between them because of the position of them or if it was tartar/plaque. I was going to try figuring it out by saying I thought he had some food in his teeth, but felt the moment of opportunity passed by the time I was mentally processing it all so just made a mental note to try to peep it again at a different time. But before I had to kiss him again. We work together (ik big mistake üò≠) and while working together just a few days ago (and after the initial incident), I realized it wasn‚Äôt food‚Ä¶ it was tartar build up. I tried to figure out a way to politely and gently bring it up and had so much anxiety about doing so. He worked the next shift after the one we had just worked so I felt it would be better to send him a text after he finished his second shift and not bring that up right beforehand. I wait until I know he‚Äôs off and text asking if I can bring up something to him. He replies I could so I start off saying ‚ÄúI mean this in the gentlest way‚Äù and continue saying how at first I thought maybe it was food but then realized it didn‚Äôt look like it was that. And that I know that might be something that‚Äôs hard to stay on top of or maybe financially inconvenient but provided resources that help for free. I also mentioned how my teeth aren‚Äôt perfect or anything either to not make it seem like I was coming for him. He got madddd. He replied ‚Äúmf just told me to brush my teeth. Yeah you got it.‚Äù Then confirmed his dentist said it was tartar/calculus and continued on about how he does get them cleaned, but ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt for some months now‚Äù so that‚Äôs why the tartar is visible but thanks for bringing up his insecurity. He immediately shut down the convo for the night by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to you tomorrow.‚Äù Then first thing he sent the next day was ‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre bringing up things gently, you have dry hands and need to use more lotion. ü§£‚Äù Which was wild to me because the day before this, he ALSO showed me how dry and white-creviced HIS hands were‚Ä¶ he had tartar and dry hands in the same day. And still no mention of a game plan for the tartar or even a reason as to why/how he let it get so bad. Just deflection. Mind you, I never even ‚Äútold him to go brush his teeth‚Äù because I already knew that level of tartar could only be solved by a dentist. I sent some final messages to him then immediately blocked him‚Ä¶ Again. And realized that he genuinely is just always going to struggle with having difficult conversations of things that bruise his ego (whether intentionally or not). I just don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs mad at ME that he has tartar in HIS mouth. He‚Äôs been kissing me with that! Talking about eating me out with that! And talking about taking my virginity with all that (which I‚Äôm so grateful we never got to either of those points). Sometimes I would taste something off when we‚Äôd kiss but I assumed it was food because any time we‚Äôd be making out would be after dates‚Ä¶ Once when we french-kissed, my tongue ran along something on his bottom teeth on accident and It felt sharp and threw me off but I thought it was just his teeth. I felt so sick to my stomach once I saw that months after the fact. And it‚Äôs like he cared more about the fact he was embarrassed over anything else. I‚Äôve told him I have immune issues and knowing he had all that bacteria caked into his mouth and felt that was okay is just so shocking to me. I know he said it‚Äôs been ‚Äúsome months‚Äù but I don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs been that recently either because he hasn‚Äôt gone since we‚Äôve started dating, and by the looks of it, it doesn‚Äôt even look like he‚Äôs gone months before we started dating either. I feel mad at myself too that I didn‚Äôt notice earlier!! I knew that his bottom teeth were really crooked so I feel like him being tall + certain angles/afar it just looked like his teeth? I feel like I would‚Äôve noticed earlier but I really mostly saw him at night or would be walking/talking side by side to him and either way he doesn‚Äôt really talk in a way that exposes his bottom teeth often. But yeah. Idk if there was a better way to handle this but ghosting and blocking him without at least communicating felt wrong, and I genuinely thought having a convo about it, he‚Äôd WANT to fix it. I‚Äôve learned to trust my initial gut feeling because he never should‚Äôve been unblocked from the first bad experience I had with him.",

We used to work together, separate parts of the building. Then hung out, spent last summer hanging out and getting to know each other. Didn‚Äôt talk from summer last year to January and rekindled in February. She is the love of my life. I want to marry this woman. She is most definitely, the one; however, we still have a few goals before we officially tie the knot (even though we have already started calling each other husband and wife). Although our emotional support for one another is so much better (I was having a hard time also). She does not like to talk about what‚Äôs bothering her. If it is something I did or relationship wise we talk about it, but personal goals and career she will keep to herself when it‚Äôs bothering her and shutdown. I never know how to best support her. I‚Äôve asked her and she doesn‚Äôt know either (she‚Äôs not used to being with someone who wants to help them). I don‚Äôt want to force her to talk, but nothing feels right. Giving her space and letting her talk when she wants, feels bad. When we do talk about it, she gets so in her head that it makes things worse because she doesn‚Äôt believe anything anyone says to her (she does this with family also). I‚Äôve tried to do a little of both, space with check in and that doesn‚Äôt work either. It literally hurts me to see her like that. We just came back from a trip to my hometown and when she left I was broke to tears. I just want to take all the pain from her. I wish I could just take whatever she feels and endure it for her. I‚Äôve tried affirmation, telling her how much I love her, reminding her of how smart she is‚Ä¶ everything I could think of. We end up talking about it eventually within the next 48 hours, but I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs okay. I know we have to do what‚Äôs best for us but I also want to support her the best I can. Just here to check if maybe there‚Äôs anything else I can do. Thank you all in advance.",

I'm just not looking for anything serious until after i graduate.‚Äù I interpreted it in 2 ways.

Idk about you but I don‚Äôt really expect to feel an immediate connection with a person I just met in person for the first time and only spent two hours with. For these dates I prefer to go for a sweet treat and a walk it‚Äôs simple easy and low cost and not too intense. I will say now that I‚Äôm 29 I think my radar for red flags is a bit more accurate or active then it used to be given that I have dated some people in the past that where definitely red flags so I kinda know what to look out for but even with that said I am generally very easy going. But even then that last like six first dates I keep getting I don‚Äôt feel a connection or something similar. Me and my friends can not for the life of us figure out why maybe it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm doing or maybe it‚Äôs bad luck I definitely don‚Äôt have issues looks wise I get plenty of likes on the app and attention in person I‚Äôm tall and well dressed. My job title sounds important but it doesn‚Äôt actually pay that well something I‚Äôm working on (neurodivergent people will understand the struggle) I do have a really nice apartment I share with a roommate and a car I graduated from therapy but still go from time to time. So I‚Äôm not really sure what gives at this point",

But I need advice on how to not basically crave her attention and worry so much. I'm guessing the real advice to just to keep busy and have hobbies Also, I worry I look needy/bad if she doesn't reply for two hours as people obviously get busy then I reply within 5 minutes. Maybe I'm just getting inside my head too. But I hate playing the stupid waiting games of purposely not replying to messages",

      "content_preview": "I (32M) got out of a relationship earlier this year. That is beside the point of this post, and I‚Äôm happy that relationship ended. I hope she truly finds her person. I recently matched with a girl (25F) on Hinge and we immediately exchanged numbers and have been talking back and forth since yesterday. We were going to FaceTime tonight when I got back from a trip, I was really excited and texted her letting her know I got home safe and was ready whenever to FaceTime. That was at 7, it‚Äôs now 11:19. Chances are, she just wasn‚Äôt that interested, or she‚Äôs seeing someone else, or just simply didn‚Äôt feel like responding. For some reason, though, I know this is all a part of the dating game. Flaking, ghosting, not responding, or simply cutting ties, which hey, totally fine by me if they‚Äôre not into it. But I don‚Äôt understand why these micro interactions, or flakes, or things that don‚Äôt workout, still hurt, even if it‚Äôs just the slightest bit of pain. It‚Äôs exhausting, all of it. That‚Äôs why when I‚Äôm not interested, I just let the person know that, usually through a text. I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to experience all of these small rejections all the time, or feel like I‚Äôm getting my hopes up, but silently also keep myself a bit distant because every time I get my hopes up, it just seems like it won‚Äôt workout again for some reason or another. I know I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this way, but I just wish that dating was easier sometimes, or that people would communicate how they feel, so I wouldn‚Äôt be left guessing. Anyway, it‚Äôs just nice to vent into the void, that‚Äôs all.",

I wasn‚Äôt living where I wanted to be so I didn‚Äôt date seriously and I was in school and working full time and I also wore my body down to an unhealthy level. I can‚Äôt believe I was this dumb to not date and prioritize finding a partner and even working on myself so I could handle dating and feel deserving. I‚Äôm not 32 almost 33 and single. I feel like I missed my chance to find a good guy. Most people now have kids and are married. I wake up in a panic most mornings and I can barely breathe. It feels like the walls are closing in. I don‚Äôt look as good as I did when I was 25 or even 28. I just feel so bummed and like I really screwed up my life. I know well meaning people will try and give me good feedback and say it‚Äôs not too late but I feel like it is. I just want to give up. The last year I really have dating my all. I go out a ton but I live in a small ski town so it‚Äôs super hard to date and I just feel so destitute. I should probably move - but it takes years to get settled somewhere else. Maybe I‚Äôm being overly pessimistic but I‚Äôm just bummed. I‚Äôve been on the dating apps since January tinder and bumble. I‚Äôve had men try and use me for sex. Most men just say they want sex with me. I also have never found someone I truly connected with - I feel as a full time working adult I haven‚Äôt had much bandwidth to date or even give much thought to the type of relationship I want. I went traveling to a neighboring state over the Fourth of July and I met a guy at a bar who was my dream guy. We happened to be at the same restaurant the next day and ate dinner together at the bar but I was leaving the next day and he didn‚Äôt ask for me number. I am also stating to feel old and like men won‚Äôt want me so I am bringing that anxiety into a lot of my conversations with men. I am starting to feel anxious and desperate and I am having a hard time going with the flow and being in the moment. Wondering if anyone has any tips or how to cope.",

I was feeling pretty good all day yesterday about my resolve to not text him, I went to work, to the gym, and while I was sad, I didn‚Äôt let myself mope. In the evening, I got a text. Not from him but from my ex whom I dated 10 years ago, we‚Äôre still close and talk often. He‚Äôs one of the most jaded, realest people I know, and never sugarcoats anything for me. If I can count on one person to truly tell me how it is, even if it hurts, it‚Äôs him. I explained a bit of my situation to him. Told him about the date, the immediate aftermath, and the family emergency without going into many details. Again, I want to respect his family‚Äôs privacy because I never doubted the validity of the story, just the severity with the timing. His advice? Text the man. Actually, his exact words were, ‚ÄúModern dating is crap, but you don‚Äôt have to be. You believe the family emergency so who cares if he‚Äôs just not that into you. Show up and support him, because that‚Äôs what good people do, and you‚Äôre a good person.‚Äù So I did. I texted him asking for an update. Then offered to bring him beer from a local brewery, and pizza from the place he told me he loves, on my free night next week. To take his mind off things. I showed up with genuine care, intention, and a plan. And it worked. He texted back immediately. A long full update on the situation, an apology for leaving me hanging, and suggestions for pizza toppings. We texted late into the night, until it was me that finally suggested that we both go to bed. His texts were no longer just polite, but had a flirty edge again, and excitement. Obviously, I can‚Äôt predict where things will go from here, but let this serve as a reminder that sometimes you should send that text. Leaving the ball in their court, isn‚Äôt always the best option.",

I feel like a total object (of desire). I know it's common but it's hard for me to accept. The stares are frequent and intense in nature, even from the same people. I've had professors/lecturers sit in the lecture seats and turn their whole body to stare at me for minutes long during the lectures their colleague was giving (and yes I'm sure this happened). I'm not boring or mean, even my male friends say so, but to the men I've met I'm just a fantasy, not a girlfriend, not a wife, hardly human.

I mean we can‚Äôt go on local dates right until they come to your city? It‚Äôs hard to get to know them if they don‚Äôt live in your country/city. And I‚Äôm not too crazy about it either. But they‚Äôre highly interested in you. Have you ever had that kind of situation? If so, how did that turn out? Did it ever work out? How often did you communicate with them? Phone and text? Video call? Did it help you to feel more secure as if you had a backup plan so to speak? Like when priority A and B (all local matches) didn‚Äôt work out, you could fall back on the back up plan (figuratively) that included people who are located far from you who would visit you later time in a few months for example? I am interested in hearing from people who  experienced the similar situation where you had dated local matches but you also communicated with matches who lived far from you and who were very serious about you and visited you irl. TIA. (I‚Äôm a woman who mainly date local matches because I‚Äôm not a big fan of LDR, but I had a guy visit me from Western Europe and already went on a few dates irl but he went back to his home country recently. And I always seem to have interests from matches who want to come visit me after some chat/phone calls in a month or two. And they‚Äôre serious about it. Just for the context, I live in one of those top five destinations to travel in the world, and top five economies.)",
