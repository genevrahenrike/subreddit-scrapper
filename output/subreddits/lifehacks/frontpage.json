      "content_preview": "Being a cat owner with four cats, I accidentally stumbled upon some odd ways to keep cat hair off my carpets.Rubber glove sweep:Slightly dampen a clean rubber dishwashing glove. Wipe firmly over the carpet in one direction. The rubber creates static that lifts fur efficiently. Wipe the collected fur off the glove and repeat.Balloon static lift:Inflate a balloon and rub it vigorously on the carpet for 10-15 seconds to build static. The fur will jump onto the balloon surface. Discard or wash the balloon afterward.Light fabric softener spray:Mix 1 teaspoon of liquid fabric softener(Downy,Snuggle...) with 2 cups of water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist the carpet (do not soak) and let it air dry. This reduces static cling, making future fur easier to remove.Automated daily maintenance:For consistent results with minimal effort, set your robot vacuums cleaning routines. Scheduling it for a daily run, especially in high-traffic areas, prevents fur from becoming deeply embedded. Use self-cleaning robovacs (eufy e25/e28) that can handle the bulk of the problem automatically.Aluminum foil pre-treatment:Before vacuuming, roll a loosely crumpled ball of aluminum foil over the carpet. This helps loosen fur trapped deep in the pile, making your main vacuum pass much more effective.",

Would an air purifier help or are there sprays that actually remove odor (not just mask it)? I’m slightly allergic to fragrances so spraying Febreeze everyday isn’t an option.

Something I noticed: people who just kept walking straight were the easiest to follow, even in dim light. You could see their silhouette from far away.The ones who were harder to track weren’t running or acting suspicious they’d simply use the angles of parked cars. Walking diagonally between rows, pausing near vehicles, or even doubling back unexpectedly made them almost disappear from sight.Most people’s eyes are tuned to notice a straight, consistent movement in open space. Breaking that rhythm even slightly makes it way harder to keep eyes on you.Edit: Just to be clear, this isn’t about being chased by security or anything official. This is more for regular life situations, like if you feel unsafe walking alone and think someone might be following.",

If so ask for these and once you get them home you simply using a sharp pair of scissors cut one leg out of the pair of hose (a stocking will work also) as your socks get dirty place them inside of the leg and on laundry day tying to open end in a knot. Throw the whole thing into the washer and like magic all the socks you put into the washer actually comes out to be placed inside the dryer! Best part is that this can also go directly into the dryer with no adjustments made (unless you want to check to be sure the knot os secure). When the dryer buzzes to notify you it's the end of the cycle you'll find each sock accounted for! (Works best for those tiny tiny socks that cost so dang much and we're lucky if we get the pair home when we go out or to keep the couch from eating one when we stay in).",

After washing, the smell didn't leave. I didnt wear it for a while till summer came. I put it outside in the sun and then washed it again by putting detergent inside the shoe but there's still a little bit of the stench remaining. What do I do? How do I wash it?",

      "content_preview": "I came up with this formula completely on my own. I have no idea if anybody's ever taught it before I have no idea if this is a First I have no idea.I'm always reading up on liquid cooled computers, and most of the websites talk about the temperatures in Celsius. Also, I'm interested in lizards and frogs and how to make a terrarium comfortable for them and all those temperatures are almost always listed in Celsius. And I decided I needed a way to quickly do it in my headAgain, I came up with this formula all of my own and as far as I can tell, it is 99.9% accurateHere's the formula (let's use 10 degrees celsius here to illustrate)Take the Celsius and double it. (10x2 =20)Add 32 (20+32=52)Now you take that number, get rid of the last digit and subtract the new number from whatever you came up with in number 2. (In our case 52 becomes 5. Now 52-5=47)Add 3 (47+3=50. 10C is 50F)I know this is super confusing at the moment, but I swear it's super easy as soon as I make sense of it for youLet's take 40°CDouble it. 80. Add 32: 112 Now take the first two digits and subtract those from your answer. In this case it's 112 so it would be 11. So 112-11 is 101Add 3 makes it 104That is 100% accurateLet's try 4°C Double it: 8 Add 32: 40 Subtract 4 (first digit): 36 Add 3: 394°C is 39°F. That is 100% accurate.Let's try 400°C. Add 32 so we're at 832 Subtract 83 That equals 749 Add 3 and that makes it 752° And that is the actual conversionLet's do zeroDouble it equals zero Add 32 makes it 32 Subtract three makes it 29. Add three makes it 32.And everybody knows 0°C is 32°FEverybody knows that 100°C is 212°F100 doubled equals 200 Add 32 makes it 232 Subtract 23 Equals 209 Add three… 212600°C Double it and add 32 and we have 1232 Subtract 123 and we have 1109 Add three and we have 1112So the 32° and the three never change. That's gonna to be that way no matter what number you're converting. The other two numbers are dynamic obviously.I hope this help somebodyEdit: turns out there's a better way to do this. Take your Celsius double it, subtract 10% and add 32.And for everybody talking shit, I would like everybody to know that I have difficulty explaining things without using too many words. So I was trying to come up with a way to get my point across, but unfortunately, I don't know how to do it concisely. I also have chemo brain, which makes me extra Fucking retarded and it gives me the notion that all of my jokes are funny and all of my comments are gold. Many times I'll come back days later and realize that I look like an asshole and everything I said was not funny.Do you see even my explanation right here is using too many words. So thanks for reading. There's a better way to do it. My waist sucks. I guess I'm an idiot. I guess I'm an asshole and I guess I'm insane.",

Total game changer.🟥 Red = Energy burners (balls, jump ropes, ride-ons)🟨 Yellow = Imagination (dolls, dress-up, action figures)🟦 Blue = Brainers (puzzles, books, STEM toys)🟩 Green = Quiet time (stuffed animals, fidget toys, sensory bins)Not only do my kids know what to expect when they reach for a bin, but now when I say “grab something from the green bin,” they actually go play with something calm while I make dinner.Would love to hear what other categories or techniques people use!",

      "content_preview": "I did my laundry last night and my boyfriend asked me to throw in his work clothes, which are all dress shirts and dress pants that he just bought 2 weeks ago and dropped $700 for.I switched everything into the dryer last night before going to sleep and went to grab something for work this morning and started noticing little spots on the clothing. I tried not to freak out until I saw what it was that caused those spots, and then I saw it. A PEN. Worst possible scenario, I guess he left a pen from work in his pocket. ALL OVER his new work clothes, there’s just little spots and streaks, nothing huge but there’s about 5-8 spots per piece of clothing, so it’s very noticeable. I don’t really care about my clothes because they’re all just casual, nothing expensive, but I am in desperate need of advice on how to get the ink out of his shirts and pants.I don’t want for him to have to get all new work clothes but I know that may be the only option, anything at all helps, we’re very desperate!! thank you!!EDIT/UPDATE: i wanted to come and thank everyone for all of the suggestions and support!! I tried alcohol, hairspray, goof off, nail polish remover, magic eraser, dawn dish soap, stain remover detergent, shout stain remover, tide stain remover, AND carbonas stain devil ink remover! after all of the tries, carbonas took the victory!! Since the clothes were dried, stains were obviously set, so it took a lottttt of work to get it out, I wasn’t seeing much of a change while applying it but I figured I had nothing to lose, so I put all of the clothes in the washer on a a soak cycle, and that worked like a charm!!There was a shirt and a pair of pants that were too far gone, pants were salmon colored and shirt was pink/purple. Some people were saying to dye the clothes that were too stained, so that’s what we did. He now has a navy shirt and black pants lol. But everything turned out great, and all of the ink stains in my clothing came completely out except for a small dot on a white shirt i didn’t see(I’ll work on it later).Also someone recommended Grandmas Secret Spray… AMAZING!! I didn’t get to try it on the ink yet, I will try it today and let you all know how it works, but I tried it on a couple shirts we have designated for working on cars lol. It was taking stains from brake dust, motor oil, rust RIGHT OUT. It was like $5 for a big spray bottle of it!",

If you check in earlier, the \"random\" allocation seems to assign you a middle seat in order to upsell you the \"Choose your seat\" option. If you leave it until later, all the middle seats are already assigned, so you get assigned a window or aisle seat. I've tried this 4 times in the past couple of months, and it's worked every time.Don't leave it too late though, as you can't check-in online within 2 hours of your flight.Let me know if this works for you, or if it was just a fluke.",

Rinsing under hot water doesn't do much. And I've tried almost everything else I could think of: washcloths, brushes, and so on.  If you do succeed, it takes forever.  After a while, you just get tired of the hassle and switch to a new blade.Now I've found a solution: compressed air.  Get one of those little cans of stuff you use to blow the dust out of your computer or whatever. You can pick them up at the dollar store for a buck 25 or so. Use the little red tube and it blows all the crap right out from between the blades immediately.",
