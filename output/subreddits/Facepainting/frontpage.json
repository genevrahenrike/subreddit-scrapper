      "content_preview": "Hello! I'm going to be doing face painting for a party in my town. I have experience and I'm not going into this blind, but my experience is from volunteer work. Question 1: Is Snazaroo face paint ok? - At my volunteer jobs I was always supplied with face paint and never had to get my own. I asked what brand they had given me and they told me it was Snazaroo. I looked it up and it seems within my budget but I figured i'd make sure it was the best option. I just started doing my own personal work so id probably get the cheaper kit that comes with smaller amounts of all the colors until I get more consistent jobs and then I'll buy the indivisual colors. Also, if you have any other advice for me for my first time let me know. Question 2: Where is the line drawn on touching the kids faces? - At my volunteer jobs I was doing face painting for free and the parents didnt have to give me any sort of money at all so if a kid moved and his face paint smudged it wasnt that big of a deal, the face paint could look a little messy. Time also wasnt a big worry because the events were smaller and I was there till they ended. For this party I am only there being payed for an hour and want to make sure I have time to get to everyone so I cant deal with too much of kids moving around. I usually put a hand under their chin with my thumb on their chin to hold them still, is this ok? Question #3: If I don't get to everyone in time, what should I do? - She hired me for an hour within the party and she believes based on who will be there only 8-10 kids will want face paint. This should be ok but if more kids want it or if they all choose complex designs or if they all dont want it at the same time I'm worried I won't finish within the hour, should i charge her more if this happens? Question #4: Can I charge her for a custom example sheet? - Her child is having a bug themed birthday party and she asked if I could pick out a couple examples specifically bug themed. I had no problem with this and I made an example sheet on canva yesterday. I don't want to charge her for the time I spent making it because that feels over the top, however I dont own a colored printer so I would need to get it printed at walgreens or CVS or something like that which would cost me around $10 depending on the size she wants. I plan on telling her about this and saying if she wants I can bring my ipad or laptop to show kids examples if she doesnt want to pay for the print out, or if she has a colored printer I could send the sheet I made to her and she can print it out. if neither of those work, I would ask her to cover the cost of having it printed. am I being reasonable? Thank you everyone! I feel kinda dumb asking so many questions but I just wanna make sure I do good and make it as easy and enjoyable for her and her child as possible.",
