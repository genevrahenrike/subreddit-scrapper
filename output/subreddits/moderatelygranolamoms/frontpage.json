I have so many food aversions due to texture and am a picky eater so I want to do everything in my power to prevent this with him. I am vegetarian but will feed my son meat. I bought BLW and organic eating for babies book that I’ve been reading but all of them seem to say different things and contradict each other. What did you all start your babies off on? Did you do/how important is all organic? When can I use spices on his food? Big no-nos? How did you balance breast feedings and solids? Purées or no? I would appreciate hearing anybody’s experiences, advice, or words of encouragement. I am soo anxious and have no idea where to begin. I’ll talk to our pediatrician and nutritionist but would really like to hear from people who have done this before!",

But when we checked out our child’s new kindergarten class, we noticed a VERY STRONG floral scent. The teacher is very big on the room smelling “clean” and uses glade plug-ins or similar products to achieve this. We have been so good about avoiding scented stuff in our home because of all the toxic chemicals, and now our child is spending nearly 7 hours a day surrounded by them. I certainly don’t want to tell the teacher what to do in her own classroom, so I guess I’m just venting. Would you just ignore this?",

I found Lovevery because they seemed to believe in this mission, but if you look closely they cut corners everywhere. Their playmat is actually made of polyester (although some of their toys are organic cotton, which they advertise heavily). When I asked if their silicone toys are platinum cured silicone (as normal silicone has been found to shed toxic ingredients), they responded: \"Though we are unable to share a more granular breakdown of the materials we use, I'd love to share that all materials in our products are tested by third-party labs to comply with global toy safety standards. We include testing for each coating and material in our products for concerning chemicals, heavy metals, and phthalates. The paint and finishes we use on our products are also tested to be non-toxic. We do not use any materials that contain BPA, nor do we use any BPA in the production of our products.\" I think it's common knowledge that being BPA-free is a very low bar, and typical greenwashing. Ugh. It's the deceptive hiding of materials that irks me. Please feel free to share truly non-toxic toy companies with me!!",

      "content_preview": "Hi! My 3 month old has been struggling with acid reflux symptoms for a while now. I was hoping he would just grow out of it but I heard it actually gets worse at 3-4 months. He doesn’t spit up often but often arches his back when breastfeeding and cries at the breast. He eventually latches and eats and his weight gain has been great. He is also a very gassy baby. We had a tongue and lip tie release when he was a few weeks old and when we recently visited our IBCLC for a follow up she recommended trying Camilla Tummy or Cell Salt (Nat Phos). I’m very much “moderately granola” but I’m undecided on homeopathic remedies like this in frequent doses. But I hate to see him so upset and clearly uncomfortable. Does anyone have experience with using these remedies? Thanks! ETA: I also stopped eating dairy over a month ago.",

The user al_tanwir is commenting on this subreddit pretending to be a mom but is really a salesperson/owner for ORL toothpaste, which is fine, but I think they should be disclosing that. His comments go something like this: “ I've read that there are some concerns over Nano-Hydroxyapatite. But generally speaking, Hydroxyapatite is safe to be used. Just be careful of the quality and the brand of Hydroxyapatite you're going for. 'ORL toothpaste' is the brand I go for, it's a bit more expensive than your average fluoride toothpaste, but it's worth the prices. :)” OR “ never used hello for my kids, 'ORL toothpaste'(google it) is the brand I trust for non-fluoride toothpaste, they have a kid's version as well. It contains Hydroxyapatite and Xylitol, 99% organic, no gmo/paraben/alcohol. If your kids have gum diseases, bad breath or unnatural acidity levels in their mouths, some dentists will usually ask you to try Hydroxyapatite/Xylitol based toothpastes and see if it helps.

      "content_preview": "Maybe I just need to vent, but after having my first I went down the rabbit hole and have gotten moderately granola. I hate plastic, we don’t like fragrance, or dyes, we use cast iron. The list goes on and on. I have read enough to know there’s about a couple dozen more things I haven’t even started swapping and really should. And when I think about how basically everything is poison now I feel ready to quit and just enjoy my life and money and whatnot because efforts feel useless. If it’s not plastic and your hormones, it’s sleep and mouth breathing, and holistic care is a fortune. I like certain things that I know are bad but I just don’t care enough to stop (like tell me you don’t love a crispy iced coke from McDonalds on a hot day by yourself running errands 😭). Anyway…. Basically I know all the things, I’ve swapped a bunch, fought with my family to get them to at least respect my wishes, but is it all pointless. Now it’s cotton. I can’t feasibly swap us fully to cotton, it’s just not in the budget. Or linen. Or whatever good natural fiber options. Just anyway. Tell me it’s worth it to keep making the halfway effort and that swapping some stuff is not pointless if I can’t swap even half of my things?",

I briefly switched over to Parasol because there was a good deal going on at target (Get $20 for $100 spent). I love Parasol diapers because they’re TCF, super soft, baby doesn’t have diaper rash and it holds so much! (I almost never got blowouts). The only downsides is that it’s pricier than Millie Moon (with less diapers per box as well!) and it’s not as widely available at Target compared to Millie Moon. (Ex: Size 1 Millie Moon $26.99 for 108 diapers = ~$0.24/diaper vs Size 1 Parasol $29.99 for 88 diapers = ~$0.34/diaper). Went back to Millie Moon and noticed that the diapers aren’t quite as soft anymore. My baby also got the first blowout in a while with Millie Moon, and redness has come back. We didn’t really experience redness the first time we used Millie moon. Did they change the quality of the diapers or am I just too used to how Parasol is made? I feel like their quality went down!",

Also, we have a one year old who doesn’t walk yet - what do I do with him the whole time? I do not actually plan to be outside for 1,000 hours a year but I like the ideas behind their platform. How do you get outside more? I actually feel so guilty because I feel like we are inside more than we “should” be. Realistically, what does “going outside” look like for your families? Are you outside everyday after school? What about weekends? Would love to hear some thoughts from real families! Thanks in advance!",

And please be kind! I feel stupid posting asking about this. I'm a chronic indoor person and I'm starting to realize how that isn't good for me or the kids. I have a 1yo and 5yo. They have wildly different needs obviously. I struggle watching them inside, and when we go outside it's even worse. My 1yo no longer likes his stroller and unfortunately my 5yo is kind of scared of being outside because he's terrified of wasps. I know I'm not helping because I dodge any bug that flies towards me with insane speed lol. I'm not at all comfortable outside and I want to be but every time I go outside I worry about the millions of things that could go wrong. So here I am asking how do I just bring them outside and let them explore without totally freaking out every time? Like do I just let them....go? I've been reading about forest schools and it's like it totally skips everything I'm wondering. Is it okay to just let my 1yo crawl around on the grass? My MIL and husband are hesitant every time I try to just let him explore they've made comments which just increases my anxiety. Do I need a specific \"set up\" space in my backyard that is safe for my kids? My backyard isnt treated obviously, so it has clovers and all that. But that also means it has a lot of bugs. What if my 1yo eats a bug or something? Or crawls into like deer poop? I sound ridiculous. I feel ridiculous. Lol. I need advice and like detailed \"this is how we spend time outside\" stories I think.",

It gets flies and sometimes the groundhog spreads it all over the deck. The cloth diapers are so hard to get on my baby. He's one next week and he never stops moving. I have to hold him in my lap screaming to get a diaper on him and I can't ever get the fit right because he won't be still, so they leak constantly and we're both going through so many clothes every day. Sometimes he escapes and pees everywhere before I can catch him. Disposables are faster and they don't leak nearly as much. I got backed up on the laundry this week and had him in Huggies for two days and there wasn't a single leak. I try so hard to take care of the planet! We don't own a car -we walk and use public transit. We don't eat meat or dairy. We're sparing about the air conditioning and heat. Are we doing enough? Can I just make life easier until my child sleeps better? I just want to have a few less tasks.",

      "content_preview": "My son caught his first cold last week, and it was rough. Here are all the things we did to help him recover, along with some advice we got from our ped: 1.Humidifier (keep the door closed). We kept it running all day to make the air as moist as possible. At night, the room stayed nice and humid, which made it easier for him to sleep. 2.Steam before bath time. I would turn on the hot shower for 20–30 minutes so the bathroom filled with steam before his bath. 3.Simple foods for extra nutrition. If your ped says it’s okay for your baby, try some easy-to-digest foods. Avoid beans since they’re harder to process. I fed my son some mashed potatoes and carrots, which really helped boost his energy. 4.Nasal aspirator. This was a must for us. The manual ones we used before need to suck with the mouth, which really grossed me out! So when my son got sick this time, I grabbed a new momcozy breezyclear nasal aspirator. It has that two-in-one spray feature that looked really handy, and so far we’ve been happy with how well it works. 5.Comfort toys. My son has a Jellycat penguin that he clings to for comfort—it really helps him settle down for sleep. 6.Infant Tylenol. If your baby has a high fever, you can give this, but only after checking with your ped first. If anyone else has tips, please share! Wishing all the little ones a quick recovery.",

Obviously in the US, mass shootings in schools have been happening for quite some time. It makes me sick to my stomach hearing the stories time after time and feeling so helpless. The safety of the school’s campus has become something that I have started to take into consideration. Unfortunately, where we live, there’s very much a sense of “nothing bad happens here.” Our local elementary school has a blue ribbon award and is highly ranked, highly funded, etc with a super cute campus and a big field for the kids to play in and happy kids and parents. BUT- you can walk right onto the campus from the street. There is not so much as a gate, it’s just wide open. The kindergarten classrooms sit right out front, with just a little white picket fence separating the street from their classroom doors. Is it wrong of me to feel like I can’t send my kids here? I bet they’d be happy, and I bet we’d find a nice community, but I think id be on edge every day knowing how vulnerable they are. It’s my job to protect them the best I can and God forbid anything were to happen, I don’t think they’d be safe. Does anyone else feel like this?",

All of the other cousins are on the other side of her family which is why we are doing something only for her. I’m here because her mom out-granola’s me (not saying that negatively, it just means I’m out of ideas) and does not let her eat anything with dyes that she hasn’t made herself so she knows for sure that the dye is “approved”. Niece is also startled very easy so the confetti-like things that pop or popping balloons are out. I’m thinking about putting something pink in a plain box and calling it a day but that seems too low effort.. Any ideas for something we could do? Is the box good enough for a 7yo?",

      "content_preview": "I never think of myself as all that crunchy and always try to acknowledge that I’m in a position of privilege to some extent that allows us to make the choices we do. For example, we only give our son organic milk and Greek, unsweetened yogurt. But then the other “weird things” that my husband and I have chosen, that most people can do, but I guess don’t is to have no battery-powered toys and very few belongings in general. I really struggle with helping people understand that we don’t need or want more physical things for our son and that we prefer things secondhand. I really struggle with people not understanding that our son eats such a wide variety of foods because he just eats what I eat. When they comment I just get quiet. I’m not trying to humble brag, I swear. I’m not going to budge on what we do but don’t want to come off as a snob or be annoying to be around because, no my not even 1.5 year old isn’t going to have ice cream yet. No, we didn’t do a cake smash. Yes, he asks for apples and crackers and is obsessed with fermented foods. This all came up just now when I realized that, man, maybe I’m more on the fringe of North American/Western society than I thought, even if not “full crunchy.” We vaccinate. Again, we did a little formula along with breastmilk past 10 months because my son started going to a playgroup, etc. What I’m getting at is that I’m realizing we might be considered alternative to most people. I was just at a family friend’s house for the weekend and when it came up that my 16-month-old son had never seen a TV show or movie, my friend’s son (my friend is my mom’s age) looked shocked. He said, “What do you do with him!?” And I said, “Well, he does go to a playgroup 4 days a week.” My friend’s son said, “But still!” And I gave him a little list of what my son and I get up to. Is no screens all that weird?  It didn’t seem radical to me until I actually gave it some thought yesterday and went “oh! I only know 3 other families that do no screens.” These interactions and realizations just left me with a bunch of questions: Is it that strange to mostly do solid food, 24-32 oz of cow milk, and still nurse at 16 months? Is it that strange to limit toys and hope to potty-train before age 2 (I’m not ready, in all honesty, but that’s our non-negotiable goal)? If you’ve had the realization you’re outside “the norm,” how do you relate without judgment of others? Sometimes it’s easy for me; other times it’s harder. How do you set expectations and boundaries on other people’s terrain when you’re a guest? Edit: sorry this is so long. I also could go on and on about the ways we’re crunchy and the ways we’re totally average and normal, as far as I can figure out what normal is.",

      "content_preview": "So five years ago when I had my first baby, I wore these nursing bras from a tiny local shop near me. No brand name, no fancy marketing, just simple comfy bras. Now I'm expecting my second and that shop closed down. Super frustrating because now I have to start my bra hunt all over again. I have been searching everywhere, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, trying to find good options. But man, it's hard to tell what's real and what's just clever marketing these days. I'm currently a 36F and really need bras made for busty moms. Comfort is my number one priority right now. I noticed momcozy busty nursing bra since it claims to be designed for larger cup sizes. But how does it actually compare to other brands? I need something with good support, made of cotton, and with wider straps. My old bras were okay, but those thin straps killed my shoulders. Couple questions though: Are all momcozy bras 100% cotton? What are the main differences between their different lines? Would love to hear from moms who've actually tried this bra. Appreciate any real advice",

Unfortunately I just grabbed a random organic cascadian farm one when in a hurry at Whole Foods. It is 20% sugar. I’m letting him finish the box because he’s happy with it (obviously lol) but I’d love an alternative. There always seems to be something wrong with the new “healthy” one I attempt so I’d love some help!",
