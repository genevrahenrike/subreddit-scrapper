I watched the episode with the little boy in the wheel chair who was a paraplegic. Their interaction with each other was so pure. Idk I just became overwhelmed with feelings. I wasn’t sad that the boy was in a wheelchair. I became overwhelmed with emotion by the way Mr. Roger’s spoke to him and the viewers. I had steady tears streaming down my face. Is this normal for other viewers??",

I couldn't find anything about them online and I didn't have a way of scanning them, so I copied the text onto a PDF. I browsed through archives of the Mister Rogers website and found a few other pamphlets that were able to be ordered in bundles by childcare providers and parents in the early 2000s. 2 to 49 copies were 50¢ each, 50 copies were $20, and 100 copies were $35. The 1985 Family Communications order catalog I received with the promotional packet has a listing for 10 pamphlets. These were produced with grants from the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, the James Francis McCandless Charitable Trust, and The Lilly Endowment, Inc. The only pamphlets I know of that I don't have are When Your Child Goes To The Hospital, When Your Child Goes To The Dentist, Talking With Families About Divorce, and When Your Child Has Cancer (which I think was written after 1985 because it wasn't shown in the catalog). I was able to access the first two pages of When Your Child Has Cancer via the Mister Rogers website and the first page of When Your Child Goes To The Dentist via a Family Communications order catalog, both of which I've included. Here are the pamphlets: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tU2p6_10Q_6IQ59IwQzmPXkA8UmP8anA/view?usp=sharing",
