      "content_preview": "Hey folks, I'm an undergraduate junior CS major and I'm hoping to line up an embedded internship for Summer 2026. Recently I've been playing around with the esp32, working on making one of those light switch iot device thingies. I had the idea to make some sort of smart wearable, maybe a name badge that would cycle through my name, major and a QR code to my LinkedIn using an esp32 and a 128x64 OLED to bring to my school career fair to demonstrate my interest for embedded projects and to be an attention grabber/conversation starter. My question is, would this sort of thing be tacky/overkill or a bad idea? Is there something else I could make that would be better? I have about  three weeks before the fair so looking for something that could be made in a weekend or two. Thanks for any insight.",

What brand / model would you recommend and what should I specifically look out for? When you bought your first what did you wish u knew before buying? Thank you! Edit: So far I learned Ideally I should get something with 4 channels and 200Mhz (2GS/s) Edit2 probably gonna be: Rigol DHO814 vs. Siglent SDS1104X Edit3: Chose the siglent SDS1104X because I do not like the touchscreen/usage and software or Rigol.

      "content_preview": "I've bit the bullet and decided to finally start using AI in my workflow. I thought it's become good enough to expect decent results from, even for embedded. Although the first week was quite exciting, I now see how you can completely derail your productivity if you start relying on it too much. I was initially hesitant, giving it just chunks of code to parse and analyse, find obvious memory leaks etc. and it did a good job. Confident in it's performance, I essentially vibe-coded a bunch of factory automation scripts. This is where it started falling apart. It messed up a lot of things, including using deprecated syntax for tooling, assuming things it shouldn't have, and creating a lot of bloat. I spent the entire day steering it towards how I think it should proceed, but by then it had created such nonsense context that it kept regurgitating the same BS again and again. If I had just done the usual chore of reading the tooling docs and writing the script from scratch, it would have honestly taken me 3 hours instead of the 7 it took with AI. This is just an example. There were other instances too. I also feel \"dumber\" the more I use AI. It feels like I haven't done my due diligence and that I have no idea if the code it produced actually does what I want. The \"confidence\" I have when I push something that I wrote with my bare hands through hours of research, is simply not there. But there's something addictive about letting AI do your work for you, and I can totally understand why so many people have started vibe coding.",

      "content_preview": "I just want to double check that I am understanding the method of accessing the GPIO registers for STM32 ARM microprocessors. From what I understand: All the pins are grouped into \"Ports\" which are labeled A, B, C, D... and so on. Each \"Port\" has a set of \"Registers\" that can be written to and are used to perform certain operations, such as designating a pin as either \"Input\" or \"Output\". And that each \"Port\" has a unique \"Base Address\" in memory, in which the \"Registers\" for a given \"Port\" exist at a specific offset from form the \"Base Address\". For example: The STM32-F411 Port 'A' has a base address of \"0x40020000\" The offset to the \"GPIO'A'_MODER\" register is \"0x00\" (same as base address) and is used to set the \"pin mode\". Each pin in \"GPIO'A'_MODER\" is represented by two bits, and different combinations set the pin to different \"pin modes\". 00: sets the pin to \"Input Mode\" 01: sets the pin to \"Output Mode\" 10: sets the pin to \"Alternate function\" 11: sets the pin to \"Analog Mode\" So, by writing binary value 01010101010101010101010101010101 to the address \"0x40020000\" would set all the pins on Port 'A' to \"Output Mode\". *EDIT: Fixed Typo.",

      "content_preview": "I’m currently working on embedded systems projects, and some of our clients are asking specifically for a MISRA C:2012 static analysis compliance report . I understand that tools like PC-Lint, LDRA, QAC, Coverity, Klocwork, etc. are commercial and premium software, and they usually generate detailed compliance reports. But as someone starting out, I’d really like to see what such a report looks like —the structure, the type of violations listed, how compliance status is shown, and how exceptions are documented. Basically, I’m not looking for any company’s confidential report—just a sample/template/example report that can help me understand: What information needs to be in a MISRA C compliance report? How violations and justifications are typically presented. How “compliance achieved” is demonstrated. The company I work for is a startup , so any suggestions that would help me cut costs are also welcome. If anyone here has worked with MISRA compliance and can share a redacted report, template, or even a screenshot, it would really help beginners like me understand how to handle these reports and what’s expected by clients. Thanks a lot!",

      "content_preview": "Hi, I am trying to read SDI-12 datalogger signal. The signal will tell me when to take the measurement and the thermistor will read the measurement and will report it back. I am using an STM32 G4 in order to control the communication between the sensors and the directions on taking measurements and how to take them. I need a bidirectional level shifter ( from 12V SDI-12 to 3.3V stm32 gpio). I was just looking around for recommendations. I am currently considering the TXB0108. However, i am a little confused. The SDI-12 protocol is a 10 bit protocol in serial. Which would imply that the no of bits that the level shifter can shift parallely would be non consequential to the actual functioning right ?? I am a little confused right now. I do have a presentation for this project tomorrow so it would help to have some clarity on this. Thanks",

The goal of the project is to create a low-power, long-range health monitoring system that can collect and transmit patient vitals (like heart rate, SpO₂, temperature, etc.) in real time over LoRaWAN. This could be really useful in remote or rural areas where cellular or Wi-Fi coverage is limited. I’d appreciate input on: •\tComponents: Suggestions for sensors, microcontrollers, and LoRa modules that work well for low-power health data transmission. •\tImplementation ideas: How to handle data visualization, low-power operation, and gateway connectivity. •\tExtra features: Any cool add-ons you’d recommend, like GPS tracking, alert systems, or offline storage. Thanks in advance! I’m looking forward to your advice.",
