      "content_preview": "Hi all! I have a question about the reading order for A Valiant Vow and Trials of the Jedi. I've been following the Completionist reading order from this sub and am currently on Into the Light. I tend to stick pretty close to the reading order as shown (although I'll occasionally read the comics earlier or later than a book if I am reasonably certain they don't spoil each other), but I'm a little confused by the placement of A Valiant Vow and Trials of the Jedi. This sub places Trials of the Jedi much earlier, near the middle of the wave, and A Valiant Vow dead last, even though it was released earlier. Two other reading orders I've seen recommended on this sub ( Youtini and the official Star Wars site ) both place Trials of the Jedi directly after A Valiant Vow. Will I be spoiling anything by reading A Valiant Vow before Trials of the Jedi? Or is there a good reason why this sub puts them in the order it does? I'll admit that it also feels a little weird to end on a middle-grade novel, which is why I'm leaning toward reading A Valiant Vow earlier if possible.",

They’ve tied everything together and I can’t wait to finish it(will probably be tonight instead of sleeping lol). I’ve enjoyed the High Republic so far, and this has sent me over the edge. I’m beyond excited to keep reading this book and finishing the entire thing. Also shout out to the Wiki, the reading order presented has been phenomenal. Great way to dive into it and follow along with the events.",

      "content_preview": "Welcome to The High Republic ! The multimedia High Republic initiative has officially wrapped. While we’ve been teased to expect “Phase More” in the future, the original story the Luminous Five & friends set out to tell has been completed. What is the High Republic? The High Republic is a multimedia project that spans novels, comic books, audio dramas, short stories, and more. It tells the story of the Jedi at their height, long after The Old Republic but still a few hundred years before the prequel era. Where do I start? The High Republic is three Phases. Like the movies, Phase II is a “prequel” Phase, where we jump back long before the events of Phase I to learn some critical backstory behind the events we’ve already seen, before we return to Phase III, one year after the events of Phase I, to wrap up the story. You should start with Phase I , and specifically, Light of the Jedi , which is the essential launching point that establishes the status quo for the series. Reading the Phases in the order they were released, not chronological order, is what was intended by the authors and what works best for the flow of information. Additionally, The Acolyte TV series and associated media take place later in the High Republic era, around 100 years after the prequel. These can mostly be read without THR as context, but one book, Wayseeker, takes place between Phase III and the show and bridges the two eras. Do I need to read everything? There is a lot of content in the High Republic, and you definitely do not need to read everything . Every piece of content adds something to the overall story, but usually, what you need to know about a book or comic you didn’t read will be summarized elsewhere. That being said, there are some books or comics that are more important than others and are essential to understanding the story. As this gets asked a lot, the adult series of novels is not the same as the essential series of novels. For example, in Phase II, the young adult novels are designed to have the most essential information of the Phase. It’s also important to note that “young adult” doesn’t mean that these are kids books; the writing style and content in them is almost as adult as the adult books. What’s the reading order? Many people on the sub will tell you that you can’t go wrong with release order, which is certainly true. We have also put together three suggested reading orders below depending on how deep you want to dive. These reading orders balance release order with coherency, grouping together comic issues and short stories so that you’re not constantly jumping between issues of different series while still avoiding spoilers. Core Events : This order only includes the Adult Novels for Phase I and Young Adult Novels for Phase II. This is the most stripped-down version of The High Republic. You will still get a tight story and a great experience out of them, but some important events will be happening in-between books. Main Story : Includes the Adult & Young Adult novels, important adult comics, and the Audio-Dramas. With this order, you will get all of the adult stories and the full big picture of the High Republic. This is the most recommended order by the users of r/Highrepublic . Completionist : Includes EVERYTHING! Adds the All Ages comics, the mangas and the Middle Grade novels. The definitive way to experience The High Republic. You can always add some of the items here to your read and drop others, but this will tell you where everything takes place. Discussion Threads Below is a list of all content released as part of the main three Phases or The Acolyte, and linked discussion threads (available for all Phase II-III releases, though some Phase I releases are missing due to lack of mods during late Phase I).

Probably a discussion best saved for another time. However, recently I've been put on the warehouse floor at my job, which meant a lot more time to listen to things than before. It started small, podcasts and the like, but I eventually got tired of listening to celebrities and influencers chat while I worked my @$$ off with them chuckling in my ear. Enter Libby - my new favorite work app. Spotify premium let me listen to certain stuff, but only 15 hours per month meant like one Novel / month. With Libby I can finish one and jump right into the next, absolutely free. With that newfound freedom, I finally decided to try THR. It felt daunting and overwhelming at first, but now I'm so bought in and invested in everything this era has to offer. I know, a lot of backstory and what probably feels like a Libby ad, but it's just my journey, and as many of you all know, the journey is part of the adventure in THR. I'm so enamored with all of it. The actions of the Jedi as they face an evolving galaxy no longer at peace, and how each deals with their new reality. Ammadeo feels guilty every time he takes a life, while Elzar seems to feel in his element in a crisis. Avar's tenderness gets taken advantage of sometimes, while who would have thought they needed an empathetic wookiee storyline? Yet Burryaga delivers every time. Then there's non-jedi adventures like the crew of the Vessel. They make such a huge difference during the fall of Starlight, then save the day/galaxy again on Tolis. Chancellor Soh faces the greatest adversity of any galactic leader in centuries, yet seemingly does it with a perfect balance of gut judgment and decades of politics. Her intentions seem so pure, yet she slowly learns how dangerous it is to rely entirely on the Jedi to fix her problems. Not to mention Grey characters not exactly Jedi but not exactly citizens like Ty Yorrick or Master Cohmac who are trying to find their place in the universe. The Nameless present a bigger threat to the order than a bunch of battle droids ever have or could. It's a great incorporation of mythology and nature to help foster the one thing the Jedi cannot face alone - a sense of fear and loss of the Force. It makes Yoda's commentary in TPM about fear being a path to the dark side so much more poignant. He knows firsthand of this degradation because of people like Azlin who succumbed to fear because of the Nameless. Also, using established characters like Yoda, Yaddle, Yarael Poof and others as anchors we all know and can rely on to not feel so overwhelmed by the influx of new characters is a great idea. It's VERY similar to what The Clone Wars did in its early seasons. People like Yoda, Obi-Wan, Anakin and Grievous helped steer us to new characters like Ahsoka, Rex, Fives, Hondo, and more. Which brings me to my final point. While we have touches of it in the very child-oriented Young Jedi Adventures, I find myself longing for a TCW-style series that brings these stories to even more life. I think they'd enrich the universe for so many people like my wife, who will watch shows with me but would probably never listen to an audio book with me. But imagine the tragedy of Loden Greatstorm, the Valo fair, the fall of Starlight, and so much more, brought to life on screen with dramatic scores by the Kiners. The animation style is familiar and established, they're clearly looking for something \"else\" to do by doing this Maul Shadow Lord BS, and there's a rich well of Canon just waiting there that cam be used. I think I first had these inklings when listening to the audio drama The Battle of Jedha, the full cast and sound effects was an amazing listen - and again would enrich elements we already know from seeing Jedha City in Rogue One. I just listened to Trials, and it only solidified my belief it should be brought to screen. The culmination of so many storylines made me want to circle back and fill in the gaps to help me have am even deeper appreciation for these stories. A bit rushed at times, I wanted more conclusion to Bell's story, but it was very good overall. Anyway, I could go on, but I can't be alone in these desires can I? Tldr: fell in love with THR and now want more, so Lucasfilm please make a TCW series based on these stories 🙏",
