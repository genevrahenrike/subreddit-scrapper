      "content_preview": "Hi, I’ve been trying to learn more about islam and include it in my life with more intention. I came across a website where it was said that it is haram to go to a place where alcohol can be served or sit at a table where there is alcohol. I read several other sites and it’s not clear to me if it’s always wrong or if it is ok as long as I don’t consume it. I think maybe it should be avoided but sometimes certain jobs require the presence at dinners or events where alcohol is present. Can anyone give me a clear explanation please I know it may sound like a stupid question but I am confused about this because I thought it didn’t matter as long as I don’t drink",

      "content_preview": "THIS POST IS FOR WOMEN WITH GOOD & NON ABUSIVE HUSBANDS One thing I notice after few months or 1/2 years of marriage, is that they (women) become a shell of a person. Their excited spirit? Gone. Their enthusiasm? Gone. Their passion for life? Gone. not all. No. I don’t blame your husbands. This is your own doing. When they first get married, ofc its exciting. Its fun. Its beautiful. Your husband made you the main character. He gives you so much attention. But after 2 years? Things slow down. Then what do you do? Ask him. And beg. And think he is the problem. Cos he isn't giving you attention 24/7. You are your problem. When you get married, Don't lose yourself to marriage. Your marriage is a part of your life. Not your whole life. Go meet your family. Have fun with your friends (Halal ofc- I am no advocate for Haram ever) Have personal goals. Even if he is a breadwinner, do something part time. Memorise the Quraan. (You know its me ;)) Learn to do cooking/ baking/ horse riding (I am just throwing ideas. I know horse riding is expensive) Main Thing: Marriage should mean Two lives Carrying on TOGETHER. Not losing yourself. If you lose your own sense of self or self identity. You will resent him & Yourself. You can argue with me all you want, but I see this again and again. (Do everything for your husband, cook, clean, keep him happy. But never lose yourself.)",

      "content_preview": "I honestly don’t know where to start. Last year, around August, my cousin kept begging me for money. He knew I didn’t have £10k just lying around, so he pressured me into taking out a loan. He messaged me constantly, called me on Snapchat, and wouldn’t stop until I agreed. I ended up giving him £5k first, then another £5k a week later after he got his brother to chase me. Altogether, the full £10k went to him. Since then, it’s been a nightmare. I work full time, even pick up overtime shifts, and my family already struggles financially. Every month I’m chasing him, asking for the repayment. He pays late, ignores me half the time, and I’m the one stuck with the bank loan in my name. He paid me the July amount but hasn’t paid me for last month or this month. When I try calling him on Snapchat, he ignores me — but if it’s his friends messaging or calling, he replies straight away. It makes me feel like I’m nothing to him after everything I did. Yesterday was my birthday and instead of feeling happy, I just felt regret. I can’t save money, I feel like I’ve ruined my own life for him. I really wish I had never taken this loan out for him. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What can I even do now? Can I take legal action or should I just keep chasing him? Also, if anyone has been through something similar emotionally, I’d appreciate hearing how you coped. It’s taken a big toll on my mental health as well as my finances.",

      "content_preview": "Mine was, I used to work in a mall kiosk selling perfumes and it was an early morning I was still sleepy and had to open the kiosk. Early morning we didn’t get many customers so I sat on the chair and dozed off 😅. One customer came and just knocked on the counter and I was like haaa haa 😴 I woke up and realized 😬 and she was laughing it was embarrassing 😬. I was so sleepy at once and due to the embarrassment I became hyperactive and started to move around fast, super fast. The kiosk was small and barely enough room to move around in speed. As I was moving around I had to grab something from the lower shelves and doing so my belt got caught in one the door handle, I was still crouching and keep the perfumes on the table and she asked to see something from the other side of the shop and me being hyperactive moved around really fast without even noticing that my best was caught in one of the doors and it was stuck 😂. I fell down 🤭🥲😭🫠 I fell down and tried to get back up but the more force I applied to pull myself out the more I felt pulled downwards 😭. Then I came to my senses and got the belt unstuck and stood back up with the most embarrassing face hehe 🥲😭🫠🤭. The customer was like what just happened? Luckily we both didn’t want things to get more awkward 😬 so I just proceeded to make the bill. Working in the mall was fun, daily something new scenes would unfold. It was an embarrassing moment makes me cringe 😬.",

      "content_preview": "Ah this will be an awkward one. A taboo one. No one wants to talk about it. Why? Cos boys will be boys. And it’s a man’s world. But I live in it too. So let’s talk about it. You’d expect single men to be there gawking, staring. (I mean, they do. Still wrong tho. But they have this line that they don't cross) Married men, not all , but some don’t just stare. They get close. They start casual conversations. They hold your eyes so you feel you have to look back. They send social media requests. They offer help where it’s not even needed. Ew. They dress it up as “chivalry.” And before anyone shouts “decency” at me, I know the difference. I know what respect looks like. I know when a man can speak politely, keep distance, and help without crossing lines. That’s fine. That’s normal. Its actually appreciated, that a woman needs major assistance and you can be of aid respectfully. This is different. This is shameless. Some will do it while their wife is standing right next to them. And let’s be clear: single women don’t want married men. Just because your wife wants you does not mean every single woman in the world does We’re not flattered by the stares. We’re not waiting for your attention. We’re not hoping you’ll add us. It’s uncomfortable. It’s embarrassing. It makes us lose respect for you. Oh you’re bored from married life? Isn’t your wife? What makes your boredom more important than her dignity? A married man giving unnecessary attention isn’t showing kindness. It’s showing weakness. Disrespect to his wife. Disrespect to himself. Stop with “it’s just a chat.” Stop with “I’m just being nice.” You know the difference between respect and flirting. We know it too. And trust me, women notice. Even if we don’t say anything. Your wife notices. The other women in the room notice. Men with emotional intelligence notice. Everyone thinks you're weak. (This applies to engaged men too.) To the married women: if this triggers you because your husband does it, don’t worry. I don’t judge you. I just get second-hand embarrassment for him. And before anyone comes at me in the comments: if I cared to impress you, I wouldn’t have shared this. (This may trigger more people than I care to admit. But someone has to be the one who says it.) Single women/divorced women see this happening to them. Let’s start calling out Muslim married men for their casual flirty behaviour. Doesn't just apply to married tho, if you're single and you casually flirt. Watch yourself. Yes, if my future husband were to do it, it would be embarrassing for him too. My actions are not linked to his. Call him out. If he doesn't respect himself, why should you? Also, Please Don't Come At The Single Women.(Divorced or not) There was no invitation. A polite conversation is NEVER an invite. Also, what's happening in the Muslim communities where married people are casually texting other married people? Do you know adultery is worse? Whether you're 20, 30, 40, or 50 or even 60. Control your own lust. Its not our job! If you want to be a simp, simp for your wife. All the desire, take it to her and treat her well. And for the record, the Prophet ﷺ gave the solution clearly. If you see something in another woman that stirs desire, don’t go chasing her attention. Go to your wife. Fulfil your need with her. That is where your blessing, your loyalty, and your dignity lies. (Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1403) Someone said to me, He spends all his day on SC, Insta Gawking at other women, and comes to me at night. When I confront him, he shrugs it off. And he doesn't care about what I want. The Prophet ﷺ said: “Could any of you beat your wife as he beats his slave, and then lie with her in the evening?” (Sahih Bukhari, 5204; Sahih Muslim, 2855). This powerful hadith exposes the hypocrisy of men who harm or belittle their wives yet still expect intimacy from them, reminding us that marriage is built on dignity, respect, and compassion, not abuse followed by entitlement. This May Not Apply To Most. But A Reminder Is Definitely Needed.",

My age is 28,  male, earning and living a decent life in tier 2 city. I have never been in a relationship. Now whenever there's discussion about my marriage, I am least interested. So is it because of people like me who have been single for so long become emotionless when it comes to love after a certain point or is it because of hormones as I've read that testosterone starts declining after 25?

      "content_preview": "I took a break from all social media and actually touched grass. Just normal day to day. When you come on social media SOME people act like all women are committing Zina, like they all commit Tabarruj. This is not true. Just travel in London Underground and you will see many niqabi women. Even in my Uni there’s modest Muslim women. Secondly, SOME men being obsessed about women is so unattractive. Daily you have 10s of post complaining about women. If you focus on your life you won’t have a hard time. If you build yourself as a man I promise you, you will find a good women and In Sha Allah you will have many options of good women. If you do tawbah and stay away from haram (especially pornography) Allah will In Sha Allah bless you with a pious wife, just keep purifying yourself. A lot of times you are rejected because everyday you come on Reddit and read about red flags about girls and feminism and blah blah blah. Then you talk to a woman and come off as too aggressive. Trust me, when you interact with a Muslim women in real life she won’t be a feminist. People just come on Reddit and dump traumas which they didn’t even experience in real life but through pixels. They will see a video of some haram and think it’s real life, especially teenagers. They will judge what they see online as the reality. For example, many times that video of those hijabis saying they want 50k Mahr (which obviously looked like a joke) goes viral and some boys cry saying look they all want 50k 🤣 that’s literally no where near what the average mahr is in the UK (it’s more between £5k-10k). Also, many brothers need to detox from social media and build a business, career or focus on studying. At least attend the masjid once akhi. The key is staying away from social media if it warps your idea and scares you off marriage, workout out, journal, build a business, focus on your studies and try getting a job if you already don’t have one. I’m sick of men crying. BTW I’m a guy and all my friends have found their partners and they also don’t spend their time with the junk which is on TikTok, X, Insta, Snapchat and Reddit.",

      "content_preview": "I came across this article on a marriage expert’s Instagram page, and I thought it was worth sharing here. Many couples think that going to bed after a fight is harmless, but in reality, it leaves silent wounds in the heart. Laying your head on the pillow while still angry means you’re physically next to the one you love, but emotionally miles apart. And this is where the coldness begins, the coldness that gradually steals the warmth of marriage. Direct Impact on Sleep: Arguments before bed trigger stress hormones (adrenaline and cortisol). For men: They toss and turn, replaying the argument in their minds. Frustration builds, sleep is restless, and they wake up exhausted. For women: They may close their eyes, but their hearts remain heavy. Tears fall in silence, and feelings of disappointment linger. For the marriage: Sleepless nights pile up, turning what should be a place of comfort into a source of misery. The emotional bond weakens. 2. Psychological Impact Disagreements don’t just end when the lights go out, they linger in the heart. For men: They go to bed feeling disrespected. Pride hardens, and the willingness to compromise fades. For women: They feel emotionally unsafe, as if they are alone even in the same bed. For the marriage: Dialogue shifts from understanding to wounding, and a silent wall begins to rise between them. 3. Impact on the Marital Relationship When couples repeatedly fall asleep angry, a dangerous pattern develops. For men: They withdraw physically, thinking it protects them from conflict, but it only deepens the distance. For women: They long for warmth and closeness, but instead feel abandoned and emotionally cold. For the marriage: The bed, meant to be a place of peace and intimacy, becomes a symbol of estrangement. 4. Real-Life Examples: A wife falls asleep with tears on her cheeks, while her husband turns to the wall in anger. The husband wakes to see his wife’s bitterness and thinks she is overreacting. The wife sees her pain ignored and closes her heart even further. Together, they wake up with heavy hearts, starting the day in conflict rather than peace. 5. Spiritual and Prophetic Guidance The Prophet ﷺ advised against prolonged estrangement: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon his brother for more than three days... and the better of the two is the one who initiates the greeting.” (Bukhari & Muslim) For men: Initiating reconciliation wins not only peace of mind but also a wife’s heart. For women: Taking the first step softens anger and rekindles connection. For marriage: The night transforms back into a space of love and mercy, as God intended: “And among His signs is that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may find tranquility in them...” (Ar-Rum: 21)",

Wish for a husband only to replace your father’s provision, without wanting to build together (Qur’an 4:34). Display outward religiosity but neglect your heart and sincerity with Allah (Qur’an 66:5). Pretend obedience in public but live a double life in private (Qur’an 33:33). Carry jealousy and envy that destroys your own peace (Qur’an 4:32). Treat marriage as an escape from boredom or loneliness, not as worship (Qur’an 2:187). Make beauty, fashion, and attention your only value, neglecting taqwa (Qur’an 24:31). Expose yourself to fitnah through shamelessness and immodesty (Qur’an 24:31). Lack patience, discipline, and mercy in your nature (Qur’an 16:90). Carry hatred towards men because of past pain, wanting to “get even” (Qur’an 42:40). Doesn't respect the responsibility of being a wife with kindness and balance (Qur’an 4:19). Every believing man longs for a wife who brings sakīnah, mercy, and respect into the home (Qur’an 30:21). Marriage is an amanah, not a playground. If your heart is unsettled, heal it with Allah ﷻ first. Don’t marry to run away, marry to build with taqwa. I used verses for guidance and understanding, not intended with hate but spreading the light of islam. Allah ﷻ doesn't expect us to be perfect, He created us weak, so that we turn to Him in repentance. May Allah ﷻ guide us all, grant us all ease and understanding.",

I’ve seen sisters say things like “If a guy approached me at the gym, It would be so bad and akward and get softly traumtised, seriouly therapy? Since when did a normal approach become a trauma response? Yet, the same voices will complain about loneliness, about men not stepping up, about wanting someone to approach outside the prayer rooms. the same voices cry about about the marriage crisis, about “where are all the good men.” Which one is it? You can’t shame men for doing what’s natural, then cry when men stop doing it. They’ll stand near the men’s at work or events, hoping for someone to notice, but if a man actually does approach, suddenly it’s harassment. Which one is it? Let’s stop sugarcoating it, many women ( and men ) are lonely, but instead of admitting it, women they bury it under career talk or “self-love,” and endless distractions. Women sugarcoat loneliness with phrases like ‘self-love’ and ‘I don’t need anyone,  until they’re 30 and suddenly want what they rejected at 20. They post about independence, but their search history is full of honeymoon destinations, couples with flowers, and date night ideas The biology hasn’t changed  men and women were created to pair, to marry, to build families. Pretending otherwise only makes the loneliness louder at night. If a man still has the courage to approach in today’s climate, don’t punish him for it. Don’t act scandalized. Handle it with dignity because times have changed, and most men have already stopped trying. And here’s the irony: when men stop approaching, women lose the very thing they secretly want but are too proud to admit. Beauty may get attention online, but it won’t build a home sugarcoating loneliness won’t make it disappear , it only exposes it more. When a man approaches and you’re not interested, the solution is simple,  decline with dignity and move on no drama, no victimhood , just respect and Vice Versa",

Pure Muslims are constantly told not to judge. We all have our limits of what we are and are not comfortable with. If someone’s s3xual past makes you uncomfortable, you have every right to reject them. You have every right to know about your spouses past. If the past doesn’t matter to someone, then they can marry someone with a long history of zina. Good for them, since it doesn’t matter to them. But it matters to some of us. Can we please stop normalizing zina and passing it off as an acceptable sin? Zina is a major, MAJOR sin. It’s FILTH. Why can’t we treat it as such? It has absolutely horrific consequences and baggage (diseases, pregnancy out of wedlock, pair bonding issues, etc). It’s the reason for decline in marriage. PAST MATTERS. Your past is your resume, your history, your record. You need to own up to it. When you apply to jobs, guess what employees look for? They look at work history and performance. Insurance companies look at history and record. When you apply to university, they look at your grades and academic history. So why doesn’t past matter when it comes to marriage? IT MATTERS! Allah is the most forgiving, but humans aren’t Allah. Allah can forgive prostitutes, murderers, rapists, gays, etc. But how many of us will feel comfortable with marrying someone like that? Not many of us. This absolutely proves that past matters. This is coming from someone who’s not even asking for a zina-free spouse anymore. But even I have my own standards and need to know about my spouses past. Keep your standards high in the search of a spouse. May Allah grant us righteous spouses. Mic drop🎤",

      "content_preview": "I need some guidance. I’m a woman in my late 20s going through a divorce. I live alone and own my house. It gets really lonely being here and I’m not use to being alone. A few weeks ago I gave my number to a man that worked at a store I usually go to. I always thought he was attractive so I gave him my number. We talked and met at my house once. We just watched a movie and played games. I told him I was just looking for someone to chill with until my divorce was finalized. One time I felt really sad with the whole divorce thing and want to make the feeling stop. I wanted so badly to stop hurting so I planned to call him over and commit Zina. Take away the bad feeling and replace with with something else. I called him and asked if he wanted to come over without mentioning my plans. He quickly said that it was too hot outside and he didn’t feel like it. We didn’t see each other but I did tell him later on how I felt when I called him. That I was sad and was planning to sleep with him. He then asked when is the next time I’m available to hang out. We agreed on the date and we set a time. When the day came he asked me if we are going to sleep together I told him no. He said ok no pressure I’ll still come over. Honestly I was still planning to sleep with him but I didn’t want to say it or talk about. After that he started acting weird he was taking longer to text. Then the time came and left and he still didn’t come or reply. He then told me “I’m drunk but I’ll come in a little bit”. At this time it was almost midnight and I became agitated “I told him then Keep your drunk self at home”. He became upset and said “well I was on the way but F you then im turning around”. I ended up blocking him and haven’t talked to him sense Do you think this was from the mercy of Allah? He was trying to prevent me from committing Zina? How do I prevent this from happening and ask Allah for forgiveness **Thank you everyone for the great Advice and for being so kind. Reading all your comments has indeed made a difference. I’ll will try to do some of the things you all suggested to avoid men at this time and committing Zina. I’m going to focus on my imam as it’s very low at this time and shaytan is taking advantage of my vulnerability. Also I’m getting a lot of messages from men please stop I’m not looking for a relationship/marriage at this time",

      "content_preview": "As-salamu alaykum everyone, I’m based in Pakistan and recently started importing gaming peripherals (like keyboards and mice). I want to make sure my business is halal from the start, so I need advice. Here’s my situation: •\tA buyer in Pakistan asks me to get 50 keyboards. •\tHe pays me around 50–60% advance. •\tI place the order with my Chinese supplier. •\tThe supplier then ships directly to the buyer (dropshipping style). •\tI don’t connect the buyer directly with the supplier — I take responsibility for the order. •\tBut the thing is, the shipment never physically comes to me. My concern: In Islam, I heard it’s haram to sell something you don’t own or don’t have in your possession. In my case, the goods go straight from the supplier to my buyer, without passing through me. So my questions are: 1.\tIs this haram, since the goods are not in my possession? 2.\tIf yes, what’s the halal way to structure this deal? 3.\tIs there something like “constructive possession” (where even if it doesn’t come to my house, it’s still considered mine legally)? 4.\tShould I treat this as an agency (wakalah) deal, or as a buy-and-sell after I own it, or salam (full prepayment)? I really don’t want to fall into haram earnings, so any scholarly explanation, fatwa links, or personal knowledge would mean a lot. JazakAllahu khair.",

      "content_preview": "We were 4 months away from our wedding date. He is 30m and I’m 25f. Both Muslim. We got together to get married; we clicked instantly. Little did I know how much he would drag me through. While his family and him waited until now to prep for our wedding, my family has been going off and has paid for almost all things like venue deposit, make up deposit, wedding dress deposit, plus my large family had bought their clothes and everything for our wedding. We weren’t perfect but we definitely loved each other. Just this week I caught him cheating. He had made a Facebook dating profile and has matched and was actively talking to 14 girls. He tried to hide it by deleting the app but I already saw the Facebook logo and the work “matches”. He asked how their day was. Called them sexy and asked if they could “take the d”. He claimed he had no bad intentions and the girls were far away; that is a lie because he was asking girls where they live and what days they’re free. At first he blamed it on me, but then accepted it’s wrong what he did. We had built so much and it so disappointing of him. I wanted to be married and love my husband, make a family and be happy. I endured so much with him and at the end he did that. He said he wanted to complete half his deen by marrying. We wanted to make it halal. This just happened and I know i will have to go through so much because everyone is excited for my wedding and has been preparing for it. May Allah heal my aching heart and grant me a spouse who truly is good for me and the family we will built together. May Allah protect me and make it easy on me please. I am scared for the repercussion; I know there’s going to be a diverse of reaction from everyone I will have to sit through acting like my heart isn’t hurting. I didn’t want this. I wanted a good person.",

      "content_preview": "Assalam Alaykum, Just for this post, I made a Reddit account. This is gonna be a long post, but I would appreciate if you read and may help. I am 27 years old now. In my teenage years and up until I was 24, I used to watch corn weekly. I wasted a lot of time on it and my mind became corrupted. 2 years ago, I made a commitment to myself: I would stop watching corn and stop mastuurbating entirely. I managed to stay clean for about 1.5 years. No corn, no mastuurbation, nothing at all! It was at this period, I started taking Islam very seriously. Started praying 5 times a day. I have not missed a single prayer in these 2 years, alhamdulilah! Sometimes I even wake up for Tahajjud. I go to the mosque every evening and I read Quran daily. Everything seemed to be going well. I believed I had control over my desires and would never give in again. However, after 1.5 years, I came across something on social media, and before I knew, I ended up watching corn again and even mastuurbating. What’s worse is that this is not just any corn. It is one very specific category that haunts me and keeps coming back to my mind. Even though I can resist all other temptations, this particular thing has a strong grip on me. Like it has me in a chokehold. If I read about it, my mind wanders. It can be months where I don’t think about it at all, living my life normally, but when I see something online related to it, I sometimes struggle to control myself. Once I give in, I can spend hours, even staying up at night. About six months ago, after 1.5 years clean, I relapsed. In just 2 days, I came 5 times.. I felt completely lost. I managed to pull myself together and made a sincere promise to Allah: I would never watch corn or mastuurbate again. I kept this for about 2 months, but then I slipped again. Yesterday, I relapsed once more. I had no intention to climax, I only wanted to look, but I lost control. I couldn’t sleep all night, feeling deep sadness, guilt, and disappointment, feeling as if I had let Allah down. Make no mistake, I still pray 5 times a day and woke up for Fajr this morning. I plan to read Quran today and go to the mosque tonight, inshallah. I truly do not understand why this keeps happening. I always thought that praying 5 times a day, being consciously engaged in my faith, would prevent me from falling into these sins. I am honestly scared and shocked at myself. I know Allah is the Most Merciful and Forgiving, but I fear I am among those mentioned in the hadith: “I certainly know people of my nation who will come on the Day of Resurrection with good deeds like the mountains of Tihamah, but Allah will make them like scattered dust…” They worship at night as you do, yet when alone, they transgress Allah’s sacred limits. I am fully aware that Allah sees everything and the angels record everything. I am very engaged in my faith: I lower my gaze, do not shake hands with women. But this one particular temptation keeps getting to me. Some might say, “Keep yourself busy.” I am very busy: •\t40h work week •\t4-5 gym sessions per week •\tCooking •\tSpending time with family •\tReading Quran daily. Watching Islamic lectures. •\tPraying at the mosque every evening What makes me even sadder is that I thought I was ready for marriage. I am stable in life and in deen alhamdulilah. But now I fear I that I may not be worthy of a pious wife. To be clear, I am not addicted. The last 2 years, maybe I’ve watched corn and mastuurbated on 9 days. That’s just 1% of my last 2 years. There are lots of good things I do. But I’m very hard on myself. For me, this one sin is outweighing all the good I do. A 27y old Muslim male should never be in the position to do this. I know for a fact that if I were married, I would never commit such acts again because my desires could then be fulfilled in a halal manner. I don’t need this filth. Alhamdulillah, I can say I’m good looking, tall. I think I need to marry, but for some reason this hasn’t happened yet. Not even close. I am looking for advice. How can I protect myself from this specific temptation? How do I strengthen my willpower so that I truly remain clean. For my feeling, I have already taken so many measures. I have unfollowed women and celebrities I used to follow, even blocked them, so that I am not exposed to them in any way. I pray 5 times a day, I read Quran, I perform my morning and evening adhkars. I go to the mosque, to the gym. And the worst part of all: I have even sworn twice by Allah that I would NEVER do it again. And that is what hurts me the most—that even that was not enough. Am I weak? Or is Shaytaan just too strong? I’m planning to do Kaffarah. Because I trangressed and broke my oath. Should I completely delete Twitter and Instagram?I also use these platforms for Islamic purposes, but whenever I have the urge, I find myself searching for this filth on them. And of course, I cannot completely block corn websites. This is having a huge mental and spiritual impact on me.",

We agree to obey our leader (emir). However, we will give our opinion if something needs to be said—and sometimes it’s needed. For example, an Imam is sometimes corrected by a follower during prayer. During prayer, we are led by our Imam, but if necessary, the follower can correct the Imam. There could be a mistake in the prayer or a verse—it happens.” An Imam, being human, can make mistakes in prayer, so a follower may correct him. The Imam shouldn’t feel upset being corrected, provided it's valid. Why? Because his prayer will be rectified. Follower in prayer should be comfortable in correcting the imam because it’s their prayer as well. Above is a good example for marriage; a husband shouldn’t feel upset being advised and corrected, provided it is valid. Why? Because it’s his marriage that will benefit. A wife should be comfortable advising her husband because it’s her marriage that will benefit.",

      "content_preview": "Salaam Reddit, as the title says I reverted to Islam about 6 months ago Alhumdulillah. I am a 25 year old American man. I have a daughter who is a year and a half old and I had been in a happy (but haram) relationship with her mother for about 3 years. For some time after reverting, I realized I was in a haram relationship and I would make dua for my partner and the rest of my family on a daily basis for them to embrace Islam as to make the relationship halal. However, I came to a realization about two weeks ago that I couldn’t continue the haram with my child’s mother just hoping she’d embrace Islam. The dynamic of our relationship had to change, she spent some time with her family for about a week while I thought some things over and we reached an understanding that for the wellbeing of our child, we can continue living together for the time being. I live with my mother and 4 siblings (I don't \"live with my parents\" in the sense that I'm under their guardianship, I'm the head of the household and I provide for my family), so I'm still following the rule of not being alone with a woman that isn't my wife. We stay in different rooms and sleep in different beds, we don't reveal our bodies to each other, etc. I still have love for her and I pray every day that she embraces Islam, I’m constantly offering to teach her about Islam and I’ve at least made enough progress to turn her mind from agnosticism to acknowledging that there is in fact a god. But I’ve come to the conclusion that I can’t just hope she reverts and place all my bets on that alone. I need to be open to the idea that I may need to seek out someone else to marry, as much as it pains me. I drive trucks for a living, so my plan is to go over the road in the coming weeks to further separate myself from the relationship. I still provide financially for my household but once I ensure that they are in a stable environment independent of me, I plan to plant my flag in a new place on my own inshallah. I guess my question is, what should the relationship between a Muslim man and his non Muslim baby mother look like? If I find a wife, would it be offensive to her if I spent time with my daughter and my baby mother at the same time? Would it be haram to keep in communication with her? She never worked while we were together, but she’s working on getting a job now. Is it offensive to provide for her financially in the mean time? I have so so many questions on the matter and they are not easily answered by a quick ask on deenbuddy or islamqa or anything like that. It’s a tremendously difficult situation to be in, I have no immediate Muslim family members here to help me, and I look like such a villain to our mutual acquaintances. I’m just trying to do what’s right in the sight of Allah but it’s so hard. I just wanted to marry her and live happily ever after, be a good father and husband, but it looks like for now that’s not what’s in store for me. Please, just any advice.",

      "content_preview": "1. You feel shame, not arrogance, after sin: Disobedience hurts you. You hide it, regret it, and feel unworthy. That means your heart is still soft and soft hearts are beloved to Allah. The truly lost are those who sin and feel nothing. 2. Your overthinking includes Allah: Even your doubts, your fears, your “What if He’s angry?” thoughts, they all revolve around Him. That means you’re still God-conscious. You’re still trying. Shaytan wants you to mistake self-awareness for distance from Allah. 3. You feel calm after crying to Him: Even if you’re still unsure, there’s a deep sigh, a tiny relief after du’a. That’s not just emotion it’s acceptance. A sign He heard you. Allah says: “Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.” (Qur’an 13:28) 4. You still experience moments of peace that come out of nowhere: Maybe during a walk, in the quiet of Fajr, when you hear Qur’an, or during sujood. That random moment of ease in the chaos? That’s not random. That’s from Allah (swt). 5. Certain ayahs or du’as seem like they’re speaking directly to your situation: You’re struggling, and suddenly the exact words you needed find you. That’s Allah’s way of responding before you even ask. 6. You still call Him “Ya Allah” and not “O God.”: You say His name. The name of love. Of closeness. Even in weakness, you recognize who to turn to. 7. You feel like your trials are waking you up, not destroying you: If your heartbreak or hardship is bringing you closer, softening you, pulling you to du’a, that’s not punishment. That’s divine recalibration. 8. Your faith rises after you fall: Sin makes you want to purify yourself. Distance makes you want to return. That means you haven’t been rejected, you’re still invited. 9. He lets you want Him: Desire for Allah is a gift, not something you manufacture on your own. “You would not have been able to guide yourself if Allah had not guided you.” (Qur’an 28:56) Jazakallahu khairan to @deenlyyours on tiktok for making this",

      "content_preview": "So it's been 2 years and my family thinks I'm gay. They've insinuated that, but they've never told me this to my face. You know, passive aggressive remarks. But i've never been told this to my face. It started about two years ago. I'm a digital nomad so I travel a lot. So once I posted in a subreddit of a city i went to, asking about it...If anyone wants to meet up, any other digital nomads there etc. Turns out the city was an attraction for gay people. And someone replied saying \"Dude, the blue chairs on the beach are for gay people... Not sure how people / tourists are supposed to know that.\" I replied \"oh lol.... thx for letting me know\". In other words, the guy was warning me to avoid the blue chairs and i thanked him for making me aware of that. This was the top comment. Then there were other comments saying \"hey this is a city for gay people etc...\" - in fact most of the comments were of that nature. I didn't know that. I had no idea until I arrived. Well, few days later i got my phone stolen. So my family was looking for me everywhere and my brother knows my reddit account so he checked that to find out about my whereabouts and he saw that post. I think they took that \"thanks for letting me know\" literally, as in I was thanking him for the info so I can use those chairs? My family has never spoken to me about that post. My aunt told me this a few days ago (almost 2 years later), that my brother saw something on a website called reddit. I have no idea. So i went back to a 2 years and it turns out the start of these passive aggressive comments coincide with that post. They must have checked it when I was unresponsive. Problem is, what am I suppose to do now? If I try to explain the situation, I will only seem more guilty. But if I don't, these comments will continue. Like what am I suppose to do? call a \"I'm not gay, guys. Let me explain\" meeting? Like how absurd is that?",

With my ex we wanted to wait a year before getting parents properly involved, which at the time I thought was good time to get to know each other. Obviously it was haram so it didn’t work now. Now I started to speak to a man again, we’ve only had a few calls so far and he wants to speak to my father soon about wanting to get to know me for marriage. I know I should be happy he wants to keep this as halal and respectful as possible but I am getting anxious. He is also a different ethnicity from me so I don’t want to deal with the things my parents will say without me even fully knowing if I want to marry this man. I’m not sure if I should spend more time getting to know him alone. Or let him speak to my parents about his intention to get to know me. Is this moving all too fast? Don’t know how I can be sure of his intention ahhhh I’m so stressed out.",

      "content_preview": "Sorry to re touch this topic again for the 100th time but I have been seeing a lot of post regarding women which lack nuance here. Zina is one of the worst sins in Islam and no muslims should do it but we are all afterall humans and yes “zaniyans” (?) can change and improve. Edit : adding a hadith here which I forgot to add the before. حَدَّثَنَا الْحَسَنُ بْنُ الصَّبَّاحِ، حَدَّثَنَا إِسْحَاقُ الأَزْرَقُ، حَدَّثَنَا عَوْفٌ، عَنِ الْحَسَنِ، وَابْنِ، سِيرِينَ عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ \"‏ غُفِرَ لاِمْرَأَةٍ مُومِسَةٍ مَرَّتْ بِكَلْبٍ عَلَى رَأْسِ رَكِيٍّ يَلْهَثُ، قَالَ كَادَ يَقْتُلُهُ الْعَطَشُ، فَنَزَعَتْ خُفَّهَا، فَأَوْثَقَتْهُ بِخِمَارِهَا، فَنَزَعَتْ لَهُ مِنَ الْمَاءِ، فَغُفِرَ لَهَا بِذَلِكَ ‏\"‏‏.‏ Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because, passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of that.\" Sahih al-Bukhari 3321 I will share a story of an acquaintance here. She was my classmate and also my neighbour. Was in a serious relationship with a polytheist since 6th grade apparently, also committed zina. It was an open secret but late they broke up, I won’t share a lot of details why but it was due to many reasons and one of the reasons was her defending muslims from Islamophobia (I know this cus I was partially involved in causing her breakup 💀). She wasn’t religious before, not at all but after this she sincerely repented, now wears her identity proudly and even started wearing hijab, only has muslim friends etc etc. Yes, everybody has their own preference, there is no denying in this but pls don’t think just cus somebody committed zina cus of their lack of knowledge probably, it means they are not a human and deserves to be slandered right and left.  People CAN and do change. Even many enemies of the prophet changed. You can’t takfir somebody if they have made genuine repentance. Allah forgives and guides the lost. Edit : I’m NOT defending Zina. As I said its one of the biggest sins in Islam for BOTH men and women so don’t only blame women but people do change. Allah is the most merciful and most forgiving out of all. Even Abu Sufiyan, a polytheist who oppressed muslims changed and embraced Islam. No muslim would abuse Abu Sufiyan now. So why can’t a teen?",

      "content_preview": "I have a few questions: Is it true that the Hajar al-Aswad turned black due to absorbing the sins of humankind? Did Hazrat Aisha (RA) oppose Hazrat Ali (RA) and lead a campaign against him? If so, why? What was Hazrat Aisha's (RA) age at the time of her marriage? There are varying accounts (6-9 and 17-18). Which is considered the more accurate account? For each question, please include relevant Hadith and Quranic references. As a Sunni Muslim, I would appreciate responses that avoid sectarian perspectives or potential conflicts.",
