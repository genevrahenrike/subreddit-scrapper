Not only does it make the room tidier, it has reduced the amount of clothes in limbo significantly. I often would forget about the clothes I wanted to wear again (groggy in the mornings) so they would pile up, but now I have a designated spot for them I pretty much use them again right away and they just go in the hamper afterwards!",

I often have people ask how I'm seemingly always in a decent mood. So thought I'd share some advice to others.Life is full of tasks we should do, or need to do, but are unappealing for whatever reason.Thebestway to overcome this is to have something waiting at the end that's worth waiting for. I'm incredibly food motivated and love to be outdoors, so I tend to have a tasty snack waiting and/or an outdoor activity. Also, I love my pets so sometimes it's literally just that I'm going to watch a movie with my pets.Instead of thinking \"Ughh I have to go to work\" try to reframe your mindset into \"When I get off work later I have x y or z waiting for me!\"Find what makes you happy and reward yourself. I feel like this is why i still have so many hobbies at 35 as well. Just making time to reward myself with things I enjoy doing.It's just a simple switch of mindset and incorporating things into your life to increase your quality of life. It's a cycle that gets better and better as it's reinforced repeatedly.Sometimes the reward is literally a nap. And that's OK! But balancing the daunting with the desirable is key.",

Your knees should be at roughly 90 degrees, and your thighs parallel to the ground. Now here's the part most people miss - when your arms are relaxed at your sides, your elbows should also be at 90 degrees when your hands reach the keyboard.If your desk is too high after adjusting your chair properly (super common), you might need a footrest rather than raising your chair and letting your feet dangle. Dangling feet = lower back strain over time.Been helping people optimize their workspaces for years, and these simple tweaks have helped more people than any expensive equipment ever could.",

Turns out we’d occasionally dump a fairly large amount of ice from the ice maker into the stainless steel sink. Guess what? Didn’t leak, but it did cause the sink to condense enough underneath to drip a noticeable amount of water. Felt silly when I figured it out but also happy I did! (I lived most of my life in a very dry area, usually no condensation even on glasses of iced tea. Now we’re on the west coast)",

Unable to check our suitcases, we had to miss our flight and book later in the day. The tickets were non-refundable, without travel insurance, and could no longer be rebooked BUT after calling the airline (in this case Eurowings), we were able to get a refund on the Taxes, as well as Airport Charges and Fees. This came out to be 47% of what we originally paid and made missing our flight suck a little bit less.Note that the Airline won't do this automatically for you and this needs to be requested. This also depends on what Country and Airline you are flying on. For example: Ryanair is notorious for making this process difficult by charging a fee, which often is close to or exceeds the taxes to be refunded.",

      "content_preview": "I always thought that once a piece of clothing picked up dye from another item in the wash, it was ruined for good, especially if it wasn’t just plain white, but already had other colors in the design.Turns out, products like Vanish Oxi Action (a colour-safe oxygen bleach) can actually lift the “runaway” dye off the fabric while leaving the original colors intact. The trick is that the original factory-applied dyes are chemically bonded to the fibers, while the accidental dye transfer is only loosely sitting on the surface.Pro Tip: don’t let the garment dry once you notice the dye transfer: drying (especially with heat) sets the unwanted color permanently. Instead, soak it right away in Oxi, rinse in cold water, and run a delicate wash. If there’s still some staining left, you can repeat the process in short soaks until the white parts clear up.This happened to me with a brand new dress I accidentally washed with a red shirt, and thanks to ChatGPT I found a fix that actually worked.",
