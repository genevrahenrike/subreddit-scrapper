Your knees should be at roughly 90 degrees, and your thighs parallel to the ground. Now here's the part most people miss - when your arms are relaxed at your sides, your elbows should also be at 90 degrees when your hands reach the keyboard.If your desk is too high after adjusting your chair properly (super common), you might need a footrest rather than raising your chair and letting your feet dangle. Dangling feet = lower back strain over time.Been helping people optimize their workspaces for years, and these simple tweaks have helped more people than any expensive equipment ever could.",

More importantly, I’ve seen how this subreddit has connected people all over the world through simple, practical advice. It’s been a privilege to help guide that process and ensure the community stayed true to its purpose.None of this would have been possible without all of you, the contributors who keep the spirit of LPT alive, the readers who carry these tips into the real world, and of course, my fellow moderators who will continue to steer this subreddit into the future.While I’ll no longer be serving as lead moderator, I’ll always be cheering this community on from the sidelines.

Not only does it make the room tidier, it has reduced the amount of clothes in limbo significantly. I often would forget about the clothes I wanted to wear again (groggy in the mornings) so they would pile up, but now I have a designated spot for them I pretty much use them again right away and they just go in the hamper afterwards!",

      "content_preview": "man i used to end every day staring at my laptop like, Wait… what did I even do today? There were a ton of things going in office like10 diff meetings to attend, 10 Slack pings, a pile of emails, what did they talk in the meeting about basically not being able to cartch up on any of it maybe because i was ditsracted sometimes even zoning out or just being severly overwhelmed with work and somehow my actual work was still sitting there untouched. By the time I logged off, I was too tired to cook, too exhausted to even scroll ig reels without zoning out. I honestly thought this was just… adult life. Work drains you, you deal with it.One small thing I tried (out of desperation honestly) was forcing a reset after meetings.I started puttingmini reset pointsinto my day. Like actually forcing myself to walk away from my desk for 3 minutes after a call. No scrolling, no checking emails could be just to pause and take few minutes off just for drinking water, stretching, even staring out the window.I alsostoppedwriting those giant everything I need to do in life to-do lists. Now I pick 3 things for the day. Just 3. If I finish those, cool I’ll do more. If not, at least I don’t feel like I failed before I even started. Still figuring it out for meetings and not to zone tf out but yea noting down helps and makes u remeber for a longer run. A better one is yet to be figured out.Try to do something youactually enjoyat the end of the day. I know you’re usually exhausted, but giving yourself that little thing you love makes the next day so much easier to face. Could be anything changing into your comfy clothes, cooking some home cooked meal warms and fresh (or just ordering in), watching a show, or having a deep late-night chat with a friend. For me, it’s been binging The Summer I Turned Pretty 😅.But through this the results for me were insane honestly. It’s wild how much better you feel when you stop treating your workday like a marathor or something you’re supposed to win. If you’re in that drained all-the-time cycle, try this. Dumb simple, but it legit gave me my evenings (and my sanity) back.",

      "content_preview": "I hear people saying things like \"I have to do x y or z but I don't want to.\" Putting time of their lives they'll never get back due to dread. I often have people ask how I'm seemingly always in a decent mood. So thought I'd share some advice to others.Life is full of tasks we should do, or need to do, but are unappealing for whatever reason.Thebestway to overcome this is to have something waiting at the end that's worth waiting for. I'm incredibly food motivated and love to be outdoors, so I tend to have a tasty snack waiting and/or an outdoor activity. Also, I love my pets so sometimes it's literally just that I'm going to watch a movie with my pets.Instead of thinking \"Ughh I have to go to work\" try to reframe your mindset into \"When I get off work later I have x y or z waiting for me!\"Find what makes you happy and reward yourself. I feel like this is why i still have so many hobbies at 35 as well. Just making time to reward myself with things I enjoy doing.It's just a simple switch of mindset and incorporating things into your life to increase your quality of life. It's a cycle that gets better and better as it's reinforced repeatedly.Sometimes the reward is literally a nap. And that's OK! But balancing the daunting with the desirable is key.",

If I feel too tired to do tidying or cleaning, I at least keep the floors clean, and run my yeedi robot vacuum once a day to make sure the floors stay clear and I don’t step on crumbs in the carpet.

      "content_preview": "I used to think my 9–5 was the problem. Like, oh if I just switch jobs or get a cooler role, I’ll stop feeling like a ded person.(I am alive but i am ded). But nah… I realized it wasn’t just the 8 hours at work killing me, it was how I was coming home withzero energy left to actually live and do anything that i loved. I hated how my entire day was basically: wake - work - crash - repeat. Nodding my head during meetings and not able to catch up on anything then regretting it later, also No “me” time, no actual living. Just existing.You know that feeling when you walk in your room dump your bag, and suddenly it’s just scrolling, Netflix, maybe reheating something and boom it’s midnight already? That’s been me for years. It hit me one day that my job isn’t stealing my time… I’m kinda handing it over on the same schedulee.Honestly, I’ve been trying to figure out how to not feel completely fried after work, and a couple little things actually helped me (sharing in case it helps someone else too):Commute was for my recharge time. I used to just doomscroll or stress on the way back, but lately I treat it like transition/chill time. Sometimes I put on a podcast, sometimes just zone out looking out the window. Weirdly, I reach home with a little bit of mental battery left instead of being fully dead inside.Meetings hack. Not every damn meeting needs to be a meeting. Half the time I straight up ask, Can this just be an email or Slack message? And writing things down it helps sometimes, even thoughts it's a lot to catch up. Still figuring it tho.Post work ritual. I don’t do anything fancy, just change into comfy clothes, light a candle, maybe go for a short walk. It’s like telling my brain yo, work’s over.Makes a bigger difference than I expected.One fun non-negotiable thing. Even if I’m tired af, I try to doonething I actually enjoy like completing my novel, make myself ramen, or calling a friend. Otherwise life just starts feeling like an endless cycle of work then sleep then repeat.Not saying this fixes burnout or anything, but these little changess made my evenings feel less miserable.",

If you jump straight into giving advice when they only wanted to talk, it can come across as dismissive. On the other hand, if you only listen when they hoped for guidance, they may feel unsupported. Asking whether they want advice or just someone to listen clears up the guesswork, avoids misunderstandings, and shows that you respect their needs.",

Didn’t leak, but it did cause the sink to condense enough underneath to drip a noticeable amount of water. Felt silly when I figured it out but also happy I did!

The tickets were non-refundable, without travel insurance, and could no longer be rebooked BUT after calling the airline (in this case Eurowings), we were able to get a refund on the Taxes, as well as Airport Charges and Fees. This came out to be 47% of what we originally paid and made missing our flight suck a little bit less.Note that the Airline won't do this automatically for you and this needs to be requested. This also depends on what Country and Airline you are flying on. For example: Ryanair is notorious for making this process difficult by charging a fee, which often is close to or exceeds the taxes to be refunded.",
