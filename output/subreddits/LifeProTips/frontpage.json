Your knees should be at roughly 90 degrees, and your thighs parallel to the ground. Now here's the part most people miss - when your arms are relaxed at your sides, your elbows should also be at 90 degrees when your hands reach the keyboard.If your desk is too high after adjusting your chair properly (super common), you might need a footrest rather than raising your chair and letting your feet dangle. Dangling feet = lower back strain over time.Been helping people optimize their workspaces for years, and these simple tweaks have helped more people than any expensive equipment ever could.",

      "content_preview": "I hear people saying things like \"I have to do x y or z but I don't want to.\" Putting time of their lives they'll never get back due to dread. I often have people ask how I'm seemingly always in a decent mood. So thought I'd share some advice to others.Life is full of tasks we should do, or need to do, but are unappealing for whatever reason.Thebestway to overcome this is to have something waiting at the end that's worth waiting for. I'm incredibly food motivated and love to be outdoors, so I tend to have a tasty snack waiting and/or an outdoor activity. Also, I love my pets so sometimes it's literally just that I'm going to watch a movie with my pets.Instead of thinking \"Ughh I have to go to work\" try to reframe your mindset into \"When I get off work later I have x y or z waiting for me!\"Find what makes you happy and reward yourself. I feel like this is why i still have so many hobbies at 35 as well. Just making time to reward myself with things I enjoy doing.It's just a simple switch of mindset and incorporating things into your life to increase your quality of life. It's a cycle that gets better and better as it's reinforced repeatedly.Sometimes the reward is literally a nap. And that's OK! But balancing the daunting with the desirable is key.",

      "content_preview": "man i used to end every day staring at my laptop like, Wait… what did I even do today? There were a ton of things going in office like10 diff meetings to attend, 10 Slack pings, a pile of emails, what did they talk in the meeting about basically not being able to cartch up on any of it maybe because i was ditsracted sometimes even zoning out or just being severly overwhelmed with work and somehow my actual work was still sitting there untouched. By the time I logged off, I was too tired to cook, too exhausted to even scroll ig reels without zoning out. I honestly thought this was just… adult life. Work drains you, you deal with it.One small thing I tried (out of desperation honestly) was forcing a reset after meetings.I started puttingmini reset pointsinto my day. Like actually forcing myself to walk away from my desk for 3 minutes after a call. No scrolling, no checking emails could be just to pause and take few minutes off just for drinking water, stretching, even staring out the window.I alsostoppedwriting those giant everything I need to do in life to-do lists. Now I pick 3 things for the day. Just 3. If I finish those, cool I’ll do more. If not, at least I don’t feel like I failed before I even started. Still figuring it out for meetings and not to zone tf out but yea noting down helps and makes u remeber for a longer run. A better one is yet to be figured out.Try to do something youactually enjoyat the end of the day. I know you’re usually exhausted, but giving yourself that little thing you love makes the next day so much easier to face. Could be anything changing into your comfy clothes, cooking some home cooked meal warms and fresh (or just ordering in), watching a show, or having a deep late-night chat with a friend. For me, it’s been binging The Summer I Turned Pretty 😅.But through this the results for me were insane honestly. It’s wild how much better you feel when you stop treating your workday like a marathor or something you’re supposed to win. If you’re in that drained all-the-time cycle, try this. Dumb simple, but it legit gave me my evenings (and my sanity) back.",

      "content_preview": "I used to think my 9–5 was the problem. Like, oh if I just switch jobs or get a cooler role, I’ll stop feeling like a ded person.(I am alive but i am ded). But nah… I realized it wasn’t just the 8 hours at work killing me, it was how I was coming home withzero energy left to actually live and do anything that i loved. I hated how my entire day was basically: wake - work - crash - repeat. Nodding my head during meetings and not able to catch up on anything then regretting it later, also No “me” time, no actual living. Just existing.You know that feeling when you walk in your room dump your bag, and suddenly it’s just scrolling, Netflix, maybe reheating something and boom it’s midnight already? That’s been me for years. It hit me one day that my job isn’t stealing my time… I’m kinda handing it over on the same schedulee.Honestly, I’ve been trying to figure out how to not feel completely fried after work, and a couple little things actually helped me (sharing in case it helps someone else too):Commute was for my recharge time. I used to just doomscroll or stress on the way back, but lately I treat it like transition/chill time. Sometimes I put on a podcast, sometimes just zone out looking out the window. Weirdly, I reach home with a little bit of mental battery left instead of being fully dead inside.Meetings hack. Not every damn meeting needs to be a meeting. Half the time I straight up ask, Can this just be an email or Slack message? And writing things down it helps sometimes, even thoughts it's a lot to catch up. Still figuring it tho.Post work ritual. I don’t do anything fancy, just change into comfy clothes, light a candle, maybe go for a short walk. It’s like telling my brain yo, work’s over.Makes a bigger difference than I expected.One fun non-negotiable thing. Even if I’m tired af, I try to doonething I actually enjoy like completing my novel, make myself ramen, or calling a friend. Otherwise life just starts feeling like an endless cycle of work then sleep then repeat.Not saying this fixes burnout or anything, but these little changess made my evenings feel less miserable.",

PDF works in layers, and your scribble is simply on a different layer but the text is still all there.Everyone can still select the “hidden part”, copy and paste and reveal the information.Ways to really remove information from a pdf:If you pay for acrobat (so NOT Reader) you can of course actually delete the text.If you don’t have edit software, you can take screenshots of your document and then scribble the images. JPG and PNG images don’t save separate layers so the information underneath is lost. Like it would be on a physical paper. In a pinch, you can simply share the document as a set of images.If you’re a bit tech savvy, you can save the pdf as multiple images, edit the images, and then collate them back into a single pdf, with the information you didn’t want to share truly gone. GPT can also teach you how do this.If you want to see what I mean I made an example pdf:https://files.catbox.moe/fmzhru.pdfEdit to add:Some people claim “print as pdf” flattens the pdf.I read all comments and some people say it works (it “flattens” the pdf) some say it doesn’t.Some even said you can “unflatten” pdfs.My guess is that each implementation is different so I won’t trust this solution. I tested on iOS and it does NOT flatten the pdf.I’ll stick to what I’m 100% sure works.PDF -> PNG -> PDF",

The tickets were non-refundable, without travel insurance, and could no longer be rebooked BUT after calling the airline (in this case Eurowings), we were able to get a refund on the Taxes, as well as Airport Charges and Fees. This came out to be 47% of what we originally paid and made missing our flight suck a little bit less.Note that the Airline won't do this automatically for you and this needs to be requested. This also depends on what Country and Airline you are flying on. For example: Ryanair is notorious for making this process difficult by charging a fee, which often is close to or exceeds the taxes to be refunded.",

That single seat now looks taken, so you can buy the 2 seats you actually want. •\tAfter checkout, just let the single-seat cart expire.I tried this and it worked perfectly—it should work on most ticket sites that use this rule.TL;DR: Put the “lonely” seat in your cart on one browser, then buy your actual seats in another.",

      "content_preview": "I always thought that once a piece of clothing picked up dye from another item in the wash, it was ruined for good, especially if it wasn’t just plain white, but already had other colors in the design.Turns out, products like Vanish Oxi Action (a colour-safe oxygen bleach) can actually lift the “runaway” dye off the fabric while leaving the original colors intact. The trick is that the original factory-applied dyes are chemically bonded to the fibers, while the accidental dye transfer is only loosely sitting on the surface.Pro Tip: don’t let the garment dry once you notice the dye transfer: drying (especially with heat) sets the unwanted color permanently. Instead, soak it right away in Oxi, rinse in cold water, and run a delicate wash. If there’s still some staining left, you can repeat the process in short soaks until the white parts clear up.This happened to me with a brand new dress I accidentally washed with a red shirt, and thanks to ChatGPT I found a fix that actually worked.",

      "content_preview": "Bro, I saw this thread about screen time the other day like people literally texting each other while sitting across the table. And honestly? Same. My screen time was hitting like 6–7 hours a day, and if you asked me what I even looked at… no clue. Just endless doomscrolling, brain rotting, and somehow still bored.So, I started pulling tiny hacks. Nothing crazy.First thing I yeeted all my social apps off the home screen. Just shoved them in some random folder on the last page. And turns out… my brain’s too lazy to go find them half the time. So I just… don’t. Then I stopped touching my phone first thing in the morning. Now it’s like: wake up → make coffee → sit on the balcony → stare at trees or talk to my fam instead of scrolling. Feels way better than falling into TikTok holes at 7 a.m.And when I’m chilling with people now, I literally put my phone out of reach. Because otherwise I know myself lemme just check one thing and boom, 30 minutes gone.I literally told my roommate or mother/brother at home, that if you catch me using phone during work/study hours, call me out. At first, it was annoying, but knowing someone’s watching actually made me put the phone down faster. If you live alone, even asking a friend to check your screen time screenshot weekly works like magic.Swapping lol: I keep a book and a stress ball on my desk. Whenever my hand automatically reached for the phone, I’d grab one of those instead. Sounds silly, but it trained my brain out of the habit. Ofc not saying my life magically changed in a day or so, but trust me something is BETTER than nothing. You might not be able to do this everyday. But no worries it will surely get better by each day:)I’m not saying delete Insta, TikTok, whatever nah, keep ‘em. Just make them harder to get to. Your brain’s lazy, trust me. Sometimes I’ll swipe twice and be like “ugh, effort” and just… not open it. Sounds dumb, but it actually works.No dramatic “I’m quitting social media” post, no guilt trip. Just… less scrolling. My screen time dropped by like an hour a day without me even trying.Now my head feels less scrambled, I actuallytalkto people without zoning out, and I’m not deep-diving into random internet drama at 1 a.m. Don’t get me wrong I still fall into IG reels or YouTube shorts sometimes, I’m not a monk. But now I catch myself before I lose a whole afternoon.It’s like I finally got some of my brain back. And ngl, it feels pretty damn good.",

Sometimes I don't even get through typing the whole thing because I'm always considering how it will be taken, if I really want to be a harsh as I was, if it's going to be taken wrong, and mostly if I even care enough to bother. Sometimes it probably even helps to \"respond\" by typing up my thoughts, but it doesn't really need to go out to the world. Honestly, I feel good about my decision not to post every time I don't.Something to try...",

      "content_preview": "For four years I worked in a sales agency and then at the end of year one the new president began requiring weekly meetings of the sales staff. These meetings were fairly useless, and the worthwhile parts could be summarized in a brief email. Suggestions for sticking with an email were denied; and week after week I sat for 1-2 hours wishing to throw myself or someone else out a window.Then I had the opportunity to schedule a conflicting meeting with a prospect which would likely close the deal and turn them into a client. I explained to the president that this was the time that worked best for them, and he gave the thumbs up for me to miss the meeting. I got the client, and props from the boss man (instead of irritation for missing his meeting).The next two sales meetings I acted more engaged, but scheduled another prospect meeting to conflict with the meeting of the third week. Same result - the boss agreed to let me be absent, and then was rewarded with the fact that I made money during the time.Rinse and repeat for several months, and I gradually increased the frequency to bi-weekly conflicts, and then by year three I was attending a sales meeting only about once every other month. Even for those meetings I would often excuse myself early “for a client call”.Obviously this won’t work for a lot of careers, but maybe it can give some ideas on how to get out of idiotic, Dilbert-level meetings.To close out the story, eventually a couple coworkers and I left and opened our own sales agency; we’re killing it without mandatory sales meetings and the old place is going down the tubes.",

      "content_preview": "Just went through absolute hell with a rental company and this tip could save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. So I rented a car for a weekend trip and like always I walked around taking detailed photos of every single scratch every single dent before I even got in. I'm talking like really close ups of everything like the bumpers, doors, wheels, interior even the tiniest paint chips. The whole process took maybe 5 minutes maxWhen I returned the car they tried to charge me $800 for \"new damage\" including a scratch on the rear bumper and some scuffs on the passenger door )) I immediately pulled out my phone (I had to turn the volume off first cuz I had jackpot city in the background blasting music) and showed them the before photos proving that damage was already there when I picked it up. The manager got all flustered and tried to argue but the photos don't lie. They backed off real quick and removed all the charges. I'm still planning to take them to court because they've probably been pulling this scam on other customers who didn't have photo evidence. Document everything people cuz these companies count on you not being prepared!!",
