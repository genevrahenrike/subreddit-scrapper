Getting clients to trust me. I’d send proposals, get ghosted, follow up, and sometimes nothing would happen. It felt like shouting into the void. But slowly, I realized that freelancing isn’t about chasing. It’s about showing up where people already are, listening first, and then sharing what you can actually do for them. For those of you freelancing: what’s been your biggest challenge so far?",

I edit using Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Blender, giving me the flexibility to handle both simple motion graphics and more advanced 3D elements (3D pricing can be negotiated). For longer-form projects such as full YouTube videos, music videos, or promotional content, I offer tailored packages where we can agree on pricing based on complexity and length.

Getting clients to trust me. I’d send proposals, get ghosted, follow up, and sometimes nothing would happen. It felt like shouting into the void. But slowly, I realized that freelancing isn’t about chasing. It’s about showing up where people already are, listening first, and then sharing what you can actually do for them. For those of you freelancing: what’s been your biggest challenge so far?",

My videos always looked kinda amateur compared to others, and I thought it was just the algorithm hating me. But recently I changed up my approach, did a bunch of research on how to look more professional on camera, and… it actually worked. I finally had a couple videos take off, and this week I crossed the threshold for monetization. It feels surreal tbh. I’m not making big $$ yet, but the fact that it’s even possible is motivating me like crazy.",

      "content_preview": "Hey there, I’ve been frustrated with how current freelancing platforms work (Upwork, Fiverr, etc.). Too many proposals, too much waiting, and often clients don’t know if someone is actually good until after hiring. So I’m experimenting with a different model: A client posts a project with a budget. Freelancers just click “I’m Doing” and start working immediately (no proposals, no waiting). The client can see freelancers’ progress live (updates, screenshots, completion time). At the end, the client picks the best result → that freelancer gets paid. It’s more like a \"contest mode\" for freelancing, where skills matter more than certificates. 👉 My question: Would you (as a freelancer or client) ever try this? Do you think this model is fair, or too risky for freelancers? I put up a simple landing page to collect early feedback: https://go-work-and-earn.vercel.app Thank you :)",

I think my abilities are decent, but I'm more so looking for what others charge for website development. I'm building a custom React/Next , Java Spring application with various user management and admin management features. I've scoped out about 5-6 weeks of work. But this client is someone I go way back with and can likely score more work after, so I don't want to come in too strong . So my question for anyone who has done similar freelance work, what did you charge? I'm dealing in CAD so please let me know if it's a different currency you use! Thanks again :)",

Businesses and individuals often need help managing their accounts being on top of things like appointments and typing up stuff they dont want to. Call local businesses in your area. All you need is a few clients. If you can land just 4–5 consistent clients, you can build a reliable income stream. Just a few hours per day or week. It seems like a realistic way to earn stable income online. if you stay consistent and offer services to enough people, you’ll start getting clients quickly. https://www.myleadfin.com/articles/fiverr-gigs.html",

Now that it's done, I'm looking for web developers and sales people who may need them. I can send you an email of vetted leads very day, specific to whatever requirements you may have. All you need to do is make your pitch - I'll handle the process of  finding and vetting your leads for you. If you're interested, feel free to shoot me a DM!",
