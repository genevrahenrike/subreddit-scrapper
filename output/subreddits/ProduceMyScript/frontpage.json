      "content_preview": "Hi everyone ‚Äì Oleg from Kinolime here. I posted recently on r/ProduceMyScript about our first competition winner, but this is my first time on r/Screenwriting specifically. I've been following this community for a while, reading the discussions about the industry, the craft, the frustrations. A lot of what gets talked about here ‚Äì the gatekeeping, the formulaic approach, the way great scripts can sit in drawers for years ‚Äì is exactly why we started Kinolime. Quick context: The Waif (our first competition winner) is in pre-production with BAFTA-nominated director Stephen Fingleton. And this year, Mob Mentality by Eric Landau just won our Spring competition ‚Äì a comedy about a thirteen-year-old who believes he's the reincarnation of John Gotti. Seeing these community-chosen scripts go from votes to actual production has been everything we hoped for when we started this experiment. Now for the big news: We're officially launching our first-ever Shorts Competition . After months of requests from writers asking \"what about shorts?\" ‚Äì we listened. This isn't just a smaller version of our feature competition. We built this specifically for short-form storytelling, with real production support to get your film made. Here's the deal: 5-20 pages. Free to enter. $7,500 production grant + $500 festival fund to the winner. Same process as our features: we narrow hundreds of submissions to the top contenders, then community voting decides the winner who goes to production. We're looking for stories that grab you. The kind of shorts that make film programmers fight over them at festivals. Why shorts? Two reasons: First, we've had dozens of writers reach out asking. Second, shorts let us take bigger creative risks. Less budget pressure means we can champion weirder, bolder stories that might be too niche for a feature but absolutely perfect for 15 minutes of your time. Look, I know announcing competitions on Reddit can feel like spam. But we're not here to just post and ghost. This community has given us incredible feedback since that first post, and several of you are already active Kinolime members. We want to keep building this thing transparently. Questions? Skepticism? Fire away in the comments. I'll be here. Submit at: kinolime.com/competition Thanks for reading, and thanks for helping us figure out what comes next. ‚ÄîOleg",

      "content_preview": "Full context before the required information - I have never produced a feature (have always been in the Post Production side of things in the US) but have two potential sources of funding to produce a feature in Portugal. The two catches are 1) It will be much easier to get the funding if it takes place outside of populous regions (so cities are out) and 2) the funding mechanism can take six months or even longer, but once the first step is approved it is essentially a guarantee. To be clear - we are not competing for funding with other films, we just have to meet all the requirements. However, you would have to allow us to use your script during the application process and give us first refusal rights to use your script until the first step approval (meaning, if someone else offers you cash for it we would have a chance of counter-bidding). Of course if you want to be in on it and be part of driving it forward we would welcome that as well. -Genre: Prefer Horror / Thriller, open to other genres IF they are thrilling in their own way -Min pages: 90 -Max pages: 120 -Additional requirements (optional): Country setting, please take a look at Alentejo and other areas in Portugal to see if there is a fit -Max budget:  5M -Writer compensation (dollar amount): Negotiable, but nothing until financing is approved. -Location resources: We have pretty privileged access to large swathes of private land (think more than 500 hectares) that include rivers, small mountains, ravines, lakes, abandoned villages, medieval walkways, and even one or two neolithic dolmens. In addition we can easily access to beautiful medieval churches and historic villages. -Actor resources (with descriptions): We do not have actor resources yet. We would cast from US / UK / Portugal depending on the budget and creative. -Crew resources: TBD. We have highly capable crews in Portugal, Director / DP would probably come from the US -Gear resources: Decent budget for gear, so no Imax cameras but otherwise .... -World location: Portugal -Experience (must have proof): I have about 20 years of Post experience across advertising / film / tv / media. I am not sure what the sub requires as proof but feel free to DM me and I am happy to provide. -Goals for film (festivals, simply for practice, etc.): We want to produce and either sell to a distributor or streamer, although streaming pay is so low that we feel we have better odds through direct screen distribution. To be honest the old model is broken and everyone is trying to put a new model together, we want to be part of that change.",

Would love to see some scripts for a feature film that will be set in an office (albeit a very large office with a 360 view of the London skyline) that will need to be completed within the next 6 months as that's how long I have been told I have access to my location during the meeting this morning regarding this. All we were told was \"No blood and no explosions.\" So it will be set in a single location, within an office in London, which has a lot of smaller rooms and two distinctive areas that can be used, and we would like there to be a maximum of three characters. Ideally there would be one, possibly two, but we are willing to stretch to three if the right script finds it's way to us. With the single location and small cast, we would like the genre to be a thriller, or a horror if it does not contain a single drop of blood. So with that being said... -Genre: Horror/Thriller -Min pages: 80 -Max pages: 120 -Additional requirements (optional): Single Location -Max budget: Micro -Writer compensation (dollar amount): To be negotiated -Location resources: Office in Central London -Actor resources (with descriptions): Represented Actors -Crew resources: Full crew -Gear resources: Full kit (Sony Venice, Sony FX6 Cameras to be used on shoot) -World location: London, England -Experience (must have proof): Professional -Goals for film (festivals, simply for practice, etc.): Exposure and Sale If any of this sounds good to you, drop me a DM and I can let you know more about who we are and what we're currently up to, and planning to do moving forward in the next few years.",

TITLE The Great Big Peanut Butter Mess SHORT PAGES 14 GENRE: KIDS/FAMILY/COMEDY Hello Everyone; This past weekend I sent a query to Angel Studios. The Great Big Peanut Mess was the project. This is the email I got back. I am looking for someone who would be interested in putting a trailer together and submitting it to them. Angel Studio is opening the door. I am willing to hand off the script for a story by credit. In my query I shared that I believe this can be made into a feature. The email. [Angel] Re: Query: The Great Big Peanut Butter Mess - Family/ Kids/Comedy Dear Tim, Thank you for sharing this wonderful story idea. It definitely sounds inspiring and uplifting, and we do love that. Right now, every show that comes through Angel Studios starts with a Torch (a pilot video) submitted by a filmmaker to our Angel Guild. Then we let our Guild members vote to decide if it's a movie worth making. It would be quite exciting if a filmmaker brought this story to us! We hope someday in the future to have more options for working with stories like this. We absolutely love that you took the time to share your thoughts with us, and are very grateful to have you as a fan!! Sincerely, Talmage Customer Experience Specialist Angel Studios The Great Big Peanut Butter Mess Script. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BTgbZTXpxir3cwCcxDCK5AdKS0HIK_rF/view?usp=drivesdk",

      "content_preview": "Repost! Had some good feedback on this one that went two ways: make it darker and more violent/horror leaning, or dial it back a little. I am completely open to  full rewrites of me assisting or you just taking it and running with it.  Very small option to show commitment to the project. I‚Äôm more concerned with making the coolest version of this! Ultra low budget dark comedy with horror elements Genre: Comedy/Horror Logline: After knocking on the wrong door, two young charitable carolers must escape the literal and figurative torture of a small Christmas party filled with social politics, angry underachieving businessmen, and a wealthy, playful psychopath. Some cast and setting info below, but open to any changes - demographic, location, story, whatever - to see it come to life! Main Cast: 5 men, 4 women Settings: Suburban neighborhoods, House Interior / Exteriors, Hospital Exterior, Vehicle Interior / Exteriors Budget: It‚Äôs a bit of a guesstimate, but Ive been told by those who read it sub 200K and possibly sub 100K with creativity. And I‚Äôm open to any tweaks needed to get it lower Let me know if you wanna read and have the resources to put it together!",

      "content_preview": "Genre: Psychological Thriller / Supernatural Mystery (mix of Final Destination, Parasite, The Wailing) Logline: When a grieving family gathers after their father‚Äôs sudden death, a relentless chain of supernatural killings begins to claim them one by one. As two detectives race to uncover the truth, they unravel a decades-old blood pact that demands the lives of every child in the family ‚Äî and the only way to break it is to confront a buried secret festering inside the house before none of them are left alive. Quick Synopsis: After their father‚Äôs sudden death, five estranged siblings reunite at his funeral but death follows them home. Each week, another family member or loved one dies in bizarre, ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù ways. Investigators discover their father once made a dark pact with his brother, exchanging their bloodline for power. Now, the debt must be paid in blood. As the deaths close in, the surviving siblings and a determined detective must face a horrific truth hidden in the family home before the pact consumes them all. Ask: How can I make this logline even more attractive to a potential buyer or as a pitch? I‚Äôm torn between developing The Pact as a feature film or as a limited series. As a movie, it could be a tight, relentless two-hour ride like Final Destination. As a limited series, there‚Äôs room to deepen the family drama, stretch the tension, and explore more of the curse‚Äôs history like The Wailing or The Haunting of Hill House. For those with experience pitching or selling in this space which format do you think would make the concept more attractive to buyers? And in your opinion, which elements should I lean into most to make it stand out: the supernatural horror, the detective‚Äôs investigation, or the dysfunctional family drama?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, The Pitch: 10 years ago I began my screenwriting journey through Reddit, learning the ins and outs, do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs of the trade. I posted many scripts here on a different account, and have been fortunate enough to see a number of them get made (The Suspicion is the 3rd film listed in the sidebar). I even offered a service about 5 years ago where I offered to write scripts for filmmakers within their budget and logistical constraints to some successful results, which brings me here today. I‚Äôm starting that little business back up. I want to write your next film, project, advert, whatever it may be! I‚Äôve kept the same pricing model as it was 5 years ago, but in that time I‚Äôve had incredible experience and opportunities, and been fortunate enough to see a variety of projects get made, or have had the opportunity to work with some incredible collaborators. I‚Äôve worked professionally providing script coverage for companies like Rustic Films, hosted an interview podcast with industry professionals like Amy Seimetz and Dr. Rebekah McKendry about how scripts get made, and have written for Sesame Street, Disney, international stage productions, wrote and produced a 26-episode children‚Äôs web series for Penguin Random House, and currently have a prestige animated dark comedy short film based on an acclaimed book in post-production with festival aspirations. The Pricing: As stated, the pricing is the same as it was 5 years ago: $50 flat fee $10 per page 3 rounds of free revisions After receiving your commission request, I‚Äôll come to you with a plan of action before any money is exchanged. Here is a link to the submission form I Have Other Scripts Too! That link to the submission form is embedded in my Patreon. You do not need to be a member to request a custom script , but if you are a member, you‚Äôll receive a discount code for custom scripts , and you‚Äôll get access to my current backlog of budget-friendly scripts, and will have exclusive access to the 3-4 budget-friendly scripts I‚Äôll be posting each month. I have two up there that you can get access to just by being a FREE member! Past Tense (Drama/Sci-Fi, 11 pages) Two would-be time-travelers must face the consequences of their actions ‚Äî before they even finish building their machine. Locations Required: House (basement) Actors Required: 2 Thin Crust (Action/Comedy, 10 pages) A pizza delivery driver's life is put in danger after delivering the wrong order to a house full of criminals. Locations Required: House (INT/EXT), Car Actors Required: 3 In addition all of this, you‚Äôll have an ad-free archive of interviews with industry professionals like producer David Lawson, Jr. (The Endless, SYNCHRONIC), Amy Seimetz (Upstream Color, Sun Don‚Äôt Shine) Dr. Rebekah McKendry (Glorious, Colors of the Dark podcast), and the ability to request script coverage from me.
