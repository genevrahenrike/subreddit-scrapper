      "content_preview": "hi friends, i apologize in advance if this is very long, i‚Äôm trying to be as detailed as possible so you can offer your best advice (if you will, please üò≠) for the past almost 3 years now i‚Äôve been getting builder gel in my home state, Florida. i have had absolutely no issues with retention, easily could keep a set on for almost a month and would be fine. from my observation, my technician used either this or this . again, no issues with either product. i remained in the south for the past 6 months and the two techs i went to also used the ‚Äúzen‚Äù builder gel, again, no issues. moving northeast at this point for a job, i went to a salon for a builder gel fill in. i wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the product they were using, but within 2 weeks my nails started lifting by the cuticle. thinking the technician did the application incorrectly, i went back for a re-do and had the same issue happen. i decided to book with a private technician hoping for a different outcome. here‚Äôs what happened: the private technician said the salon used ‚Äúsoft gel‚Äù and that my nails were very weak and brittle. i did not change any habits with my hands, use new vitamins, medications, etc the private technician used a ‚Äúhard gel‚Äù but i‚Äôm unaware of what brand that was within 2 weeks, my nails started lifting again. the following set, she used the first gel i mentioned my OG tech used in the white bottle, and within two weeks, my nails began lifting again. fast forward to multiple sets, trial and error, there still hasn‚Äôt been any improvement and the set i got now two weeks ago is lifting once again. my technician and i are at a complete loss of what‚Äôs going on & i‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs tried researching any solutions on how to fix the issue. so here i am, reaching out for my own curiosity and to hopefully relay some tips to her that we can try to help fix the issue. at this point, i almost just want to take my nails off & just get a gel manicure but i‚Äôm worried the same thing is going to happen. i‚Äôve also enjoyed having long, ‚Äúnatural‚Äù nails and the ease builder gel brings to growing them out, so the thought of going short again makes me sad but at this point i don‚Äôt know what else to do. please, if you have any ideas or have experienced the same issues with any of your clients, let me know what helped. i‚Äôd be so grateful to you. üò≠",

I reached out to see if there was any additional warranty with the manufacturer since it started falling apart inside and not able to charge anymore. I was really nice and just asked if I needed to buy a new one or if there was a warranty I didn‚Äôt see. But the customer care agent was really rude and even cursed in her response. I have NEVER experienced this type of customer service before from the nail industry and I was really shocked. I just wanted to see if there are others who have experienced very unprofessional customer care from Zilla before. She could‚Äôve just said ‚Äúno sorry you have to buy a new one‚Äù and it wouldn‚Äôt have been a big deal. I know the nail industry you can‚Äôt get a lot of refunds or their warranties are usually very limited. I never expect free stuff, but if they are advertising that it‚Äôs high quality and at a high price then yeah I‚Äôm just going to double check if there‚Äôs any other warranty. It never means you have to be rude to your customers. If you‚Äôd like the screenshots just message me and I‚Äôll happily send them over. I will be reaching out to the CEO about their customer service and how they should not have to curse at their customers for asking questions.",

I've already put up with a lot of bs, but this is the final straw. Last week I was cleaning the salon. Found mouse poop everywhere. The owner's are lucky no clients saw it and reported them. I took photos and informed my boss. All he did was put up one mouse trap. I had to clean the poop myself. That's already irritating, but my main issue is that I found a piece of poop on top of, and in one of the tubs of masque that we use on clients. We usually portion it out into deli cups to use for the clients. The basket that holds these deli cups also had mouse poop in it. I bag up all of those, and take the tub and put it outside to be thrown out. My coworkers made it seem like I was blowing it out of proportion, or wasting product. I didn't care, I just said this is a biohazard, throw it out. I came back to work today. They kept all of it, have used it on clients!! I'm disgusted and appalled. I feel like I should report this. But I can't afford to lose my job. I'm at a complete loss of what to do. Does anyone have advice on who I could report this too? I feel like I got to regardless of the risk.",

I would expect this to be the opposite because I apply my acrylics to my right hand with my non-dominant hand so it‚Äôs not as skilled. On my left hand I‚Äôm lucky if it lasts a week. Here‚Äôs what I do for prep- Push back cuticles, cut away any dead skin. File nails with a 180/100 grit file, until the shiny layer is gone making sure to really get the sides and cuticle area because that is where most of my lifting happens. Wipe off any dust with rubbing alcohol or acetone Dehydrater then primer, usually apply both of these twice Any idea why I have such amazing retention on my dominant hand, but horrible retention on my left hand? I know 2+ weeks doesn‚Äôt sound like great retention but I am VERY rough on my hands as I work out and do a lot of labor work, I have been to countless nail salons and private nail techs and they never last more than 2 weeks. It might be helpful to add that I do have a bit of a nail biting habit, so when I have acrylics I tend to chew on my left hand more than my right, dominant hand",

The owner charges me low rent and is pretty accommodating but I do feel like he is a little opinionated on the services I provide and how much I charge. He has helped promote me so I don't rock the boat to much when it comes to these opinions. I have been licensed for about two years now and am financially stable enough from other jobs I've had in the past to consider being a nail tech as my passion job (job I love doing but if I stopped tomorrow nothing would change for me financially). I love doing nails but am thinking of quitting because sometimes I feel like it isn't yielding much success. I've had issues with retention (clients and nail sets). I've done multiple trainings and certifications but am still very slow. I get enough clients most weeks to either break even for booth rent or make $100-$200 a week. The constant promoting and marketing to try to get clients is draining me...I know I'm all over the place with this but I guess what I'm wondering is for any nail techs who have taken a break or quit, what was your breaking point and did/do you regret quitting?",

Nails have been a passion of mine, however, in cos school the curriculum was more geared towards hair than anything. On clients, all we did was basic mani/pedi and gel manis. No acrylics except stateboard prep so that means we also never learned the Efile. I recently got a new one and she is pretty powerful. I think i overfiled my natural nails which sucks because they feel sore af. :( Can someone give me pointers? what helped you learn efile the best on your own? I'm very hands on with my learning style. I definitely do not want to hurt clients. I'm also open to any other pointers you have from someone just starting out! Thanks in advance!",

This also happens with builder gel fills only I always think i get all the lifting off when doing gel fills, and i dehydrate and prime too with non acid primer. I do full removals if there is excessive lifting as well to eliminate risk. most my regulars come in every 3-4 weeks is there anything else i can do? should I switch to acid based primer to eliminate lifting? i feel like no matter how careful i am, i always worry about potentially giving a client a greenie now.",

My chronic illness was extremely down hill and I had to stop working all together. Recently I decided to get back into the career I wanted to do. In cosmetology school they don't go over nails hardly at all (from my school at least) And now I'm working in a salon as a intern giving our free services to practice again Iv asked the owner maybe I should take classes or go nail technician school but not do the license part. She said she would writw down all the steps I would need to do I don't know how to do acrylics at all, I know good enough for gels but I'm not the greatest, I'm ok at dips. I don't have anyone near me to actually teach me what I'm looking for. I understand hand on experience is the best but I'm mainly doing the basic pedicure and manicure over and over. People keep asking for other services I don't know how to do. I'm not sure what to do. One hand I get hand on experience practiceing On the other I don't know the stuff I need to do for a average nail technician. I watch videos constantly. I only get to practice 2 times a week at the salon I work another job and I can't cut it out of my life. I feel stuck. With my chronic I'll I feel so tired after working 3-4 days a week for 10-12 hours at my other job And now 2 days at the salon. I'm not sure how to even fit in time to practice at home. What would y'all advice be? I genuinely feel so stressed and overwhelmed I don't know what to do.",

      "content_preview": "One of the few splurges I have for myself is a gel manicure every twoish weeks. I've seen the same gal off and on for a few years now. Having my nails done also keeps me from picking at my cuticles which I do have a tendency to do thanks to ADHD and anxiety. The tech I see is aware of my picking and she's keen on cleaning up if product does get on my skin, she also knows that I'm less inclined to pick if we keep to a natural color and I rarely actually ask for a color so she just uses pink gel and cures etc etc. I make sure to use gloves when I'm washing dishes etc etc. This summer barely a week after my appointment, I've had several start lifting at the tips and I do try to leave them alone but it'll get caught in my hair and such. I've even resorted to using nail glue which I've noticed might be reacting negatively to the gel and might be leading to more lifting and such. I have mentioned it to her, but after several times mentioning it and still having the same issue I can't help but wonder if another product would be better. I trust her experience and even have friends and family that see her as well but I'm getting very frustrated with what I am beginning to feel is becoming a waste of time and money, which I don't care for doing either. I'm seriously wondering if perhaps I need to find someone else but that's also a process I'd rather not endure, also thanks to ADHD and anxiety... Any thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "I am not a nail tech and would love some wisdom from folks who are. I‚Äôve been getting gel nails for several years now for work and I generally have nice almond-shaped nails. I also compete in dog sports and work to keep my nails just short enough that they don‚Äôt break easily although it‚Äôs always a risk. About a year and a half ago, I started noticing my nail salon using what I think are called e-file machines. My nail techs used to just use Emory boards to take off the top coat of the gel polish and then let them soak and then more Emory board to get the paint off. That was always fine with me and gave me good results. The first time the e-file was used, I had three painfully, jagged broken nails the next day and the manicure itself had burned while it was happening. I just cut off every last bit of extra nail and bandaged over the parts that bled. I had a few similar experiences after this with different techs before I just started insisting that I wasn‚Äôt ok with the e-file being used. Yesterday, I made the same ask as always and I could tell this put my nail tech in a rush which I felt bad about but there‚Äôs no point in getting a manicure that‚Äôs supposed to last a couple weeks, if my nails are too thin to hold up. I was watching whatever they had on tv when I looked down and realized he‚Äôd soaked the polish off, Emory-boarded the old paint off and was absolutely going to town with elbow grease on the top layer of my nail with the Emory board. I pulled back and asked him to please go easy as I wanted to make sure my nails didn‚Äôt break. There was a bit of a language barrier and he continued to do this for each nail and I gave up communicating. My question is, is it standard practice to just keep filing off the top layer of nail? Does this generally make the manicure last longer or is there another purpose to doing this? When I‚Äôm asking them to stop am I asking them to essentially do something that‚Äôs against their training? Finally, how long should I allot for soak-off for the old gel to fully fall off so that very limited filing has to be done and we can preserve as much nail as possible? I have no problem sitting and waiting for my nails to soak while other clients are taken care of but I want to make sure I‚Äôm not butting up against closing times. TL;DR: E-files have ripped up my nails in the past and it seems like even when they‚Äôre not used, techs try to file off a ton of actual nail- not just old polish. What gives and how do I communicate better ?",

She said, ‚ÄúWill you have to dremmel off my nails with that thing???‚Äù Like babes, if we change our connotation of words it won‚Äôt sound as scary.

      "content_preview": "I had a really bad experience at this nail salon today I went to for the first and last time. A few things happened to me and others but there were two instances in particular I was unhappy about. During my pedicure, the technician told me that my legs were so hairy. She pointed to different parts of my legs and pointed out how much hair there was (I‚Äôm female and shave every so often due to personal preference and an injury, but honestly it shouldn‚Äôt matter whether a female has body hair or not). I asked what the issue was and she just kept going on about how hairy my legs were (which really aren‚Äôt as I shaved last week). That made me really embarrassed. Later she finished the top coat of my toes and immediately had me walk  and some of the toes got ruined, so she got mad at me for not being careful enough (I usually am told to wait a moment or two before moving to help them dry). What really irked me is that when she was doing my fingers, she was pushing her tool on this area of my finger that hurt. I pulled my hand away and said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs hurting me.‚Äù She grabbed my hand back and did the same thing, and I told her once again how it hurt and I didn‚Äôt want her doing that. She started arguing with me but a bunch of other patrons were staring. When I paid I wrote 0 on the tip and she told me I forgot to tip. I said I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving a tip as she made unnecessary comments about my body in front of people and kept doing something that I told her hurt and asked her to stop. She started arguing with me some more about how I was supposed to tip her (which I always do, I was just crying a bit from the pain and embarrassment and just wanted to leave). Should I go back to the salon and leave a tip, and if so, how much? I have not tipping, but I feel like extra money should only be for good service, which is the opposite of what I got. Am I wrong?",

      "content_preview": "Hello y‚Äôall. I graduated from nail school earlier in the year and I am now ready to take my nail tech exam to get my license officially. My instructor recommended that I get the nail tech exam kit that they sell for my state, Virginia. That is what I purchased. However I feel like I still may need some extra things that I don‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs a 2 1/2 hour drive to get to the testing site. And I don‚Äôt wanna leave anything behind. I followed all of the list that I have everything is inventory and packed for travel. If you have any recommendations or advice that I would need for my practical exam. What do you recommend?",

I work a full time job so I‚Äôm hoping for a program that does evenings & weekends. And would be great to know of schools I should avoid lol. I would like to keep the tuition to around $4.5K but unsure if that‚Äôs unrealistic? Also curious how long a part-time program usually ends up taking. TIA for your suggestions!",
