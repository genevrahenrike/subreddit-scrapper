I‚Äôve been told today that the school doesn‚Äôt need me anymore as they don‚Äôt have enough students and only want her. I‚Äôm extremely confused on why they didn‚Äôt mention this before, as the flights were only booked within this week. I feel like I‚Äôve been lied to just to get her for the job and then sack me off as I won‚Äôt be able to stay after 30 days after my z visa runs out. I‚Äôve been told to wait a month and a half to see if the school might hire again when they have more students but I don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs possible when my z visa runs out. I‚Äôve been told by my agency that they can get me permanent residency for the school even through I don‚Äôt officially work for them while they keep looking for schools for me. I just have no trust at this point and I feel like this is a scam. What do I do I have 28 days and I need to have a job with the agency to get my reimbursements back but I don‚Äôt know the laws on getting residency without a job as they promised me this is possible.

      "content_preview": "I should have known. I've already given up on swimming pools here because I can't find anywhere people don't spit into the plastic grate at the end of the pool as they complete each lap, leaving the spit to drift back into the water. I had hoped that being in a major indoor water park full of families might mean that people would be able to behave themselves for just a few hours but that was clearly way too much to expect... It started off fine, the park was quite nice, my kid was having a good time. Then it happened, walking towards the hot spring section my foot slid in a pile of phlegm that had been left right on the path. Sickening, literally. I simply could not enjoy any of the park after that. Why do people have to be so disgusting everywhere they go? To all the inevitable replies saying 'this happens everywhere', please stop kidding yourselves. As a parent with a kid that loves to swim I've been to a dozen water parks in many countries across Asia and Europe including some very poor and underdeveloped countries but this could only have happened the fist time I step into a Chinese water park. Sorry for the rant, I've just come back to China after a lovely summer away and was ready to give the place another go but this is part of a theme whereby we try to do stuff that should be nice and relaxing only to have the experience completely derailed by someone nearby being absolutely revolting in one way or another. I'm growing very weary of it.",

      "content_preview": "To port your number from any provider to any other provider, simply text CXXZ#BOBSMITH#PASSPORT to your provider's CS number (10001 for Telecom, 10086 for Mobile, 10010 for Unicom). This is a status query only, does not have side effects, and is free. Every character must be UPPERCASE, no spaces; try BOBSMITH/SMITHBOB in case your provider switched your first and lastnames. The response will either tell you that you are ready for porting, in which case go to any provider service location anywhere in the country with your ID and you're done. (As a passport holder I found that only official ÊúçÂä°ÂéÖ can service passport holders. People with PR card or Âõû‰π°ËØÅ might be able to do it at third party shops.) If there's anything preventing you from porting, it'll explain the reason and tell you how to fix it. In my previous post I got \"you have roaming charges pending\", in which case I had to wait until the first of the next month to be able to port out. If you have a contract, it'll tell you the exact contract name and end date, so that you can choose to pay to break the contract early to port out. If you have multiple lines under the account, it'll also remind you. Can't believe I'm saying this, but I was overly critical of the giant State-owned Triopolies in my previous post . The porting system is well designed and provides clear messages (albeit in Chinese only). If I was designing the system, I probably couldn't have done a better job. Example error message when you have a contract: Â∞äÊï¨ÁöÑÂÆ¢Êà∑ÊÇ®Â•ΩÔºÅÊÇ®ÁöÑÂè∑Á†ÅÊúâÂÖ®È¢ùÈ¢ÑÂ≠òÂàÜÊúü‰ª£Êî∂ÂêàÁ∫¶Â•óÈ§ê_Áõ¥ÈôçXXXÂÖÉ_XX‰∏™Êúà(Âà∞ÊúüÊó∂Èó¥‰∏∫20XX-XX-XX)ÔºåÂΩ±ÂìçÊê∫Âè∑ËΩ¨ÁΩëÂäûÁêÜÔºåËØ¶ÊÉÖËØ∑Âí®ËØ¢10000„ÄÇ‰ºöÂΩ±ÂìçÊÇ®Â∑≤ÂäûÁêÜÁöÑ‰∏ªÂâØÂç°ÔºåËØ∑Âú®Áî≥ËØ∑Êê∫Âè∑ËΩ¨ÁΩëÂâçÂÅöÂ•ΩÁõ∏ÂÖ≥‰∏öÂä°ÂèòÊõ¥ÔºåËØ¶ÊÉÖËØ∑Âí®ËØ¢10000„ÄÇ Now for the human interaction portion of porting, you are in for hell. Most employees still think that cross-province porting is impossible; some even think that cross-provider porting is impossible, period. Some might think it's impossible because you're a passport holder. If they say no, pull out all the usual tricks: Escalate to manager \"My friend just did it here last week. He told me to come here.\" \"This service is legally mandated by the State.\" (\"ÂõΩÂÆ∂‰ø°ÊÅØÂåñÈÉ®ÊúâËßÑÂÆöÂøÖÈ°ªÊâßË°åÁöÑ.\"Ôºâ Print out the actual legal directive, and an official looking page from your new provider , in color. The red State Seal, and their company logo tend to make them take it more seriously. If it's any consolation, you're not experiencing this hell because you're a foreigner; you're experiencing it because it's a relatively new process and they just haven't done it yet. The Chinese internet is full of Chinese people complaining about the difficulty of the process, so you aren't alone in this at least. Porting might be easier in big cities and harder in rural areas. Like I vaguely implied in my previous \"anywhere in the country\" comment, nothing is stopping you from getting a Tier 1 city number even if you don't live there. But be aware that certain services like passport number updates require an in-person visit. I don't know much about comparative cross-province pricing, but currently China Telecom Duangdong (Shenzhen) is offering 200GB data per month, shared across 10 lines, plus 2Gbps fiber home internet, for 300 CNY per month. So if you have a large family (or are a spammer), consider consolidating all your numbers under one account. The Triopolies seem to charge per family and don't really care how many lines are used within a family. This is just a flyer I saw when I talked by. If people have better deals then please post it, or share sites where special deals can be found. Disclaimer: I don't work for anyone. I don't know anything about this, aside from some Googling and sending out test SMSes. I tried my best to be as accurate and informative as possible, and will happily correct or update the post based on feedback. I wrote this because I couldn't find any good English sources on cross province porting in China.",

      "content_preview": "I studied abroad in Shanghai this summer, and I had such a unique experience as a Chinese American. On one hand, I clearly looked like everyone else since my features blended in. But at the same time, my alternative style (red hair, piercings, tattoos) stood out as very non-traditional, and people could immediately tell I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfully‚Äù one of them. I got a lot of stares. Once, a little girl pointed at my butterfly tattoos on my chest, and her mom literally turned her around and told her to stop staring (she didn‚Äôt stop lol). What stood out to me most was how people reacted when I told them I was American. Many times, people would say, ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt look American, you look Chinese,‚Äù or they would be confused about why my Mandarin wasn‚Äôt perfect. I speak fluent Mandarin, but of course there‚Äôs vocabulary I don‚Äôt know and instead of being impressed that I can have a full conversation, some people just looked disappointed or confused. What really hit me was the double standard compared to white or non-Asian foreigners. A white classmate could say a simple ‚Äúxiexie‚Äù or ‚Äúnihao‚Äù and everyone would praise them like ‚Äúwow, li hai! zhong wen hen hao!!!‚Äù Meanwhile, I can speak fluent Mandarin, but instead of praise, I‚Äôd get questions or judgment about why my Mandarin wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù It felt like locals held me to a much higher standard because I looked Chinese. At the same time, there were positives. Because I could communicate, many people were curious about me and would ask me questions about America they normally couldn‚Äôt ask other foreigners. It was interesting to finally be able to share my perspective with locals in Mandarin. Overall, it was a strange place to be in ‚Äî foreign, but not foreign enough. It was neat to be part of the majority for once. Has anyone else had this experience as a Chinese American (or Asian American) studying or living in China?",

If anyone could share some jobs that would be available for me to do in Chongqing, that would be great! Also, would I need a TEFL or some kind of other English certificate to teach there? What other job opportunities are in Chongqing for foreigners with a bachelor in chemistry and masters in education?",

Last year, my friend told me he doesn‚Äôt,  because he uses the e-channel like Chinese passport holders. So next time I landed at Pudong, I went to this small counter on the right end of the immigration hall and applied. Took 5 minutes. That‚Äôs it. Now I can use the e-channel every time I fly in or out. Last trip, I stopped the clock: plane to baggage belt in 13 minutes. Another 10 minutes and I was already in a taxi. Crazy. I travel every couple of weeks for business, and honestly, this changed my life. Thought it might help other foreigners here, too.",

      "content_preview": "Scrolling through this sub, I see a lot of negativity surrounding the topic of race in China, particularly being a black or dark skinned foreigner. I was browsing the sub because I plan to go back soon and decided to share my experience to try and bring some positivity to the subject, to show other potential black expats that it isn't (or doesn't have to be) all bad. I did an undergraduate work-study program in Changsha back in 2023 through my university. I was working as an English teaching assistant at a business college (not super relevant info, just background). I am a black American woman and was working with a white American professor with whom I became close friends during our time in China. I am not what you would call dark-skinned, but I am certainly not light, and in any case, I was leagues darker than the local women. I was initially worried about potentially being the only brown-skinned person for miles in a country with so little diversity. I had heard plenty of horror stories about daring to be brown in Asia and didn't know what to expect. But I was very pleasantly surprised by my overall reception. No one (to my knowledge or in a language I could understand) said anything negative about my skin or features. In fact, I received many compliments on my appearance, especially from Chinese women. At times, it started to feel like too many, but it was very flattering. The compliments did not feel fetishized either (except for maybe a few about my butt). I always wore my natural hair out in an Afro, and no one ever tried to touch it or said anything unkind about it. I was even able to find hair products that worked for coily hair. Children often gravitated towards me and would follow me around and ask me to play (very cute!). A balloon vendor at the IFS even jokingly got down on one knee and proposed to me in the street. I frequented lots of local shops, particularly the nail salon by my apartment, and was always eagerly greeted by name and given great service. My students were always eager to see me and talk to me. The university treated me very well (besides one Chinese male professor who took an upskirt photo of me, but that's a whole other story lol). All that to say, I was never made to feel ugly or unwelcome because of my skin color. The few times I was not welcome somewhere were almost entirely due to me being a foreigner, not necessarily black, as my professor received the same treatment. I have faced far more racism in America than I ever did in China, which is really wild to think about. I did integrate somewhat with the local women, which probably helped a bit. I love the hyperfeminine fashion of Asia, and mostly wore that style, so I wasn't out of place in that regard. I also carried a UV umbrella like other women (which they probably thought was funny lol). There may be a gender bias at play, though. A lot of the reports I have seen about racism in China have been from black men, so perhaps people are generally nicer to women? Perhaps Changsha is a unicorn city, or I was just extremely lucky? Who knows. There were certainly days when I felt like an exotic animal in a zoo with people wanting to take pictures, following me around, recording me without my consent, etc. I felt like a celebrity dodging paparazzi. It did get very tiresome and upsetting at times, but it was softened by the fact that there was no malice behind it. Most of them really had never seen a black person in real life before, and I was kinda glad I could make it a positive experience for them. I only had to cuss out one guy for following me and being too pushy, and that was in Shanghai. In my experience, Changsha was very foreigner- and black person-friendly. The only negative racial experience I had was actually with two other black expats. They were Caribbean men and acted as though they were entitled to my time because I was the only black woman in town. They were oddly hostile, practically interrogating me, and tried to follow me back to my apartment from the corner store at night. Even the shop owner saw how they were acting and told them to leave. That was the only time I ever felt unsafe during my stay in China. All in all, I loved Changsha and felt very at home there and would go back in a heartbeat, if for nothing else than cute clothes, great food, amazing inexpensive manicures, and delicious Meco fruit teas lol But I would love to hear other people's experiences! I know when it comes to China, you either love it or you hate it. Hopefully, my experience assuaged some fears for potential expats or at least made them smile :)",

In the last 3 years, I signed up for 5 gyms. FIVE. first gym is pretty clean, kinda new, boss runs away. no refund second gym, underground with a pool, disgusting humidity or whatever it is, gym doesn't pay workers, dies. no refund third gym. long existing, kinda cheap, dies after a while, got refund though fourth gym, my favorite, pricey, but very clean and close. not a lot of people. they broke the contract with the mall, illegal modifications.. a MONTH after i signed up, they operated for 5 years no problems.. fuck! fifth gym, bought a month to test out, operated since 2019, not clean as it should, but works and seems stable, so this month i pay for a year.. and 2 weeks later. boss runs away. i swear, i hate this country for allowing this kind of shit. gyms are so fucked here. yes, i'm ranting, but omfg do i hate it.idk if it's my shite luck or i really know how to pick a dying gym. it sucks",

Obviously we‚Äôll be bringing the cats with us, but I‚Äôm already stressing about the logistics (luckily we‚Äôve got a year to plan/prepare). The UK doesn‚Äôt let pets fly in cabin, so if we went direct they‚Äôd have to go in cargo for around 13 hours, which honestly freaks me out. The other option is flying with them in cabin to Paris, then doing the drive + Eurotunnel into the UK. That feels kinder for them, but it does mean extra paperwork ‚Äî we‚Äôd need both the UK and EU certificates. They‚Äôve got the same requirements (microchip, rabies vaccine, 3-month wait, blood test), but for the EU one the rabies test has to be sent off to an approved government lab (closest one is Beijing) which adds a bit of hassle. So my question is: would you go for the longer journey (flight + 2/3 hour car ride + Eurotunnel + another 2 hours uk side) so they can stay in cabin, or is it better to just do the direct flight and put them in cargo? Has anyone here done either route?",

From what we‚Äôve found online, it looks like Zimbabwean citizens are only eligible to apply for Japan‚Äôs eVisa if they reside in certain countries/regions, and mainland China isn‚Äôt on that list. We also called to ask, and it seems that having a Chinese residence permit might be required in order to apply for a Japan visa from within China. So I wanted to check if anyone here has had a similar experience. Are there any Zimbabwean citizens (or citizens of other countries that don‚Äôt have visa-free access to Japan) who successfully applied for a Japan tourist visa while living in Beijing/Shanghai? If yes, could you share how you did it? Thanks a lot!",

From what I‚Äôve seen, Anta and Li-Ning are still the big names for sports shoes....they‚Äôre comfortable and hold up well. I recently tried Li-Ning running shoes, and even after daily use for a few weeks, they stayed light and comfy. A friend has XTEP sneakers for casual wear and says they‚Äôre surprisingly durable. PEAK is popular for basketball shoes, while BeLLE seems to be the go-to for women‚Äôs fashion shoes. Heritage brands like Warrior and Nei Lian Sheng are also getting noticed for combining traditional styles with comfort. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of other brands doing well that don‚Äôt get much attention, and if you look online, platforms like Alibaba have tons of listings from China shoe factories,some of these lesser-known brands might be worth trying. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm curious to know which hidden gems or under-the-radar brands have you come across and actually liked in 2025? Any favorites among the well-known ones?",

We can explore sights and new places as well as practice Chinese together ü§© I especially like dancing so I really want to go to a dance class. Going to a club and exploring nightlife would be fun too. I also really like cats so going to a cat cafe is also on the list. Let me know if you‚Äôre interested! We can talk on WeChat too",

      "content_preview": "I'm sure this has been asked many times before, but I feel like it something that can also be seriously discussed. As a foreigner, I admit I have sometimes made jokes about this, and I even remember being told as a guy it's typically a \"rite of passage\" that will happen to you here at least once before you find someone who will truly stick with you. I'll tell you though, probably never will make those jokes again, cause when it happens to you, it is not funny at all lol. I hear it's mostly a foreigner guy - Chinese girl thing, but does it often happen the other way around too?  I always used to think having a lot of money could convince anyone's parents of anything, but it turns out sometimes \"traditional values\" (racism) can just be that much stronger. EDIT: this is not a complaining thread by the way, this is a discussion thread.  I still stand by whatever happened to me was incredibly incredibly unlucky, and is not actually the most common case.  (I dealt with in laws who were not swayed by money sadly, to make a long story short, they refused to allow their daughter marry a foreigner and she was unfortunately too quiet and too soft spoken to fight for it, whatever the actual truth may be, the end result is still the same)",

      "content_preview": "I apologize if this isn't really appropriate for the sub, mods feel free to delete I just have to vent because I feel like pulling my hair out. I'm currently on a lengthy roadtrip and while the scenery, roads, and trip in general has been amazing I cannot get over how rude, impatient, and inconsiderate Chinese drivers are. For people who are so lovely in person, even the exact people I'm talking about (I've chatted to several at stops) they are absolute wankers behind the wheel. I feel like I am constantly on edge driving here because everybody is so unpredictable. I'll give you some examples; Apparently lanes are entirely optional here and I would say 70% of drivers cut every corner, arguably moreso when it's blind. And while we're on the subject of corners, half the drivers have no idea how to take a corner. They'll absolutely bomb it down the straight and then slam the brakes in the middle of the corner or yeet themselves across two lanes and cut it. Chinese drivers seem to take overtaking as a personal offense. In almost every other country I've driven in, when you're overtaking someone - especially long or slow moving vehicles - they'll ease off a bit or pull in slightly to let you pass. Not in China. Most of the drivers here speed up when you're trying to overtake and would rather see you end up in a head-on collision than just let you merge. Littering. They all just fire shit out the window constantly. Not only is it disgusting and disrespectful, I've almost been hit by two red bull cans flying out of the window in front of me. They have less than zero patience. The vast majority of the traffic I've been stuck in is the result of people just shoving their way into gaps they blatantly don't fit in. At one point I slowed to let someone finish making a turn and the guy behind me decided that was his opportunity to undercut me, almost wiped out the guy turning and caused a huge backlog because he couldn't wait five seconds. I've seen three crashes in five days because people keep overtaking on blind bends and trying to overtake someone who's already overtaking someone else. Indicators? Never heard of em. Hazard lights? Don't be daft. I've lost count of the times I've almost crashed because the person in front of me decides to swing a turn with zero notice or swerves at the last second to avoid a bike, yak, or some other obstacle with me right behind them. Logic would say, ok I need to leave more room to be prepared - well whenever I do that some cunt sees the space in front of me as fair game to shove his way in and save four seconds on his journey. It's only a matter of time before I fully lose my mind or crash, and honestly I'm not sure which is more likely.",
