      "content_preview": "Hello ! As per the title, I have been considering doing a degree at Flinders and was looking for some opinions about the university from people who have experience there. I would mainly like to know how good the tutors are, how passionate they are, how well are assignments structured, what is campus life like, and maybe even what student accommodation is like. If you have opinions on any of these aspects of the university, I would greatly appreciate your input! Specifically, I was considering doing a bachelor of arts with a major in Medieval and Early Modern Studies (Flinders is the only university in Australia that still offers this major). I already have a bachelor's degree in animation production from UTS (I am from NSW). Finding a job in animation right now is absolutely abysmal. No doubt, a job in the field of history will be just as tricky, but I figured going into editing, writing, or even becoming a librarian would all be viable paths from such a degree. Most importantly, this period of history is an enormous interest of mine, and I love learning about it--writing essays is also something I generally find fun. All that said, I do worry that doing such a degree in Australia may be a waste of time and money. I haven't been able to find any students currently attending Flinders online who have this major to ask them their experience of it. Maybe there are some students here who are doing similar majors with a crossover in the tutors/professors who can give me some idea of the value of such a degree at Flinders? I also have some worry that the major will no longer exist in a couple of years, as it has disappeared from other Australian universities very recently and Flinders could follow that trend. Otherwise, any opinions at all about the university, both positive and negative, I will be very grateful to hear. Thanks!!",

I was stressing about being late for work and fobbed him off a bit, nicely I hope. I felt bad about it and went back to try and find him when I realised I had more time than I thought but he’d gone. He had a white beard, brown coat, possibly doing it rough but clearly looking after himself. He seemed like a lovely guy. Does anyone know him or know how I could get in touch with him? I’d love to make it up to him, buy one or more of his stories, maybe a cup of coffee. Please let me know. UPDATE: Thank you to all who helped! I actually happened to see him again today, so I apologised and told him I’d like to buy one of his stories. He remembered me and said I’d made his day and then said a prayer for me. I’m not religious but it was very sweet of him. He’s a good egg, ol’ Harry.",

Obviously, I had to stop, and there's no patching the cavern that is this hole by the side of the road. I rang my partner to come pick me up, and I was fortunate enough that she could jump in the car within 5 mins. Anyway, whilst I'm sitting on Railway S Terrace waiting for my ride, at least 6 cyclists stopped independently of each other to check on me over a 10 minute period as they passed. Two of them doubled back to do so, whilst another offered me an entire new inner tube. There was also what I would estimate to be a 10 year old pedestrian who asked me if I was alright as he passed, then came back 2 mins later as an afterthought to see if I needed help with the bike... The point being, I was touched by the willingness of the cycling community, all in a rush to get home from work, to stop and check on me. Given the obvious downside of the flat, it was a genuinely awesome experience. That is all! Cheers Adelaide!",

I think those are pretty good deals and they fill me up, which is great as a student. I was wondering if there are any other spots in Adelaide that do something similar, and are open late at night (or even all night)? Thank you — I would really appreciate your suggestions.",
