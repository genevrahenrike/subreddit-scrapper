      "content_preview": "Jungle has far too much game impact. Bot lane has far too little. Top and mid lane are the most balanced and fair roles but are forced to coin toss for junglers for objectives. Said objectives are FAR too numerous. Feats of war. Dragon. Baron. Elder. Voidlings. Herald. Atakan. If the other jungler gets one, he's likely to get them all. Nerfs to minion make wave manipulation more difficult, and so there are times where you will either have to over extend or lose cs. Playing safe is more punishing than ever before, and it's the main way players survive against counter picks or weaker teammates. Champion balance also- each patch seems to make the game worse and less fun to play. Win streaks punish the player by pairing them with teammates with 40-45 winrates against players with 50-55 winrates. (Proven by numerous players documenting their progress through losers que despite what league says, they say 'yes we do bump play mmr on winstreaks but no we dont have losers que' what kind of gaslighting is this?) Leads. Snowballing. Way too prevalent. Smurfs. Boosters. Account shares. All of these issues make the game impossible to play and enjoy. The only way I could see anyone having fun is through the other gamemodes outside summoners rift. Or through very casual play to the point of trolling for lulz. I'm an old time player. I've been playing since AP yi and flash pull blitz was a thing. Since Vi had just came out. Season 6 was the best. Season 10 was the beginning of the end, with the addition of dragon buffs, berries, and things like this that added more ways to snowball and not less. Since then it's been \"add complexity, make everything OP until nothing is, and neglect the old unbalanced stuff and just bury it with new over-kitted stuff\" The game will need serious reworking before I return. If I ever return. Jungler will need to be nerfed first of all. Add a temporary wall to river- whatever you have to do. Laners need to test themselves against other laners for a while without being jumped. Even towers aren't enough to protect you these days pre-5 minutes. Make new champions locked from ranked until 2 patches after their release. Stop ranked throttling. When I go 6 wins in a row- dont change anything. Let my MMR raise in tandem with my LP. Don't force me to lose regardless of how I play for another 6 matches just to maintain that 50% winrate artificially. Do what you promise and remove smurfs and ranked sharing. Start balancing your champions properly. Remove the snowball jungle objectives and stop adding a new one each season. Make dragon a temporary buff that lasts until the next dragon spawns. Remove voidlings and herald and elder. Feats of war creating unique item benefits just gives players more reason to flame teammates that go behind. Essentially - make it feel more like your personal skill matters more. I know it's a teamgame. But it's not a game of flip the coin either. Our we play in lane and teamfights should matter. It shouldn't be focused on map awareness and roaming alone. roaming is far too rewarded as a skill when its just a simple choice to shove and leave lane. Rather than fight against a stronger opponent. This game is broken and I'm not alone in believing this. Dante, Tyler1, azzap, and many more other big names in the community have pointed this kind of stuff out. Jungle is too over powered, bot lane doesnt matter, and top and mid lane are just kept around to give the game SOME validity and fairness. Reset the game to season 10 and try again, essentially. It just feels like the balance team keeps doubling down on the core problems plaguing league today. Making finding fair matches more difficult than ever before and the community HAS the answers. That's the worst part. We KNOW how to fix it, but the balance team refuses to listen.",

      "content_preview": "Personally for me, it's Sylas. He has powerful basic abilities but the potential to have super ultimates, which are balanced around their original owner's weaknesses. Most super ultimate champs don't have good basic abilities. Fiddlesticks is slow and requires a jumpscare so he can make you stay in his R to take a lot of damage otherwise, you just leave it and he gets kited. Sylas is high mobility and when taking fiddlesticks R, can make people stay in it for a while because of his 3 dashes, one of which is a cc. Unlike Fiddle who's usually squishy and relies on killing everyone with his AOE Fear to not die, Sylas just bruteforces with his W's insane heal. Yes, I know that there might be useless ults on the enemy team but that's fundamental to his design and compensating for potentially bad situations with strong basic abilities is bad design and unbalanced. Even most of his bad ults aren't that bad, Elise R still gives Spider Elise E or Human Elise E, both very powerful. Etc Etc. If we used this logic of all champs needing to be OP when not against their preferred enemies for the sake of consistency, why aren't Malphite and Galio strong against Magic and Physical respectively? Sylas gets strong basics with super ults, why do they have to deal with being weak against magic and physical respectively?",

      "content_preview": "They didn’t ignore that women feel pain too. Especially between the legs. You see Vi and other women take real hits and react like humans, not like they’re invincible. No “girl boss tanked a groin shot like a champ” bullshit. Vi takes a hit, and she folds like anyone would. Shows almost never acknowledge that women have pain responses in those spots too, but Arcane? Arcane said “biology matters.” That alone gets my respect. 2. The facial expressions are criminally good. There are moments, like Powder crying after Vi hits her, or Silco trembling in a quiet scene,  where the emotion in their eyes alone makes your stomach turn. You see the heartbreak, the guilt, the fear. No words needed. Powder’s crying isn’t some clean Disney sob,  it’s ugly, it’s childlike, it’s real. Vi’s rage isn’t just anger,  it’s grief in collapse. You can pause the frame at any second and see exactly what the character’s thinking. That’s not animation, it's ART. 3. Jinx and Silco’s trauma is mirrored. And they showed that in almost no words. Silco and Jinx are the same person at two different stages of betrayal. Silco was drowned by his brother. Jinx was abandoned by her sister. They both were hurt by the ones they trusted most, and both ended up clinging to someone who said, “You’re perfect. Stay broken. I won’t leave.” You don’t need a long-ass monologue to explain it. They gave us a few flashbacks, a couple lines, and a shitload of pain — and it clicked. 4. They captured psychological breakdowns like they’ve studied real trauma. Powder didn’t just “go crazy.” She was: Gaslit by love, Betrayed by family, Blamed herself for everything, And then handed a gun and told she was perfect the way she is... broken. That’s not a villain arc. That’s a trauma response turned into identity. And they showed that visually. You feel her shatter with every eye twitch, every hallucination, every unstable moment. And you get it. It hurts. It makes too much sense. Arcane doesn’t tell you how to feel. It just shows you something real and dares you to look away. And the truth is? You can’t. You sit in it. You feel the hits, the betrayals, the cries for help, the heartbreak, the rage, the longing for someone to just stay. This isn’t just “a good show.” This is art.",

My build is ROA → Shadowflame → Stormsurge, which makes Diana feel more like a bruiser-assassin hybrid. She can spam abilities in teamfights, deal a ton of damage, and is noticeably harder to kill. It’s been working well for me, so I’m wondering: why isn’t this build meta?",

I like champions like Fizz, Zed, and Malphite AP, but I can't find anything similar in the top lane that I really like. I've tried Gwen, Riven, Fiora, Camille, Aatrox, etc., and they just don't quite click for me. Any recommendations or lesser-known champions that do any of these things? Thanks!",

I've been playing Wukong and Amumu mainly. But I felt like I was depending on my team a lot, I very rarely carried and won games when all my laners were losing. And one day I decided to try Xin Zhao, a champ that I played like 5 times in the last year. And Xin got me to Diamond IV today, with a 80% WR in 20 games. I feel like I'm cheating. After getting Sundered Sky, it felt like I was more powerful than having Trinity and Sundered on Wukong. The heal was crazy, like I had a Yummi attached to me. The enemies were not even trying to contest objectives when i was around. Don't think I lost soul drake once in these 20 games. Why is there such a big difference? I always thought that playing a champ that you know best will be better than playing a meta champ that you rarely played, but this was a game changer.",

      "content_preview": "Hello, we (2 motivated developers) have spent some months now building URSG , a website/app to find other League/Valorant players. We have been very inspired by GetSoj since nothing else has felt quite the same. I hope this subreddit is okay for this, as this is not a profit-oriented project in any way and just aims to provide a good way to find players! I know we’re definitely not the first ones, and probably not the last, to have done this, but maybe it can still spark some interest. Signup There are 2 options for signing up: with Google or with your Riot account. Both are designed to be easy signups and especially to avoid creating another account. After that, you will be asked to provide some basic information about yourself and what you're looking for, and you're all set. Swiping Finding friends is the main aspect, and you can swipe through profiles that might match with you on the main page. You can request them as friends or skip them, depending on whether you're interested or not. If they accept, you can start chatting. Small features We have some smaller features to make the app more interesting. For example, there is a little quiz every day to guess a known League player (not Valorant yet, but that will come), or you can edit your profile picture with frames that you unlock over time (no, you can’t pay money for it). As for the other features, you can test them out yourself if you’re curious. Conclusion First of all, thank you for reading this far, and I hope it made you curious. I also want to say that we are very passionate about this project, and it's by no means intended to be just a money grab. We are not doing any ads, on-page sales, or selling any user data. It is just a fun project that we would like to share, and maybe some can enjoy it with us. Feedback is always welcome, and we try to respond quickly to any kind of questions or issues!

We’re in a single elimination draft tournament , and all games are best of 3 . If we keep winning, we’d need to play 3-4 BO3 series today , starting at 16:30 GMT and potentially going until midnight . We’re from Portugal (EUW) and looking for a midlaner who can sub in for us. Ideally, we’d love someone who could play the whole tournament, but honestly, even if you can just do 1 or 2 BO3s, we’d really appreciate it —we’re kinda desperate here. We’re a chill team, just playing for fun while trying our best... BUT we just found out we’re up against Diamond+ players , so if we could get a mid carry to 1v9 for us (maybe a Grandmaster smurf or something, lol) , that’d be amazing. We really wanna win this thing. If you’re interested, hit me up! IGN: Mora SPKTR#SPKTR To check what time that is for you: https://time.is/GMT Please, save us. 🙏😂",

      "content_preview": "r/Leagueoflegendsmeta is for the discussion of metagame and strategy of ranked and professional games on Summoner's Rift. We welcome all players who want to theorize and discuss the game at a high level with an emphasis on winning and a competitive edge. If you have a theorycrafted strategy to share or have a question about higher level League of Legends you're in the right place. What's a metagame? For the purpose of this forum the 'metagame' is made up of what choices we expect to be made in a game based on our experiences in previous games. In solo queue, the champions that are perceived as strongest tend to be chosen more often and it is those champions, how they are played and optimized, and how they are used strategically that shape the metagame. Rules: When presenting an idea, your post should be: |    On-Topic - Theorycrafting and Strategy is what we are here for! |    Substantial - No low effort posts. Be as complete and in-depth as possible. The body of each submitted post requires 150 characters. |    Justified - Your idea should explain why your choices are plausible in a competitive environment. Support your theorycrafting with math proofs, match histories, or strategic analysis. In order for an controversial idea to be plausible it must be supported with evidence. When asking a question, your post should be: |    On-Topic - Theorycrafting and Strategy to help you make choices. |    Specific - General questions lead to general answers which promote lazy thinking. List of naughty things bad posts do that get your post removed |    Is X viable? - In solo queue everything is viable. We care about what is competitive in a given metagame. Competitive means that a strategy has a reliable, distinct, value that can contribute meaningfully to winning games. |    What's the state of X? - Be specific. Questions like these just generate opinion polls and not enough discussion that drives choices. |    Tell me how to build/What is the best build/How do I X/Give me tips? - We aren't all experts here, but many experts put their expertise online in guides and forums. We want to avoid posts that end up linking you to recipes and stick to the meatier end of discussion. |    What's the current Meta? - Want to know which champions everyone says is OP right now? Find out here! Comments should be: |    On-Topic - Relevant to the subject of the post and respects decision making. |    Civil and Constructive - Be Civil. Be Constructive. |    Substantial - Answers should be explanatory, as detailed and in-depth as possible. It's more important to be thorough and explanatory than it is to be simply right.",

      "content_preview": "T3 boots suggestion Sorry for the wall of text <3 Hear me out, I think that T3 boots requirement should be changed to: Needs 3 legendary items, reduced by 1 for each feat of strength. TLDR: This still gives a huge advantage to a team that gets all feats, but makes the advantage early game focused, which gives the winning team a ”time window” for benefiting from the buff. This incentivizes the losing team to stay and stall, since getting that 2nd or 3rd legendary item  will provide a big power boost. Thesis: T3 boots requirement: Completed 2/3+ feats and purchased 2 legendary items > Purchased 3 legendary items, reduced by 1 for each feat completed by your team Theory: Assumtions: We are on the current patch boots upgrade costs 1k gold spent on boots upgrades is on average 2x as  efficient as the rest of your gold spent all players who can buy t3 boots buy them right after their 2nd legendary item Example: red side wins feats of strength and is at 30k gold by 20 minutes, blue side is at 25k. Redside has about 6k gold per person Lets assume for simplicity that 3 players (support and 2 others) have the required gold to buy t3 boots. Result: This extends redsides advantage by 3k gold. Actual gold lead = gold lead +/- 1k * number of players who can afford t3 boots (Negative in case the team at a gold deficit wins the feats of strength) The term”number of players who can afford t3 boots” is directly related to gold earned, and thus will be higher for a team with a gold advantage than one at a deficit. In terms of “actual gold lead” T3 boots give a larger snowball effect to winning team who also wins the feat of strength than a comeback effect for a losing team that won feats of strength. Note: would be interesting to see average gold earned over time for team that wins feat of strength vs teams who dont Through this change, the ”gold buff” from winning feats will be arriving earlier but also dissipate throughout the game, counteracting the snowballing effect. To note: I recognize that there are a lot of other factors playing into what makes a team winning or losing, such as team comps, objectives, vision. All this is ignored for this analysis Let me know if i have cooked, Kamrat Mango",

I know they’re commonly used in FPS games, but how do they perform in a game like League? I saw that Faker uses a Wooting keyboard, but it doesn’t seem like many other pros have adopted them yet. What’s your opinion? Does the faster actuation point provide a noticeable advantage? And is rapid trigger or \"rappy snappy\" something that could make a difference? I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

The thing is that my friend and I want to see what our personal peak is so we are gonna grind 5 days at the next season start. I'm playing midlane and my Championpool is Cassio, Zed, Malzahar, Ahri. My biggest strength is CSing and punishing my enemy for his mistakes so I can get early leads. So now here's the thing: I don't think I'm a monkey or sth. but every game I'm loosing feels like so rough because I can't carry my teammates when they go 0/7 out of lane. My mate is normally a top main but in duoq he goes jungle so he can have more impact. In my opinion it's normally hard to watch and look for my own mistakes bc I can't see them. What do you guys think we should practice more on? Like should we look out for our macro? Op.gg: https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/ItzMatzePvP2-6501",

I've worked in the biggest BR teams, with the most known and best players over here and I went to MSI 21 - Iceland after winning CBLOL. Besides that, I have reached finals over 5 times. I'm offering some individual coaches for ALL ELOS , everyone who is willing to learn is welcomed. In those sessions the same metodology used in professional teams will be applied. During the session we will set some goals for you to evolve individually and consequently, climb your elo. I'll be watching your recent games and you will play one SoloQ match when in call with me. The main idea is to show you some of your patterns and bad habits that you don't even know that exist, figure out where they come from and how to fix them. By doing that, I want you to become self-conscious of your mistakes and to stop auto-playing , always being aware of your own decisions. If interested, I also offer some discounts in case you book more than one session. For more details and prices, DM me or reach me out through dionrraycontato/gmail.com or my socialmedias @ /dionrraylol. (The metodology applied on the coaching is the same that is applied in professional teams and players, respecting all the particularities over the player's ELO) (I've already coached players before in NA/EUW/JP server, as well as I already worked with Korean pro-players before) (The coaching session lasts 2Hours)",

      "content_preview": "Hey LoL community! After having spent numerous years on the ranked grind, two friends and I built a free to use algorithm that leverages machine learning based on champion synergies and counters to help you pick the 3 best champions to maximize your chances of winning during the champion select phase. The generic elo of the champion recommendations is Gold 1, but if you search your summoner ID, recommendations will be adapted to your current elo. Also, if you want to receive recommendations from a specific pool of champions you can create an account and it will save your selected preferences. Let me know how it works for you, and feel free to share any suggestions or thoughts! Check it out here: https://www.smartpick.gg How to use it: Select your mode: screenshot mode (autofill) or manual mode (fill in yourself) Fill in the Dashboard Get recommended champions An example of the manual mode: https://media.giphy.com/media/18pc2Y0unpoSjM8EvC/giphy.gif An example of the screenshot mode: https://media.giphy.com/media/7AmD63GadyofrCDYWu/giphy.gif",

      "content_preview": "(Yes title was supposed to say mundo my bad) This is a genuine question. How do yall play against mundo? So far the only counter play I have found is winning the game before 20 minutes. I am typing this after a ranked game where the mundo was 0-3 within the first 10 minutes as well as enemy bot duo. Ass he did was farm a little bit and as soon as he had 2 items we could only kill him with all 5. We all built gracious wounds and attempted to avoid him. No one could solo kill him so to stop his split all 5 would have to answer. To which he would be able to turn away freely thanks to ghost and spell shield. This allowed every other lane to catch up and for them to secure nearly every objective. Now I am by no means a high tier player or the greatest in general but I have finally started playing ranked and gone from iron 4 to silver 2 so far. I am genuinely curious on how I can play against him? Thanks in advance.",

I think I could play with a duo smurf and climb really easy to masters, but I didn't find anyone, thats why I am asking you, to help me climb, and both of us will be great.

      "content_preview": "Hey, I'm not new to league, I've played for a long time, but I was always playing on \"autopilot\" and never really tried to improve, just treating this game as a form of spending free time with my friends. Recently I decided that I would like to improve, and play better. I don't really care about rank, I just want to be a better player but if someone is curious, I was never above silver, on solo duo nor on flex. There are still few champions which I never played as, even tho I was playing since Ekko got released. I recently tried Briar, and I enjoyed playing as her. However I have no idea what's in the meta right now, nor if she is good or bad. I know that in low elo it doesn't really matter, but if I get better, and get higher rank, I don't want to be forced to change to a different champion, just because she is not in the meta. I've heard different things, like \"Briar is bad right now\" but on the other hand I've heard that armor penetration was nerfed, and I thought \"I can just build armor on her, be like a tank/bruiser, and it should be okay. But I have no idea how this game works, so I might be delusional. I know that really good champions for learning the game are something like rammus, ammumu, and other, more basic champions, but I find them kinda boring. (I haven't mentioned that I mostly play jungle). On the other hand, I also don't really like champions which can be useless if they are not ahead, like Evelynn and Rengar. That's why I was playing ammumu, because he is still useful due to his utility, even if you are 0/10. I don't know if the same thing applies to Briar, I didn't play her much for now. Thanks in advance for any advice. TL;DR: The title, which is: What's the meta right now? Is Briar good?",
