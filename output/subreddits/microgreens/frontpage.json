      "content_preview": "Hi! I‚Äôm usually a huge researcher, taking weeks/ months to figure out the best methods, equipment, etc before jumping into something new BUT my autistic son who also has ARFID (disordered eating based on overwhelming sensory aversions to food) and has about 4 foods that he will eat, none of which are nutrient dense with the exception of Dino kale (which I do grow but it‚Äôs currently not in season and the nearest grocery store that sells is an hour away) and his other safe foods are beige. Anyways.. he ate micro greens today at the farmers market, liked it and has been eating what he bought by the handful! Now I‚Äôm in a mad dash to start growing them myself and don‚Äôt have the energy or bandwidth currently to research properly so wondering if anyone has quick link recommendations for a home grow system that is relatively low maintenance for kale, broccoli and/or kohlrabi. We have a small home with limited counter space so I‚Äôd also be interested to hear where you guys put your trays with a space saver mentality! Thanks so much for reading",

I've got an old mushroom tray and some spare potting soil to grow in, but I had a question on what to do post harvest. Like cress, once it's cut, the seed is 'used' (for lack of a better term), would it be possible to let a few of the plants grow and flower to go to seed and harvest? Or am I just overthinking it?",
