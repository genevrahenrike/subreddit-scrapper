      "content_preview": "I have recently moved in to a new rental which is a granny flat under the Home. There are no telephone sockets in the wall and we have FTTN/FTTC. I have been told by two separate providers 2 separate connection types however we will not be able to access this NBN as the only connections in the Home are regular power outlet/wall sockets and TV aerial sockets. There’s no 5G Home Internet in the area and my options come down to 4G Home Internet, satellite Internet (Starlink, which would be tricky as we do not want to have to drill any holes into any walls or roofs I know that we can just leave it on the floor outside, but I’m not too sure if this is even going to provide us any speed at all and for the price of starlink I’m not sure if the speed will be justified). We can upgrade to FTTP. However we’re only here for six months and we have been told it is going to be expensive. Does anyone know what we can do to get some higher speed Internet than the 16 mbps the 4G will be providing? Or does anyone have any way that we will be able to use any highest speed Internet without the wall sockets/how expensive it would be to get one of those installed From from the main line upstairs? I know very basic information about Internet so I’m not too sure if any of this makes sense. I hope it does and I hope someone can help me. Thank you.",

      "content_preview": "Dear fellow NBN forum regulars My parents have a partial direct buried cable which appears to run under an under a concrete slab that was on their property when the house was built in 1980. The shed apparently was the original sales office. NBN contractor turned up on 25/8 and tried to mount the PCD and NTD on the shed!  I lost my shit at him because as a Registered Cabler, as far as I know you cannot put a PCD or NTD on a detached building, that was after he turned up an hour earlier than scheduled. I quoted him S008 and S009 and said, PCDs must be on the house, and I’m organising conduit to be run to the study, I need NBN Civil to come and dig a new LIC but there is only about 1 metre clearance between the property fence with the neighbours and the tin shed, which appears to have been built over the LIC, the cable comes up out of the ground at the far end of a long shed, you could fit six cars in it side to side (to give you an idea of how long the shed is), but then the copper comes up out of the ground and disappears into a small run of conduit, and no Madison box, the old network boundary was a wall phone in their kitchen. I wanted to find out whether Snap, Send, Solve and log it as damaged NBN infrastructure is a good way or log it as a NBN complaint please? Telstra don’t want anything to do with it, the NBN tech who turned up said he would log it with his supervisor as requiring a new LIC and left me a 30 meter outdoor patch lead to run from the study inside the house to an as yet unknown PCD location. Given the job was rebooked with Telstra a month into the future, and I asked them to run a SQ on the line as I figured I’d get them onto NBN100, this was was done by Telstra NBN activations, and shows they can get NBN100 on their line, but NBN have marked the entire area as no NBN100 speeds until fibre is run without even checking whether their copper would support NBN100, which it will. Telstra can’t do anything (so they say) because the Atlas is saying my parents  can’t have 100/20 despite the modem sync speed clearly slowing its capable, and Telstra NBN Activations confirming my parents could get NBN100, but alas, it’s locked out in the Atlas and the Atlas is like the bible - RSPs have to follow whatever the Atlas says - so anyone who has done what I’m doing, and this isn’t the first direct buried client I’ve assisted. This just happens to be my parents. I logged the Snap, Send Solve case, alas, I couldn’t attach all the photos because there is a limit to uploading. Would anyone suggest using the NBN website complaint option to log it again, as besides a case number, I haven’t had an acknowledgment for my original case. Last time I did this it was a 1950s house with direct buried cable and I logged it as a complaint, but they told me in the future don’t log a new LIC as a complaint, log it as an infrastructure fault.  It’s been nine months since I assisted with this other customer, and they sent one of the NBN Civil contractors out and they used a machine to bury a trench, it was much more straight forward than my parents place and I recall the gear they used might not fit in the space between the fence line and the shed, plus it’s uneven ground just to make it more fun. I can always push back the install date, as I expect it will take a while for Civil guys to come on site, but I would have expected a reply to my Snap, Send, Solve case which was logged a week ago. I shouldn’t be running the patch lead from the PCD to the NTD, as that is on NBN’s side of the network boundary.  I don’t even know where they will put the PCD, but I have a fair idea where I’d put it.  I know the NBN tech should have mounted the PCD, but he said that’s Civil’s job.  Seriously frustrated with some of these yahoos who contract for NBN. I’m just trying to get advice on best department to speak to about a new Lead in Cable based on other people’s experience please.  I am not digging a trench, because again, that is not on the side of the network boundary I am supposed to be working on.  I could, but I’ve been told multiple times it’s not my responsibility.  Plus I don’t fancy hand digging a trench 40 metres from the back fence where we last picked up the cable before it disappears under the concrete, and that is a kitchen which is a wet area, and there is no way they will mount the PCD on the back wall of the house.  It’s nearly a straight line to the side of the house, not far from the electrical box which is where I would put it. From reading other people’s comments seems that regulations and what happens in reality can be very different. Thanks in advance. Cheers.",

NBN plans on leaptel.com.au have been updated, the CIS pdf also has been updated and the Membsrs Portal shows the 500/50 plan which you can select to change to. The 500/50 comes in at $92.50 ongoing after the usual discounted rate for first 12 months of $79.95. This will more than likely be the 'default' NBN plan most consumers will be drawn to. Cant wait to see the Multi-gig and high upload pricing next month. https://preview.redd.it/leaptel-having-quietly-added-the-new-nbn-500-50-plan-as-of-v0-yj7c3oziazgf1.png https://preview.redd.it/leaptel-having-quietly-added-the-new-nbn-500-50-plan-as-of-v0-inqj0uhlazgf1.png",

Anyway.. I need a NBN that's reliable and preferably cheap with static ip as I want to login remotely for CCTV etc. I'm leaning towards southern phone with free modem over 12 months. Also.. how quicky can this be rigged up? My address is serviced and this week would be great! Do I need to be home? Sorry.. internet user through the ages early 90s to present but totally new to NBN. Also standalone house not apartment if that helps Thank you!",

For this, there is a long driveway that is concrete which extends up until my front door. There is no dirt patches on the driveway at all. Would the driveway need to have a trench dug out for the LIC to go completely under it? Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "G'day, Some context: I'm renting In a house that shares the same address as my landlord. The houses are about 30m away from each other. There is an underground wired connection going from a wall in my landlord's house (let's call this the \"main\") and coming out the wall in my house (call this \"secondary\"). The cable would have been run years ago so likely cat5 or cat5e between the two. This underground run has been cable tested and there is a solid connection. Recently the main house got an NBN upgrade and an NBN box got installed inside the house. Current setup: NBN box in the main house has a wired connection to a TP-link archer vr400 router and provides working internet to the entire main house. Cat6 ethernet cable running from the Archer to the wall of the main house. Out of the wall in the secondary house to a TP-link TL-WR841 router that is setup as an AP. However, there is no internet. Prior to the NBN installation I was getting some strange dodgy but working connection going out the wall in the secondary house to a Netgear modem WAN port, out the Netgear LAN port to my TPlink router (set as an AP). This was providing solid download but 0 upload. Now with the nbn upgrade things have stopped working again. I have spent many hours trying to work this out but I feel as if I've come to a dead end. Any help would be appreciated. Networking isn't my strong suit but I've definitely have learnt a lot trying to work this out so should be able to follow along with any troubleshooting advice. Thanks in advance. Tl;dr Optus has me by the balls.",

This is weird as we used to be able to have a stable connection with 3-5 devices doing heavy usage. We're south Brisbane with no reports of outages or maintenance in the area. Any possibilities for fixing this or troubleshooting would be much appreciated. Updates: having from the coax to the router all off and reconnecting has yielded no different results :(.

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone. A bit of a strange one. We just moved into a rental. It’s an older place (built in 1940/50s) and before we moved in we signed up with a provider for FTTN. According to all of the ISP’s I’ve spoken to, the house is listed as NBN ready. However, we cannot find a telephone socket anywhere in the home. We have checked everywhere, above cupboards, in cupboards, we checked when the house was fully empty, and there is nothing. ISP’s are saying there definitely should be one. The only sockets we can find other than regular PowerPoints are for the TV antenna. We have checked in with the owner about this however we are expecting that they will not know either, as they only recently purchased the property, and have never lived in it. We could upgrade with FTTP. However we are fine with using the FTTN as it is cheaper and meets our needs and in theory will be connected more quickly than FTTP. Does anyone know how I can figure out if there ever was a telephone point? Is it worth getting one installed, or should we just seek permission for the FTTP install and wait for that to be connected? Any experiences or suggestions welcome! I’m stumped!",

I think our neighbour has an interior NTD but not certain, however we just have a Cat5e cable hanging out of the wall in the garage and the other end is hanging out beside the box on the outer wall. I've been in touch with an ISP who said that we will need to lodge a new development application with nbn as the location IDs are the same for both units and the main address - there are three addresses listed on here . Haven't heard back from our property manager yet so I went online and filled in the nbn form. Turns out that to get the \"new development\" submitted we will have to pay for both units at $600 each. I was expecting a $300 charge which we'd be fine to pay, but $1200 for a property we don't even own is a bit fucking far fetched to be honest. Our property manager assumed that the place had nbn, and we only discovered that it didn't after we had moved in. Obviously if both properties require a new development application then the owner should be paying for it. We desperately need an internet connection here and just signed a 12 month lease on the place. Has anyone experienced this before? What are our options here?",

      "content_preview": "Hi team. I’m not big on tech, I thought I was alright and then I read this sub and realised I have some learning to do ha! I need some advice. We have always used the modem our isp gave us which was fine in our apartment but now in a bigger (not huge) house, it’s only two and a half bedrooms but is 100 years old. We have HFC. I want to buy a new modem router. Or do I just need a router as I have the nbn box? If so, what are some good recs? Looking to spend either side of $200. We don’t game, only two of us and just do basic streaming. The house is longish, so need some range as it can be quite slow in the front room, modem is toward end of house in living room. Appreciate your advice!",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I'm preparing for an FTTP install to my place. I'm following the NBN's instructions. It's a new build, I'm installing everything from scratch, including Lead-In-Conduit (LIC), Premises-Connection-Device (PCD), internal cabling, etc... Just wondering, does anyone have an idea about which particular PCD model is being used on new installs presently (2025)? On page 25 of this specification, Residential Preparation and Installation - Single Dwelling Units (SDUs) and Multi-Dwelling Units (MDUs) , they mention there are two different types of PCDs. The reason I'm trying to find out is so I can pre-install the external LIC and the internal conduit at the right distance apart from each other. With a 'Madison PCD' the distance between the centre lines of two conduits should be 143mm, whereas, if a 'Corning PCD' is used, then distance between the two should be 80mm. https://preview.redd.it/which-model-external-pcd-is-being-used-on-new-fttp-v0-rb2ig1zxg4mf1.png I suppose that one way around this would be punch the internal conduit through the external wall where the PCD is going to be installed, but then wait and not completely finish running the last leg of the external LIC where it rises out of the ground. That way, I can run the last leg vertical part of the LIC on the day when the PCD gets installed, and finish off the LIC to meet it at whatever distance is needed. What do folks think? Am I on the right track here?",

Every single month I have to call them and explain how the account that's connected for them to take payment has much much more than is needed just for them. They then argue a bit back and forth and wave the fee and I paid the normal price. I don't get it, they make no attempt to withdraw the money, just get an email saying they tried to withdraw but couldn't, so I get a fee. Seems like a scan to take $10 extra dollars for nothing. No other bill company has any problems taking their payment.",

Well with the wholesale speed increases coming next month it seemed like a good time to upgrade to FTTP from FTTC since NBN never ended up enabling G.Fast on the FTTC DPUs so I would need to upgrade to take advantage. Today was the appointment, everything seemed to be going well and I had internet via the new FTTP connection while he was here when he finished, did a speed test and let a friend know that my fibre was installed, yay!. 10 minutes after he left... no more internet. I checked the NTD and the optical light is red. Spent 45 minutes on the phone with ISP getting handed around to 4 people, told by the first I was still on FTTC and after I insisted that the NBN tech had literally just finished installing FTTP half an hour earlier, was then told accounts would have to fix that issue with service type on my account, then the person they transferred me to attempted to initiate an FTTC to FTTP upgrade installation and started reading me a blurb about the plan they were going to sign me up for, which I had literally just told them had already been done and that was what I was calling about and they said oh, that's not what I do, was then handed to another to fix that account detail so that the new connection type was in the system so they could help me with it, during that time, their system updated itself anyway, so they handed me to a technical team member and was told there's an NBN planned outage (which I believe was actually only for the work the tech did in the pit to prepare for our upgrade and nbn's site doesn't show any outage for my address). So anyway they said they can't help until after 7pm when that was supposed to end and they'll call me back to see if the optical light is green yet. After that on a hunch I moved my router back to the old FTTC connection, and that one is still working just fine so surely the fibre out in the pit is ok and the issue is something with the fibre (likely with connectors?) between the pit and the NTD so I called them again and told them that the FTTC is working while the FTTP still shows red optical light and they did some test and said they'd escalate to engineering or something and I should get a phone call within a day. I'm glad the FTTC connection is still working for now, hopefully that doesn't get disconnected before they eventually fix my FTTP service...",

      "content_preview": "https://preview.redd.it/switched-from-iinet-to-leaptel-500-50-plan-but-am-not-v0-ukom6pzyeikf1.png Switched over too Leaptel today on there 500/50 plan ahead of the upgrade. While download is good, upload seems to be at 20mpbs any ideas? Using the iiNet router , VX420-G2h that can support this upload speed and the speed test was done over ethernet. SOLVED Edit: Thanks everyone for your help here is how i did it: I had to first factory reset the router to remove any previous setting TPG/iinet had set, so make sure you have your connection details from your provider for me from leaptel it was PPPoE.Once reset do not reboot the router until finished, as this could allow for the setting from TPG/iinet to be reapplied. Now login your routers setting, mine was using 192.168.1.1 but you can find your on the bottom of the router with the password being admin unless you have changed yours. once in go to advanced --> Network --> EWAN First delete the TPG one there, you wont be needing that, (and for the record i performed the previous steps until this point quickly in the fear it would connect back to TPG servers and limit my router again). You may have to click delete or delete all a few times for it to work once deleted click ADD. Then scroll down to where it says advanced again and click it. Then enable  \"Use the Following DNS Addresses\" You will hopefully see a primary and secondary DNS addresses, now it wont let you make them both invalided so for my primary i changed it too 10.0.0.1 while keeping secondary blank (0.0.0.0). Once done, click ok or save.  From my understanding this removes the ability for TPG/iiNET to communicate settings with the router, hence remove the ability to limit the speed. But also removes the ability for you to connect with web pages or something, next we fix that. Ok next go to LAN settings still under the internet tab in advance In LAN settings scroll down to your just above client list to where it says Primary DNS and Secondary DNS change this to 8.8.8.8 for primary and 8.8.4.4 for secondary.  From my understanding this allows for you to access the internet again and the DNS 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are run by google. If you dont want that idk why, im sure you can find alternatives. Once you click save you may then reboot your router.  Hopefully this works long term! I will update if not so",

While looking at getting our internet connected when we settle, the address doesn’t come up on the NBN website or any internet provider websites. I called the NBN co & they checked whether there was a pending application to register the property for NBN, there isn’t. This would lead me to believe the builders haven’t made provisions for a connection at the property. Anyone dealt with this? What do I do!! Shouldn’t it be standard in new builds??",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been out of the country for 5 years, which could be why I can’t understand this. Before I left, all I could get to my house was Coaxial sh*te at a max of 100. It was NBN and the only choice I had was whose logo went on the bills (I went with Aussie Broadband as they have a reasonable customer service dept.) Since I’ve been back there are so many NBN adverts in my feed. I thought they perhaps had a new product but following their links, it’s the same offering. They didn’t advertise before I left so am confused. Why are they advertising and is there anything different? Is there now a “non-NBN” choice? Seems really weird to try and sell what people already have.",
