After digging deeper into the Autopilot logs.  A more specific error the devices are getting is \"timed out while waiting for all policy providers to provide a list of policies\".  Autopilot has been working flawlessly for us for over 3 years with no known changes over the summer but now provisioning does not work. Our SE devices are the only ones failing.  We have a handful of Win 10/11 staff laptops that provision just fine. Details: - User Driven Deployment - All devices are in the correct groups - Users are properly licensed - Tried multiple different ESP profiles - Cleaned up multiple old policies that no longer apply I am not the smartest tool in the shed so if there is anybody that could help that would be great.",

      "content_preview": "For anyone not familiar, I have a little project called the OpenIntuneBaseline (OIB), a comprehensive set of Intune policies that are industry aligned with the likes of CIS, NCSC etc, but go far beyond that and cover a ton of great user experience settings. It's used a lot . Oh, and they don't cause a bunch of conflicts or break stuff! Historically I've been using the IntuneManagement tool as a way for people to be able to import the OIB, but I've been working on a web-based, user-friendly tool to be able to deploy and version-check existing OIB deployments, and it's finally ready! Features: New Deployments: Allows granular control over policy deployment. Import as much or as little as you want! Existing Deployments: Validate your OIB policies against the latest version, allowing quick and easy views on what's outdated or new. Completely browser-based, using MSAL Authentication. MIT Licensed: Not comfortable using my Enterprise App? No problem! Grab the code and host it yourself or run it locally! Want to try it out? Website: https://deploy.openintunebaseline.com/ GitHub: https://github.com/SkipToTheEndpoint/OIBDeployer Already using the OIB? Go drop a Star on the GitHub repo , we're almost at 1k!",

Here‚Äôs the reality: The image from the hardware vendor is always outdated. Windows Updates and driver updates via PowerShell take forever. Autopilot / Device Preparation Policy is marketed as this seamless, zero-touch dream, but in practice, it‚Äôs clunky, unpredictable, and requires a ridiculous amount of scripting and workarounds to get even close to functional. How are you installing Windows (with updates and drivers) as part of your Autopilot flow? I'm genuinely curious how others are dealing with this, because at this point it feels like we're duct-taping a system together that used to just work with SCCM, WDS, MDT and WSUS. Autopilot + Intune might look good on a slide deck, but in the real world, it feels like we‚Äôve gone back two decades in terms of control, speed, and reliability. I‚Äôm done with it! Would love to hear how others are surviving this.",

I've deployed the Dell Command | Endpoint Configure for Microsoft Intune app to a test device and installed the .NET Runtime 8 . I then used Dell Command Configure to set up my admin password. I edited the file to input my old BIOS password before uploading the .cctk file into the Intune BIOS configuration policy. The first test was successful. I then wanted to see what would happen if there was no password set. So I manually removed the BIOS password and reapplied the policy. This is when I removed the device with the pending status, which I later found out I shouldn't have done. I created another policy for devices without BIOS passwords. I added the device to this policy, but it was stuck in a pending state and the password didn't change. I then manually set up the password again and changed it again using the old policy. The password changed, but the device was still in a pending state. I checked the logs and it said that the BIOS configuration operation was successful, but the CCTK exit code was 146 I tried removing the policy again, manually changing the password, and then changing it using the policy, but the device is still in a pending state. Is there anything I can do to fix this? Thanks",

It takes such a huge workload off our shoulders when it comes to quickly roll out updates for third party applications and we're pretty much hooked. PMPC also offer very good support and are quick to answer any questions we've had so far. So all in all I can really recommend PMPC as a company and as PMPC Cloud as a product. We do however have one issue that I would like to check in with the community to see what experience others may have. I'm not sure if it could be something specific with our Azure/Intune setup which fuels this issue, but we do see quite a few deployments in the PMPC Cloud portal with a failed status. I did the math and figured it's roughly 25% of all my active deployments at this moment. The error message is, as far as I've noticed always: The sync of the [application name] has failed. The Intune application could not be synced. I did put in a ticket and I was assured that the deployment would retry according to our sync schedule, and I'm not very concerned about this problem other than it's annoying whenever you're in the PMPC Cloud portal to see the red status. If I'm not taking notes of which apps that are in this state (which I am now), I would only just assume that certain apps are always failed. Pushing the \"Recreate\" button resolves the issue, but I really don't want to push a button to make things gel and besides, pressing recreate resets any customizations done outside of the PMPC Cloud portal (i.e. custom requirement scripts). So anyway - any other PMPC Cloud customers who can chirp in with their experience? Thank you in advance!",

Devices sitting in an \"Updates Paused - Your organisation paused some updates for this device\" The Configure Update Policies under the following area - Settings - Windows Update - Advanced Options - Configured Update Policies. Being switched to GPO. I know there was an issue last year when the KB4023057 caused similar behaviour to happen. I know this KB is vital as it installs the Windows Health Tool, which is required to use the expedite feature. These two devices which I am seeing this on are freshly built Windows 11 23H2 devices. I signed in to both devices and after about half hour or so I could all the updates downloading. So I am wondering if the KB4023057 broke the update policies registries. Below are screenshots from the affected machine registry - Screenshots I below the last highlighted one is the culprit here and the GPCache keys. What do you all think?",

Custom Script Renaming ‚Üí You can now rename your scripts to whatever makes sense for your setup.

      "content_preview": "First things first, this is not a Classic Teams to New Teams migration topic :) New Teams is now installed on windows 11 by default starting from 24h2, so it shouldn't cause big problems, but I find some issues in managing it at deployment/patching level since Teams was separated from Office. It seems Windows update is not taking care of Teams despite having \"update also other microsoft products\" enforced. I noticed a couple of weeks ago a Security recommendation on Defender about a new vulnerability in older New Team versions and found a surprisingly high number of impacted devices, most probably given by the bootstrapper installer. Per user clients updates should be mandated automatically via Microsoft, there's no policy to influence it on Teams center, so I was thinking maybe I could find an alternative way of performing and expediting the update of the installer via Intune. I tried to test the Teams deployment via new MS store, a source which should take care of the updates as well. At first the deployment looked all right on existing devices, but Teams installation is blocking pre-provisioning, which was kinda unexpected. I've also tested winget, but that returned several 'app not detected after successful  installation'. Before venturing in other territories, I'd like to know how are you handling Teams deployment and patching, if you do at some level.",

The main point of this post is how does one un-grey the \"Add new location\".  Instead of specifying a trusted location for many devices, we'd like to see if we can narrow it down to a user-specified thing (We are aware of how insecure this is). To the best of my knowledge, I've \"configured\" and \"Not configured\" the appropriate bits in our relaxed security baseline but this button just won't un-grey.  It almost feels like it's not meant to be clickable anymore by design in a hyper-cybersafe-aware world. This wouldn't be an issue if we hosted the files on a SMB capable storage solution and the files in question could be brought down to the users' devices. But it's what it's. thank you for your time.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, Im sorry for the long post. I'm dealing with a user complaint where a Windows 11 device (23H2 -> 24H2 feature update) allegedly forced a restart during a Zoom meeting without any prior warnings or notifications. The user is adamant she received no pop-ups, toast notifications, or warnings about an impending restart. Our Intune update ring policy is configured with a 7-day deadline. My goal is to forensically check the device to prove whether the user did or did not receive the standard update notifications after that 7-day period passed. I need help from the community on where to look for definitive evidence. I have full admin access to the device and Intune. What I've checked already: ¬∑ Intune Device > Device Timeline: Shows the \"Scheduled Restart\" and \"Restart\" events, but only confirms what happened, not what the user saw. ¬∑ Windows Update Logs ( C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate ): I've looked here but finding user-facing notification evidence is tricky. ¬∑ Intune Management Extension (IME) Logs: Reviewed, but they seem more focused on the installation process itself. My specific questions are: Where are the specific ETW/Event Logs or traces that record when a notification is displayed to the user? I'm looking for something that logs events like \"Update Notification Toast Displayed\" or \"Restart Warning Dialog Box Shown\". Is there a specific Event Log (e.g., Event Viewer) that is best for this? I've poked around Application and System logs but haven't found a smoking gun yet. Are there any Intune-specific logs or reports that might show the notification status communicated from the client back to the cloud? Could the \"Active Hours\" or \"Engaged Restart\" settings have failed silently, making the system think it was okay to restart outside of active use? Any guidance on the exact log names, locations (e.g., C:\\Windows\\Logs... or specific Event Viewer paths), or even PowerShell commands to parse this data would be incredibly helpful. I need to build a solid case one way or the other. Thanks in advance.",

Changed the HDD in the bios from RAID to AHCI and I was able to reset successfully :) I know this isn't so much an intune issue - but I'm banging my head against a wall trying to figure this out. We purchased 500 devices from Dell 3 years ago - these were imaged under Windows 10, enrolled & provisioned at Dell before being sent to us (White Glove, I think?). We were able to use the Ctrl+Win+R @ login screen to initiate a reset on these just fine. Since April, we've tossed basically the entire intune config & rebuilt our policies, apps, etc to coincide with Windows 11. A major outstanding issue I have is that every time I try to reset the device (Ctrl+Win+R, or going to settings > Reset this PC > Remove everything) it never succeeds. It boots me into the WinRE environment, but with the options to Troubleshoot, open a command prompt, etc. Rebooting from here the device says that the reset failed. checking with The Oracle (ChatGPT) & running Reagent.exe shows the following: WinRE status is enabled WinRE location looks good (GlobalRoot identifier to a recovery partition) However the Recovery Image location is blank, as is the Custom Image Location. ChatGPT seems to think that this should point to a .WIM located somewhere on the computer. Is this correct? Should there be a full Windows .WIM located on the device to facilitate recovery? Or am I barking up the wrong tree?",

They made a strange attempt at utilizing groups to manage update rings for autopatch but a lot of it seems to be not working or misconfigured. I would like to revamp it to make more sense but the sheer volume of devices and grouping them seems daunting. Could I use a couple dynamic rings for the main devices group that's being used to set enrollment for said 3000+ machines and then separate some explicit groups for exceptions that would be testing and early adopters or will the dynamic rings overtake the smaller explicit groups?

      "content_preview": "Alright, it‚Äôs come to me making my own post about Remote Help not working.. I‚Äôd like to start by saying I have 0 access or visibility to the firewall or any network devices because a separate IT department manages it. I work at a college campus in a sub-IT department and I‚Äôve been trying to setup Remote Help for our devices to replace TightVNC (I don‚Äôt wanna hear it, I inherited this mess) I‚Äôve set up everything correctly within Intune for Remote Help - it‚Äôs been pushed to devices and setup, as well as the Company Portal and I‚Äôve setup the RBAC roles. Every time I go to initiate a ‚ÄúNew remote assistance session‚Äù, it just gets stuck on ‚ÄúSending notification to user‚Äôs device‚Äù and then fails stating ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt send notification to user‚Äôs device.‚Äù and to make sure that the device is on and connected to the internet. I‚Äôm able to do a Remote Help session from device to device with 0 issue, but not from Intune. I factory reset a device to rule out the potential of device configurations conflicting with it, I‚Äôve connected to hotspots, I‚Äôve ensured the application was permitted through the device‚Äôs firewall, I‚Äôve even looped in Microsoft Support to review my settings and confirm that everything was set correctly. I‚Äôve watched youtube videos of people setting it up and it works with ease for them, I‚Äôve also read their documentation on how to set it up and troubleshoot and no luck. I‚Äôm kind of at a dead end here. I‚Äôve checked the Company Portal for notifications as well and nothing there. For some reason in Intune when I go to Remote Help Sessions, it only lists a few sessions that were created when I attempted to connect to these devices, even though I never connected not even once. The only thing I think I have to work with that may indicate a connection was coming in is these events in Event Viewer that are Event ID 14 that says: INFO: {‚Äúcommand‚Äù:‚Äùforwardtoagent‚Äù, ‚Äúcontext‚Äù:{‚Äúcommand‚Äù:‚Äùuserrequest‚Äù,‚Äùcontext‚Äù:{‚Äúinternetconnected‚Äù:true,‚Äùrequestname‚Äù:‚Äùnetworkstatuschanged‚Äù}}} That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got to work with. I hope, but at the same time don‚Äôt, that someone else has run into a similar issue and was able to resolve it with like a stupid easy step or button that was missed. Please. I‚Äôve been going at this for about 2 weeks now and I have tried eliminating just about any possible interference that could be prevent it from working.",

I‚Äôve noticed that on almost all our Windows 11 devices, File Explorer opens automatically on startup - specifically, the Documents folder. and if the user is signed in to OneDrive, it opens OneDrive\\Documents. I don't know where to start looking or which policy could be causing this behavior. I did find a OneDrive policy applied via Intune with the following settings: Prompt users to move known folders: Enabled Silently move known folders: Enabled Prevent users from redirecting folders back: Enabled Show notification after redirection: No Could this policy be related to the issue, or is there another known cause for File Explorer opening at every startup?",

      "content_preview": "Hey guys, some of you may know the tool \"Run-in-Sandbox\" (or RiS for short) by MVP Damien van Robaeys https://github.com/damienvanrobaeys/Run-in-Sandbox This tool is great and helps incredibly with testing various things in the windows sandbox and for most users here mostly with testing intunewin files before pushing them to intune and with a clean system. As some of you know, the original tool hasnt been updated in quite a while and is basically un-maintained anymore. Therefore to improve the tool and fix bugs, i have forked it here https://github.com/Joly0/Run-in-Sandbox and since added some new features, fixed bugs (i basically fixed every single open issue on the main repo in my fork), made it easier to work with (from a dev standpoint), etc. I tried to get those changes integrated into the main project, but well, its not that easy. I have tried to contact Damien through mail over the past 2 years multiple times. At the beginning he answered me, but he stopped a while back and hasnt responded to any of my mails since then. Threfore i will slowly turn my fork into a normal project (so un-forking it) and will add new features that i find useful (for example an update-check for a new version). I have credited Damien for his great work in my readme (did this a while back already) but i declare myself as the current maintainer of this project. So any issues with the tool should be tested with my fork and then reported on my repo and any feature request should better be requested on my fork aswell. Although the current project is still the most starred for Damien, i do not think there will be any (big) updates in the future. I still thank him for his hard work on the project and all he has done. Thanks for reading Julian aka Joly0",

      "content_preview": "Hey Intune Community :) It‚Äòs my first post here, so go easy on me. üòÖ I‚Äôve been working on a little side project as I thought it might be useful for others too: swiftDialog ESP Configurator. The idea was to make it easier to build a custom Enrollment Status Page (ESP) for macOS without needing to touch scripts or JSON files f.e. from the Microsoft GitHub repository etc. I know, that there are other solutions for this, but I was looking for something lightweight and free. Some of the things it does so far: Show device-specific info during onboarding (serial, username, etc.) Add your own branding and progress messages Just new: keep users on the Enrollment screen until required apps are installed ‚Äî so they only land on the desktop once everything‚Äôs ready All through a web UI, no scripting required I‚Äòm also planning on adding some curated scripts sometime soon. If you wish to collaborate on that, then feel free to hit me up here or via LinkedIn. üòä For me, this makes deployments look way more polished and gives users a smoother onboarding experience. I‚Äôd really love your feedback ‚Äî ideas, criticism, feature requests, anything that could make it more useful to the community. üôè You can check it out here: https://www.mac-esp.com Thanks for having me, and looking forward to learning from you all! üí™",
