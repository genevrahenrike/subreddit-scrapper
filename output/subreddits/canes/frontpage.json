Can we tailgate in the parking lot beforehand? I bought tickets for the whole fam (5 total) and was hoping to get some good seats for the kids. Appreciate any info you can provide!",

The Carolina Hurricanes Foundation is looking to build on a historic year in which it donated $1.7 million to support programs and initiatives that uplift communities across the Triangle and North Carolina during the 2024-25 season. “Coming off our most impactful year ever, the Community Game is our next big step forward,” said Amy Daniels, Executive Director of the Carolina Hurricanes Foundation. “Every seat filled, every dollar raised, helps us continue doing the work that matters most — from hurricane relief to youth programs to health and education support.” Discounted general admission tickets to the game go on sale on Wednesday for $10 and will be available for purchase at this link . Reserved first row seats on the glass will be available for $100, and reserved seats in the second through fifth rows will be sold for $50. Remaining seats to the event are available on a first-come, first-served basis, and fans may purchase up to eight tickets. In addition to the special discounted tickets, parking for the game will be complimentary with additional donations accepted. “The Community Game is where our values as an organization shine brightest,” said Warf. “This isn’t just about hockey — it’s about heart, and about giving back to the people who make North Carolina special.”",

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",

At the end of June we welcomed a sweet ball of floof to the family. (No, she doesn't have a Canes related name!) I have often said that Jarvy is the human equivalent of a kitten with the zoomies!
