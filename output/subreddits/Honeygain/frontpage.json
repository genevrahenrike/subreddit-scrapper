My setup is: PC on home Wi-Fi (always online) Phone on mobile data only (always online, never on Wi-Fi) This way I have two separate IPs, and until recently I was earning around 200+ credits per day consistently. However, for some reason, over the past few days my daily earnings suddenly dropped to around 40 credits/day,  without me changing anything in my setup. Has anyone else experienced such a big drop lately? Could it be related to IP changes, lower demand, or something else on Honeygain‚Äôs side? Any advice to bring my earnings back up would be much appreciated! Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "Don't use the JumpTask mode, and don't complete any tasks on JumpTask.  You can search this subreddit and find all the people who are having issues with this service.  Sure, there are also people that have had no issues, but the number of people that ARE having issues makes it clear that they are scamming people. First, it is claimed that you get 10% more money by running Honeygain in JumpTask mode.  However, the tokens depreciate in value quickly, so that 10% will disappear quickly. Second, when completing tasks they usually pay the equivalent of 1-4 pennies per task.  Those tasks might take you anywhere from 2-10 minutes to complete.  How much is your time worth?  Also keep in mind the rapid depreciation of these tokens mentioned in the first point.  They can also tell you that you didn't complete the task correctly and not pay you, at their own discretion. Third, they will ban your account for their own ineptitude.  This is what happened to me.  They claimed that I was trying to complete offers more than once.  The reality is that I received an error message when completing an offer, so I attempted it again.  I also noticed that even offers that successfully completed would still show in the list of available offers.  I don't know about you, but I'm not going to remember which casinos I already did google searches for, when half the offers are for casinos. Fourth, when they eventually ban your account, they will confiscate all the money that you \"earned.\"  If a website can automatically ban your account, surely they can update tasks on the website to reflect which ones you have already completed.  But it's probably much easier to just ban you and take the money.",

But after installing Honeygain on Linux, the earnings are super low. On Windows, I get around 5 to 7 honeys per hour. On Linux, I barely make 5 to 7 a day, sometimes even less.
