      "content_preview": "A female student is dead and several others have been injured in a major school bus rollover at Stonehaven, just outside of Geelong. Multiple fire crews, paramedics and police are at the scene of the incident at the intersection of the Hamilton Highway and Friend In Hand Rd. It’s understood a Christian College bus, believed to be carrying about 40 students, crashed. A yet-to-be identified girl died at the scene and another male has been seriously injured. His condition is not yet known. Other students have also been injured. Officers from Geelong’s Major Collision Investigation Unit and highway patrol officers have arrived. A number of children were in blankets and being transferred onto another bus before leaving this morning. Crews were first alerted to the crash about 8.20am. An Ambulance Victoria spokesman said their priority was with their patients. “An update will be provided as information becomes available.” The Department of Transport confirmed the Hamilton Hwy was closed in both directions for a stretch between Inverleigh and Geelong, due to the serious collision. “Motorists should consider using the Geelong Ring Road, Princes Highway and Inverleigh-Winchelsea Road, adding nearly 30km to the journey,” a statement said. “The closure is under the control of Victoria Police, and the road will be reopened once investigations are complete, and it is safe to do so. “Our signals team is monitoring conditions and will adjust traffic lights as needed to minimise congestion for detouring traffic.” Reported by GeelongAdvertiser https://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/bus-crash-at-stonehaven-intersection-prompts-major-emergency-response/news-story/32f48155a3d62f26ab4026c9aad64ded",

      "content_preview": "This is honestly a last ditch effort for me to find some help for my stomach issues, this is embarrassing to post publicly. Ive had ibs symptoms everyday for the last 3 years following chemo. Its become debilitating, i dont leave my house unless I need to and often need to call off sick for work or events because im so sick. But this means I can't pay my bills. My current gp just tells me it's stress or diet. Ive done the low fodmap diet and have tracked my mood in relation to my stomach problems and there is no link. The chemo drs said its not their issue (despite the chemo most likely caused this) and my gp didn't really want to touch it as he thinks it's their territory as he doesn't know the side effects of the specific regime i was on. As my ovaries were ravaged by the chemo i thought maybe 1. It could be a contributing factor and 2. There was never any investigation/follow up so i don't know what is actually happening inside me. Just that itll be hard to have children. Ive used the toilet at least 4 times daily over these 3 years. I throw up average once a week. Pork possibly makes it worse but at the same time eating plain rice has also set my belly off. I had cdiff part way through chemo caused by my medication stripping my stomach bacteria. And have never recovered. Ive gone from 125kg to 90kg and im not doing anything different from when I was gaining the weight. Even the fodmap diet didn't change the speed of my weight loss (i presumed id lose more on that diet). My stomach swells with gas and wakes me around 3-4am every morning, feeling like im going to vomit and then I'll sit on the toilet for an hour or 2 Ive been searching and have been turned away from every dr people have recommended to me because they arent accepting new patients. The latest ray of hope was a dr that also specialised in female anatomy. But unfortunately ive been calling this drs office back every couple of weeks as instructed and its at the 2 month mark so im giving up. Surely the city is big enough theres another dr! So basically, I need a gp specialising in ibs, gynaeno and overall gastrointestinal stuff. Please help me! 😫",

A pair would be awesome, but I'd very happily accept only one if the opportunity appears. Does anyone have any idea where I can go or who I could contact to purchase these plastic appendages? I have only thus far been able to find shops in America who sell secondhand (ha) mannequin parts, but I would much prefer Australian arms. I am not a racist I just don't want to have to deal with my arm going through customs. I swear this isn't a perversion. I like dark art and it is involved in my work. I also like drawing on skin, but my friends are all heavily tattooed :( Thank you for reading",

We've had issues with it before, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's tree roots again. The previous plumber we had out didn't have the right equipment and ended up calling in someone else to help, so I'd prefer to go straight to a local Geelong Plumber(Belmont) that specialises in blocked drains, with all the right equipment to fix properly. Any recommendations? Edit: We used Bay Plumbing & Drainage, and they were fantastic. Came out on Saturday, cleared the drain, did a CCTV check, and sent the full report with footage by email. Really professional and highly recommend! https://bayplumbingdrainage.com.au",

I tried calling national heating and cooling to see if someone could come around to service the unit, make sure it’s running properly and hopefully give me a quick tutorial on how to operate it but they said they only do units they have personally installed.

      "content_preview": "Throwaway account. A bit about myself, I had recently graduated high school and decided to do a gap year. I was also pretty emotionally vulnerable around the same time they first approached so I was a perfect target. Also I am religious Around the end of last year, I was approached at Westfield by two friendly girls who asked for help with shopping. I didn’t think much of it as they were bubbly, kind and started casual conversation. After chatting a bit, we exchanged details and made plans to hang out. Not long after they introduced me to another friend of theirs and later a teacher. The teacher invited us all to join a Bible study as a way to understand the Bible more deeply. I’m an easily influenced person and also through the process of love bombing, when all my “friends” wanted to join, I reluctantly agreed as well. Eventually I was invited to a larger Zoom class by the teacher who proclaimed it as a great opportunity. I thought I was learning with other newcomers but I found out that everyone that introduced me to this Bible study class was already in on it and they are pretending to be new to make it seem normal and safe. I guess red flags did pop up but I seemly ignored them because my “friends” really enjoyed the classes and I didn’t want to doubt them. It wasn’t until recently that I did some snooping around online which the group forbade. They never told me the group’s name but I’ve now found out it's Shincheonji, a Korean based cult and it’s active across Melbourne, Geelong and other parts of Australia. Everything matches up and I’m shaken up to my core right now. I think the scariest part is they know where I live. I genuinely thought of them as friends and for them to have lying to my face from the beginning in order to recruit me to the cult is so fucking disingenuous. I genuinely do not know how to process the whole situation and I feel so lost. Nobody knows that I’ve found out this information and I’m looking to leave and cut off all contacts immediately. Please if anyone has any tips/advice on what should do please let me know TLDR: Joined a cult and need help on how to leave safely",

      "content_preview": "Every weekend without fail, my neighbours blast bass-heavy music until the early hours of the morning. I’m talking 3:00AM and beyond, with windows rattling and walls vibrating. This has been going on for years. You can hear it three streets away, and even in the furthest room of my house it’s unbearable, especially when trying to sleep and earbuds/plugs aren’t sustainable at this point (believe me I have tried) I’ve reported it to both council and police countless times, but nothing ever changes—it’s been nearly a two-year back and forth with no real progress. I’ve tried asking them nicely, but I just get told to “piss off” or “get a life” or just completely ignored by their teenage sons. There’s absolutely no point in knocking on their door again—it will never result in anything different, only more hostility. And just to be clear—before anyone says anything—I’m all for people listening to music. But when the bass is cranked so high that it vibrates houses two doors down, it stops being “just music” and becomes a real disturbance. This isn’t a once-off party either; it’s constant, deliberate, and sometimes goes from 7:00AM all the way until 3:00AM the next day—even on weekdays like Monday. It’s reached the point where I’m constantly anxious. I can’t relax in my own home, I dread weekends, and I even worry about my car being targeted because they know it’s mine when I complain. The Geelong Police or Council (or even the EPA) don’t do much, and now the house has started blasting music on weekdays while I’m working from home. The worst part is, both neighbours directly next to the offending house are elderly. They’ve told me they hear it too, but they’re too frightened of this family to speak up because of their aggressive behaviour and recklessness. We’ve even seen their teenage boys climbing onto the roof of the house. That should tell you something about how little care or responsibility goes on there. I’ve kept thorough evidence each time this happens and sent it through to council, and while there is technically an “open investigation,” I don’t expect much to come of it. Meanwhile, I feel like my right to peace and quiet enjoyment of my home. We also have very sick grandparents we’re trying to care for, and the fact that this family can’t show even the slightest decency or respect makes it all the more unbearable. I’ve genuinely reached my limit. Does anyone have any suggestions?",
