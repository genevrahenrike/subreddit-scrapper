They started out off fine where they were on the right track up to Season 4, until the last few seasons forced it!Whenever I look at people listing strong female leads done right, I barely ever see people including these two on there (not even Daenerys Targaryen) and probably for good reason given how much David Benioff and D.B Weiss (the showrunners) sabotaged their writing to the point that it just became very cringe to watch.It felt like they didn‚Äôt really know what else to do with these two, other than having them continuously using their trauma and forcing it down people‚Äôs throats where they believe it automatically makes them special, a badass and the most competent people in the room.There was potential for them to have great development, but the lazy writing just wasn‚Äôt doing it any justice where the credibility they kept insisting they had felt earned.Kim Wexler from Better Call Saul I think really set the gold standard for a strong female lead done right! I can‚Äôt wait to see what her and Vince Gilligan bring to the table in her next series; Pluribus!",

This has been asked a couple times and time and time again Black Sails was among the top choices.People told me the first season was tough; I felt myself quickly losing interest as the first few episodes went on. And then I made it to the last episode and thought why not finish the season?It was like a lightbulb went on about 10minutes through. It got better. I feel like it took 7 episodes to find its footing and I‚Äôm at episode one of the second season on the edge of my seat.The characters felt understood. The pacing sped up, thank goodness. Pirates were suddenly acting like pirates.I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next!",

We watch him over the years grow from a rebellious teenager to a responsible, happy adult with a great job and marriage he works hard for. And he does it all his own way, finding his path in the world through many trials of tribulations.Then, it feels like the writers ran out of ideas for what to do with him, and they flush it all down the toilet. His wife leaves him, he loses the job, and ends up a loser in a flop house where he doesn't pay rent. And it all happens off screen! It's completely out of left field and, frankly, just sucks.Sure, he ends up happy with his office job in the end, but it's just as rushed as his fall is, and clearly just to wrap up loose ends in the finale. I don't even remember if he gets back with Piama.",

However, I feel like it‚Äôs not utilizing the biggest plot point, the fact that the xenomorphs are now on Earth. They should feel like a ticking time bomb that underpins the whole show with existential anxiety (ie early seasons White Walkers). They could have let the first xeno escape the crash with an egg, turn into a queen and start building the army. Instead they killed it and had the life cycle restart, basically playing the same beat twice of the creature growing and escaping containment. Hopefully, they can ramp up the threat level because ending the season without delivering on the Earth aspect would definitely leave a bad taste.",
