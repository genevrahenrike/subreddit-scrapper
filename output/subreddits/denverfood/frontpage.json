      "content_preview": "I was at Chubby Cattle last night on S Broadway (corner is E Ellsworth) and our server sought to upsell us on the membership program they have. They explained that in addition to their current location on the corner, they will be opening up Chubby BBQ (think Japanese DIY tabletop meat grilling), which will be in Mutiny’s old spot on the corner across the street. The deal promo includes a free meal at the new location as well as their existing location. Still sad Mutiny is gone (yes, I know they’re not far away but they were a cornerstone of the S Broadway neighborhood) but at least there will be one less vacancy in the neighborhood. At any rate, it will be interesting to see how this plays out.",

They are also not transparent with pricing and add 4% to your bill for the kitchen staff, then want you to tip on top of that.

And holy shit $9 for a tiny tub of roasted veggie cream cheese?  And to top it off, the counter service asking for a 22% tip - and the order with just bagels and CC took 15 minutes to fulfill. Rumors are that the people who own Rosenberg’s are jerks. And they’re even worse with their prices but at least the bagels are solid. Why can’t we have just a real basic good bagel shop with 15 flavors of fresh hot bagels and tubs of lovely cream cheese at light speed like they do in Brooklyn.  I don’t need my bagel  shop to sell branded Tshirts and Hats - I need a place that will deliver on the bagels. Anyway. End Rant. I wish CYM was better.",

Now Clover is reaching out offering 0.1% fee and seemingly low hardware cost. My restaurant is a small counter service startup with 4 things on the menu so my dependency is very basic. How has the Clover been in your experience? Hardware, software, customer service and all things considered? What are the challenges? Is our worth it?",

I had to ask for refill on coffee and water multiple times, the food was served cold with no silverware, I had to ask for a pen to sign the check…. I ordered the corn beef hash with pancakes. I can deal with small portion sizes if the food is good..not only was portion comically small, but it was cold and had clearly been sitting out.

The other plates we got were fine, nothing remarkable or memorable. We skipped dessert all together. Service: TERRIBLE! Every course a runner just came and shoved our plates onto the table, no explanation of the food, didn’t take any empty plates. At one point we were left holding plates in our hands as he walked away. Our “server” only came to take the order and run drinks. At what point is it rude not to tip?

He’s recently had a stroke and this will be his first time eating in public since - he’s really worried that he might make a bit of a mess from dropping something or missing his mouth or whatever, but he says he really misses good pasta he can’t make at home ☺️ I’m looking for a recommendation of a good restaurant that would put him at ease and help him enjoy his meal - specifically looking for: good pasta selection not too fancy, trendy, or loud roomy tables, not packed in too tightly kind staff fairly central Realise this is a bit of a random ask, but grateful for any pointers!",

They also refused to give me the itemized receipt once I paid. Scammy af. Tables and floor are sticky as hell too. Oh, and the prices they charged me were 10-15% higher than what is listed on their to-go menu, which I picked up on the way out. Not going back.",
