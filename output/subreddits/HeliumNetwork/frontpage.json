This may have happened around IOT to HNT move, wasn’t that in the last couple months? Not that it got much reward before, some, not a lot.  I’m curious, was there some action I should have taken recently to keep this guy going?  Or just old hardware or low network usage and therefore nothing to be expected anymore?  It was no rewards before the halving.",

Anyone else w similar problem? Edit: Linxdot miner ... They went out of business :( can't get it to BT pairing mode. Can't connect to the PC for any kind of update :( ...
