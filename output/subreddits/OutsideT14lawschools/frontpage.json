      "content_preview": "For anyone considering applying to law school, it is critical to demonstrate the ability to use exact language.  \"Best Law Schools\" is a misnomer phrase that would never pass the rules of evidence in any Court of Law. \"Best\" in this case is merely an opinion offered by a for-profit magazine whose primary goal is to sell subscriptions without spending any more money on research than is absolutely necessary.  College Solutions ( https://www.collegesolutions.com/blog-articles/2025-law-school-rankings ) describes USNWR law school rankings as \"far from perfect... year after year the magazine distorts the decision-making process for applicants trying to make an ultimate decision...62% of law school admissions officers believe the rankings have lost some of their prestige....the rankings are losing their grip\". There clearly are some law schools that are more selective than others, numerically, but there is no \"best\" law school for everyone.  Often named as the greatest (most winning) trial lawyer of the 20th century, Gerry Spence (see \"Karen Silkwood\") graduated from the University of Wyoming Law School.  Many other famous and hugely successful lawyers graduated from schools in the lower rankings. Just FYI: I am a San Francisco born, UC Berkeley graduate who attended UC Law SF (formerly known as UC Hastings, which is the oldest law school in the Western US and the first in the UC system, which now has five).  I am on the verge of retirement after 50 years in practice, mostly spent defending other attorneys in legal malpractice lawsuits.  I now serve as a court-approved expert witness rendering opinions to Judges and juries regarding whether or not a particular attorney met the \"standard of care\" (i.e. was or was not \"negligent\") and\\or met the professional rules of ethics).  I have known many very good, highly ethical lawyers from lesser-known law schools, and some from  top-ranked laws school graduates that I would never have considered hiring. UC Law San Francisco serves as a top pipeline to the nation’s largest and most prestigious law firms, ranking No. 25 on Law.com’s latest “ Go-To Law Schools ...\"Big Law List\", and, at the same time, produces more California Judges than any law school in the nation, US News doesn't even list it in the top 75 law schools. In large part, this is because UC Law SF has the largest Legal Education Opportunity Programs (\"LEOP\") in California, if not the US.  Each year UC LAW SF seeks out, admits, trains and graduates a significant number of students whose grades and test scores might not qualify them for admission to the majority of law schools, but who have overcome economic, ethnic, racial and other obstacles and, at the same time, offer sufficient promise and commitment to justify their admission (Kamala Harris is one of many examples).  And UC Law SF provides 80% of the first year class either merit or need-based grants and scholarships. In considering which law school to attend, I urge you to rely more on your own investigation and instincts than on any rankings made by a for-profit publication. Wherever you choose to go, I wish you Good Luck- the law is a Great education and a Great career path (although a law school education will be of great help in ANY career you may choose).",

I have almost my entire application materials prepped and ready to go for tomorrow. Only problem is none of my letters are academic in nature. I have 1 from my union president, 1 from my supervisor, and 1 from a summer job I had in college and kept until 2023. I graduated in 2021, so im over 4 years out of Undergrad. I did get a masters this summer, but it was asynchronous and I didn't feel connected to any of the professors I had. The prof I asked from undergrad didnt get back to me in the 3 months (with reminders) that I gave for him to do the letter over the summer. I know its hyper early in the cycle, and I could wait for an LOR from the professor, but the year is starting back up and he will likely not have time to write the letter before I'd get too pushy. UW asks for at least 2 lor's on their website and im thinking of sending in the 3 that I have. I should be good, right? TLDR: Is not having a letter of rec from a professor while being over 4 years out of undergrad going to present a serious issue for me?",

I'm interested primarily in doing public interest, gov, immigration, or labor and employment at the moment. However, I'm by no means set in stone on that.

      "content_preview": "LSAT Unplugged Podcast just did an episode on the new $50k/year loan limits will change both law schools and admissions.  I was really impressed with the analysis.  Definitely worth a listen. Link: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/in-2026-law-school-changes-forever-heres-how/id1450308309?i=1000722322516 Key takeaways: Starting July 1, 2026, \"no more borrow what you need\" \"It's a turning point.  And most people are not going to see it coming.  Most will keep applying to law school like nothing's changed.  And most schools will keep charging tuition like the old rules still apply...This is the biggest reset to legal education in 20 years.\" \"It means for the first time in decades, law students will actually have to think about how they'll pay for school and not just assume the government's going to spot them the full amount.\" \"Law school tuition is not based on what the education costs.  It is based on what law schools think students can pay.\" \"Because when people hear loan caps, they assume it's bad news for low-income students...but if you zoom out, the opposite might actually be true...the option it removes is unlimited, unthinking, no-questions-asked debt, which has wrecked far mor e careers.\" \"Students will no longer look at $90,000 per year and think to themselves, I'll just borrow it.  They'll have to figure out how to cover a $40,000 game every single year.\" \"Applicants will need to do real math before accepting an offer, compare cost against job placement data, not just rankings, and push back on tuition and meaningless scholarships.\" \"The first big trend is fewer high-debt borrowers.  And this one starts immediately. Students will self-regulate in a way they've never had to before.  They're going to run the numbers They're going to cap their own borrowing. And they'll walk away from schools that don't offer meaningful aid. And that single mindset shift will ripple across every admissions cycle.\" The T14 will be fine, and so will many others.  But consider the DC area (UVA, GULC, GW, GMU, Howard, AU, Catholic, UDC, etc.).  Despite high tuition, UVA and GULC will be fine, as they will find enough full-pay students who can work with the $50k/year loan limit.  Howard and UDC have relatively lower tuition and discount a lot already. GMU also discounts widely and graduating students have comparatively low loan balances at graduation.  But how will GW, AU, and Catholic respond to this new world?",

I’m really my top choice, but I do have a GPA on the lower, I had a clear upward trend in my transcript, so I chose to write an addendum. I applied pretty early in the cycle (end of August). From what I’ve seen, Emory admits tend to go out in waves later in the cycle, but I wanted to hear from others who applied with similar numbers. What do you think my odds are for admission (and maybe scholarships) at Emory with this profile? Anyone here with comparable stats who’s been admitted/denied/waitlisted?",

This was my 3rd time taking the lsat and I got a 150 after studying for 1 month (I cancelled my score the first 2 times bc I did not study at all). LSAC also gave me a 3.37 gpa because of classes I took in high school. I did have a 4.0 gpa last semester (I’m in my gap year). I have a BS in criminology, law, & Justice and Psychology (double major) with a minor in Public Policy. What school do you think I would be able to get into and do you think there’s a chance of me getting any scholarships? I was planning on applying the day applications open if I don’t retake the LSAT. Or do you think I should study and retake it in November? I don’t want to but I want to get a scholarship. Lmk what u guys think!",

Not trying to seek pity by any means, but I don't come from money lmao. My immediate family would love to help me, but they can't, and that's okay. I really want to attend some of the NJ/NYC schools. But... how do people even afford living there while in law school if they don't have parents paying? Thankfully, the schools in that area do have part-time programs. I'm applying to part-time at Seton Hall, Rutgers, and NYLS. It's been my dream to live and work in NYC since I was young. I'm curious about how y'all manage with the high cost of living. I want part-time school if I go up there, and I am wondering if I'll still be able to afford rent. I know this is a totally different side of the US, but I'd also love UC Irvine because I love Orange County and have some extended family there, so I'd have a support system. At least there, I could have stayed with family and maybe just pitch out some money to them when I can to cut costs. Unfortunately, I don't have the stats that UCI would like lol I'm not NYC or bust, though. I really like Cincy, UMKC, Maine, and Albany. Those are all places I would be happy with. However, none of them offer PT programs. Other PTs I'm considering include Toledo, Loyola Chicago, and UConn. But I feel like that, no matter what, this could be tricky, because I'm not sure how I'll keep up financially, and the last thing I need is the stress of bills while I'm in school. I know I'll be better off once I'm a practicing attorney. I just wonder how it works while you're in law school. Sorry if I sound dumb, so please be nice lol",

My question is how do I choose where to apply? For example, which of the schools are likely to sway BU/BC admissions towards more money? I know a safe strategy is apply everywhere but I have neither the money or the time... In particular, are there some schools that are likelier to have a larger effect (beyond just the highest ranked ones)? My stats should be above median at BU/BC though I haven't taken the LSAT yet",

Class is fine but when you’re say, the sports editor of a paper or running a record label, maybe you don’t care so much about getting an A instead of a B. Worth an addendum saying basically law school will similarly be more about the work I do than where I fall on a curve?",

I applied to McGeorge, Southwestern, and Santa Clara University. I got rejected from Southwestern, today I got the rejection for Santa Clara, and orientation has already happened for McGeorge although they're still 'considering my application'. I am applying for Fall 2026, and working even harder on my LSAT scores as I think that's the main contender for everything, even if my GPA was higher than the median.

I am currently Active Duty Army, commissioned 1LT applying to FLEP which would pay for my law school, but this year the Army added UFLEP which would be self pay with a lower service obligation (but still full pay and benefits which is a great deal) that being said I am looking to apply early with the prospects of getting scholarships, I have pretty mid stats however 155 LSAT (still waiting for August score) and 3.14 GPA. What schools should I be targeting with hopes of getting some scholarships? I also plan to apply for outside scholarships and am willing to take under 25k student loan debt if I don’t get into FLEP. Do I have any chance at some $$$ with my current stats? Does active duty service help at all, I also have some strong LOR from former JAG and law advisors. Any advice appreciated, I may take the LSAT again in November to see if I can boost further, but it’s hard given I’m in Active service and recently became a father a few months ago. List of schools I plan to apply (FWIW I plan to stay in the PNW when I leave the service): Willamette U Maine Law New England Law U of Oregon Ave Maria School of Law U of Montana Gonzaga",

As much as I would like to say it doesn’t, the low rank makes me a little nervous (but I now they are a newer school so want to acknowledge that as well). I’m sitting at a 3.6 uGPA, 5 years WE, and 162 LSAT for reference. Also, I am not at all tied to TX would just be convenient to live at home. Considering schools all over the country as well!! Wayne State, Michigan State, Georgia State, Oregon, Campbell and some others on my list as i’m open to living/working in most states. Would appreciate any insight or advice anyone has to offer, i’m all over the place in deciding where to apply. TIA!!!! :-)",

However idk what type of law I want to go into. For context: I’d like to stay on the east coast (I’d love to go to wake forest,Boston, maybe a NJ law school). I mean patent law seems obvious but I have no interest in a master degree bc engineering really isn’t my passion (hence why I’m trying to do KJD). My question is do I try to take gpa booster courses (or just courses that are more law school like poli sci, Eng, Phi, etc.) or just graduate take a gap year and then go back into law school admissions? I’m currently studying to take the LSAT but idk what yalls advice would be. Thanks for any and all help!",

      "content_preview": "Ok I'm clearly behind the ball on everything. I applied late- like 6/30 for the 7/1 deadline. From what I've seen, it seems like CSU is way behind in reviewing applications. I'm just wondering if anyone has insight on how likely it is that I'll even hear back or be considered for this cycle. I didn't decide to begin the process of applying until December, and I didn't have an LSAT done yet so I had to wait until April to take it and then had to break the news to my employer that I'm applying for law school so I could get my LORs, hence applying so late. I have a 3.7 GPA, but only got a 155 on the LSAT 🙃 I want to do part time in person. There's no way I'm paying for LawHub + to track the status since I only applied here and I heard it's not all that accurate. Give it to me straight- do we think I have a shot??",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! My post makes it obvious, but my target is Northeastern University. I'm a junior in undergrad who's currently prepping for law school. 3.0 — 3.1 is my expected gpa and my lsat score has been all over the place due to mental health problems, my first diagnostic back in April being 168 and my newest one from today being 147 (extreme lack of studying and poor memory, i presume). I was wondering if y'all had any tips for me when it comes to the LSAT! I struggle primarily with the RC's, but I also seem to struggle sometimes (infrequently) with the LR's. I currently use the free version of LSAT demon and I'm considering buying the cheapest version because... well, I'm a college student. I'm broke. Is there any other material i should invest in? Should I get the more expensive versions? If anyone with ADHD had something that worked for them let me know :)!! Thank you all!",
