The first problem was when we couldn’t carry evidence from the garage up to the shuttle because of the co-op garage door. No matter what we did, we couldn’t get the boxes through. I figured this was just because those co-op doors don’t allow you to carry heavy objects through or something, whatever, we found some evidence in the rest of the police station and finished the objective. We beat the trial objective, everything was great, until we got to the shuttle. Once we got to the shuttle, none of us could enter the shuttle. We just stood there in the exits, nothing happened, even when we all stood in one. Coyle wouldn’t really come after us if we were standing there, but we couldn’t exit the trial. The countdown finally hit zero, we all died, and that was that. I was looking at an A+ to end the trial, knocking out a bunch of the tasks for the new mode, but nope. Has this happened to anyone else? I tried to save a clip of what happened, but the whole game was bugging out for my squad. For whatever reason my ps5 wouldn’t capture any of the trial.",

      "content_preview": "I have seen some variation of the above statements pretty consistently, so let me break it down for those still wondering: Murkoff is NOT trying to train fighters! They are trying to train sleeper agents to function as SABOTEURS and ASSASSINS! The US military is the primary fighting force for the American government and corporate interests! If you're not signing up, there's no need for your little reagent to pick up a gun and go fight in Guatemala or Vietnam or whatever country Uncle Sam hits on his dartboard. Murkoff is in league with the CIA, meaning their methods will be quieter. Subtler. They're more focused on careful applications of violence than the brute force of stomping a nation into submission. It's the same reason you don't use a sledgehammer to put a nail in drywall. Remember, when a reagent got activated in Cuba, they were only able to kill one person before being neutralized, compared to Franco's seven. Reagents make for crappy fighters unless used in specialized situations, and that is by design. \"B- but... if a group of reagents t-teamed up, they could beat up C-Coyle or somethi-\" MURKOFF WILL MAKE THEIR ESOPS EXPLODE.  Or use them to zap the reagents. Or send in the guards with the guns, something. Prove to me they can't. In environments where Murkoff can do anything they like, what would stop them?  You think they wouldn't sacrifice a few reagents to keep their one-in-a-million prime assets from flatlining? We see this in action with the surveillance cameras. One can learn from evidence documents that the cameras don't really work as cameras. They're just simple motion detectors that give the reagents a zap via their ESOP when triggered. There's no reason why this couldn't occur for other things like trying to kill an Ex-Pop or Prime Asset. That's not even getting into the STR and CON attributes of PA's and Ex-Pop. Coyle got attacked by Henrietta (aka Jaeger), and he not only came out unscathed but actually roughed her up so bad, Murkoff staff didn't think she'd survive. If you think you can convince a group of sleep-deprived, malnourished, stressed-out loners to team up against that or even a machete-wielding Ex-Pop, hey, more power to ya. Just don't be offended when I'm watching from the dark, sharing a bag of popcorn with Night Hunter. \"Okay, maybe the reagents can't fight even if they wanted to. What is even the point of the trials, then? I mean, are we really going to be assassinating our targets by turning them into sex toys and burning them alive like in Pervert the Futterman?\" There's a popular theory in psychiatry when it comes to dissociative identity disorder (previously known as multiple/split personality disorder). Mainly, that when a person is exposed to enough trauma, they will 'dissociate' as a coping mechanism and thus won't recognize their own body as theirs. If this is true, then the trials contain plenty of trauma for the reagents to experience. Every trial is guided towards Murkoff's objectives and away from what authority figures in society (the Prime Assets) would want. It's not about training reagents to kill, it's about getting them to follow Murkoff's orders unquestioningly. Combine this with the reagent's dissociative state, and you have someone who can steal, sabotage, and kill without letting anything (conscience, morals, peer pressure, authority) get in the way. There's an episode of The Outer Limits from 1996 called 'Straight and Narrow' with this very same premise. Instead of trials, the characters get a brain implant that suppresses their personality and allows them to become assassins. Same concept, great episode. You should watch it. \"Alright, alright, but this is all speculation. How do we know this is the case?\" I suppose there isn't anything within the game itself stating this... except ALMOST EVERYTHING EASTERMAN SAYS! Murkoff says they brought him in for his study of brainwashing, as it was concerning to the US government that troops went to Korea and became full fledged supporters of Kim Il-Sung and Mao Zedong. Easterman's goal is to try and do the same thing but for America's side. This is why he needs 'blank slates', as he calls reagents, in order to imprint Murkoff's messaging on. Here are some choice lines from Easterman: \"But at the end of this journey, you'll be reborn. A whole new you. We're all going to get better together.\" \"Perfect soldiers would not know they were following orders. Perfect slaves would think they were the masters of all they surveyed. Perfect agents would think they served no agenda but their own. Our servants will obey us absolutely, they will kill for us and die for us, because they will believe with absolute conviction that our goals are their own.\" And of course the classic: \"A decent performance. I said \"jump\" and you jumped. But what I need, is somebody who when I say \"jump,\" says \"how high?\" Can you be my How High?\" This is the reason every solo rebirth ending features the reagent escaping, fading to white, and then waking up in a completely new place. It's the mental conditioning Murkoff gives us to become new people in the dissociative state and carry out their tasks. After all, the best kind of spy/assassin is one who doesn't even remember their orders when they get caught.",

      "content_preview": "Here are the stats that I've compiled about most of the variators. These information are from the files in the Season 4 (Project Diarchy) update. Like my last post , this won't include any leaks or upcoming content. DOORS: Barricaded Doors: Blocked Gate Chance - 0.5 / Locked Doors - 0.5 / Opened Doors - 0.5 / Planks - 5.0 / Trapped Doors - 0.5 / Sealed Doors - 0.5 Barricaded Doors config for reference (same for others below) Blocked Doors: Blocked Gate Chance - 0.5 / Locked Doors - 0.5 / Opened Doors - 0.5 / Planks - 0.5 / Trapped Doors - 0.5 / Sealed Doors - 3.0 Introductory: Blocked Gate Chance - 0.66 / Locked Doors - 0.66 / Planks - 0.66 / Trapped Doors - 0.66 / Sealed Doors - 0.66 Padlocked Doors: Blocked Gate Chance - 0.5 / Locked Doors - 0.5 / Opened Doors - 0.5 / Padlocked Doors (swaps Sealed Doors) - 1.0 / Planks - 0.5 / Sealed Doors - 3.0 / Trapped Doors - 2.5 The door name with 3.0 is the Sealed Doors Trapped Doors: Blocked Gate Chance - 0.5 / Sealed Doors - 0.5 / Planks - 0.5 / Trapped Doors - 5.0 / Locked Doors - 0.5 Unreliable Doors: Locked Doors - 2.0 / Planks - 2.5 / Sealed Doors - 1.5 / Trapped Doors - 2.5 GATES: Blocked Paths: Uses both Blocked Doors and Closed Rolling Gates variators. Closed Rolling Gates: Blocked Gate - 2.0 / Blocked Gate Chance - 0.5 All other gates like Proximity, Timed and Remote have no randomized chance attached. All compatible gates will change depending on its variator. HAZARD ENVIRONMENT: Toxic Shock: The hazard cooldown is 90 seconds. Once cooldown is up, it will trigger announcement warning before the hazard comes. Once gas stops, the cooldown starts again. Each Health Bar is worth 25 HP. Toxic Shock deals 5 damage in 2 second intervals. The player loses their max health bar after getting 25 total damage from the gas. Cold Snap: Same as Toxic Shock, the hazard cooldown is still 90 seconds. Cold Snap deals 10 damage with no second interval. ITEMS: Bleeding & Sharp Glass: Each small medicine and adrenalines has 0.5 (50%) chance to swap with bandage. A lot of people thought that these variators increase bandage spawning rate, but they just swapped certain items already spawned in a certain chance. Bomb Countdown Removes 0.75 (75%) of every small battery. Time Extenders have 0.5 (50%) chance to be found in blue containers. Those containers cannot be locked. Swaps two items in Secret Rooms. Those items swapped are either large medicine or large battery. Bomb Countdown II Removes 0.75 (75%) of every small battery. Time Extenders have 0.5 (50%) chance to be found in blue containers. Those containers cannot be locked. Unlike Bomb Countdown, they cannot appear from minimum distance up to 500. Swaps two items in Secret Rooms. Those items swapped are either large medicine or large battery. Limited Items: Items have 0.66 (66%) spawn rate. The items affected are Adrenaline, Antidote, Bandage, Bottle, Brick, Large Battery, Large Medicine, Lockpick, Rig Recharger, Small Battery, and Small Medicine. Limited Items II: Items have 0.33 (33%) spawn rate. Limited Items III: Items have 0.22 (22%) spawn rate. No Items In Trial: Items have their spawn rate set to zero. No Medical Items: Reduces the lockpick spawn rate to 0.5 (50%) chance. Removes Adrenaline, Bandage, Antidote, Small Medicine and Large Medicine. No Running: Increases the spawn rate of Adrenaline to 2.0 (200%). Blacklists Exit Rush, No Items In Trial and No Medical Items. No Running's Blacklisted variators No Technical Items: Reduces the lockpick spawn rate to 0.5 (50%) chance. Removes Small Battery, Large Battery and Rig Recharger. Padlocked Doors/Locked Items: A lot of people believed that Padlocked Doors and Locked Items variators spawn extra lockpicks in the trial. However, none of these variators mention lockpick at all, unlike No Running which actually increases the adrenaline spawns. Psychosis Damage: Has 0.2 (20%) chance to swap each small medicine and adrenaline with antidote. Bandage is also swapped at 0.1 (10%) chance. Blacklists Bad Trip and Bad Trip II. Thief Loadout: Gives 2 lockpicks and removes one slot of the player's inventory. Lockpicks are removed from the trial. Multiplies the Rig cooldown by 2.0 (while Rigs Extended Cooldown is 2.5) PLAYER: Bleeding: Skinner Man's tentacles and his AOE (Area-Of-Effect) damage are listed as an exception for Bleeding. Bleeding exception list. Spectre is Skinner Man's AOE damage. Introductory: Increases the visibility range and hints of the objective icon. Extra Lives starts with 5. No Running: The shock damage from running is 2.5 When the adrenaline effect is ended, there is a grace period of 5 seconds. Psychosis Damage: Has a frequency cooldown for 10 seconds. Each Sanity bar is worth 33 HP. Any damage makes you lose one sanity bar. Stay Together: The radius value is 1500. The grace period when separated is 5 seconds.
