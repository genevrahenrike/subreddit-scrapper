Please do not tell other users how to raise their pets. Do not tell people to keep their cats indoors or to spay/ neuter them. Follow the sitewide terms of service as well as reddiquette. We prefer original content. Content found online is not directly prohibited, but we discourage karma farming. This includes titles & posts that suggest a cat found online is owned by you. Please do not post memes or image macros. We do not allow fundraisers or self-promotion of any kind. We do not allow advertising of any sort. This includes accounts that primarily exist to promote their own NSFW content. NSFW/onlyfans posters are allowed to participate here, but on a separate SFW account. No NSFW content and no animal abuse/cruelty. No dead animal photos. While we understand you may be mourning, please do not share photos of your cat after passing. Photos during their lifetime are fine. We understand that hunting is a natural behaviour but ask that you don't share photos of your cats prize here. Repost of recent or currently popular post from another subreddit for the purpose of farming karma. We no longer allow people to ask what breed or gender their cat is. We do not allow political or politically charged posts. You must set the flair of your post to 'Name Request' at the time of submission, failing to do so is in breach of this rule. Please submit your post before sending us a modmail - your submission will trigger an automated message which will contain the instructions required for your post to be approved. Your verification message will be left unanswered if you send us a modmail before you have submitted your post for us to review. No memes, image macros, or low-effort posts. AI-generated content is not allowed. Original content is preferred. The 'Cat Art' flair is only for artwork made by you. If it isn‚Äôt yours, credit the original artist clearly or use the 'Not OC' flair. Misleading or uncredited content may be removed."
