      "content_preview": "Said that a lot of photographers were having some difficulty with booking, numbers for 2025 were down all across the board. The planner works for one of the prominent companies in my town and confirmed what I had a hunch about. I get that it's not something a majority are going to want to talk about, but it seems everyone as a collective are experience in some form -- and I get that you'd want to keep your social presence up with wedding work to make it look like you're busy ALL the time even when that's not the case. So just a little reassurance to anyone who might think they're not doing as much, while others are flourishing -- social media can be super deceiving. EDIT: Wow, apparently this is a super sensitive subject for a LOT of people and I was merely trying to see what people's booking process was like, but has turned into a massive shitstorm pointing fingers rather than being a civil discussion. EDIT 2: Here are threads from 1-2 years ago talking about how booking 2024 was difficult. https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingPhotography/comments/1cp8sna/slow_bookings_for_2024/ https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingPhotography/comments/1cihmqf/lag_in_2024_booking/ https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingPhotography/comments/15251m5/ive_heard_a_lot_of_people_are_struggling_to_book/",

I understand why they‚Äôre asking (to make sure it‚Äôs still professional quality), but I feel a bit weird sending other photographers‚Äô portfolios to a client I‚Äôd really like to book myself. I‚Äôve been shooting weddings for 7 years and this is my first time getting this request. Do you generally send clients your second shooters portfolio? I‚Äôm not sure the best way to respond to them. Any advice? Thanks in advance! Edit: Little update: thanks for the replies, it reaffirmed how I feel about the situation. I have a shortlist of 2nd shooters but no clue which one will actually be with me on the wedding day yet as it‚Äôs for July next year. I let the bride know that and let her know that all the galleries she‚Äôs been sent have 2nd shooter photos in them and that they‚Äôre all edited in my style, so that is the most accurate way to get an idea of what a wedding gallery from me looks like. Also let her know that I only work with other professional photographers who have experience in weddings and who I can rely on to produce high quality images to try and give her some peace of mind, if that‚Äôs what she was looking for.",

I know obviously the 1.2 is the gold standard and has amazing character to it but I also heard the autofocus on the 1.4 is SO much better and may be worth buying over the 1.2. Does anyone have experience with both or either lens for use in weddings and portraits? Also sometimes I do kid portraits!   Does the 1.2 keep with well with kids? Thanks in advance guys!! :)",

I carried by two bodies and mainly used the one in my hands, but put the second body idiotically on a bench near us. Thankfully there was nothing super important, I got the main things on my main body. The camera was z6 + 85mm 1.8. Anyways. Now I need to sell all my stuff and buy a new one because I have 5 weddings in the next month. I used the 85 for closeup of the guests and sometimes in the photosession. My other lens is 35 1.8 and a 14-30. Bought exactly those lenses because they get me awesome quality and are very lightweight which is a must if I carry two bodies. I am considering: Buying the same lens, 85 1.8 Buying 24-70 for all run and gun, using the 70 for closeups. I consider this because there are times where I missed the shot because I am limited to the prime range whenever I am cought in the moment(I cannot move fast enough to capture it entirely) and for me moment > shallow depth of field...plus I never understood the argument that zoom shooters are lazy or getting lazy",

The camera I have is a Sony DSLR A57. The wedding is outdoors on a golf course between 2-3:30pm (cringing at the time, so bad for lighting in Canada). We have a list of photos and a timeline of where to be when and thankfully she says her expectations aren't super high, but my own are haha Any tips or recommendations are much appreciated ü©∑",

In this case, they claim to be advertising your business to a network of country clubs in a given locale. The catch, of course, is that they don‚Äôt actually have any affiliation with the clubs or their members, so you‚Äôre advertising to no one. This was confirmed by six of the clubs I reached out to; they each said it was a scam. The reason I‚Äôm bringing this up, despite it being a fairly obvious scam in hindsight, is that they‚Äôre somewhat more sophisticated than any similar scam I‚Äôve encountered and they have no negative press about them until now. They have a fully fleshed out media kit and detailed answers to specific questions I was using to vet them. They use aggressive sales tactics under the guise of trying to support a small business while in reality they‚Äôre seeking hundreds to thousands of dollars in payment for a service they will not be equipped to provide. Stay safe, folks. I‚Äôve been doing digging and their parent (read: shell) company is Pure Path Marketing. They‚Äôve changed business names a few times from what I gather. I submitted a report to the Better Business Bureau but wanted to make sure potential victims see this via the Google algorithm too.",

It doesn't matter if you are a seasoned pro, a second shooter, or if you are posting your first wedding photographs as a lead photographer. Don't be shy... constructive feedback is a great way for us all to learn and get improve. Be nice... Be constructive! Please be constructive. Unconstructive, hateful, or disparaging comments will be removed. Submission Guidelines: In order to ensure informative discussions and worthwhile critiques while being mindful of the personal time of reviewers we have instituted the following guidelines. Single Images: Please post single images if you would like a quality and in depth critique of technical execution, lighting, composition, posing, perspective, post processing, etc. If you would like to post more than one individual photo, please do so as separate comments. Blog Posts/Image Sets: Please post full blog posts or image sets if you would like feedback on your storytelling, cohesiveness of post processing, or other general feedback across the set. Even in this instance it is not advisable to post a link to hundreds of images or a full wedding set. Websites: Please post links to your full website only if you are looking for feedback on your site design, architecture, layout, or other use of images within the site. Do not expect quality critiques of all of your photographs just by posting a link to your website. This critique thread is intended to help provide access to thoughtful and thorough portfolio review. For that reason, it is best to remain focused which can be achieved by following these guidelines. These are merely guidelines, but if they are followed you will receive a greater response and much more useful and comprehensive feedback.",

Some think it looks too harsh or ‚Äúpaparazzi-like,‚Äù while others love the energy it adds to dance floor shots and the fact it keeps photos looking crisp in low light. As a photographer, I use flash a lot ‚Äî but in ways most people don‚Äôt expect. It‚Äôs not about blinding your guests with a spotlight. When it‚Äôs done right, flash helps: Freeze those wild reception dance moments Add depth and drama in dimly lit venues Keep skin tones natural even under bad uplighting The truth is, most reception spaces aren‚Äôt designed with photographers in mind, and relying only on natural/ambient light often means blurry or muddy photos. Flash is just another tool ‚Äî it can be subtle, cinematic, or bold depending on how it‚Äôs used. Curious ‚Äî what do you all think? Would you want your photographer using flash on your wedding day, or do you prefer everything natural light only? For couples who are still deciding, I put together a breakdown on when and why flash makes a difference (with examples): Flash Wedding Photography Guide",

Client booked my largest gallery package after the elopement shoot (pricing is based on number of images). -Paid about 1/4 upfront. -I sent the invoice, which they confirmed in writing. -I started editing (normally done in 1‚Äì2 weeks). Now my Problem: I got no payment of the remaining. They ghosted me for 2 weeks after I reminded them. Now they‚Äôre asking if they can just get half the images instead. Would you: Be flexible and agree to deliver less? Or stand firm, send a reminder/notice, and not deliver anything until fully paid? Yeah, lesson learned: next time I won‚Äôt start editing before full payment. Edit: Thanks so much for all the feedback. Yes, I do have a contract that clearly outlines both the payments and the image delivery. The invoice was also accepted by the client. My deposit covers the photoshoot fee. I use the image selection system because I want to make my shoots accessible both for clients on a smaller budget and for those with a larger one. Up until now, I‚Äôve never had a case where someone picked the largest package and then couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt pay. Normally, clients in that situation just choose the package that is covered by what they‚Äôve already paid.",

      "content_preview": "Post individual wedding, engagement, proposal, couples photos or photo sets or websites for feedback. It doesn't matter if you are a seasoned pro, a second shooter, or if you are posting your first wedding photographs as a lead photographer. Don't be shy... constructive feedback is a great way for us all to learn and get improve. Be nice... Be constructive! Please be constructive. Unconstructive, hateful, or disparaging comments will be removed. Submission Guidelines: In order to ensure informative discussions and worthwhile critiques while being mindful of the personal time of reviewers we have instituted the following guidelines. Single Images: Please post single images if you would like a quality and in depth critique of technical execution, lighting, composition, posing, perspective, post processing, etc. If you would like to post more than one individual photo, please do so as separate comments. Blog Posts/Image Sets: Please post full blog posts or image sets if you would like feedback on your storytelling, cohesiveness of post processing, or other general feedback across the set. Even in this instance it is not advisable to post a link to hundreds of images or a full wedding set. Websites: Please post links to your full website only if you are looking for feedback on your site design, architecture, layout, or other use of images within the site. Do not expect quality critiques of all of your photographs just by posting a link to your website. This critique thread is intended to help provide access to thoughtful and thorough portfolio review. For that reason, it is best to remain focused which can be achieved by following these guidelines. These are merely guidelines, but if they are followed you will receive a greater response and much more useful and comprehensive feedback.",

It seems absurd to me, maybe I‚Äôm just not quite educated on what the app really is. I‚Äôve recently jumped back into photography after a significant break and there are so many new resources out there, is Unscripted just a glorified pinterest with prompts? If you use it how do you incorporate it into your workflow or would you suggest a similar website, app, software etc? (I am currently learning Pixieset for booking and general business management)",

Seems to be a lot of things that need to figured out like do I LLC, do I need and how much for lawyer fees. Is there a standard contract I can use or do things need to be adapted for each situation. What do need in terms of insurance and on and on. How cash do need to have just to get off the ground. Any suggestions or feedback be great or if there are specific websites that can offer quality info. I do have things booked for later in the year and next year but I really want to start using contracts. I am also shooting quincea√±eras and or banquet style events so I would hope it can all be under one roof. Thanks in advance.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I‚Äôm looking to get started in wedding photography and could use some advice from people who‚Äôve been there. I already have my own portfolio website (not a full wedding portfolio yet), and I‚Äôve been emailing local wedding photographers offering to second shoot for them. Since I‚Äôm also a front-end developer, I‚Äôve mentioned that in exchange for giving me some second-shooting opportunities and experience, I could help them by building or redesigning their professional website since most of them had wix site or some other wordpress. I reached out to smaller photographers that posted recently their wedding photos. A few questions I‚Äôd love your input on: Is offering my web dev skills in exchange for second-shooting experience a good approach, or does it come off as odd? How did you personally get your very first wedding gigs? What should I focus on in my portfolio when I don‚Äôt have many wedding shots yet? Any tips for making my outreach emails more likely to get a ‚Äúyes‚Äù? I also bought an ad to shoot pre wedding photos in interesting places but we all know that it didnt work out. I‚Äôm genuinely willing to put in the work, assist however needed, and learn the ropes before taking on my own clients. Would love to hear your thoughts and stories! Thanks in advance!",
