Justin Cupo is driving in from Philly and Josh Lampley is frantically writing because he now sees that the text I sent him says Cupo and not Crespo. Also on the card is a 16 year old against a 17 year old and a black guy against an autistic chick. And now, for the uninitiated: Every week Dan Wickes (me) presents a curated lineup of comedians to compete in insult battles. The show is affiliated part of Roast Battle League, as one of two New York chapters. New York has the best joke writers in the world, come see what happens when they're put to the test.

LIC seems to have more of the stuff I like to do (climbing gyms, pickleball) and is on the quieter, newer side which I like. I work from the office 3/4 days a week and am looking for 1-2 roommates who would be interesting in hunting with me for a move-in of ideally sometime in November. I'm clean, tidy, and pretty chill overall. I also have a cat. I'm flexible budget-wise and would prefer a building with nicer amenities (in-building laundry, elevator, fitness room, potentially garage parking etc). I would love to have a roommate instead of a studio for some community and hope we can get along and spend time together occasionally watching shows or something :) Feel free to DM if you're interested!",

If you are walking your dog, do not just let your dog come up to another dog without first asking “is it OK if they say hi?” my dog is not good with other dogs. We keep him on a leash and we do not go near other dogs but 50% of you out here are letting your dog come up to my dog on a 20 foot leash without asking first and now I have to hurry up and try to hold my dog back because you have no decency to ask first.. I honestly should just let my dog bite yours since you seem to not care for your dog’s safety. But because I’m a decent person I hold my dog back and say he’s not friendly and I’m not going to be polite about it anymore. If you come up to me and ask, hey is it OK if our dogs say hi I will kindly say oh no sorry he’s not friendly but if you do not ask that at all, I’m not gonna be kind anymore because I’m getting sick and tired of this. And while we’re on the subject, keep your dog on a fucking leash stop letting your dogs off the leash I don’t care how good they are and how good they are listening to you. It takes one second for another dog to hurt your dog because it got too close to them.",

I just wanted to say if you setup your pickleball net there for multiple hours, you are an inconsiderate person and are hogging what is a public area that other folks should have an opportunity to use as well. You should at least be considerate when there are groups of people there to ask if they want to switch on and off instead of being an insatiable pickler.",

The building itself, which looks to be nearly a century old, had been standing empty for a long time. There were different rumors, including one that the structure would be demolished to make way for yet another LIC-style high-rise. But I’m truly glad that this low-rise building will continue to please the eye for a while longer. And now, after so many years, a restaurant is finally opening there under the name… well, that’s the tricky part, because the sign is in three different languages, and the translations don’t quite match: 酒館 (Jiǔguǎn, Chinese) — “Tavern,” “Bar,” or “Wine House.” 沙桃 (Sha Tao) — literally “sand peach,” though most likely it’s just a proper name ( Sha Tao ). โรงเตี๊ยมสาโท (Rong Tiam Satho, Thai) — “Rice Wine Tavern” or “Rice Liquor Inn.” Address 43-02 Hunter St, Long Island City, NY 11101 https://preview.redd.it/new-tavern-in-lic-v0-3pkm89j1mvkf1.jpg",

I know that’s SUPER low, but I’m wondering what the most affordable options are in the LIC area? Honestly I’d be willing to venture a little outside if need be :) Looking for something potentially under 200 a month that offers unlimited!!",

      "content_preview": "We were so excited to visit Lost in Paradise Rooftop in Long Island City based on the beautiful photos, but everything about this place felt like a scam once we got there. First off, the photos are wildly misleading. What you get in real life is a rooftop view partially obstructed by old warehouse tops and plastic eucalyptus pinned to the wall like someone went on a SHEIN bender for quick and easy (tacky) decorations. Including green velvet fabric stapled to the  walls. Which no offense to their designer except it was advertised differently. They automatically tack on 20% gratuity, even though we were a party of 2, and it’s nowhere to be found on the menu, reservation page, or signs. This is common where we are from but It wouldn’t sting so bad if we’d actually had a server. She took our order and disappeared. The host brought our food, drinks, and checked in on us throughout our meal and we didn’t see our server till she brought us the bill telling us gratuity was already included. I would have preferred to tip the hostess who was actually handling our table, yet the server who ghosted us still earned 20% of our bill? Automatic grat is fine I’d just have preferred they be upfront and clear about it. Sodas were $6 per refill, which we weren’t told until after. And if you stay more than 1.5 hours, they charge you $50 per person for overstaying. I’m not exaggerating. It’s written in tiny fine print before you get to the menu when you scan the QR code. This however wasn’t a problem for us seeing that our meal took a total of 33 mins before they took our plates and brought the check.  This was due to portion size and how the food was somehow ready within 5 mins. To top it off, someone on staff was screen-mirroring their personal Spotify to the TVs and literally skipping songs every 3 seconds when they didn’t like them. Totally ruined the vibe and made the whole experience feel like we were crashing a poorly planned house party. And the food? Awful. We paid for chips and salsa and got a sad 2 oz ramekin of cold tomato mush. “Loaded” nachos came with four chips that had actually toppings, and the rest were naked. The tacos were honestly inedible. My husband and I both have worked in nice restaurants, we know NYC prices, and we’re happy to pay for good food and service. But this was a money grab, plain and simple. The view is the only redeeming factor, but it’s not enough to save the experience seeing that the service and food were so bad. If you want to spend $100 on a snack and a view for half an hour there are so many better options. LIP is great if you just want to sit and have overpriced drinks listening to Katy Perry’s firework while the sun blinds you. Don’t be fooled by the pictures and social media hype. Lost in Paradise is all marketing and no quality, underwhelming, and a complete letdown.",
