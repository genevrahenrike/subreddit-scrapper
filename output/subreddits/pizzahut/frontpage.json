      "content_preview": "I started working at PH a little less than a year ago and the store I'm employed in is a really good store. Everything is always clean, all ingredients are used before the expiration date and we throw out anything that gets old, dough is proofed no longer than 1 day ago before being cooked, employees are mindful of the amount of sauce and toppings put on a pizza and if something doesn't look good coming out of the oven it gets remade. Basically it's nothing like the complaints and horror stories you sometimes read about in this sub. We have 3 stars on Google maps, anyone looking at our reviews would think we're the worst place to eat around here and 90% of our complaints are bs. Just last week we had a guy make a big order then come to pick up his food an hour late and then write a review about how bad it was. News flash, the food won't be very good if you leave it sitting in the warmer for an hour. He also complained about his medium wings not being spicy enough, he ordered mild. None of this is our fault but we can't reply or do anything about the 1 star review he left us including pictures. That's up forever for people to see without knowing the full context. Not too long ago we had a man come in demanding a refund because his pizza was under cooked, I look in the box and it's the most perfectly cooked pan pizza with a golden brown crust, looks like it came right out of the advertisement. The dude points at where he took a bite and says it's not cooked, obviously he just doesn't like that pan pizzas are fluffy or prefers his pizzas well done but whatever he gets his refund because you always have to accommodate the customer. Sometimes people complain about the sauce or cheese amounts. It's not often, only about 1% of our customers, but they're always the most vocal ones online. For 99% of our customers they're happy with the sauce, cheese, and cooking temperatures/times of our pizzas. It's ok if you want your pizza made a little differently, that being said. You not ordering according to your preferences is not a mistake on our end Occasionally we do make real mistakes like forgetting to include the wings when giving someone their food, but 90% of our complaints are not our fault. For my whole life whenever I heard someone make negative comments about a place they ate at I took those comments seriously. Now having worked at PH for almost a year and seeing what most of our complaints are like, I'm rethinking every instance that I heard someone complain about a restaurant and wondering if they were the problem.",

      "content_preview": "I love telling this story and I figured this sub would appreciate it. Buddy and I bartended at a Mexican place in college. He was the type who loved rambling on to drunk customers. Half the time he was buzzed himself. One night two guys come in late and sit at the bar. Few minutes before close. Sometimes restaurant employees act annoyed when people come in late but never my buddy. He loved everyone who would talk to him. They tell him they're starving because they went to get a pizza at a local place, it took a long time and the order was wrong so they got up and left. My buddy is obsessed with pizza hut, so he starts in on them. Telling them pizza hut is his favorite pizza, it's better than all the chains, all the local places. Says he'd rather get pizza hut than a NY slice or something \"authentic\". He's going on for a good 20 minutes about his love for the hut 😂. Guys eat some tacos, cash out, leave a big tip. One of them goes to the end of the bar to shake my Buddy's hand and says \"I don't think I've ever met someone who loves pizza hut as much as you man. I want you to have these.\" Hands him a stack of business cards. One is the guy's, which says regional manager or something similar on it. Under that was 50 individual coupons for free pizzas, no expiration dates! I may be misremembering some details, but on my life this is 95% accurate. My buddy was almost in tears and we ate pizza hut every weekend for a solid year 😂 The lesson, always be nice you never know who you are drunkenly rambling to.",
