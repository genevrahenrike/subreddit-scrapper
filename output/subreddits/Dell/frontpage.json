I've tried everything: updating drivers, updating Windows, uninstalling my camera, and even did a BIOS thing, but still nothing. I've reset and troubleshot it as well. I tried the Device Manager thing, but I couldn't find my Camera in the menu. I'm really fed up. It feels like the only thing left is to yank the camera out and maybe replace it, but surely, there should be another fix. I'd really appreciate some help. Okay thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I have a hobby of screwing around with dell xps and precision laptops. Must have had my hands on 15 by this point. I take them apart and put them together. Buy them for relatives and myself. Once I replaced a motherboard on XPS9560 to a motherboard from Precision 5530. I learned that most of the time everything fits, but you have to get generation specific heatsink and fans. So, this time around I had my hands on Precision 5550. And I wondered if I could upgrade it. I made a comparison between the two images of motherboards. That one and XPS 9530 (2023) and saw no difference besides the cpu/gpu switching sides. I ordered 13700h & 4060 xps9530 mobo from ebay. Ordered Precision 5570 heatsink and fans. Because 12th and 13th gen processors are almost identical and that's the only heatsink I found. Waited few weeks and everything arrived. I put everything together and it just worked. Important note, the 5550 had a full hd screen and it worked fine. However, I wanted to go with further upgrades. I had xps 9510 with 3.5k OLED screen available. And I tried putting that screen onto my new creation. The screen would give 2 yellow and 7 white lights error code, despite showing dell logo. I figured, they must have changed something between generations with OLED screen, but everything was fine with full hd one. I did not want to leave it behind and also ordered OLED screen from actual xps 9530 from aliexpress. That one fit and worked fine. Only issue is that  the screen/lid does not seal shut when closed and stays open by 3mm or so. Which is not an issue for me. Could be my specific issue too. Well, at the end I have xps9530 (2023) internals and screen within the body of precision 5550. The whole thing is probably just as expensive as buying actual 9530, but this was an experiment for me. The reason why I wanted to put this out there, is because when I was doing my research, gemini, chatgpt and internet in general told me this probably will not work and I want to prove it to a next guy that may decide to do this that it does indeed work. The dell laptops xps/precision from 2020-2023 body style have pretty much interchangeable parts. As long as you have correct heat sinks and fans that have two variants (gen 10/11 and 12/13 cpus). Everything else fits fine... with hd screen.",

Started with very basic machine to build on!  Was pretty bummed to find out the hard way that there's a problem loading the Sandbox componenet of Windows 11 Pro.  Install runs to 100% and then freezes, ultimately requiring a hard shutdown.  It then tries to \"recover\" by reinstalling and ends up with the same problem - 100% and freezes.  Worked with Dell Support for a couple hours.  Tried all the tricks to recover - Only way to get it functional again was a Factory Refresh.  Tried updating bios to latest  SupportAssist BIOS version - Same problem. Tried updating to latest documented Bios 1.7 - Same problem!  Dell tried to send me to \"Software Support\" to pay to troubleshoot!!  No way!  Right now gave up on Sandbox for the moment and continuing to test machine.  Seems like a nice machine other than that.  Loads all the other Windows Virtual components OK - Just not Sandbox - which of course is what I need.  Trying to decide whether to keep or return.  I've seen a couple people in various forums mention having the same problem.  Anyone else have the same box and tried installing Windows Sandbox?",

      "content_preview": "Here to share my sort of solution for the dead Nvidia dGPU on the XPS 7590 or Precision 5540. Problem : Nvidia GPU visible in Windows device manager, but only with a warning sign, showing error 43 no load assignable to Nivida GPU Nvidia Control Panel not opening drivers install fine without error, warning disappears in device manager (until reboot) but still no load assignable nvidia-smi command shows error GPU also not recognized in Linux (Fedora/Bazzite-NV) also described elsewhere, for example here Consequences : no fast GPU acceleration - defaulting to only utilize integrated UHD630 iGPU from CPU very high constant temperature output and loud fans, even without any load extreme short battery life (1h with just browsing > 97Wh Battery + FHD Screen) Cause : according to some forum, they proposed the solder of one of the Nvidia GPUs vram memory chips may went bad Nvidia GPU can not be fully disabled (not in bios, not in device manager...) and sucks high power (on idle) in the background leading to high temps, noise and short battery runtime \"Solution\": reflowing or maybe replacing the vram memory chips \"should\" solve it > I tried: heating each vram chip for 30s at 480°C with an electronics heat gun > Nvidia GPU worked again!! BUT... only for approx 20min - after that same problem as before > heating it again / longer did nothing crazy 0$ \"fix\" : accepting fate (repair is expensive...) > killing Nvidia GPU completely > I figured even though you cannot completely disable it in software... why not do it in hardware... it is broken anyway. My best guess was to desolder/cut all power running to the Nvidia GPU and hope it doesn't brick the thing - using images from the Core i5 non Nvidia GPU mainboard variant of this device and confirming it with the XPS' board scematics... I tried unsoldering 5 inductors (see pictures) from the PCB... 2 of them I managed, on the other 3 the solder did not melt... I took a wrench and chopped them off. Not beautiful or professional... BUT! it worked!! We lost all access to the Nvidia GPU and can only use the integrated UHD630 from now... but the system is now 90% of time running passive cooling at 0db (browsing with lots of tabs, word, youtube, everyday stuff ....) and battery runtime is made great again haha! all ports/video outs still work, no issues!!! (Bonus for Hackintoshers: MacOS Power Management also benefits from the GTX 1650 not being around anymore haha) - if you ever want to repair the Nvidia DGPU in future, I guess that the technician could resolder the inductors back to the board too to fix it as well as fixing the vram modules. https://preview.redd.it/fix-dell-xps-15-7590-precision-5540-dead-broken-faulty-v0-5mgvb5kd6mmf1.jpg",

The system was under warranty, and before the issue, it was running Windows 11 24H2, fully updated and stable. After service, the laptop was restored using Windows 11 21H2, which is a much older build. The random restarts have stopped — which is great — but I’m now facing persistent compatibility issues: • OneDrive refuses to log in • Windows Update doesn’t offer any newer builds • Missing update options like “Get the latest updates as soon as they’re available” • Reliability Monitor still shows instability • General mismatch between drivers, BIOS, and OS features I’ve confirmed that 21H2 is outdated and not ideal for my hardware. This feels like a misalignment between the recovery process and the actual requirements of the device. I’m wondering: What should I do?? Any advice is helpful just got this laptop in February and I’ve done extensive troubleshooting already. I just want my system to run the way it was designed to. Thanks in advance.",

      "content_preview": "Just curious if anyone else has run into this with the Dell Vostro 15 3530 brand new laptop. Fan noise: right from power-on (before Windows even loads) the fan spins like a jet engine at max RPM and never quiets down. BIOS is up to date, drivers are up to date, but the fan behavior doesn’t change. On other Vostros I’ve set up, the fan only spins up briefly at startup or under load, then calms down. This unit never does. Windows Explorer delay: it takes 15–20 seconds for File Explorer to populate mapped drives after login. Once they’re loaded, opening new Explorer windows is fast. I suspect this might be related to moving an SSD between machines before reinstalling Windows 11, but I’ve done that plenty of times on other hardware without issues. Has anyone else with a Vostro 3530 experienced the “always full-blast fan” problem? Is the slow Explorer startup a quirk of this model, or just my SSD migration being messy this time? Would appreciate hearing if this is a common pattern or if I just got unlucky with this unit.",

      "content_preview": "I have a Dell Vostro Laptop, and recently I swapped out the 2230 NVMe SSD for a Lexar NM790 1 TB, M.2 PCIe NVMe. I tried cloning the drive, but for some reason it kept freezing. I decided to simply install a fresh copy of Windows instead, and it worked fine for a while. Now it's crashing, and when rebooting, the BIOS says \"No Hard Drive Detected\", and tries to boot from ipv4 aftewards. For the first 2 days of usage, it crashed like that once a day, now it happens many many times a day. The obvious thing to me is that the SSD is simply not in properly, but I reseated it and it seems fine. CDInfo also shows 100% health, and the SSD is brand new. The boot order is also set properly. The only idea I have left is that the BIOS is set to RAID for some reason, even after resetting the settings, but swapping it to AHCI results in it not being able to boot. I tried using this SSD with the system on another computer, and it seems to be working okay? It doesn't seem to me like a system issue, so I don't think reinstalling would help, since the BIOS doesn't even try to boot from the drive after it crashes. On the other pc, according to Lexar DiskMaster, the firmware on the SSD is up to date too, and it completes the full disc scan fine as well I'm kinda at a loss of that to do, I swapped back to the old SSD for now and it seems to be working fine as well.",

I recently received an rtx 2070 from a friend as a gift, but I knew that in order to run it I would need to upgrade my power supply to 500W. So, I purchase a new Dell power supply on their website (the same that they use for the G5 5000 pre build but for 500W) knowing that Dell has proprietary systems built in to their computers. And my dad’s friend who’s pretty knowledgeable on PC’s helped me install the new dell power supply. But after properly plugging in everything, my computer wouldn’t run and even when we switched back to the 350W power supply it still wouldn’t function. My dad’s friend believes that it may be an issue with the switch, but I’m asking you guys if you have any idea or insight on my situation and if simply swapping out the power supply could cause my computer to stop working. Any help or response would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",

      "content_preview": "I have a Latitude 2120 that's in need of a new battery.  The problem is, Dell doesn't sell the OEM battery anymore. Parts-people doesn't have the battery. If I buy any \"completely compatible\", \"high quality\" replacement battery on Amazon, the system doesn't recognize it and refuses to charge it. The system works fine on AC but that's not the point. If I can't get a new battery that works, and any new battery that I can buy is useless after it runs out, what does Dell expect me to do?  Is there any workaround to the replacement battery refusing to charge? How do those places even manage to market them as compatible if they don't work?",
