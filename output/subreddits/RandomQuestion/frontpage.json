Also, I tend to hold my phone pretty high, pretty much at chest level, because my eyesight isn’t great and I need to see the screen better. I'm not even sure if it’s because of my eyesight, or if most people just hold their phone like this?? Because it's more comfortable? I’m wondering if that makes it more likely for the person right behind me to see what I’m doing… is it even visible from that angle? Would love to hear if anyone else experiences this and how you deal with it 😅",

They'll literally put a picture of some horrendous mouth cancer on the pack, but people still buy them and smoke while looking at the picture 😂. At some point, you have to just give up. If people wanna get mouth cancer or whatever other thing might come from smoking, well let them. Today I saw a guy opening a pack, the pack literally said \"cigarettes are bad for you\" but it might as well not be there. Why bother? Its wasted effort. If people are going to keep smoking let them, as far as non smokers are concerned, its not our boat, if you end up suffering from it, as long as you dont bitch about it, we dont wanna hear that shit. So these companies need to use their effort on other things, its a free world.",
