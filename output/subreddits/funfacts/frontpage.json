The tire, that simple piece of rubber, is what made our entire, bizarre culture of driving possible. It's the reason we spend hours in traffic, scream at other drivers, and then turn right around and take a spontaneous, long-distance road trip just for fun. ​The tire is the unsung hero of our lives—it has seen you in your best moments and your worst. It's been with you on your first solo drive, on the long journey to college, and on countless trips to the grocery store. ​So the next time you're stuck in traffic, think about that little fun fact. The tire is more than just a piece of equipment; it's a silent witness to all the strange, beautiful, and sometimes insane things we do every single day.",

This type of painting is extremely unusual. A friendship between a black woman and a white woman. And they're both smiling, and there's no sense that the black woman is a servant. they're equals as much as it can be in the painting. A few other little facts: being the child of an enslaved black a woman and a navy officer. It's extremely good. Look down upon as you can imagine. But she still got a good education, which is unusual right as you can imagine. Despite all this, she was taught to be a young \"lady\". which put her add an advantage and you can see this depicted in the film. All this detailed information, I looked up after I saw the movie belle.  This woman shows that not everything in history was black and white. Pun intended.

      "content_preview": "So there was a TV show one of my friends was in as a child. In the show there were a bunch of children that were left in a forest and there were cameras everywhere filming them they had children from a bunch of different countries and backgrounds and luckily some knew farming and have seeds on them all the time and some knew how to build. Anyway s the show made it to year 10 (season 10) before it had to be stopped because some of the girls started getting pregnant and giving birth but mainly because they not only were mining but also making firearms and attacking anyone who they didn't recognize or have a badge (not so fun fact) they actually created a government and almost got recognized by Ireland then tried declaring war on Mexico. this was filmed in the US somewhere in the Humboldt-Toiyabe Forest.",

      "content_preview": "The wry insight of Jonathan Swift, that a lie may go half-way round the world before the truth has got on its shoes, seizes in a witty way upon the irritating fact that a lie has greater chances to reach farther than a truth. In the age of the digital world, this reality is more pronounced: fake news hits the world wide web in a matter of minutes, whereas truth needs time to be proven and spread. Many life quotes about truth explore this same idea: truth may be slow, but it is steady and enduring. https://preview.redd.it/fun-fact-a-lie-will-go-around-the-world-before-the-truth-v0-1wgodbpmndkf1.jpg The Reasons as to Why Lies Spread So Fast It is not unusual that lies travel more quicker since they are framed in a way that would spark anyone to share the lie to feel the emotions of fear, anger or excitement that accompany it, and without the need to verify information. Truth on the other hand is evidence-oriented and needs time to assemble and prove. This is why life quotes about truth remind us to be patient; accuracy may move slowly, but it is far more reliable. The problem has intensified due to social media. Just one sensational fake can make a couple of millions of views and the truth still might not have reached even a thousand. Gods of Truth Works Lies might cut it in the race in the short-term but hardly do they pass the test of time. Even the most common lies can be broken by truth according to which nobody hid everything. Many life quotes about truth compare honesty to light—it may dawn slowly, but when it rises, it cannot be stopped. The metaphor used by Swift of truth putting on its shoes is the one that connotes the diligence that has to be taken to ensure confirmation of truths, evidence and reliable communication. This may not appear to be a swift way of getting things done but the truth that comes out of this is very stable. How To Insure ourselves Against Lies Awareness of information means that to stop the pace of lies we need to be aware of what we are consuming. Life quotes about truth inspire us to pause before accepting or sharing a story. Verifying assertions, pursuing a variety of views and challenging sloppy reporting are some of the means by which the truth can be stalked. Truth also requires champions - individual who is not afraid to disseminate factual information over a rumor even though the latter is usually more entertaining. Life according to Swift Wisdom The following are steps by which you could live by this quote: Check before you share-Speed is now less important than accuracy. Promote evidence-based Speech - Support the argument of the evidence-based authorities instead of rumouring. Kind to truth--Put Gentle to pass a test. By following these practices, we align our actions with the wisdom found in life quotes about truth and help create a culture where honesty is valued. Final Thoughts Jonathan Swift tells us that the lies always run forward, but the truth is a long-distance runner. The message behind life quotes about truth is clear—accuracy matters more than speed. The truth, even though it requires time to tie its shoes, once it decides to go, nothing could impede its path to the destination.",
