One of the KR team members appeared on the KR official YouTube live show last year, but people complained in the live chat that he was an account buyer, so the official YouTube video was changed to private. And a year later, he formed a team by gathering many account buyers without any restrictions, and one of them is a famous dungeon macro cheat user in kr. Does Blizz, which makes fools of users who follow the TOS, have the confidence to tolerate this ugly past every time it releases an RPG game in the future? https://www.reddit.com/r/DiabloImmortal/s/yP42z0jUzF And good luck to the JL team fighting against TOS violators.",

The entire opinion was based on the perspective of a super whale (the 0.01% of players that spend insane amounts of money). Obviously, that doesn’t reflect the reality of 99.9% of the player base. Yes, Diablo Immortal has issues — no one denies that — but reducing the entire discussion to “only whales can play/enjoy” is just lazy. Most of us who actually play daily know that you can progress, and have fun without dropping thousands of dollars. It’s frustrating to see big creators shaping the public opinion of the game without giving it a fair shot. The narrative becomes completely distorted, and anyone who hasn’t played just assumes it’s an unplayable pay-to-win scam. Curious to know: how do you all feel when you see these big streamers or YouTubers talking about DI without really understanding how the average player experiences the game? here's the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWOlXFPRGmA",

      "content_preview": "TLDR - Went in with no expectations. It was good, it was fun. Hi Guys, Devs, community managers, it's me, from OCE Bloodsworn. One time my cat was on the front page of Reddit (so you know this post is good). Now that the whale Hunger Games are over, I'd like to make a REVIEW of Bout as someone around 5k Reso, roughly 5-6k secondaries, who doesn't bother with shadow war or anything boring, and mainly does PVP and play against the meta with fun but ultimately crappy builds. All opinions are subjective, but I'd like to see the community give their two cents too, since the vast majority of us who stuck around are hector to bottle nose dolphins by now. Our team got to top 32, and on the 16 round, we ran into the winners of OCE, JL (Congrats!) Fun Factor = I perrsonally had lots of fun. I knew there was no way to beat the whales, so I tried a few builds and ideas, and ultimately decided on playing an old Trap DH build, using immobalisation, no-Dash, dots, and CC-break dash. Testing and experimentation, together with indecisions, poor decisions, bad decisions, and last minute decisions - very, very fun. Good job blizzease! Time Factor = 1 hour per night, monday to friday. For the amount of fun I had, and that everyone managed to show up (go DA BOYS) it was a good time. People were committed and we all had good time. (Discounting JL making me into a hamburger while we went 1300 / 0. That was just... a time) Spend Factor = Congrats blizzease, you managed to make me finally spend another k over two weeks to get my Pot to 7.5k among other things like 4/4 Ess testing. I am around 12k in over three years, and considering this is the only game I play (have time to play), its worth. (For someone who was previously into MTG Crack, 40k Crack, you get it...) Community Factor = VERY GOOD. our team bonded through the collective victories we won, and the collective trauma of getting our asses handed to us in some earlier games due to us having NO FRIGGING IDEA. Then we did lots of conspiracy style game planning and anti-meta, and we won everything until, like the Wicked Witch, we got crushed by a House (deposit (s)). Total Review = 4.5 / 5 enjoyable. It was engaging, and I liked the planned and the community aspect. We lost due to being poor, but that's how this game works by default, so you can't fault that. The whales keep the server running after all. The future = What I hope to see at least ... as a once a year thing. Fair Mode Arathi Basin or Tower ==> So that the 150 crsts actually mean something to the winners Organised Clan local server mode ==> A \"winner's bragging cloak\" that does the round every rotation (maybe 4 times a year?) Or just MORE of this type of thing if Blizzease absolutely has as the same attitude toward Whales as Japanese Scientists. What do you guys think? Write your thoughts below! Like and Subscribe!",

Maybe the MONKS that entered just weren't good enough.. maybe not enough of them entered because no one plays MONKS anymore.  Maybe its just bad balance and heavy nerfs.. Too bad the games devs don't look at those same numbers and do something to correct them. All about the balance.. I'm just sayin'",
