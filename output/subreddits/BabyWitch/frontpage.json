      "content_preview": "So I‚Äôve been super drained lately, I don‚Äôt know how to explain. I‚Äôll try my best, though. I get being drained after doing spell work, and I realized that I haven‚Äôt really been grounding before doing such. So I started grounding and shielding before divination, spells, before and after sleeping, not working. At one point I had gotten a huge headache for a whole with no explanation (I was on my period, but it was the 5th day and I NEVER had something like this happen). A little history: Before I moved into my apartment with my cousin and her boyfriend, my room was occupied by my cousins brother. He had a LOT going on. So yesterday I decided I may be tired because there‚Äôs a lot of sprits around that are unwanted. So I cleansed, saged my room and bathroom, put incense, rang my bells, salted, etc. etc. Still not working. I‚Äôve been in and out of sleep, and maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm bored because I don‚Äôt have a job and are looking for one. But even when I go out somewhere I‚Äôm just so sleepy‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm never like that Possible explanations: 1- bored and have nothing to do lmao 2- I vape so maybe I just get really tired from that? Probably not. 3- my cousin and her boyfriend are pretty toxic to each other, maybe that‚Äôs effecting the energy? 4 I‚Äôm doing something wrong Thanks and happy 1st <3 TL;DR:  why am I tired no matter what I do? Let me know if you guys have any questions, I know it probably doesn‚Äôt make too much sense.",

I was taught that if you sinned or made a mistake, you would go to hell or whatever. I‚Äôm 20 and I decided that my relationship with God was a fearful one and I didn‚Äôt want to worship someone who wants you to be scared. Idk, this has been frustrating because I have anxiety and my life is already hard enough. I‚Äôm doing my research and yet people are saying that you can be punished for making a mistake.

      "content_preview": "I recently did my first cord-cutting ritual related to an unhealthy relationship. Afterwards, I felt lighter, clearer, and relieved‚Äîit really helped me to see the connection visually and symbolically. That said, I‚Äôve noticed some thoughts and old energy creeping back in. I‚Äôve stayed fully no-contact and haven‚Äôt broken that boundary, but I‚Äôm wondering how to best handle the lingering rumination. Would it make sense to repeat the ritual, or would it be better to focus more on reinforcing boundaries and other practices? I‚Äôd love suggestions for ways to symbolically or intentionally represent releasing these lingering thoughts and energy.",

      "content_preview": "Hi, can use please stop posting pictures of your egg cleanse. Traditionally, you're not even supposed to look at the egg yourself after a cleanse, because doing so can reopen the energy you were trying to release. When you post pictures of your cleanse, anyone who sees them may unintentionally take on the very energy or negativity you were trying to get rid of. You are affecting others too, not just yourself. Its also not the best thing to interpret the results yourself. Egg cleanse is mostly about releasing that negative energy out. If you do decide to interpret it. Be mindful and dont share the pictures of the results. You could describe it in writing what the egg looks like. And any peraon who chooses to interact with your post is doing it at their own discretion. Please be mindful of the ritual and the well being of the community.",

In that year I was diagnosed with cancer and I know some part of me died during that treatment‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in remission (I function on one adrenal gland), can lucid dream, have intuitive sense on people in real life, and have been looking for many answers that I don‚Äôt know the question to ever since. I am a Christopagan I guess, non-practicing in anything at the moment until I figure out how to sleep safely. Recently I‚Äôve had some noticeably terrible dreams that involved my mother in some way, usually indirectly, where the dream will go dark around me, just shutting down, falling apart, and then I wake up in a sweat or fall into another dreamscape. I have looked at r/dreams but that didn‚Äôt seem like the right place. I don‚Äôt have a good relationship with my mother as she was/is emotionally and physically abusive and manipulate, ‚ÄúChristian Karen‚Äù type. I no longer live with her, feel free to look at my early posts in r/raisedbynarcisists . I fear that these recent dreams have been really bad because she has come to visit my new apartment and brought her bad energy to us. I kind of understand what the dreams represent and came home crying to my bf about it one day. I am looking for good ways to spiritually clean my apartment space, strong/heavy duty ones if yall know any, I just want to sleep/dream peacefully. My dreams have not stopped in the 22 years I‚Äôve been in remission and I just want to feel safe in my space. Also if there are any grounding/protection/sleep rituals, I‚Äôm open to suggestions.",

I have a coworker who is also my neighbor (wonderful)  I recently found out was behind a lot of my misfortunes the last 2 years, how? she blurted it out herself because she said ‚Äúyou seem too happy these days‚Äù and she wanted a way to put me down. She admits she knows more about me that I even do. she‚Äôs been doing things, and another friend of mine who is beautifully clairvoyant confirms it. Yesterday she became jealous again because I was simply in a good moon and on my way back my taxi almost crashed because the tire got punctured. It also felt completely unnatural even the driver himself was shocked. I have been protecting myself, my black tourmaline broke before this almost accident as it is taking up a lot of negativity to protect me. I saw a vision that she has something with her, and it‚Äôs an extremely dark entity. The only motive is none but enjoyment, it was eerie. Every time I have a good window open up for me she does whatever she can to sabotage it. Predicts months were I‚Äôll be prosperous and then does whatever she can do impact it with her negativity. It is obsessive and crazy behavior. I need something strong, and likely permanent to stop her. She herself admits she does not want any woman where she works or lives because she loses herself in jealousy. Her own sister died mysteriously.",

      "content_preview": "Hello witches of all shapes and sizes, I need your help as an intermediate pagan witch, so recently I‚Äôve had signs and dreams of something reaching out and I‚Äôm not sure what it could be.. so first I‚Äôll start all the way back in late June/early July I saw a feather on my way back from taking out the trash first we me and my mom thought it was a raven but then i thought it was a pigeon.. it‚Äôs a crow feather, I then saw raven/crows in this book at a fair in the only line which wasn‚Äôt crowded, I then saw a tree of life pendant on my bed, i thought I stepped on it but I would‚Äôve felt it, the things that disappeared or vanished seem to be found in obvious spots like behind the trash can or next to my bed in the living room. I had seen about 15 art on books or posters at Barnes and noble plus a real crow in my day that was within an hour and a meme about a crow.. my friend said I remind him of an owl because I‚Äôm curious and wise, my mom gave me a snow owl necklace and a few nights later I realize that I am hella drawn to Lilith for some reason when I was at the metaphysical store near my house that thankfully has festivals.. I had a dream about a girl with long black hair and she and I were doing witchcraft in a BIG cauldron and she was wearing green almost forest dress with a corset and a witchy hat, think of a Sarah Sanderson outfit or like the witch. She and I also had witch hats on our head and she had a snow owl on her shoulder, her face wasn‚Äôt clear (I didn‚Äôt write all of it down like I should‚Äôve) but she did speak to me I just don‚Äôt remember every detail.. I saw the number 3 a lot like 3 graveyards, I also remember seeing a black cat in a aldis look into my direction. I did a guided meditation and based on my experience I saw Hecate but I am not sure if it was just my imagination or if I did it right But honestly everyone says it seems like Lilith, Hecate, Morrigan, or even Ceridwen Besides Jon solo YouTube channel where can I learn about these beings?",
