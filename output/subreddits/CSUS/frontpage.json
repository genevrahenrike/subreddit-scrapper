Atm I commute to school, but my friend and I are about to move into an apartment near campus and we’d really love to have a little group of girls to hang out with! I find it hard  to make friends in my classes, so I figured I’d try here—if you’re also looking for friends, feel free to DM me or send me ur ig and I’ll reach out! Some things I’m into: going to the gym/fitness, thrifting, fall activities, anime, crocheting, dressing up for a night out, or just grabbing coffee. Honestly, I get along with pretty much anyone and would love to meet some new people !",

      "content_preview": "Hey, just wanted to help some people out with tips for parking the beginning of the semester.... Don't go to garage 2. Its full by 9am. Go to garage 3 or somewhere out in the big lots. Garage 1 take forever to get in and out of. They ticket you parking in carpool. Id avoid it. If you come in from College town, go on the little road by the alumni building or stadium drive. Don't go down the road toward garage 2. You'll hit even worse traffic. If you come in from J street, you'll hit traffic between like 8:30 and 9am. Come before that if time permits. You'll definitely be late if you try to go to campus 10 minutes before class starts. Come 30 mins to an hour early for the first 2 weeks and it will get better. Hope that can help someone.",
