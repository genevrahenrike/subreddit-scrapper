      "content_preview": "This will be a long post (with a lot of grammar errors, but english isnt my first language) but i wanted to write a fic about how huey give to the orginal clan members the gems and why. I have just a couple of problem :  i dont have the design of them (except for olivine) AND for some of them doesnt feel... good. Like they need to improve, expecially from people who like those characters more than me. Yakumo: we know. He is the only clan member who born with the gemstone that we could see his ancestor backstory. Edmond: i make him a long long distant relative of the king: normally, medival nobles were all linked togheter, and he could be a branch family. His ancestor was the founder of the royal capital, a person who use huey power for protect his village, and he become the first king. Olivine: Huey didnt mind about the gender of the person who has a contract with him. Oli ancestor was a woman who used her house as an orphanage, protecting children without a home. This give an explaination on why olivine have the gemstone in that point: we know that the part of the body of the clan member with the gemstone would become unuseful. She lost the power to generate life, but with huey's divine power she could protect all of the children. And how she could give her gemstone to her discendent? Well, bloodlines arent just direct. She could have a sibilling, with the same blood. Quincy and Kuya we can skip them, because they were the ones who make a pact with huey. Garukaru: god, i love the hc  for my babies. Their gemstone is on their neck. This means also vocal chord. The moonstone ancestor was the Alpha wolf in the pack. And he (not sure of the gender) exchange his \"voice\" for the save the pack from a calamity. Starvation?  Illness? I dont have the idea yet, but he scarifice his howl for the sake of the pack. This also reflect garukaru being kidnap: they were tortured, humiliated, treat as object... and they couldnt scream. Even if they scream, no one would save them. Its like the phrase \"if a tree fall in the woods, and no one hear it, you can say it make a sound?\" No one hear them. Its like they didnt make a sound at all. And when someone finally hear them, the gemstone was removed from their body. But this isnt a post about my children, so we have the next one! Blade is skipped like kuya and quincy. He recived the gemstone directly from huey. Dante: Obiuvsly, the founder of Solaria. I think that he give his eye for not being fooled anymore by mirages and for have the power to create a home for his citizen, a group of nomads who survive in the desert. And at last: Rei. I gived to edmond the royal gemstone because for him i have... a better idea. I really hc that Rei (and Quincy) is an half human half youkai. Rei's mother, for me, was a bird youkai who loved humans so much that he fell in love with an human man. One of my hc is that she make a pact with Huey when she was pregnant, and instead to being the one with gemstone attached to her body, the one with it was her son, who was still a part of her. The pact? I have two hc: the first and the one i like more, she wanted to give to her lover more year to live. Because i want belive that the nobles treat  Rei and his mother like we see because she married the king of the capital AFTER rei being born. The second theory is that she wanted to become the ambassador and become the bridge between youkai and humans. Those are my theory and hc about ancestors of everyone. Yeah, the edmond and dante ones were too similar, and i dont really like them like the olivine, garukaru and rei one. And as i say... i dont wanted them being identical to the actual clan members. Like, i hc garukaru being like this because of the forced transformation, so their ancestor would never look like them.",

      "content_preview": "In yet another installment of my weird fascination with headcanons: How well would the boys do with kids (a family friend has their 9 month old with them, so I’m in a bit of a baby fever lol) Eiden: Good big brother. Does better with kids as opposed to infants/toddlers. Popular with the kids he’s babysat Aster: Keeps his distance, kids are too expensive anyway Morvay: Is kept away by Aster, probably for the best. Will wave at babies and gets really excited if one waves back Yakumo: Cries more than the baby. For the love of Klein do not leave your baby with him alone, because he will freeze up and panic. If he’s with someone who’s good with kids though, he relaxes. Always knows what foods are good for kids Edmond: A bit stiff and unsure of what to do unless given explicit instructions. But rest assured he will protect that baby with his life Olivine: I mean, do I even need to say anything?? Literally Mother, end of sentence Quincy: Keeps his distance, thinks kids are too troublesome (also a bit weary after being shunned by the tribe). Relaxes if he’s with someone like Eiden or Olivine, and has been convinced to hold some kids. Best napping buddy tho Topper: squeaks in thinks kids are cute, but not cuter than him ofc. Will play with older kids who know to be gentle Kuya: No. (has definitely made kids cry, both on purpose and on accident. Very rarely has he ever given kids the time of day. One time, the clan was looking after a toddler, and the kid wasn’t scared by him. “Begrudgingly” held the kid and almost wouldn’t give them back) Garu: Loves kids of all ages, and is always sure to be on his best behavior. Likes going to the Water Temple with Olivine and playing with the kids at the orphanage (he’s quite popular with the younger kids. Affectionately nicknamed “Fluffy” by them) Karu: Pretends to be as uninterested as Kuya and will try to scare kids. Much less successful though, especially with the orphanage kids thanks to Garu Blade: loves kids, but needs someone with him to make sure he is too “intense” (He’s very… aggressive… with his love. His heart’s in the right place though) Dante: Pretends to be annoyed by kids, but everyone knows he has a soft spot for them, especially for fellow orphans. Eiden, Rei, and Kuya all tease him about it, but Olivine has stated that he’s always welcome to visit the Water Temple orphanage if he’s in the area (Dante has taken him up on that offer a few times, under the guise of “making sure the kids grow to be strong warriors” Olivine just pretends he believes it) Sooley: rawrs in kids are cute and sometimes interesting to watch. But he’s cuter ofc Rei: Also no (much less overt in his disdain than Kuya, but still makes it obvious. Lost babysitting privileges when he tried using a kid for an experiment that “definitely wasn’t dangerous”) Father: coos in no Bonus: Huey: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA. No. Fucking deadbeat- As always, feel free to share hehe",
