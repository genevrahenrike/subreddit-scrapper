      "content_preview": "I am slightly annoyed and would like some outside views on this. My boyfriend was on a work trip and there he met a colleague who also had hypermobility syndrome, though I don't know to what degree. And apparently they talked about it, my boyfriend asked some questions because, well, I have it. They talked about how strength training is really important (duh, we all know that, it's literally one of the only things that can be done to lessen the symptoms). That colleague also told him about some kind of psychosomatic Hypermobility, which basically means an over-sensitivity to pain. And now my boyfriend is really questioning all my symptoms and wondering if I might have that. Saying, if that's what I have, there might be different treatments that could help. And insisting that I should get the genetic test, even though I could only get it via doctor's referral and they haven't deemed it \"bad enough\" to justify. I know his considerations come from a good place. But I am not proud to say that I always get a little triggered when he comes up with that because I have had so many discussions with Doctors and health care professionals, who have tried to tell me that my pain was psychosomatic, even though I got my diagnosis over a year ago for hypermobility, finally. And it's clearly a systemic issue (not POTS, no subluxing AFAIK, but dysautonomia, I scored 5/9 on the Brighton, have issues with chronic pain, digestion, vision, neurodivergency, other physical quirks, you catch my drift). So does anyone have experience with the \"psychosomatic\"/ oversensitivity to pain kind of hypermobility? Is that a thing?",

      "content_preview": "Hey people! I found a wonderful and helpful community here many years ago and things have been going a lot better for most of the time. The resources I found through this community have been helpful in finding ways to deal with pain and injury. But I find myself coming back here after another one of those frustrating days where help seems to just not exist! I've been first diagnosed with some sort of hypermobility issue when I was 13 and I'm now 37. It's been a continuous battle of meeting people who know absolutely nothing at all or highly outdated things at best, and trying to convince them that something's wrong. Most of the help available in my country is not covered by insurance,  so I've been paying out of pocket for bandages, kinesio tape, braces, splints, crutches and ergonomic stuff for most of my life. Today I saw an orthopaedic specialist for the first time after finally getting the choice to get a referral. The apprentice doctor who saw me and reviewed my x-rays was a sweetheart and was pretty thorough. His supervisor stepped in for 2 minutes, double checked her apprentice's work, then proceeded to aks me to show how hypermobile I am (as if the diagnosis by her colleague from rheumatology 2 years prior was not valid) and prescribed me: a truckload of painkillers. She was sooooo unfriendly as well, like she'd left her heart in the fridge. It's insane to me how both my GP's assistant, who referred me, and this lady are so quick to dismiss things based on the fact that there's no obvious injury or incident that leads up to this pain. I've never found painkillers to be useful for my pain so I'm reluctant to follow her advise. Sadly, there's not really any community in my country that offers support for these issues and only 2 hospitals that have specialised doctors. My PT has been an angel but he doesn't offer much in the way of preventative care, he can't help me with working out and my visits are only partially covered by insurance. So now I'm looking for something else and honestly, at this point it's just praying that I find someone who can provide actual care. Thanks for reading <3",

      "content_preview": "Kinda a funny observation, kinda long-winded sorry. TLDR at bottom. So, I've had joint pain since I was a kid, but especially the last 5 years. I was pretty much crippled for 2 years, but have been doing relatively decently the last 2 years. I'm 20 now. It has been raining like nonstop this summer, I've been flaired up for like 2-3 months and it's very annoying. Last month, on my way to work (internship), nice and bright at 8am, an old lady runs a stop sign in her SUV and hits my car in an intersection. Luckily both of us were okay but my car's totaled and her front bumper was gone. My dad came and picked me up and I was already half way to work. So I just asked to be dropped off, I already told my manager I'd be late. Him and his boss asked up and down if I was okay, needed to go home, the office nurse, the works. I said no and the work day was normal. We had a dinner that night for a coworker's resigning and my manager's boss asked how I was feeling, then prompted me to tell the story to the rest of the coworkers there. They were all astonished I came into work, even though I swore I felt okay. My manager's boss pretty much all but insisted I stay home the next day, which I did because I woke up a bit sore. Anyway, I have since realized I was probably a bit sore throughout that day from the crash. But I'm so used to functioning in a base level of pain that it didn't even register that I should go home. With chronic pain, I either live my life or I don't (not counting rest days/breaks), and when I do it just is usually in pain. Like yeah, a healthy coworker absolutely would be like \"wow that shook me up, I'm a bit sore, I'm gonna go home.\" But my life generally doesn't have the option to persue my goals and be 100% pain free, so I went about my day as I normally do. Also, none of them know about my condition/pain. I probably look a little unhinged to my coworkers now lol. TDLR: Was in a car crash and still went to work. Realized everyone was shocked I didn't go home because healthy people don't just keep truckin on through pain.",

Im so lost. I have absolutely no idea if ive experienced one (for reference im in pt for neck pain and then got referred to get evaluated for my joints so now im just waiting) but like a common thing that happens to me is that my shoulder grinds (it grinds every time i rotate backwards) and then just like buckles and shits out? but i don’t have to shove it in or anything, i just move and it kinda fixes itself. anyway im begging, please explain subluxation to me like im five",

My joints move too far and its painful. I just thought this was normal and I was out of shape and needed to stretch more. Which isn’t inaccurate. But the more work i put into getting in shape and stretching the more my joints hurt. I even went as far as to give myself “sprained fingers” on my non dominant hand.

Im around 12-15 (age range for privacy) and everyone else my age likes sports and stuff and I feel like the only one suffering with a condition. everyone else can choose whatever sports they like and the only thought is \"do i have fun?\" Where as for everything I have to see if it will hurt me or if its even worth doing, that darn checklist for everything I do. I want to be able to have some fun in my life but usually im forced into walking for very long like on holidays and stuff.

Im 16F, and I am very hypermobile and have been my whole life, the whole shabang, shoulders, elbows, knees, hips, fingers, the whole package. Almost all of my female family on my moms side is too. My cousins knee disloactes becase it hyperextends, my grandma claimed she got arthritis from it but I don't know if thats true, and my aunt is pigeon toed because of her knees. It was never an issue for me, I just had cool party tricks (ex. licking my elbows, being able to put both legs behind my head). HOWEVER, in 8th grade I started getting really dizzy when I stood up and passing out. I also was having excruciating shoulder pain randomly and would be like writhing in pain in class, which I have a very high pain tolerance too. Then after plethora of appointments and tests a neurologist told me I have poor circulation because Im hypermobile. To get back into sports I had stopped doing and to eat more salt. Time has since passed as I'm now going into 12th grade (as of tomorrow), I got back into soccer at a competitive level, I did roller derby and hockey for a bit. I don't really struggle with  the dizziness aspect anymore. Since then my family started bringing me to their chiropractor who when I went in for my first assessment told me I had \"really interesting anatomy\"...exactly what you want to hear from a doctor lol. Anyways not the point, what I do struggle with most is my shoulders and hips. I literally am in pain 24/7, and people dont seem to get that. My shoulders click and pop like nobody's business, they partially dislocate (subluxation I believe is the word?). My shoulders will sometimes be in the wrong spot and I can feel it and its almost like I have to force them back to their right spot, which sometimes hurts sometimes not, but it always has a loud pop when I do it. And my hips do the same but not anywhere near as bad, they just pop a little in and out. My shoulders are absolutely horrible and when people hear me move them it grosses them out. I also have really bad chest pain randomly because of my lack of circulation and stuff, and it is just so annoying. And I dont know if hypermobility counts as a chronic illness but it sure as hell has chronic pain. And its so difficult to make people understand that I'm not just stretchy, I literally hurt all the time lol. It's just annoying and I'm sick of it yk. Also the spine pain after working is like nothing else. I work retail part time and during the summer and on weekends did alot of 8 hour shifts. Anything over 5 hours KILLED ME, it literally feels like my spine is like compressing into a little ball and its hell on earth. So annoying Thank you for listening!",

Is there strength training that can help? wow! good to hear I’m not alone. I too have had this feeling most of my life that I don’t know why this is harder for me. For me personally, the fingers on my left hand seem to be weak. I was doing all kinds of learning proper technique etcetc, but last guitar session when I worked at keeping the strength & shape in my fingers the pain was less. Gonna focus on building the strength more alongside everything else…",

Gripping things that are a larger diameter pulls my fingers out. Carrying things with my arm extended pulls my wrist out (sometimes elbow too) and carrying things close to my body with my arms curled causes subluxation in my elbow. I'm talking an arm full of clothes or bag of groceries. I bought hand strengthening tools but they ironically are too big for my hands, and especially the pinky and ring finger go all wonky when I try and use them. Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "Hey. I’m new to a lot of my health issues due to a lot of prior medical neglect that wasnt in my control, and I have a lot of questions now that I’m older and finally can go on my own and ask! Some things I’ve been compiling have me wondering if I do struggle with hyper mobility, along with a plethora of other things. I’ve talked to some doctors already, some have already made me do my “elbow trick” where I contort it as much as possible and from that they’ve told me I’m “semi-hyper mobile” so I was like ok. My ex was hyper mobile to the extreme so I accepted that I wasn’t -that- bad but that’s too much to unpack. Basically I think I am slowly accepting that too much is lining up and it might actually be more serious than what I’ve been told, including what ive told myself. What even made me want to write this, was kinda tmi.. but I was in the bathroom wiping and I had to bend to wipe my behind and whenever I turn or stretch my limbs or ESPECIALLY! MY RIBS!! they cramp so bad. They tense up, and they feel like they may snap, or they like, lock into place (please laugh it’s okay). So bending over, looking behind me, trying to pop a pimple over my shoulder is actually really painful and apparently that isn’t a normal thing. And when I was a kid and a bit skinnier, I used to shove my hand under my ribcage and grab it/feel around under it, even try flexing it a little. I think it’s normal for it to be somewhat flexible so that it can keep everything moving and intact inside but the way it feels in my body just feels so wrong.. Some other things I struggle with a lot -nausea -dysautonomia -extremely clumsy/uncoordinated/unbalanced -swollen aching popping sensitive joints even as a kid -standing and sitting and even laying down, doing pretty much anything is uncomfortable and hurts and I have to constantly wiggle around like a worm or else I am in more pain than usual -stomach/intestinal/bowel issues There’s a ton more I could list but I’m tired and just can’t think but if I don’t post this now I’ll forget and never post it. Anyways I just want to understand more and get perspectives, especially those who know they have this and struggle with it. I feel like I have the body of an 80 year old when I’m only 23 which is crazy to me. Thoughts? Comments? Questions? 💔 help I’m battling between… immune disorders? Is this just somehow what CPTSD does to the body? Is this a genetic thing I’ll never get answers to? Is it a disease? Will I be in pain for the rest of my life?",

I'm torn between maybe I'm/one is always leaning to reduce joint pressure, but also I've been told I need to strengthen my knees so wouldn't not leaning help with that? Tbh the hardest part is sitting normally. If my knees aren't bent less than 90 degrees at all times (or stretched out straight, no inbetween lol) then it SUCKS. So yeah, what do you guys do? Are you leaners? Has standing helped or hindered you? I'm lucky that I don't have any back issues (yet)",

I wouldn’t say it outright HURTS, but it is extremely uncomfortable, and when it happens once, it happens over and over that day. The more it happens, the more sore I feel in that area. Sometimes when I feel it, I can kind of twist around and shift my torso enough to get it “unhooked” but it’s weird and inconsistent. Does anyone else experience this or know what it is? A hypermobility PT said it sounds like a slipped rib, but I’ve had slipped ribs before, usually close to my sternum, and they tend to hurt a bit more than this. This is just uncomfortable.",

This article and subsequent reading and now more pieces in place. The info arrived five days after a first-in-a-long time overnight flight in which I was bloated, uncomfortable and could not sit still. Most of my relatively minor physical oddities seem to come back to this. I'm not sure how many times I've rolled my eyes or smiled as I've been reading. I don't have intense pain like some but I'm starting to admit that it is chronic, like I'm used to being in pain of some sort. I'm going to talk to my doctor about it at my next med check as well as talk to a Yogi about reviewing my regular practice to see where I'm sitting in my joints when I shouldn't be. It's something I work on, but I'm sure there's poses where I don't realize is happening. Now I'm getting ready to leave for a football game and tailgating, something that I really enjoy doing. Going to see friends and hang out. Weather is beautiful. But I'm really anxious and I was sitting here thinking I don't know why...and then it hit me that it's because my subconscious knows I'm about to be physically uncomfortable for the next six hours. It'll be worth it, better than missing out, but still. Anyway, just venting. I'm doing everything I can to mitigate and it will be fun overall.",

Anyway, the toe of my shoe caught on a lip in the door, and my full body weight pulled my knee right out. Then I proceeded to land on the injured knee to catch myself, again, with my full body weight. I kept walking, mostly because I didn’t want to draw attention, popped it back in, and didn’t notice anything about it for 4-5 hours. Well it’s been 6 ish hours now, and holy crap this thing is SORE.

      "content_preview": "I guess I’m just looking for similar experiences/stories. My baby was born exactly a month early. She’s been a bit behind on all her milestones, rolling, sitting, crawling & now walking. I always took it as her just being a preemie. However, at around 8mo, she qualified for early intervention. By the time it took OT to make visits, she was already crawling and functional sitting. We continued with OT but (and I don’t mean this offensively) it was pretty useless. They basically just watched my baby move around/play and provided feedback. Don’t get me wrong, it was appreciated, but it was information I already knew just by reading online. (No W sitting, how to help baby pull up, get down, etc) I finally asked for a reevaluation. I felt like my baby advanced so much on her own and was exceeding the goals they had previously set. So, right after her 1st birthday, an older gentleman came to re assess her. He was WONDERFUL. He was my idea of what PT is all about. He was hands on, extremely thorough, and found the route cause for her delays. Hypermobility. He told me OT wasn’t necessary anymore and showed me exercises to strengthen core. My daughter turns 14mo tomorrow & still no signs of walking. She crawls, pulls up, gets down, climbs, and is the center of all attention. Nothing impedes her mobility, she is EVERYWHERE. Follows her big sister around all day. But, lacks stability and balance. I’m hoping the exercises help. Has anybody else experienced this? If so- did you notice other problems with your child later in life?",

I'm also a beginner at the gym, having gone around 4 months consistently, working through any hypermobility-related issues with success so far. I find that a neutral grip on lat pulldowns seems to target my lats better, however after a few reps I always end up with shooting tingling feeling in my right index finger (something restricting my median nerve probably). Not painful, just uncomfortable, and as a result I have switched back to using an overhand grip.

My main symptoms are frequent knee dislocations (with surgeries), stretchy skin with abnormal scarring, IBS, and pelvic floor dysfunction. My doctor said I’m “definitely hypermobile” (9/9 Beighton) but wouldn’t diagnose hEDS, explaining that there’s debate about whether hypermobile joints should really be classified as EDS since no single gene has been identified and it may involve many variations. For those of you who’ve been through this — does it actually matter if the label is hEDS or HSD? Have you found it makes a difference for treatment, recognition by other doctors, or access to accommodations?",

She did parts of the Beighton score (thumbs and knees) but didn’t bother with the rest as my thumbs don’t flex back?! When trying to self-assess (as a general guide, not diagnosing) I scored around 5 or 6 (unsure as to whether one extended enough). She also said that as I can still function enough to go to work and that they haven’t seen me at the doctors alot my pain must only be mild and is not a large issue. I stopped doing things I enjoy because I was in too much pain and I’ve been on a waiting list for an appointment for 2 months. I just felt completely ignored and its made me question if I’m being overdramatic? I know I don’t score off the charts on the Beighton test but 5 is the level for hypermobility and on alternative/extra tests I also reach the level for it. Has anyone else had experience with these doctors? Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with them? I’m hoping to see my usual doctor when I go back for blood results (the doctor today is at least try to rule out other issues like arthritis)",

      "content_preview": "I have been dealing with chronic pain issues all over my body since late 2020 and throughout that entire time I have never had any luck getting diagnosed or treated for anything. Several doctors have mentioned hypermobility as a potential cause but through my research I have struggled to find cases that have been as bad as what I have experienced. I am only 21 years old. The issues started in both of my hands with pain that feels like an overuse injury and is triggered by phone or computer use. For the past five years, using a phone or computer has felt like walking on eggshells because I risk injuring my hands every single time I try to use them. When they get injured, which is very frequently, the pain is constant and can last for hours or even days sometimes. Regardless, there is always some level of pain whenever I try to use these devices. Both of my knees have been in near constant pain since 2020 as well. They hurt all. The. Time. It’s sort of like a dull ache around the patella that just never goes away. I finally had an MRI done on one of them last month and it showed bone marrow edema and several contusions (bruising) on the fat pad. My doctor said that this looks like the sort of damage you would expect to see from hypermobility. Basically, I think my knees are so unstable that the bone is constantly rubbing around and causing internal bruising and inflammation whenever I walk. A similar sort of pain has been in both of my feet since 2023 and also sometimes my elbows, but these areas aren’t as severely impacted as my hands and knees. I also have been super susceptible to other types of horrible injuries that take forever to heal. Like just this January, my hip became injured and was in horrible pain whenever I would try to walk from what seemed to just be sleeping on my side. It took 6 months to heal and even now it can easily be re-injured. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I do not meet the criteria for EDS so all of this pain must be caused by just plain old hypermobility. Anyone know if any sort of medications such as biologics could help treat this at all? I cannot keep living like this.",

If i am laying flat on my back and i try to raise my upper leg to a 90 degree angle, the pain is significant. Not sure what’s going on, i think there might be an issue with the hip flexor on the right side.",

The banded exercises are outwardly laying down with my legs, and then laying on the side while extending my knees outward while my ankles are touching. My instability has been insane after this. I cannot walk without a gait change due to pain. Before the slipping sensation was random but now when I walk I feel as though I’m always in the before stages of a slip. I’m always limping now. My baseline pain is higher, now, too my inner hips/groin are so much worse. I’ve had issues with the banded exercises while in physio but am still encouraged to do it. My physio told me to do them in smaller ranges but I can’t believe my pain and gait issues are so much worse. Perhaps I understand the pain because these are apparently severely underworked muscles but the gait issues concern me. I’ll see her soonish but I want to know if anyone’s experienced this",

Now that I’m about to graduate college and have more free time, I’ve thought about getting back into it, but I don’t know if I’m just going to keep having the same issues. Have any of y’all had these issues or overcome this, or is this too niche lol? Didn’t even really know what hyper mobility was until very recently so I’m looking back at a lot of issues I’ve had and wondering if I can actually make a second attempt at things if I do it the right way.

As someone who used to be pretty fit, having exercise intolerance and watching my health decrease to the point where I am housebound and unable to do most chores without severe repercussions has been hard. I'm well past the point of preventing deconditioning and I need to start building up my strength again but my knowledge of exercise is only suited for higher levels of fitness than I have now. I don't know how to start from near zero. For my specific conditions, I need recommendations for movements I can do that don't involve: Sudden posture or level changes Too many repetitive actions that could create friction on my skin (i.e. sit ups where my back touches the floor repeatedly) Fine motor control (precise movements like touching or reaching for a specific point are fine)",

      "content_preview": "While I don't really suffer from chronic pain (yet) I really feel like bouldering and climbing in general helped stabalize my shoulders ALOT. Before I started bouldering I was quite overweight at 85 kg while being 170 cm tall. With bouldering (and dieting) I gained muscle and lost about 20kg. I was having alot of trapezius(/upper back) pain and strain. But I don't suffer from that same pain anymore since I use alot of shoulder and upper back muscles now. But it could also be that my boobs are lighter now. Climbing is very different from normal weight training because you use EVERY little muscle to stabalize your body om the wall. I know alot of people at my gym that also suffer from hypermobolity and have said that climbing helped them alot in their journey. Also climbing is suuuuuper fun and addicting, so if it's not for hypermobility management, you should just try it for fun! I'm now working on building more glutes and hip muscles, since I do feel unstable in my hips still. I don't know if my hypermobility is less bad than others and that thats's why it works so well for me, but I'm just trowing it out there!",
