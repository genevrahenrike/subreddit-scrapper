I know that  sound would still be able to reach the inside of the house through the junctures between the two walls because they have to be connected somehow. So some sound would still be able to get through. But the question is: How much of it?? I mean would it still be reducing the sound considerably more then using standard sound proofing techniques and materials, or would the sound entering be so much that it's either like nothing changed or it's even worse?",

I went through the manual and tried realigning the cavity multiple times, adjusting the optics step by step. I can get output, but the maximum power I’ve managed to reach is about 100 mW, which is far below the expected level. From what I understand, I need at least 500 mW to activate stable mode locking.For pumping I’m using a Millennia V laser at 5 W, which matches the recommended input. Still, no matter how I adjust things, I can’t get the Tsunami past that 100 mW ceiling. I’ve tried carefully realigning again and again, but I always end up with the same maximum output.Has anyone here had similar issues with the femtosecond version of the Tsunami? Do you have suggestions for what to check or common mistakes that might limit the output power this way? Any advice would be really appreciated.",

It helps future experiments, improves supernova models, and tightens the numbers we use in cosmology.Over time, JUNO will also watch for neutrinos from the Sun, Earth, and the next Milky Way supernova.( Article link in comment )",

So far, most of the initial experiments at the dawn of quantum mechanics that I know of (photoelectric effect and the compton effect) are explainable in a semiclassical model (one where the matter field is quantized, but the EM field is classical/statistical) and do not directly show the need to quantize the field. Which now begs my question, what was the first experiment that directly shows that the EM field is quantized?Best, QoO",

I'm doing research over the summer now, and my supervisor has been advising me to apply for Oxbridge for Masters since our research has been going well. The thing is, there's no way to afford it on my own if I could even get in (as I am already struggling to pay for living expenses etc. in London and my family can't support me). I really want to keep studying Physics (whether that be at Imperial with the QFFF program, I'm currently at a low first class grade but am aiming higher for final year - definitely don't mean to sound ungrateful but I feel like financial circumstances have been a strain throughout my degree).Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do - i.e. funding, scholarships/I've been looking at the TUM-LMU elite masters course that would be tuition-free, should I aim for this and how can I boost my chances? I'm feeling quite desperate even though I still have a year to graduate as I love Physics, but may have to quit pursuing academia. Just to clarify I have found a job as a backup but my scholarship requires me to work unless I find further studies (can postpone the obligations).Any advice would really be appreciated! (Also not sure if this is the right forum but please direct me to the right group otherwise). Also I'm currently interested in mathematical Physics as my summer research has been in the Maths department.",

He formulated Curie’s law, which is an interaction between ferromagnetism and temperature, as well as the Curie Dissymmetry Principal. Most importantly, he, along with a student of his, provided the first evidence of nuclear energy from the study of radium, and observed differences in these radiation forms, which laid the groundwork for the discovery of alpha, beta, and gamma particles.People often say that he is less well known because Marie Curie’s story is more important to the history of science, but I would argue his story is important in a different way, as one of the most profound losses in the history of math and physics, on the level of someone like Galois, although Curie died much later than Galois…So, any opinions? What gives?",

The moving-mass weighs 1,63kg, so that gives us a constant acceleration of 184,05m/(s^2). Now my question is how to calculate speed and position? These are necessary for programming the system.Right now I have v=a/f [m/s=(m/(s^2))*s], and the same logic for position, or rather distance traveled: d=v/f [m=(m/s)*s].I feel as though these formulas are too linear and I am missing something in order to make a sine wave.

      "content_preview": "Hi all. I graduated from Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville back in 2013 and have just been informed that the university has chosen to eliminate the entirety of the minor, major, and the physics department. This comes as a shock to myself and other former students of the program considering this is a fundamental and required science for many majors.The student body for the major has always been relatively low compared to other majors at the university, however it was always stable. Many students continued on in their education to local universities for graduate studies including myself. As well, many other students used the advanced physics courses that were offered as electives in engineering, chemistry, or mathematics. This is a major blow to more than the majors student wise.I’m not sure why I am writing this outside of getting my frustrations into words. This is a punch to the gut and I hope that other universities don’t follow this same path. Not every student can afford to go to a large university and choose to stay local like I did. What SIUE just did should not be forgotten and I hope prospective students see this and decide to study their (non-physics) courses elsewhere because of it.",

My plan is to model the coil and magnets using open-source tools and libraries. I was thinking of using FastHenry / FastCap or finite-element methods (FEM) to extract L, R, and C values, then building the equivalent circuit and plotting the Bode response (10 Hz – 20 kHz).I’m a physics master’s student, but I don’t have much experience with FEM simulations. Does anyone have tips, references, or past projects I could look at for workflows like this (geometry → EM extraction → circuit)? Or suggestions for a better approach? I’d also be open to team up if anyone’s interested.Thanks in advance!",

      "content_preview": "So there was some confusion about mean relaxation time in conductors a long time ago, it seems, and I understand that even the guy who discovered this (Paul Drude) made a mistake in his paper about this concept. I just recently came across this in Edward Purcell and David Morin's Electricity and Magnetism book, and since I'm reading this on my own, I don't have any teachers that can explain this to me.He makes a statement about this, and I think I understood it, although I'm not sure. I'll first show you the excerpt from his book and then I'll tell you what I understood from it, and plz tell me if its wrong and how to correct it.I will edit the first sentence of the excerpt a bit so that I don't have to give you two pages worth of context, but I'm sure my edited version means the same as what Purcell intended.Mean relaxation time is the average of the time since the last collision. That must be the same as the average of the time until the next collision, and both are the same as the average time between collisions, t.You may think the average time between collisions would have to be equal to the sum of the average time since the last collision and the average time to the next. That would be true if collisions occurred at absolutely regular intervals, but they don’t. They are independent random events, and for such the above statement, paradoxical as it may seem at first, is true. Think about it. The question does not affect our main conclusion, but if you unravel it you will have grown in statistical wisdom; see Exercise 4.23. (Hint: If one collision doesn’t affect the probability of having another – that’s what independent means – it can’t matter whether you start the clock at some arbitrary time, or at the time of a collision.)All right, so what I understood from that was, if I pause the time and ask each electron how much time has passed since its last collision and I tabulate the values and take the average of it, say <t_1>, I will find it to be the same value as <t_2>, where <t_2> is the average of the times I will measure if I unpaused the time and measured with a stopclock the times taken by each electron to collide the next time. If I, without pausing the time at all, just measure the times between 2 successive collisions for each electron individually using my stopclock, I will get a value <t_3> and that will still be equal to <t_1> and <t_2> individually, and NOT their sum.I assume this is because the previous collision and the next collision are independent events.If I pause the time near the starting of some electron's journey to the next collision point so that its time to the next collsion, t_2 is greater than the time since its last collision, t_1, it would not make any difference to the average since there is always some electron at that paused moment of time that is a hair's width away from its next collision, so its t_2 is very small (hair's width is a metaphor, please understand). Thus even if I try to single out electrons to make their t_2 bigger than their t_1 (or vice versa), the average value <t_1> and <t_2> will remain the same and equal.Am I right?Thanks in advance.Edit: the angular brackets <> denote average, and the variables without angular brackets are the values for each individual electron. So <t_1> is the average of t_1 for each electron, and t_1 is just the time elapsed since the last collision of one particular electron.",

It seems that most physicists were not particularly excited about this idea given that quantum computing as a field remained relatively obscure until Shor's algorithm appeared in the 90s.In hindsight, the concept of building a machine that fundamentally operates on quantum mechanical principles to simulate quantum experiments is attractive. Why weren’t physicists jumping all over this idea in the 1980s? Why did it take a computer science application, breaking encryption, for quantum computing to take off, instead of the physics application of simulating quantum mechanics? What was the reception among physicists, if any, regarding quantum simulation after Feynman's paper and before Shor's algorithm?",
