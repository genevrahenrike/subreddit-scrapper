I know that  sound would still be able to reach the inside of the house through the junctures between the two walls because they have to be connected somehow. So some sound would still be able to get through. But the question is: How much of it?? I mean would it still be reducing the sound considerably more then using standard sound proofing techniques and materials, or would the sound entering be so much that it's either like nothing changed or it's even worse?",

      "content_preview": "I’m working with a Spectra-Physics Tsunami Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser and having trouble getting it properly aligned. I went through the manual and tried realigning the cavity multiple times, adjusting the optics step by step. I can get output, but the maximum power I’ve managed to reach is about 100 mW, which is far below the expected level. From what I understand, I need at least 500 mW to activate stable mode locking.For pumping I’m using a Millennia V laser at 5 W, which matches the recommended input. Still, no matter how I adjust things, I can’t get the Tsunami past that 100 mW ceiling. I’ve tried carefully realigning again and again, but I always end up with the same maximum output.Has anyone here had similar issues with the femtosecond version of the Tsunami? Do you have suggestions for what to check or common mistakes that might limit the output power this way? Any advice would be really appreciated.",

So far, most of the initial experiments at the dawn of quantum mechanics that I know of (photoelectric effect and the compton effect) are explainable in a semiclassical model (one where the matter field is quantized, but the EM field is classical/statistical) and do not directly show the need to quantize the field. Which now begs my question, what was the first experiment that directly shows that the EM field is quantized?Best, QoO",

It helps future experiments, improves supernova models, and tightens the numbers we use in cosmology.Over time, JUNO will also watch for neutrinos from the Sun, Earth, and the next Milky Way supernova.( Article link in comment )",

      "content_preview": "Pierre shared the nobel prize for radiation with her and Bequerel in 1906, and would’ve shared the one in 1911 for the discovery of polonium and radium which they also discovered together, if he hadn’t died of an accident in 1906 at age 46.Beyond that, apart from his wife he did plenty of groundbreaking research in the second half of the 1800s. He formulated Curie’s law, which is an interaction between ferromagnetism and temperature, as well as the Curie Dissymmetry Principal. Most importantly, he, along with a student of his, provided the first evidence of nuclear energy from the study of radium, and observed differences in these radiation forms, which laid the groundwork for the discovery of alpha, beta, and gamma particles.People often say that he is less well known because Marie Curie’s story is more important to the history of science, but I would argue his story is important in a different way, as one of the most profound losses in the history of math and physics, on the level of someone like Galois, although Curie died much later than Galois…So, any opinions? What gives?",

      "content_preview": "Hi all. I graduated from Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville back in 2013 and have just been informed that the university has chosen to eliminate the entirety of the minor, major, and the physics department. This comes as a shock to myself and other former students of the program considering this is a fundamental and required science for many majors.The student body for the major has always been relatively low compared to other majors at the university, however it was always stable. Many students continued on in their education to local universities for graduate studies including myself. As well, many other students used the advanced physics courses that were offered as electives in engineering, chemistry, or mathematics. This is a major blow to more than the majors student wise.I’m not sure why I am writing this outside of getting my frustrations into words. This is a punch to the gut and I hope that other universities don’t follow this same path. Not every student can afford to go to a large university and choose to stay local like I did. What SIUE just did should not be forgotten and I hope prospective students see this and decide to study their (non-physics) courses elsewhere because of it.",

Here are some tips to help you work (or, you know, not work) from pretty much wherever (home, highways, canyons, etc.). If you want to work from wherever, you need a reliable, expansive network. T-Mobile’s got that and tons of other travel-perfect perks ready for you.DIGITAL NOMAD-ING: A HOW-TO GUIDE1. Lock in a reliable remote connection:Surprise surprise, the first tip in a T-Mobile post is about your network. BUT... stay with us. It’s first because the whole ‘digital nomad’ thing is all about staying connected while you’re traveling. T-Mobile keeps you online with the largest,fastest, and most advanced network available. Just one of the reasons people are calling us the Best Network (officially) according to Ookla® Speedtest®.12.Treat your car like your child (because it basically is):When you’re living the nomad lifestyle, your car is your castle. Your sacred place. Your literal window to the world. Be sure you stay up-to-date on maintenance, keep that gas tank full, and have a first-aid kit in your trunk. Nice-to-know: You can get a year of AAA on us when you switchto T-Mobile, just in case you’re so focused on nature’s beauty that you forget to fill up.23. ABPFAP (always be prepared for a picnic):There are beautiful, stunning, totally-take-your-breath-away views out there just waiting to be… viewed. Make sure you’ve got a picnic go-bag in your trunk (blanket, cards, snacks, maybe even a …cooler?). With more 5Ginterstate highway miles on T-Mobile than with any other provider,3it’s easy to track down hidden gems on your route where picnics seem to grow on trees.4. Catching Zzzs:Sleeping under the stars or in a tent can be serene. It can also quite literally break your back. Every now and then, you’ll want to sprinkle in a night somewhere that has a bed and a shower. Good thing you can save up to 40% on hotels and car rentals as a T-Mobile member.41 Based on analysis by Ookla of Speedtest Intelligence® data 1H 2025.

I really want to keep studying Physics (whether that be at Imperial with the QFFF program, I'm currently at a low first class grade but am aiming higher for final year - definitely don't mean to sound ungrateful but I feel like financial circumstances have been a strain throughout my degree).Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do - i.e. funding, scholarships/I've been looking at the TUM-LMU elite masters course that would be tuition-free, should I aim for this and how can I boost my chances? I'm feeling quite desperate even though I still have a year to graduate as I love Physics, but may have to quit pursuing academia. Just to clarify I have found a job as a backup but my scholarship requires me to work unless I find further studies (can postpone the obligations).Any advice would really be appreciated! (Also not sure if this is the right forum but please direct me to the right group otherwise). Also I'm currently interested in mathematical Physics as my summer research has been in the Maths department.",

The moving-mass weighs 1,63kg, so that gives us a constant acceleration of 184,05m/(s^2). Now my question is how to calculate speed and position? These are necessary for programming the system.Right now I have v=a/f [m/s=(m/(s^2))*s], and the same logic for position, or rather distance traveled: d=v/f [m=(m/s)*s].I feel as though these formulas are too linear and I am missing something in order to make a sine wave. Any help will be appreciated",

      "content_preview": "Hi everybody,I’m trying to simulate the frequency response of a single-coil guitar pickup purely from its 3D geometry. My plan is to model the coil and magnets using open-source tools and libraries. I was thinking of using FastHenry / FastCap or finite-element methods (FEM) to extract L, R, and C values, then building the equivalent circuit and plotting the Bode response (10 Hz – 20 kHz).I’m a physics master’s student, but I don’t have much experience with FEM simulations. Does anyone have tips, references, or past projects I could look at for workflows like this (geometry → EM extraction → circuit)? Or suggestions for a better approach? I’d also be open to team up if anyone’s interested.Thanks in advance!",

It seems that most physicists were not particularly excited about this idea given that quantum computing as a field remained relatively obscure until Shor's algorithm appeared in the 90s.In hindsight, the concept of building a machine that fundamentally operates on quantum mechanical principles to simulate quantum experiments is attractive. Why weren’t physicists jumping all over this idea in the 1980s? Why did it take a computer science application, breaking encryption, for quantum computing to take off, instead of the physics application of simulating quantum mechanics? What was the reception among physicists, if any, regarding quantum simulation after Feynman's paper and before Shor's algorithm?",
