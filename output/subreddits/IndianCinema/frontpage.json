      "content_preview": "So, I’ve been wondering, what exactly is Hollywood lacking in terms of storytelling or filmmaking that audiences are now finding in Indian cinema? Are there not providing what their audience wants? Take RRR for example — it got massive success in Western countries. Clearly, something clicked with the audience. What do you think worked for them? Hollywood these days feels like it’s mostly focusing on big-budget superhero movies or franchises. But when I look at Malayalam or Kannada cinema today, they’re experimenting more, focusing on grounded stories, strong characters, and still pulling off brilliance even with smaller budgets. I’m saying this as someone who watches both Indian and Hollywood movies: From your perspective, is Hollywood losing something they used to have? And on the flip side, what do you think Indian cinema still lacks compared to Hollywood? Would love to hear comparisons — like your favorite Indian film industry (Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Bollywood, etc.) vs Hollywood.",

Its understanding of geopolitics appears to be childish. About halfway through it tanks its momentum and becomes even more plodding. There's a shootout set piece that's one of the laziest I've seen in recent years which is bizarre because it has a whole single take sequence. So some thought must have gone into it. The whole cast of characters is unlikable. The bad guys are cartoonish villains. The minor antagonists in the various governments and spy agencies don't care about people. The main characters are torture loving cops who commit wanton extrajudicial killings. The hero cares so much about a girl who was killed in a bombing that he goes on a killing spree across the middle east, shooting up public roads in Iran, getting friends and allies killed and leaving another girl orphaned. Of course, neither he nor the movie cares about why a young girl has to raise her even younger brother by selling flowers on the street. Uh, this was a bad, irritating movie.",

So Amsaja is a pdf that rapes minors and wants them to get pregnant with his child? But he wants girl of that family because they have the blessing of maa kaali. I don’t understand that message still. Tear drops and blood of daughter will finish the demon. Can someone explain what does that command mean? And then in the last that connection to shaitan. So the demon raped that old lady who did the kaali puja 40 years ago and R Madhavan is her son?",

No excessive drama. No phony romance. Simple, unadulterated feelings that are authentically captured. With its haste for dazzling plots and passionate romance, modern film would never be able to replicate that purity. A child who actually behave like a child There are timeless classics. and among them is Balika Badhu. A simple yet perfect movie ,",

Most of what we get these days are slapstick comedies or horror-comedies, but not that clever mix of laughs + tension that actually keeps you hooked. I was talking to my friends about this and the only example they could think of was Bullet Train… which isn’t even Bollywood 😅. The last Hindi one I can remember is Blackmail. So yeah, when the trailer of Ek Chatur Naar popped up, I was like finally something that at least looks like it’s going back to that zone. It reminded me why I love this genre in the first place. I just hope the execution matches the promise, because honestly, Bollywood needs this switch-up badly. Coming back to the topic i think If Bollywood doesn’t start experimenting again, comedy thrillers might just die out completely—and that would be a shame.",

When we produce period pieces of war and power struggle we end up making mahabharat and ramayan over and over again. Everyone knows the mythologies. Can we not have something else for once? Something original? Our audience is obviously to blame because they favor sasta masala movies with low tier action and problematic views like Animal Or KGF. I feel like all our war movies are biographies. We always take real life events and make them into movies. HAVE OUR WRITERS LOST CREATIVE THINKING?",

And wow, what an experience! It turned out to be a superhero-style film, but with a female lead at the center—and it was executed so well. The storytelling, the visuals, the whole vibe—it kept me hooked throughout. Malayalam cinema never fails to surprise with such bold, refreshing, and powerful stories. I went in with zero expectations, and came out absolutely stunned. If you haven’t watched it yet, I’d highly recommend giving it a shot.",

But why put down other industries to praise your own? Describing other films from various industries as crap to make your point is not the way. That mallu guy posted the same thing in various subreddits, without even changing the context. That comes off as pretentious and desperate. If youre gonna do PR, do it right. Not the embarrassing way.",

      "content_preview": "I must admit it Malayalam Cinema is one of the best film industries in the world, no doubt about it. The other Indian Film Industries are making some crap superstar action films and giving so much hype before their release, but after the release of the movie, people got scammed. Now in Kerala there are 3 major releases for onam. Mohanlal With Hridhayapoorvam, a Fun-Filled Family Drama Fahad With Odum kuthira Chadum kuthira a Rom Com Kalyani Priyadarshan and Naslan With Lokah Produced by Dulqar Salman, it's a Vampyre Superhero Thriller and the beginning of a universe. Director Krishand is making a Gangster Mini-series named Chronicles of 4.5 Gang with some newcomers. It was released on Sony Live. These four different genre movies/series are getting a good response from the audience and all three movies are going to be a hit there. Not any single industry in India can imagine a movie like Lokah with a 20cr budget with a female lead with this technical quality. The film was dubbed in all languages and released all over the world. It's one of the best movies released this year. Hridhayapoorvam and odum kuthira chaadum kuthira also had some really entertaining aspects and were well-made fun... Chronicles of 4.5 Gang is Malayalam Cinema's Version of How a Gangster Drama must be absolute fun to watch. It's one of the most well-made series in our country. This is how an industry must be. In other industries, directors, actors and producers only want money, not good movies. That's why a 3/2 budget is given to stars and directors. Audiences are still worshiping some random actors for doing crap films. Directors, please study Malayalam cinema and do good movies. The audience will accept them.",
