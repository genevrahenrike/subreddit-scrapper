      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, We wanted to make a post to further explain our rule on attacking other users directly. We have recently seen increased conflict between the more and less optimistic sides of the subreddit, and we don't believe that this conflict is healthy for the sub. We strongly believe that r/phillies should be a place where people feel comfortable to share their opinion, regardless of how they feel about the team. Therefore, we want to make it explicitly clear that attacking another user or group of users directly, or indirectly, is not okay, and will result in your comment being removed and potential bans if a pattern emerges after comment removals and a warning. Please remember that we are all Phillies fans here and rooting for the same thing! Here are a few examples of comments that are not okay: Direct attack to a user : \"I can't believe u/philliesfan123 thought the Phillies would win this game, what an idiot.\" Indirect attack to a user : \"The person I just replied to has no idea what they're talking about and isn't a real fan, their opinion is stupid.\" Direct attack to a group of users : \"The optimistic people on this subreddit live in la la land and need to crash down to reality.\" Indirect attack to a group of users : \"Everyone that upvoted that comment confidently should come here now and admit that they were wrong, feel the shame!\" If anyone has any questions or wants clarification on any of this, please let the mod team know and we'll reply. Ultimately, treat people with respect and how you'd want to be treated, regardless of if they have a different opinion than you. This is something we are going to be monitoring more closely as the postseason approaches and new members will surely find their way to the sub. Go Phillies!",

The Pirates are incompetent and don’t want to win lol, but as a Millersville alum I’ve followed Mayza’s career closely (he’s one of two to make the majors and the other is Chad McCormick… gross) and he is really good. He has been more than solid during his career outside of last seasons outlier Did the Pirates see something in his rehab to cause them to place him on waivers? I’m shocked that we got this dude practically for free, because if he’s even anything close to what he was with the Blue Jays, that can be a super important piece in the playoff bullpen Disclaimer that this is a little reactionary after his good first inning with us, but I was thinking it yesterday too. Just seems like an absolute steal for nothing",
