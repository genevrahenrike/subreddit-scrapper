      "content_preview": "My handball shoes finally gave up on me last week during practice. I went for a quick cut to the left and almost slipped because the grip is completely worn down. They‚Äôve been with me for a couple of years, so I can‚Äôt really complain, but it was a bit of a wake-up call that I need to replace them before I get injured. The thing is, when I started looking for new ones, I realized prices for handball shoes are all over the place. On some local sites the shoes I like are either way overpriced or not even in stock in my size. Then I started checking European sites, and the same models are noticeably cheaper there. A friend of mine in Germany even told me he can find multiple options in regular sports stores for prices that made my jaw drop. Out of curiosity, I browsed Alibaba and some other global marketplaces too, and while the prices look tempting, I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs really worth it once you add shipping, customs, and the question of whether they‚Äôre authentic. I‚Äôm not looking for the cheapest pair possible because I play a couple times a week and need something that will hold up. At the same time, I don‚Äôt want to overpay just because the sport is less popular in my region. Handball isn‚Äôt mainstream here, which probably explains why the shoes cost more and why the selection is so limited. That‚Äôs why the idea of ordering from a region where handball is bigger, like Europe, feels like it might be smarter.",

I‚Äôve been looking into setups that don‚Äôt just give VO‚ÇÇmax estimates but also capture things like peak HR, HR in the last 30 seconds, and recovery HR afterwards. Really curious if any of you are already doing that, or if most stick to stage/shuttle results.

The soccer/football is far too slick and results in alot of drops, so I‚Äôm wanting to get a textured handball that is highly visible and great without resin as we play on an indoor soccer/football (doesn‚Äôt allow resin) field with a dark wooden ceiling (hence high visibility so we can track it in flight). Are the selects as grippy as they look? Sorry for the dumb questions, even at our city block sized sports stores we don‚Äôt have handballs here. Thank!",

I used to play water polo and was usually the center, if that makes any difference. Do you think that kind of background could help?

I am a goalie 21M and as of right now at a club that aims very high (promotion) in the division they are in. Thought i was gonna be the second place as a gk in the roster but i was informed of another goalie joining the club with more experience in the higher division and he is probably promised the second spot, making me surely the 3rd goalie, 4 gks in total. I was determined to fight for my spot in the club but i was approached by another club in the same division that promises me the first goalie position and a little economic help, where as of now i dont get nothing. Seems like a no brainer being offered this but the coaching staff in my now club is top class and of course training with better shots from better players gives a better training experience but there will be no playing time as i see it. Do i leave and build my reputation by being seen because of playing time or i stick to my now club and fight for the spot. Haven't talked with my current club about my position after the new transfer but will do soon, what do you think?",
