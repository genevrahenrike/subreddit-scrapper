I particularly adore them on Conan doing Colony of Birchmen, and the band seems to be having a blast when they did Show Yourself on Kimmel. Wondering if anyone on here can share some of the memories around these performances? if they were fans already and couldn't believe they were on tv, if you became new fans because of the show, if you attended any of these live, etc. I wasn't old enough to experience any of them for myself/attend on my own so it'd be really cool if anyone has any stories!",

Now that Brent is gone I really wish I had this and also to give to the friend I was with there. I contacted US/EU official Mastodon merch but no stock. Wondering if anyone knows where I could get this -with- the tour dates (legit sites to monitor maybe) or even if I could have a couple made (no clue how that works but I understand design files just not how or why any of the art is available). Anyway this shirt looked like this in the EU but apparently there was this version with US dates. (Yes you can get the front of the shirt from various shady merchants...tour dates though are important to me now :( ) Back of US Shirt EU version (North America would have the same front?)",

I can imagine that during these past tour dates, one reason he didn't play Brent's solos like the records is that he didn't have enough time to learn them. It's common for lead guitarists with good improv skills to skip learning the original solos when time is short. Having to learn dozens of complex songs last minute is already time-consuming enough without also transcribing their long, intricate solos. If he does continue to tour with Mastodon, do you think he will attempt to learn Brent's solos for future tours?",

To me, he wasn’t just a musician – he was someone who, through his voice and the way he expressed himself, was there with me in many moments of my life. His music helped me through difficult days and gave me strength when I needed it the most. I’d love to keep a physical memory of everything he meant to me, which is why I’m looking for a poster signed by him and the others. I know it’s not easy to find, and even harder living in Spain since many places don’t ship here, but it would be such a meaningful treasure for me. If anyone in the community has one or knows of a place where I might be able to get it, I’d be incredibly grateful for any help. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading, and for keeping his memory alive together.",

The song feels like it's about Brent and it originally was going to be on Cold Dark Place which was a very special album for Brent. I feel like Troy could sing the Brent parts as well as his own and if not I think Bill could do Troy's parts because Troy's parts aren't really that crazy. This being the one song Bill sings on would actually be pretty meaningful and show how much they loved him. Obviously they'd have to be comfortable doing it. I wouldn't want to push them to do anything they don't want to do. But it's just something I've been thinking about. And if not Jaguar God doing it with another song would also be pretty cool. A song that meant something to Brent though.",
