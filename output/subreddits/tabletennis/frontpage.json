      "content_preview": "My first custom setup has been a Tibhar Power Wood with fh Tibhar MX-P, bh Rasanter R42, and a Yasaka Sweden Extra with fh Nittaka G1, and bh Rakza7. I picked everything not for specific reviews of what I needed or wanted, other than offence oriented, but based on overwhelming reviews for the best cheaper blades, and then some of the most common for fh, and went out on a limb on the bh’s. I tried both when getting them, and noticed the difference in speed with the power wood, and decided I should focus on one over the other, and played primarily with that.  I like it, I play fine with it… or do I?  I can change to the Yasaka, and notice I have to put a bit more into it, but otherwise don’t notice a huge different in the rubber. The rubber is getting worn on the power wood though, and I’m thinking I want to jump up to a more expensive set up with a carbon racket, but I have no clue how to go about this, other than again picking something like the Viscaria or Long 5, as they seem to have so many generic all in all good reviews. My local club isn’t big, and the ability to try different set-ups isn’t there. It also seems like reviews on almost everything are so subjective for blades and rubbers, combinations can make a wide variance on top of that.  It’s not like other sports I played, where there isn’t so many variances.  Baseball bats, shoes, gloves, you can try on.  I literally have no option to even hold any of these blades in my hand before purchasing. I feel I have no other way of going over my original approach, and simply buying the most popular, and hoping for the best that way, as anything else is more of a crap shoot. I’m not that good lol, but improving, and I play a lot, as I now have two tables in my house (one being the DF Volant King 2 purple, which btw I love!), and like to look fh, but also rip drives when I can, as with my tennis background, I have a big fh.  I just need to still refine it more. Any insight from anyone?  I’m just trying to decide, and other than going with what seems to be a safe next level option in the Viscaria, I don’t know what else to look to.  As for rubber, I’m thinking of maybe some type of butterfly ten/dig set up, as again, they seem like the can’t go wrong options too. I don’t know… help?",

Wanted to have one for me and others for friends to use and rotate to find my setup. Which should I primarily try and learn with? What are the big pros and cons of the different options? Do blades make that much of a difference or is it mostly the rubber? What makes a cheaper carbon blade worse than a more expensive one?",

I’m moving into uni this fall and see my school has a table tennis club, but I’m afraid to join simply because I’m new and will get dogged on. Similarly, my city has a table tennis club but I’m also worried to check it out because I’m a beginner and not sure how welcoming they’ll be. How did you guys start out?",

      "content_preview": "Two days ago, I shared here a tool I’ve been building to help players compare blades and rubbers more clearly. The response was mostly positive—people liked the idea and appreciated the clean design. But a few comments stuck with me, and I think they’re worth addressing. Some users felt that whatever system of scoring blades and rubbers is too subjective to be presented as fact. Others seemed to think that this whole project might be a fool’s errand, given the complexity and inconsistency of the gear landscape. Honestly? I get it. Table tennis gear is a mess. Every brand uses its own rating system. Reviews are all over the place. And unless you’ve tried dozens of setups yourself, it’s hard to know what anything really means. That’s exactly why I built this tool—not to pretend I have all the answers, but to offer a clearer starting point, a way to guide and educate at the same time. Maybe I should have been more upfront with this but here it goes Here’s how I’m approaching it in a nutshell: When it comes to choosing new TT gear, the real challenge isn’t finding specs—it’s comparing gear across brands. Most manufacturers actually do a good job describing their own blades and rubbers. The problem is, those specs don’t line up between brands, so you’re stuck guessing how a Butterfly blade stacks up against a Nittaku or DHS one. That’s the core idea behind my system: finding a reliable way to cross-brand comparison. For rubbers, it’s relatively doable. The internet is full of “vs” reviews—Tenergy vs Rakza, Fastarc vs Hurricane—and those matchups give us anchor points. From there, I can normalize manufacturer ratings and build a scale that makes sense across brands. Blades were trickier. You can’t test a blade in isolation—rubbers change the feel completely. So I had to get creative. I use vibration frequency analysis, which measures how a blade responds to impact. It’s a well-established method in material science, and it correlates strongly with speed and stiffness. That gives me real-world anchor points. And since blade construction is often shared publicly—wood type, ply count, composite layers—it’s totally valid to say that two physically identical blades (or very close) will perform very similarly. That’s the foundation: no reviews, no hype—just structured comparisons built on verified specs and real-world relationships. That’s what allows me to place rubbers and blades from different manufacturers on the same graph in a way that’s grounded, not arbitrary. It’s not perfect, and it’s not meant to be. But it’s a step toward clarity in a space that’s often confusing by design. Open to discussion.",

The feel, the control, the power—it just suits my game perfectly. The only problem is he just asked for it back, and now I'm back to my old blade and really missing the ZLC. I know the old Innerforce ZLC is discontinued, so I'm trying to figure out the best way forward. I'm considering a couple of options and was hoping to get some community input: Buy the new version: The new version is the Innerforce Layer ZLC. From what I've read, the main difference is the head size, which is slightly reduced. How similar does it play and feel to the original? Does anyone have experience with both? Find a similar blade: I've been eyeing the Franziska Innerforce ZLC because I really like the craftsmanship and the look of it. It's another \"inner\" ZLC blade, but I'm not sure how it compares in terms of play style and feel. Are there any other blades from Butterfly that I should consider too ?",

I usually play with this friend a few times each week at our club and I beat him almost all the time without trying too hard. In this tournament, I was beat by my friend 3-2 in sets and I was knocked out. I felt super frustrated because of that result. For some reason I always become very tense and stressed when my name is called up and I have to play a match in tournaments, I keep telling myself that nothing will happen if I lose and stuff like that, but I always find myself tense and very nervous. What can I do so I perform better and not get stressed when my match starts?",
