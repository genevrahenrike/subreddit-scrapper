I didn't know its story premise, I didn't even know it used turn-based combat. I heard people loved it, and I assumed it was an RPG of some kind, based on general vibes (though I was expecting an action RPG), but that's about it. It's great to learn everything about a game WHILE you're playing it. It was so fun playing through the prologue and listening to the dialogue to piece together just what is going on in this world. It feels like the intended experience for a game. The thing is, I would not have done this without Game Pass . If I'm going to buy a game, I need to know some details before I shell out the money. I need to know what the gameplay is like, and I'm probably going to learn its story premise in the process. But with Game Pass, it's commitment-free. All I have to do is uninstall it if I end up not liking it. Just a cool benefit of Game Pass I'm just now noticing.",

Oh my god. I’m so glad I did! The graphics are absolutely insane! It’s so realistic and it really draws you into the environment and makes you feel like you’re actually there! Especially exploring ‘downtown’, when it’s cold, wet and dark. The combat is ok, took me a while to get used to X and Y aiming as I use gamepad but once you adjust the settings you like it’s perfect! It can be a bit gory too, they didn’t hold back so you will see limbs and bullet wounds etc but it adds to the realism, rather than just a ragdoll body with no injuries after an explosion. My only complaint is that it wasn’t longer. I completed the game and got all achievements in about 17hrs of gameplay. I definitely recommend getting this especially since it’s free on GamePass. The game retails at £49.99 on Xbox store, I personally don’t think it’s worth it purely because there’s not a lot of content for the money. But it is a smashing game for GamePass!",

My buddy suggested Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, but I don't think I like that gameplay. I played up until leaving. So not too long, but enough to get the feel for gameplay. It is a very good looking game and the sound track is excellent, but I can't get down with the turn-based gameplay.",

In this specific case I'm referring to Tony Hawk 3+4... If I spend $18 does that mean that I have the Deluxe Edition of the game permanently or do I just have two skins in in game and as soon as it leaves GamePass that money was wasted?

I also like building pens, stables and barns for animals, decorating the landscape and making natural looking areas like lakes and streams. I've tried stardew valley, terraria, 7 days to die, subnautica and grounded and they don't feel the same as ark or Minecraft. Same with tycoon games, they aren't what I'm really looking for. I'm not a big fan of Skyrim, the sims or no mans sky. Games like Tiny Glade and Gourdlets are what I'm looking for, where I can just build and landscape. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!",

      "content_preview": "I come here to see if anyone has any recommendations to save my one S. The truth is that it is failing a lot, for example in Fortnite it takes too long to load, to the point that I don't even see the lobby, but rather it loads directly to the game map, it takes too long and in 1 out of every 3 games the game crashes and closes suddenly. Another problem that I have encountered is that recently it doesn't let me log in with other emails, I type them and everything, but when it goes to add it it simply doesn't, you are making me desperate and buying a series is not an option, does anyone have any advice? Postscript: I already performed maintenance on it and even changed the hard drive for a new one, believing that that would solve the problem and it didn't. I appreciate any help or advice.",
