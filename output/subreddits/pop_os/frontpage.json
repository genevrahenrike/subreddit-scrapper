      "content_preview": "I have a Samsung 27\" monitor with a native max resolution of 1920x1080. When I connected it to my MacBook Pro, I used an app called ResolutionMenu ( https://github.com/robbertkl/ResolutionMenu ) to simulate a 2560x1440 resolution. It wasn't perfect; the picture wasn't as sharp as on native resolution, but it worked, and the picture was pretty good. Now, with the same monitor connected to my new System76 laptop running Pop OS, I'm trying to do the same thing using xrandr , and I'm having a hell of a time. Here's what I've tried so far: First, I tried using gtf to generate a Modeline for my desired resolution and apply it to my display: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ gtf 2560 1440 60 -x\n\n  # 2560x1440 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 89.40 kHz; pclk: 311.83 MHz\n  Modeline \"2560x1440_60.00\"  311.83  2560 2744 3024 3488  1440 1441 1444 1490  -HSync +Vsync\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --newmode \"2560x1440_60.00\" 311.83 2560 2744 3024 3488 1440 1441 1444 1490 -HSync +Vsync\nxrandr --addmode DP-1 \"2560x1440_60.00\" I then went into Display settings, and selected the new 2560x1440 resolution; my screen turned to pixelated static, something like the \"static snow\" on an old TV set when there was no signal from a channel. I reset to the native resolution, and tried again with cvt : xxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ cvt 2560 1440 60\n# 2560x1440 59.96 Hz (CVT 3.69M9) hsync: 89.52 kHz; pclk: 312.25 MHz\nModeline \"2560x1440_60.00\"  312.25  2560 2752 3024 3488  1440 1443 1448 1493 -hsync +vsync\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --newmode \"2560x1440_60.00\"  312.25  2560 2752 3024 3488  1440 1443 1448 1493 -hsync +vsync\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --addmode DP-1 \"2560x1440_60.00\"\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --output DP-1 --mode \"2560x1440_60.00\" This had the same result as the previous try. I then tried using the -r flag to reduce blanking: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ cvt 2560 1440 60 -r\n# 2560x1440 59.95 Hz (CVT 3.69M9-R) hsync: 88.79 kHz; pclk: 241.50 MHz\nModeline \"2560x1440R\"  241.50  2560 2608 2640 2720  1440 1443 1448 1481 +hsync -vsync\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --newmode \"2560x1440R\"  241.50  2560 2608 2640 2720  1440 1443 1448 1481 +hsync -vsync\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --addmode DP-1 \"2560x1440R\"\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --output DP-1 --mode \"2560x1440R\" This again turned my screen to pixelated static. I tried using the Snap package Custom Screen Resolution, which suggested the following xrandr commands: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\" 173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode DP-1 \"1920x1080_60.00\"\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --output DP-1 --mode \"1920x1080_60.00\" --rotate normal --scale 1.3x1.3 --filter nearest This actually worked to force my display to simulate 2560x1440 resolution; but it looked absolutely awful. Text on screen was barely readable. I reset to native resolution. I also tried using a lower refresh rate: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ cvt 2560 1440 45\n# 2560x1440 44.94 Hz (CVT) hsync: 66.52 kHz; pclk: 227.75 MHz\nModeline \"2560x1440_45.00\"  227.75  2560 2720 2992 3424  1440 1443 1448 1480 -hsync +vsync\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --newmode \"2560x1440_45.00\"  227.75  2560 2720 2992 3424  1440 1443 1448 1480 -hsync +vsync\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --addmode DP-1 \"2560x1440_45.00\"\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@pop-os:~$ xrandr --output DP-1 --mode \"2560x1440_45.00\" The monitor then displayed a message that this was \"Not optimal mode\"; I had to reset back to native resolution. So; does anyone know what the \"right\" way is to do this? How can I get my screen to display 2560x1440 resolution on Pop OS, and not look terrible? Thanks for your help.",

For starters I want to say that i started using Linux just a few days ago and chose pop os as my first distro so if I'm asking about something obvious or stupid I'm terribly sorry. For now im very pleased with it but i heard it isn't getting updates and will lose support in 2 years or so. I also heard there is a new version in the works with new desktop environment. Will the new version extend long term support and when the stable version with cosmic will it be possible to seamlessly update without need the need to set everything up again? Any answers would be highly appreciated because I'm very worried that I'll have to change distro and set/download everything again",

I really don't see it do anything substantially more than other DEs and yet everyone is super hyped about it. To me it feels like yet another desktop environment among several that have been in development for years. What's the point of making a new DE that will be full of bugs for quite some time after its release? What does it provide more that the other standard DEs don't? Could someone ELI5?

I was pretty notorious on Slashdot for saying Linux desktop is garbage lol. For the last couple decades I just used Windows and macOS on my desktops and laptops, and Linux on all my servers -- headless, command line only. This month my 2013 MacBook no longer could get any updates so I flashed Pop_OS on a whim.. aside from the Broadcom WiFi driver needing manual installation, the rest has been a breeze. It worked really well, and so I put it on a much newer Dell Latitude after as my daily driver and I'm super happy with it.",

Hmmm Maybe I could just create integration? Long story short: My shared TODO List of shoping list So here is my shopping list - As you can see I've forgot to but mustard ;) It's shared list with my wife and kids - So that's nice. The model does not match 100% so I need to think about it a bit, but yeah... kind of working I think. It's 1 O'clock I'm going to sleep, but it is nice to see that on my desktop. - authorization flow works - Lists and Tasks are obtained Rest I will check maybe tomorrow? I wonder if it could be useful for anyone. Edit after one day and couple of hours of work: Works So it works :) Checklists are not implemented hence (subtasks in UI) But other than that ? It works :) I can add complete, edit, lists and tasks On my phone, Via webpage or from my desktop App.",

Only thumbnails are downloaded - so you can browse your latest pictures from your phone on your laptop without necesity to download them. Well if you will click one of them it will be downloaded and then opened in default application. Nice right? https://preview.redd.it/update-on-my-onedrive-client-v0-cijmcx4qg0if1.png https://preview.redd.it/update-on-my-onedrive-client-v0-ize8teurg0if1.png You can as well instruct client to always dowqnload your pictures in Folders page ( screenshot 2 ) it is also handy. On samsung Ondrive integration is implemented directly so if you have Samsung you don;t even need to download onedrive on your phone. https://preview.redd.it/update-on-my-onedrive-client-v0-5u1gfatug0if1.png You can now pause and resume synchronization and go offline while still using your  FS read AND WRITE. You may cause some conflicts. Conflicts resolution is not fully implemented yet, BUT, there is a part for that already https://preview.redd.it/update-on-my-onedrive-client-v0-azs792zwg0if1.png not everything works yet. I would love to get some testing help. If you are interested then go to: https://github.com/digit1024/ondrivefs_bmideas",

      "content_preview": "For some context: I'm a software developer and have been a Linux user for many years. Several distros and many DE experiences over the years eventually landed me on system 76's wonderfully thought out pop_os. Ultimately for me it's the applications' behaviors which keep me productive and in a satisfied state; the os does everything i need without ever getting in the way. The killer feature of pop_os for me is its super intuitive tiling implementation. i love it and appreciate that I can use the mouse for certain actions (which is because i haven't memorized every single tiling keyboard shortcut; thanks to system 76 designers/engineers who included mouse support for tiling window management!) I haven't fully upgraded to 24.04 yet on my main computer; but almost daily i update the latest COSMIC alphas on a VM to examine progress. What can I say? The team at system 76 has created a DE that is beyond what I ever could have hoped for. When system 76 several years ago announced their audacious plans for a new, non-GNOME desktop written in Rust, I recalled reading comments from the community of naysayers who offered only superficial criticism and snarky remarks. I'm glad that system 76 transcended those negative comments and followed their ideals with dedication, amazing engineering talent, and a true passion for helping us all out. Looking forward to the future of Linux and COSMIC!",

      "content_preview": "I felt like my laptop has a rather high idle drain. Running upower, it reports around 12-14w. Installing tlp and running it together with system76-power (I know it is not recommended), immediately reduces this to about ~6W. After a lot of checking states, frequencies and such, the main difference I can find is that with tlp, there are more PCI devices suspended. Otherwise things look very similar. System peripheral (Intel Device 7e4c)\nRAM memory (Intel Device 7e7f)\nSerial bus controller (I2C Controller #0)\nISA bridge (Intel Device 7e02) Seems to be the ones that tlp puts to sleep. This is on a HP ZBook Firefly 114 G11 with Intel Ultra 7 155H running popos 24.04 with firmware and system updated. I am not sure if this is \"fixable\", or what otherwise I should provide for any reasonable help/debugging. Having tlp installed seems on average to work better, but I'd rather have only system76-power installed if that is the recommended.",

My fist time installing nvidia driver was in the terminal, following pop os instructions on their website. After it finished install the nvidia drivers to the usb I restart my pop os desktop(usb pop os installed desktop) and then it could not boot. Stuck on somthing that look like a fullscreen terminal. Forgot the text that was on terminal. It was june or April when I did that. Fast forward I installed it on my pc/main ssd and how I installed nvidia drivers was i go to pop shop, go to update ctrl + I i see nvidia driver 4xx, 5xx, 570, 575 and installed my nvidia driver from there ever since. Is there an alternative pop shop way. Pop shop i notice auto update my drivers. Example: 570.08.456 update to 570.09.678 Sometimes when i ctrl +I it only shows on nvidia driver old or new. I have to turn it off, unplug and leave it after a while to show all drivers. I'm assuming it shows the stanle drivers for pop os. Edit: Every day since nvidia drivers through pop shop, it Boots fine and updating from 570 to 575 made games not freeze, but now its doing it again but that's a different thing.",

I am reading it’s optimal to have kernel 6.14 but I think the install comes with 6.8. Has anyone else done this or am I going to have issues during the install or is this even possible? Thanks.",

Good progress on OneDrive Client. I will start with UI: The layout is better now in all the pages - it looks less a prototype now. Let's start with Pictures gallery: Galery in Pop OS Desktop APp To compare how it looks like in Web page: Galery in Onedrive Page - Shows All pictures and videos - Opens Dedicated App on click and download on demand - Has \"infinite Scroll\"  functioonality just like in web version Mounting still works as expected, with thumbnails generated by local filemanager Mounted Onedrive - Read Write works - Opening *.onedrivedownload file will start download ( on demand functionality implementation)  with Notification. - can work offline Status Page improved UI: https://preview.redd.it/update-on-my-onedrive-client-18-08-v0-2kcpnoyoxsjf1.png - Has a possibility to Pasue and resume synchronization ( was there) - Shows Daemon Status Pause now works ok in daemon daemon logs showing paused sync cycle Synchronization Folders has a better UI now: Synchronization folders management - Files in those folders will be synced with local system - if a new file appears, it will be downloaded automatically ( same for modification) Download Que: Improved Download Que UI there is no \"upload que\" actually. Files are uploaded on regular sync cycle so I need to remove that. And I dont think that this page is actually useful. Conflicts: Slightly improved conflicts resolution page Important Stuff: - I've spent some time on integration test to ensure proper conflicts detection - they are correctly marked. Now I need to test Manual decisions. - I've found a nasty bug related to how I scheduled tasks - memory leak . Fixed - now application keeps around 4 Mb of ram for daemon in idle state - it goes up on heavy sync though. And on initial sync it can be quite large, but this is expected. - I've introduced \"fixable\" synchronization errors handling - e.g. File modified , but  parent folder was deleted remotely - I did not  want to have conflict resolution complex, so instead I'm recreating Path. I still have the couple of bugs to squash but overall it seems stable, at least for my simple use case. It is still in early stage I would say though. I am learning about onedrive APIs and Fuse a lot, finding some challenging problems. I doubt that running  heavy task in this FS would work, but for normal task it works. I don't think anyone  has tried this it and it  kind of produces a problem - I don't know what is not working. https://github.com/digit1024/ondrivefs_bmideas Feel free to check this out.",

      "content_preview": "New Icon So I took a break from OneDrive to Work a little on tasks fork to support Microsoft TODO app for cosmic DE. https://github.com/digit1024/msToDO this  is a fork of orignal tasks app by Eduardo Flores from cosmic Utils https://preview.redd.it/update-on-my-microsoft-todo-app-for-cosmic-30-08-v0-dcyq32ltb1mf1.png Basically, most of the functionalities works as expected. Authorization flow implemented on startup All API calls moved to async ( not blocking UI anymore) Subtasks remove in favour of checklists (TBD) Unfinished Tasks counter added ( with refresh) Lists with \"well known name\" shows first. Tasks list Toggle completed always fetches from API ( to not download finished tasks if not needed ) Add/Remove/Edit List and Task Works New Icon Shared list Icon Known Bugs and limitations: Only first 50 tasks is downloaded - support for \" infinite scroll\" TBD Checklists TBD Due date and reminder TBD All Tasks List and \"TODAY\" TBD BUG - Storing a date does not work \"set Icon\" menu should be removed Export should be removed \"Favourite\" should be removed Rename, repackage publish So not  that much left :) Hoping to finalize it a week or two. For Basic usage, it's enough I have to admit that I have learned a lot looking at the code of the original app - Hopefully I will be able to improve OneDrive UI as well because of that. :) https://buymeacoffee.com/digit1024",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, im really loving this pop vs pop 22, big step up. Im having a few issues and not sure where to post tbh ENV: ryzen 5 amd 6900xt 128GB ram nvme storage issues im having are the following: how do I add a shortcut to keybinding, it says text but if i want my prtscrn button to use either flameshot from the store not apt install (store works but not apt install all good tho)? I see the keybinding is Print but if i manually type it and then add the command and hit close it disappears if i add a custom desktop icon to an app, it could be any app that lets you send it to desktop, it doesnt display correctly sometimes but i can probably chalk that up to human error on my end lol i just need to do screen shot and i get that its wayland not x11 yet just need help adding shortcut regarding prntscrn button. i tried command line and i tried gui yet none of it works even tried to use grim and swappy with dconf editor yet to no avail and reverted everything back. im open to any ideas also bonus issue i have is dark mode is really dark lol so if i want to select a box or even in the same screen where you change keybindings the close button when highlighted turns completely black. Is there a way i can customize the colors easily. Although i prefer everything from cli",
