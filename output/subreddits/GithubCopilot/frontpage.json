      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share something I‚Äôve been working on: GenLogic Leads . It‚Äôs a platform I built to make getting UK business leads a lot easier. Instead of spending hours scraping, buying outdated lists, or chasing random contact databases, you can log in and instantly find verified leads you can actually use. I‚Äôll be honest‚Äîthis started out of frustration. I‚Äôve been in sales for years, and finding decent leads has always been a pain. Half the time, the data is old, the emails bounce, or the info is incomplete. So I thought: why not build a tool that just makes this simple? With GenLogic Leads, you can: Search and access thousands of UK business contact lists, including LinkedIn profile links Get clean, verified data without the usual noise Focus more on selling instead of searching It‚Äôs still early days, but I‚Äôd love feedback from anyone who works in sales, marketing, or lead gen. Would this actually make your work easier? What would you want to see in a tool like this? Here‚Äôs the link if you want to give it a try: https://leads.genlogic.io",

The more I trusted, the harder it was to debug when things went sideways. . And the more I leaned on it, the more I realized I was slipping into autopilot myself. So I started pushing back. Instead of saying ‚Äúdo this,‚Äù I now ask: Why is this the right approach? How would I have solved it differently? Does this align with my architecture decisions? And that‚Äôs where the real value showed up. Copilot Agent Mode isn‚Äôt my replacement. It‚Äôs my sparring partner.

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to get some thoughts from the community and hopefully from the GitHub Copilot team as well . I‚Äôm seeing a clear trend: every major Copilot competitor now offers a CLI-first, agentic coding workflow: Anthropic Claude Code: runs straight from the terminal, plugs into IDEs, provide sdks, and exposes hooks/sub-agents for automation. Google Gemini CLI: an open-source agent with a MCP server support, web fetch/search, and a VS Code ‚Äúagent mode.‚Äù Qwen Code (Qwen3-Coder): open-source CLI tailored for agentic coding, with non-interactive (scriptable) mode and docs that make CI usage straightforward. Cursor Agent CLI: just launched headless/CLI mode so you can spawn parallel agents from any environment (including CI). Why this matters for real teams: CI/CD integration: run agents directly in pipelines to generate tests, refactors, or quick fixes, then open PRs for review. Asynchronous agent flows: let agents work in the background, continue after your laptop sleeps, and report back via PRs/issues. Programmatic use cases: script agents for repo hygiene, cross-repo changes, large-scale migrations, audits, etc. On the GitHub side, I know about Copilot in the CLI via gh copilot (Im not sure if anyone using this üòÖ) and the new Copilot coding agent that works asynchronously and drafts PRs, plus the Agents panel to launch/track tasks anywhere on GitHub. Those are awesome steps! But what I‚Äôm specifically looking for is a first-class, GitHub-blessed, CLI-native coding agent that I can run headless on dev boxes and inside CI (not just via the web UI/VS Code), with: robust non-interactive mode (stdin/stdout-friendly), multi-agent orchestration (parallel tasks), mcp integration sdks(python-typescript) I‚Äôm also aware of open-source community projects like opencode that try to offer custom Copilot integrations. They‚Äôre exciting experiments, but realistically I don‚Äôt expect GitHub to ever officially support or endorse those ‚Äî which is why I‚Äôm asking about an official CLI agent roadmap directly from the Copilot team. Questions for GitHub folks & the community: Is there a public roadmap for a Copilot Agent CLI that matches (or exceeds) Claude/Gemini/Qwen/Cursor capabilities for headless + CI use? If the answer is ‚Äúuse the Copilot coding agent from GitHub.com,‚Äù what‚Äôs the recommended path for pure CLI/pipeline orchestration without opening a browser or relying on IDE UX? For enterprises: how do you envision policy controls (tools, file access, mcp) for a future CLI agent? I‚Äôd love pointers to official docs, previews, or even ‚Äúnot yet, but soon‚Äù confirmations. If there‚Äôs a beta I can try, count me in. Thanks! Side note: Yes, I used AI to help draft this post ‚ú®",

Is this normal? How can I use it better in this case? I started using the instructions .md file and I think it is slightly better (maybe biased here). Maybe I can have like my own master prompts for documentation or add better logging and just paste those prompts - maybe is there a way to have my own doc agent or logging agent or something similar to custom GPTs?

Here is an example of the result of my speaking to the chat window using voice So the the bottom of the calendar view here. Where it just ends, so the around 7:00 PM and so on. I don't know what it is actually. It's just a bit ugly how it's just stops and same with the. Same with the sort of the left hand side where it says up to 7:00 PM. And it sort of stops. It also kind of doesn't line up as well. You've got the header like the Monday 13, Tuesday 14, Wednesday 15. I think that's pushing things to be sort of a little bit out of sync as well where there's no compensation in the actual left hand menu either for that in that, sorry left hand 9A at that time access. So yeah, this whole view looks all right. But I just think we need to make it look a bit smarter. I actually don't see any reason why we couldn't even show the whole 24 hour period for a day, so keep that in your mind. While you do some your your slight fixes here. Is it possible to have an llm transform this with some reasonable prompt like \"From the message above, extract the actionable wishes of the message into concise and reasonable statements, structured to express the wishes of the author as clearly as possible.\" That step would help transform the silly aimless rambling thoughts we have into something more useful if we want it.

Just out of curiosity, I opened two windows, one with the local project and the other with the remote project, and I typed at the same time. I found the local project to be much faster overall. I suppose this is obvious for certain reasons. I imagine it has to do with latency or hardware, but I don't really know... My question is whether this is something normal that can't be improved in some way, or whether something could be done to make it run faster. Thank you!",

There's things I love (Sonnet 4) and hate (gpt 4.1 in general, gpt5 at x1, etc), but today I'm here to complain about something I can't really understand - limiting tokens per conversation to 128k. I use mostly Sonnet 4, that is capable of processing 200k max tokens (actually 1M since a few days ago). Why on this earth do I have to get my conversations constantly interrupted by context summarization, breaking the flow and losing most of the fine details that made the agentic process work coherently, when it could just keep going? Really, honestly, most changes I try to implement get to the testing phase and the conversation is summarized, then it's back and forth making mistakes, trying to regain context, making hundreds of tool calls, when it would be as simple as allowing some extra tokens and it would be solved. I mean, I pay the highest tier. I wouldn't mind paying some extra bucks to unlock the full potential of these models. It should be me deciding how to use the tool. I've been looking at Augment Code as a replacement, I've heard great things about it. Has anyone used it? Does it work better in your specific case? I don't \"want\" to make the switch, but I've been feeling a bit hopeless these days.",

However, I am importing and using another private Python package that I desperately want to keep private. The contents must not be part of what the agent is allowed to read. I asked the agent if it can read those files and it came up with a very clever solution, but I don't think it will read those contents \"by default\" (here is what it came up when I tried that on another package that is already open source: python -c \"import whisper; import inspect; print(inspect.getsource(whisper.load_model))\" ). Is there a setting I can use that forbids reading from \"external packages\"? Or is this the default behaviour? Can you guys maybe point me towards the documentation that explains the behaviour?

Over the past few weeks, I noticed that I‚Äôve been in an infinite loop, where I‚Äôd do some progress vibe coding, then all of the sudden the agent switches to doing the most dumb things possible and destroying all the work done. So I asked a couple of time which model is used and I find out that it‚Äôs not the premium model that I‚Äôve selected and paid for, but the dialed down version of an old free model. This is up until a week or so ago when github copilot stopped identifying the back end model, and now only answers that it cannot identify which model is being served. Shortly after that, it went from a 50/50 chance to have a brain freeze, to almost 90% of the time. I raised an issue with their support, but I kind of know exactly what the answer is. They will say the model is exactly the one you selected. So I guess time to switch fully to a local llm. Anyone else noticed the same thing?",
