I know this sub tends to shy away from politics and this post might be removed. However, the involvement of three prominent hockey figures makes it relevant to hockey. There are many hockey fans (including me) and players who are trans (even if not at the NHL level), and this is 100% relevant to the current state of hockey and how much it‚Äôs backpedaled from ‚ÄúHockey is for Everyone.‚Äù Even if it‚Äôs not personally relevant to you, imo it‚Äôs still important not to ignore how the NHL is tied to and influences/is influenced by current politics, especially the politics of professional sports - however one might feel about it.",

      "content_preview": "Ok so very weird and niche question, but it‚Äôs been bugging me for a while and we‚Äôre deep into the offseason so why not. I‚Äôm from Montreal and am a native French speaker and noticed something (very mildly) interesting about how we pronounce team names when speaking in French. The large majority of them are said and pronounced in English (to the best of the speaker‚Äôs ability), however a handful of them are always pronounced fully in French in hockey discourse : Sabres, Senators, Penguins, Avanlanche, Predators, and funnily enough both Coyotes and Mammoth. (Not 100% sure about Kraken because nobody talks about them). These sort of make sense since they translate to very similar, if not identically spelt words in French: Sabres-Sabres Senators-S√©nateurs Penguins-Pingouins Avalanche-Avalanche Predators-Pr√©dateurs Coyotes-Coyotes Mammoth-Mammouth The part that is bugging me is that there are three other teams whose names are basically the same in French, but are NOT translated, and fully pronounced in English like any other team: the Flames (instead of Flammes) the Capitals (instead of Capitales) and the Panthers (instead of Panth√®res (though I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but I feel like we used to say Panth√®res in French, but it‚Äôs changed to English as they‚Äôve gotten good and relevant)). So why do we pronounce some names in French and some names in English ? Sorry if this was super convoluted, but I wonder if anyone can offer some linguistics insights into this phenomenon. Thanks TLDR : Why do Quebec francophone fans pronounce Sabres, Senators, Penguins, Avalanche, Predators and Coyotes/Mammoth in French, but Panthers, Capitals and Flames in English ?",

      "content_preview": "Number to call: 212-789-2000 The above number directs you to the NHL head office in New York City. The recent release by the USA Government to form a sports body is a direct attack on trans athletes, and begins a slide by NHL management to actively support a regime that breaks the constitution, and arrests people without any due process. Below is a pre-written example of what you can use when calling in: \"Good Morning/Afternoon, I'm a huge supporter of the NHL and have been for years, and I have immense concern regarding Bettman's recent inclusion on Donald Trump's Council of Sports. The commissioner of this league influencing regressive sports policy such as this not only shows direct issue with the NHL's inclusive messaging, but immediately discredits any future attempts to involve people within hockey itself. Donald Trump and the GOP has shown no ability to effectively handle social issues, and their targeting of trans athletes is yet another step in the decline of American sports. As of reports in 2025, there are now more people on this council than there are NCAA trans athletes. The issue they are trying to resolve is not only imaginary, but is consistent with fascist dogwhistles to demean, harm, and otherwise remove trans people from any aspects of social life. NHL fans do not want this, nor do the thousands of youth and recreational players across the continent who view the NHL as the holy grail of the sport. In addition, the inability for the commissioner to identify the danger of a convicted felon, pedophile, and constitutional traitor, greatly reduces any belief I have in him to effectively run the NHL. Bettman has no place on this council, and as such should immediately rescind his position within it if he wishes to maintain any credibility within the NHL, and with it fans. Until then, I refuse to financially commit any more money towards the NHL, or any team that participates within it.  I will not be buying jerseys, tickets, or subscribe to any streaming service to support these games. Until the NHL cleans its hands of any association with the current presidential administration, the PWHL and local leagues will be receiving all of my financial support going forward. Hockey fans have a long memory, and these financial impacts will carry forward for a long, long time if this is not rescinded. With care, a long time hockey fan, player, and NHL supporter.\"",

Rushmores of Hockey Day 1 - Anaheim Ducks: Paul Kariya, Teemu Sel√§nne, Ryan Getzlaf,  Jean-S√©bastien Gigu√®re Day 2 - Boston Bruins: Bobby Orr, Ray Bourque, Patrice Bergeron, Phil Esposito Day 3 - Buffalo Sabres: Dominik Hasek, Gilbert Perreault, Rick Martin, Ren√© Robert Day 4 - Calgary Flames: Jarome Iginla, Miikka Kiprusoff, Lanny McDonald, Al MacInnis Day 5 - Carolina Hurricanes: Eric Staal, Rod Brind'Amour, Ron Francis, Cam Ward Rules of the post are simple: Each day, I will post a new topic for the next team alphabetically. Comment with an eligible player that played at least one game for that franchise. At the end of each day the top four highest-upvoted comments will be enshrined as that team's Mt. Rushmore. If a comment has more than one player, I'll only count the first player listed. Bolding that last one to make my own life easier hopefully. Day 6 and what a day it is. So many great choices.

Don't pester the rest of the fanbase. - Be respectful. Light-hearted banter and your standard trash talk is okay, but don't let it turn nasty. Basically, just adhere to Reddiquette and the r/hockey rules. - Don't complain to the r/hockey mods. This whole thing is my brainchild, not theirs. Any complaints should be directed to me. The non-immune team with the most votes in each poll will be eliminated, This will continue for an additional 19 rounds until round 20, when immunities are removed, and then round 30, where users will vote for the winner of r/hockey Survivor among the three remaining teams. Google account required to participate. VOTE TO ELIMINATE A TEAM HERE Polling will close between 9 AM and 12 PM EST tomorrow. Results will go out with the next round between 12 and 4 PM EST.",

Be creative. Things you should try to avoid (unless genuinely creative) include but are not limited to: San Jose choking Vancouver rioting Vegas being historic/using LTIR Sabres' playoff drought Minnesota being Wild-ly average Calgary being eternally mid Nashville raising a banner for everything Marchand being a rat Leafs in the first round Utah soaker/Mormon jokes In general, any other overplayed memes Roast Schedule: Florida Panthers ‚Äì Boom, roasted. Edmonton Oilers ‚Äì Boom, roasted. Dallas Stars ‚Äì Boom, roasted. Carolina Hurricanes ‚Äì Boom, roasted. Winnipeg Jets ‚Äì Boom, roasted. Washington Capitals ‚Äì Boom, roasted.
