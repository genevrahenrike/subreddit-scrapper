      "content_preview": "I made three deluxe containers of vanilla: A base version (nonfat dairy + sweeteners + stabilizers + vanilla + salt) Notice, no protein powders at all, kept the base very simple Not sharing exact ingredients to keep the focus on the effect of the next two Base version + 1 Tablespoon (12g) of Inulin powder Version 2 + 1 Tablespoon (10g) ClearJel (Cold modified cornstarch) Inulin is meant to be a fat replacer that provides better mouthfeel. ClearJel, which is the main ingredient in every sugar-free pudding mix, is also a fat replacer and helps reduce iciness. My goal was to see the effect Inulin then Inulin+ClearJel. I blended each version for about 60 seconds on low to mix everything thoroughly. The base version was fine, but after the first light spin, it was very powdery. I had to re-spin it to get a nice texture. Both versions 2 and 3 only needed a single light ice-cream spin. Version 2 was noticeably better with a creamier feel. Not surprisingly, version 3 was even better; it was far smoother and creamier on the tongue. It seems clear that I'll be adding both of these (1 T each) to my premade stabilizer mix going forward (for a deluxe). I can also see why so many of you are adding sugar-free pudding mix, the modified cornstarch has a very pronounced effect on the final texture. After I eat my way through these experiments, I'll try another round of testing. Please jump in and let me know if you've tried anything similar and what you like to use.",

Mix well. Add vanilla syrup. Add pudding mix, mix well. Add cream cheese (I usually microwave mine for about 15 seconds to make sure it will mix). Mix everything together. Pour into creami tub and freeze overnight. Spin on light ice cream setting. This recipe creates the best, creamy, ice cream. Typically, I don't even have to respin but if it comes out a little crumbly add 1-2 tablespoons of almond milk and respin. You can take this recipe and make it any flavor you want. Just change the sugar free syrup and/or the pudding mix I've made mint chocolate chip by using sugar free mint chocolate chip syrup in place of the vanilla syrup. I have plans to make a salted caramel and butterscotch ice cream by using that flavor of syrup pudding mix. Enjoy your yummy protein ice cream!",

      "content_preview": "I've been making creamis daily now for protein (my go-tos have been mint, cinnamon toast crunch, coffee, and cookies & cream - but still finalizing my ingredients) However, one of my favorite ice creams is just plain chocolate and realized I'm missing that one. What I mean by specifically \"premium\" is that there seems to be a difference between the average chocolate ice cream, and premium chocolate ice cream Here are 2 examples of specific brands that pretty much nail it: Aldi's chocolate super premium ice cream (brand Specially Selected) BJ's Wholesale Club premium chocolate flavored ice cream (brand Wellsley Farms) What I'm mainly wondering is has anyone been able to or have good ideas on how to nail this flavor? Hopefully someone knows what I mean by \"premium chocolate\" since I'm not good at describing flavors, but it's not super rich and maybe closer to milk, and it's not watery or bland. If it helps, I don't typically like chocolate protein shakes, those just taste like cold hot chocolate which is different flavor than this (to me) I'm not sure if the flavor I'm looking for could only come from normal unhealthy ice cream (due to sugars/fats0, or if it would be possible to try to mimic this flavor in a lower calorie protein creami (so using protein powder, not sure which brand for chocolate or if chocolate flavor would come from a different ingredient) Anyone have recommendations or is this not really doable? Sorry if this is a brainlessly dumb question but I honestly have no idea but would love a chocolate base I like Edit: Figured I'd mention, would this post quality for this flavor? My question is weirdly specific so I wouldn't know and would rather ask than try 10 different chocolate recipes Edit 2: I will also update this OP with what recipe I threw together based on your suggestions below, with pictures and thoughts on taste - might take a few days - thanks everyone so far :)",

      "content_preview": "I am one of the gymbro types that has latched onto the Ninja Creami. Given that one of the most common questions fitness types ask in this sub is \"which protein powder should I use?\", I have decided to simply evaluate as many of the blends as possible. I am not Mr. Moneybags so it will take me a while to do it (I am trying the blends and taking my data sequentially, not all at once), but I think a comprehensive review may help people make their decision. I will rate (and have rated) brands on the following metrics: Texture, Taste, Cost, Protein per Serving, Cost per Gram of Protein, Availability (specifically in a large metropolitan US area), and public 3rd party testing/labs for contaminants and protein labelling. Given my 'tism, I will try to be as quantitative as possible... even though most of these metrics outside of price is pretty subjective, and it is always best to try yourself. I have tried the following brands already: MyProtein (using an 80-20 blend of concentrate and micellar casein I had on hand) PeScience (Frosted Cupcake) Metabolic Drive (Chocolate) Brands I plan to try at the moment: PEScience (Chocolate Truffle) Quest TrueNutrition BlackMagic Flex Brands As you can see, I like chocolate. I will stick to that flavor profile. I am using the same exact super simple gymbro recipe (fewer ingredients, the better, I am lazy!). 330g 2% milk, 0.25 tsp xantham gum, 1 scoop of protein, and 1 tbsp of cocoa powder. I will use the same generic cocoa powder for everything, but I am experimenting with dutch cocoa sometimes so I may note how cocoa impacts it too. For TrueNutrition, since they do a custom blend, I am going to go with the flavor the manufacturer support team recommended (their cocoa monkfruit sweetened flavor). I would love to hear your suggestions and I look forward to sharing my experience with you all in a few months. Also, I am only testing blends, because I have tried using pure whey and pure casein (MyProtein and Legion), and blending leads to better texture basically always in my opinion, so I am not going to test any whey isolates/concentrates or pure casein powders anymore. Thanks!",

That said, I've spent SO MUCH MONEY! haha not really a complaint, just an observation and giving others a heads up. We are a consumer society built on spending money. So it's been 2 weeks I think, actually only 1! Ordered the deluxe (24 oz) from eBay. Before that arrived I ordered extra containers so we could hit the ground running. I placed a Walmart order for the milks, thickeners and flavorings. Walmart didn't have Fairlife so I did an Amazon order. I got a notification there was an issue with that order so I did an Amazon Fresh order spending $50+ to get free delivery so we could have he famous Fairlife. I also got some Skyr I've seen people go Gaga over on YouTube. Did another Walmart order to get mix ins or other flavorings I'd see people talk about on YouTube or here in Reddit. Ordered PEScience protein variety 8 pack 5 servings per pack because I've seen it on YouTube. I'm now sitting here wondering what else I should buy to try. I really think my favorite Creami so far has been cheesecake, made with real cream cheese, milks, an egg yolk (but honestly I just use the whole egg) sweetener and gums.",

      "content_preview": "Looking at buying a Ninja Creami Currently, noticed the differences in models available, thought they were all the same. Is there any point of buying the Deluxe 10-1 (NC501) over the ‚ÄúRegular‚Äù NC300? I know the NC501 makes larger tubs. I am kind of leaning towards buying a coloured one. Are the more options & larger portion tubs worth it? - Thank you",
