      "content_preview": "So my main concern, honestly, is with Two-Factor Authentication. I am totally fine with using 2FA on my accounts, but I am super worried about setting it up on Bitwarden itself. The main reason being that I'm always afraid that if my phone ever gets stolen, or if I ever lose my phone, I would quite literally lose access to everything. The idea of that is terrifying. So far, I have been setting up 2FA on all my services that I use, and making sure that I save the Authentication Keys in Bitwarden itself, so that they're at least stored on the app incase I do ever need to use them, but I have yet to set up 2FA on my  Bitwarden itself, for the reasons mentioned above. When you guys are using 2FA on Bitwarden, which method do you use? And also, if I decide to pay for premium, and I get TOTP generation in the app itself, would I still need to use a separate app in order to generate the TOTP for the Bitwarden app itself? I mean, I figure I would since I would have to be signed in to access those codes, but I thought I would ask, since it seems silly to have an entire separate Authenticator app to worry about before logging in to Bitwarden. Would it be bad to just simply use a strong password for your master password? Like 30 characters, capitals, numbers, symbols, the works?",

With the latest update I now noticed that the windows hello option is now disabled upon first boot or restart and I have to sign in with my master password at least once now during that session. If I shutdown or restart and log back in it disables it again. Anyway to allow windows hello login? For reference my security settings are as follows: Vault timeout: on restart Timeout action: Lock Unlock with biometrics is checked off. Which brings me to my next issue on the bitwarden extension in edge. I used to be able to type my master password hit enter and that would unlock the vault. Now when I type in my master password and hit enter it closes the extension window as if I clicked out of it and leaves it locked. I now have to click unlock after typing my master password. Not a big deal at all but just an odd thing to change.",

      "content_preview": "I admit, I dropped a few bucks on the last Powerball drawing. The jackpot is now about one billion dollars. Sometimes I like to dream, you know? When I was looking up the winning numbers yesterday, I noticed an article that says the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are one in 292 million. That’s measurably better than one in a billion.  A one followed by nine zeros. This leads to an important lesson involving your passwords and your password manager in general. I see people taking  precautions with their passwords such as 20 random characters or perhaps a four word DiceWare passphrase. But what does that really mean? Assuming these passwords are randomly selected (just like my Powerball tickets), a 20 character password has a probability of roughly a one followed by TWENTY-TWO zeros. A four word passphrase has a probability of a one followed by FIFTEEN zeros. Put another way, the odds of someone guessing such a passphrase is roughly equal to winning the Powerball ONE MILLION TIMES. And yet some users are convinced they need to do more to secure their passwords. I have news for you. If you won the Powerball one million times, everyone would know that you were cheating the system.  In a similar manner, if someone is going to guess a strong password, they didn’t really “guess” it. They found a “cheat”.   Powerball. One million times. In other words, the weak point in your security is no longer your passwords.  It’s something else: physical security on your devices, you failed to keep your devices patched, you downloaded malware onto one of your devices, you let someone watch you enter the password, et cetera. There is no such thing as “perfect” security.  Someone is going to win the Powerball, sooner or later. Your job as a responsible password user is to pick the level of risk you are comfortable with. But whatever you do, don’t go out and buy a million Powerball tickets. That isn’t responsible management of risk/reward. If you want to improve your security, your resources are better spent elsewhere.",

Login takes about 6-7 seconds on my phone. I'm only using Bitwarden for secure notes, not passwords, so I won't be using autofill at all. Are these settings strong enough to protect against brute force attacks? Should I increase memory or iterations, or is this good? Any advice on how these hold up against brute forcing for a notes only vault? Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I'm new to this so a couple of questions that I was not able to find in the FAQ and are surely naive: - I have the app installed on my Android phone. So I assume the app keeps my info as an encrypted, offline file in my phone's physical memory. Is that so? - Once I unlock the screen of the phone I can access the app (through biometrics, PIN or passwd). At that time I assume the key to my data is regenerated, blob decrypted, and the plaintext is put on the screen, cashed etc . Correct, right? So the questions are 1)If I lose my phone and IF the phone is (somehow) unlocked - what can I do to prevent brute forcing the key to BW? 2)Is there a way for me to dump the blob to the cloud every time after the completion of the session - so that no encrypted blob is kept on my device - and retrieve the blob back ONLY when I need to decrypt it The point is to avoid having an offline copy (which CAN be brute forced), and force the possible perpetrator to request the chypertext from the cloud (which CANNOT be brute forced). Hope that makes sense. Thanks",

The issue i have is whenever i go to any site that needs a login the saved logins are from i believe MS password manager and passkey brings up Google password manager. (i then need to go into More Options… then select BW and i can use it). In Android settings i have BitWarden set as my default passkey. In Autofill i have BitWarden selected (and both MS Authenticator and Google password manager unchecked/disabled). In BW client itself i have “Autofill services” checked, set to Inline. I also have “Use Brave/Chome” autofill integration boxes ticked. Keyboard used is Swiftkey. In Edge itself in password manager, everything is unticked, no offer to save passwords, no auto sign in, no autofill for apps. In Chrome and Brave this DOES work - i get a BW and only a BW popup for logins and passkeys. In Edge i seem to get MS and Google PM regardless of the fact they’re disabled everywhere i can see. Bit Warden does work but only via “More options…” for passkeys or deleting the autofilled text from the dialogs manually before it appears for normal logins. Phone is a Android 16 Pixel 9 Pro. I get identical behaviour on my Galaxy Tab s5e running Android 15 (Lineage 22).",

      "content_preview": "I run a script to backup vaults for my organization and couple private vaults about once a month. Most months lately, that includes updating to the latest version of the CLI. I'm on 2025.8.0 now. In the last release, my backup would report errors syncing vaults. But inspecting the backups I saw no problem. Now in this release, syncing works fine but exporting attachments is REAL slow (extracting attachments). The script took over 30 minutes to execute and usually finishes in maybe a minute or two. During the time, my bitwarden VM was using way less than 1% of the CPU and doing just a few kb of disk i/o. And I can drag and drop big files like 50M into my VeraCrypt volume in Windows Explorer - no problem with the speed of writing to it. I have about 1GB network thruput from my workstation to the VM. My script also reports an error copying one particular attachment. But when I inspect the attachment it looks fine. And iterating thru the attachments, there's a couple that download twice now. I haven't change the script in about eight months. Anybody else having weird problems like this using the CLI? Windows batch file output",

      "content_preview": "So, after reading about a few people getting their bitwarden account hacked, I started getting a bit worried. I had my TOTP enabled but I felt it wasn't enough. So I bought 2 security keys. Well, although it's less convenient than TOTP, it's not a big issue. O don't have to log in from scratch every day. Not even every month. It's basically set and forget. As a bonus, I then secured my google and apple accounts. That's it. Just these 3. And I've done the same for my wife. I feel more \"safe\" than before. For 50 USD, I think it's worth it. Google and bitwarden are my most important services. Is it an overkill? I hope it is. I hope nobody ever even tries to hack me. I strongly recommend it for everyone here.",

When you get a new phone or do a factory reset you need to get into your google account before you can install any apps on your phone but my password is inside bitwarden but I can't install bitwarden.  I just found it was easier to change the password to something real easy and I have to disable 2fa i hate doing that but i have not found any other way.  I even tried  making a dumb account just to install BW. but then you still have the 2fa issue with bitwarden.",
