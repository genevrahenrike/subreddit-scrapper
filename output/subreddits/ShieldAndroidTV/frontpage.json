I always have it on tivimate and have it set to return to the last used app when i wake it up from standby, which works fine most of the time. At one point I noticed at night that the TV was on as I could see the light uder the door, I went to look and found the shield was on and sitting on the desktop (F launcher).  So apparently sometimes in the night, the shield is somehow being turned on and going back to the desktop.  I don't know whats going on, it seems quite random and seems to be happening at night, possibly when losing internet connection due to engineering work at the exchange or something. So I am confused as to: 1: why the shield is turning itself on 2: why it's not on tivimate when it does this I looked around thinking it was some sort of wake on lan turning it on when internet went down and came back up, but there is no such setting (and its on wifi anyway) and that wouldnt explain why its on the desktop instead of in tivimate. When I get up in the morning the shield and the tv are always back in standby, i only know it has done this overnight because when i turn the shield on, its sitting on the desktop and not in tivimate.  So when this does happen, it seems to be turning itself back off (and the tv with it due to cec) after the 15min idle timer runs out. Now I am wondering if something is crashing, causing the shield to reboot overnight, which is causing the tv to turn on and the shield to end up on the desktop instead of in tivimate...but I use it all day and never ever have any crashes or issues of any kind, so I don't think it can be that or I would see it during the day.  So I am back to having no clue whats going on.  any ideas?",

      "content_preview": "Hey all, looking for real-world Shield tips. I‚Äôm on a Shield TV Pro (2019) with a 4K TV. Ethernet to the router, strong connection, and I‚Äôm using a popular live TV app on Android TV. What I‚Äôve tried so far: Hardware decoder on, playback set to highest quality Increased player buffer inside the app Turned off motion smoothing on the TV Cleared cache and rebooted the Shield It‚Äôs good most of the time, but big matches sometimes hiccup. For Shield owners who watch a lot of live sports, which settings made the biggest difference for you? Helpful details I can share or change if needed: Shield settings for Resolution and Refresh Rate AI upscaling on or off Match frame rate options inside apps like Kodi or Plex when relevant DNS or router tweaks that play nice with Shield Preferred Android TV player apps for live channels If you have a known good combo for 50/60 fps sports, please drop it here. Thanks!",

My question to you is: Is it stable enough to be a daily driver? Is it ready to get published on the Play Store and make improvements along the way? For those who don't know the app here are some videos of the UI: https://youtu.be/CN6bJdUkTus https://youtu.be/Qw7pQEJ9nn0 Test it at will and ask for features or report bugs on https://hegemon.canny.io/issues-and-feature v1.03 (current) Added QuickApps Dock on long press of the Back button Enabled Trailer button with WebView and YouTube iframe API Added option to select which streaming app appears when Play is pressed Added ability to choose default streaming app Improved translations Added new languages for the app (Italian, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi) Fixed visual bug where elements were cut off by Spotlight Implemented direct play in Kodi using the Fenlight addon (movies and TV shows) Fixed loading of rows on first app launch Fixed notification deletion bug (no longer jumps to SearchScreen) Added options menu to the Apps screen, accessible via long press of back button. Allows selection of sort type (alphabetical, usage, custom) Fixed app menu option overlay handeling Fixed search screen tvshows id's Added functionality to Trakt personal lists I know it's a long way from being perfect, but hopefully you'll take this journey with me.

I assume it won't upscale because Kayo streams at 50 fps and the tube only upscales 30 fps content. With that being said will upgrading to the Shieild TV Pro work instead? I don't want to get it just for it to not work either, as the tube Shield works fine otherwise.",

      "content_preview": "Hey duders, I've been trying to get my hands on a used 2019 Shield Pro on online marketplaces (I'm broke), but I can't for the life of mine tell the physical difference between the 2017 model and the 2019 one. I'm not suspecting everyone online selling their 2017 pro for a 2019 model, but they easily could if they wanted to, because they seem to be identical enough that an IT and internet guy like myself is having a hard time distinguishing them. They both have the same model number, same triangular remote (Am I right?) with the Netflix button and the main device's body is identical between the two models. Please help. And if anyone has a used (but not abused) 2019 Pro model and wants to get rid of it, contact me. The picture here is from an eBay post that lists the items as the 2017 model. It also has a triangular remote with the Netflix button. ChatGPT says the late 2017 models had upgraded remote. And I know this a 2017 model, because the 2019 didn't come with the game controller This adds to the confusion. *EDIT: Just so that there's no confusion, I'm not asking about the spec differences between the two models. I'm asking how can I tell if a used TV Shield Pro on eBay or Facebook marketplace is ACTUALLY the 2019 model, especially if the seller hasn't specified the model year. https://preview.redd.it/how-to-tell-nvidia-shield-pro-2019-from-2017-v0-3hp3qz3zrwgf1.jpg",

I can select PC mode on the tv, force full range video on moonlight and set black level to high and it looks good. I can also do the opposite - select Game input on the TV, turn off full range video and turn black level to low. This also looks good. I understand the secone option is a limited RGB range and the first one is full, but can the shield even do full range 4k 60fps HDR? Which option should I be picking? Thanks!",

Anyone have any ide on how to fix this? thanks. EDIT1: So i think i found the problem and sorry for not responding earlier! I run a pfsense router with pfblockerng and when i deactivate pfblockerng the no internet access dosent show and i dont have \"limited connection\" i haven¬¥t had the time to go throw the feeds or make a whitelist yet. Just a bit strange since these no internet access warnings didnt show when running pfsense before i had to reinstall it? EDIT2: Found it. One of the dnsbl feeds in pfblockerng (Phishtank) was blocking the google connectivity test. If you have same problem as i had try whitelisting the google connectivity test domains connectivitycheck.gstatic.com connectivitycheck.android.com clients1.google.com clients3.google.com and if needed google.com",

      "content_preview": "I have 3 shields, 2 - 2017 models and 1 - 2019 model. I opened them all up today to clean them and replace the thermal paste. The 2 2017's were great after reassembling. I really don't feel I could have damaged anything with as careful I was with all 3, but the 2019 will not turn on. No light, no fan. I didn't see any master reset buttons on the back. I let it sit out for 30 minutes unplugged and plugged back in. Nothing. Anyone know any tips or tricks that might get this thing going again? If appreciate any help!",

      "content_preview": "Have been running Ples Media Server(PMS) on my Shield for may years issue free.  Just discovered the latest update to Shield or PMS broke my PMS. Tried everything I've read in forums with no luck, so did a factory reset on the Shield. Server starts and shows as running in plex local client settings.  However if I stop and start it immediately starts, I do not think it is starting correctly as in the past this would take a few seconds to start.  Assume crashing at start and incorrectly reporting status as running. I can connect to Plex remotely using SMB with 'Transfer files over local network' is enabled on Plex from a PC on LAN.  So no issues with network. Shield on latest version. 9.2.1(33.2.0.326) PMS version 1.41.1.8.9834(SMB) Moved media to temporary PMS on Mac, Shield Plex client can see and access Mac PMS, so no issues with client. Plex config from PC or MAC detects the Shield PMS server but reports it is currently unavailable.  If I remove the server from the Plex  config and reboot the Shield the entry returns to the list of PMS servers but still shows as unavailable. As network connectivity does not seem to be the issue and I have done a factory reset I can only assume there is an issue with the current update to the PMS client on the current version of the Shield OS. Any thoughts or guidance appreciated. Having tried just about everything I'm just sitting waiting for next update unless one of you smart folks have any ideas.",
