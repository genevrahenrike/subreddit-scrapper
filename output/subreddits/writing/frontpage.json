        "content": "Samples of writing, whether for critique, self-promotion, or general sharing, may only be posted in the weekly self-promotion and critique thread. Requests for writing partners may also only be posted in the critique thread. Requests for school help should be posted in , including posts about school essays or citations. We do not allow advertisements for your book, website, new subreddit, etc., or for you to do so on behalf of another company, outside of the self-promotion thread. This includes both posts and comments. We ask that users frame their posts so they are useful to multiple people. If your post invites answers that are specific to your work alone, it belongs in our brainstorming thread. “Low effort” posts (two lines of text, repetitive questions, etc.) will be removed. Posts focused on personal sharing may only be posted in the general discussion thread. Calls for submissions (including posts about general writing work) must include 1) payment information; 2) submission deadlines; 3) rights requested; 4) any other relevant information. Directing to a website to answer these questions is not allowed. Please limit yourself to one post per publishing cycle. AMAs may not be posted without mod approval. We prefer subjects be part of the wider writing industry or have done something more than publish a book. Please message modmail for AMA requests. Treat other people with decency and respect. We encourage healthy debate and discussion, but we will remove antagonistic, caustic, or otherwise belligerent posts. We moderate on tone rather than language. Racist, homophobic/transphobic, misogynistic, ableist, and other categories of hate speech (including against “acceptable targets”) will be removed. Please report any instances of offensive talk, and the mods will deal with them. Internet vigilantism and doxxing will not be tolerated. The forum is a place where we all come together to celebrate what we do: write. We will remove posts: berating other people for their genre/subject/literary taste; adherence or non-adherence to rules; calling people morons for giving a particular sort of advice; insisting that their opinion is the only one worth having; being antagonistic towards particular types of books or audiences; or implying that a particular work is for “idiots”, or “snobs”, etc."

      "content_preview": "I just published my first book three days ago and it has somehow already sucked all the fun out of writing for me. No one’s bought the book, which is completely fine and that’s not why I’m sad. I didn’t expect anyone to buy my book because no one knows who I am. It was more the entire process of learning how to publish, learning that getting traditionally published is as impossible as winning the lottery, so pivoting to self-publishing. I wanted to self-publish anyways so I could keep my creative freedom.But learning about how to do it, learning where to get covers and how to market and what sells and what to do and not to do… making a KDP account and learning about all the shitty things Amazon does its authors and wondering if I just shouldn’t sell on there even though they hold like 90% of the book market… All these different things I had to learn along the way seemed fine because I was also still writing my book, and that’s the part I like.But then I finished it, and published it, and I was happy for about two seconds. And now I feel… utterly trapped. Like now I’m stuck on this hamster wheel where in order to gain traction I HAVE to write. And I have to write shit I don’t care about. I know that’s not true because the book I just published wasn’t even to market because I don’t care about that. I just feel like I entered myself into the capitalist rat race and it’s making me literally depressed. I want to take my book down off Amazon. I want to delete my KDP account. I want to go back to putting my work up on free forums and get comments from random internet strangers about how much my work means to them.But I don’t know if I should listen to this voice or if I’m just scared because this is something new, and I should just give it more time. In truth, I kind of have no other skills and am partially disabled, so if I COULD make money from my work, that would be awesome. But I don’t know if it’s worth the expense of my mental health since I feel like I sold out or something. I hated every aspect of publishing my book. I hated learning about KDP. I hated learning about publishing. I hated the process of finding an artist and getting a cover. And I hate that, because I wrote the first book in a series because I had such plans for this world, that now I feel financially compelled to write book two because having only one book doesn’t sell. I hate that I think about writing capitalistically now.How the hell do I balance my love and passion for the craft of writing with the gross marketing aspects? Or do I just… quit?",

But writing that??? Something about it makes my blood curdle 💀💀💀Is this just like, standard?? Like do I just need to get used to it?? Should I not include it and the make my characters use standard English?? Idk man 😭😭😭Edit: Okay this got WAYYY more attention than I expected 💀 i really appreciate all the advice and encouragement! I think I’ll just stick with the first example and see how it shakes out in the end.Thanks everyone!",

He'll literally read the most random stuff. Any genre. He's the only one who messaged me to tell me he read it and what he liked.I think about 40 people said they wanted to and were going to read it. I gave about 5 people hard copies for free. My parents didn't read it, none of my friends, not even my partner read it. I get it, they're not readers, but come on!This is my rant.

Only when the story relates to the disability in the story I'm submitting typically.Right now I'm submitting a humor story to a magazine that has the blurb.

      "content_preview": "I’ve tried. Really, I have. But every time I join a writers group, I run into some mix of the same four people.There's the edgy anime bro: mid-twenties, hoodie with something likeDeath NoteorInvader Zimon it, and a writing style that's essentially fanfic plus thinly veiled trauma dump. Their only exposure to fiction is anime, manga, and wattpad erotica.Then there's the divorced romance enthusiast, mid-forties, writing what is clearly softcore porn with characters who look suspiciously like her ex-husband, her coworker, or a barista she once exchanged eye contact with. Always with a healthy dose of \"The Writer's Barely-Disguised Fetish\"Next is the worldbuilder. He’s got 1,200 years of history mapped out, a binder full of languages, and a hexagonal map of his fantasy continent, but not a single completed short story. He’s building a universe with no people in it.And finally, the eternal workshopper. Usually an English lit teacher or MFA graduate who's been polishing Chapter One of their magnum opus since 2006. If you ask them about querying they suddenly look like a deer in the headlights.Those quirks should be fine. Mostly they don't bother me (that much). I just see the same archetypes so often that it almost seems to be parody.But the real reason I’ve given up on writers groups?The crab bucket.You know what the metaphor is: crabs in a bucket will pull each other down rather than let one escape. That’s what these groups become. The second someone shows real progress (getting published, going to conferences, etc) they’re branded a sellout or \"lucky\" People hoard contacts and opportunities like they’re rationing during wartime.Critique sessions are less about helping each other grow, more about performing intelligence. Everyone’s laser-focused on nitpicking comma splices while ignoring what actually works in a piece. The goal isn’t to improve. It's to keep everyone equally average.Oh, and god forbid you write genre fiction. Literary writers scoff. Genre writers roll their eyes at anything that dares to have symbolism or ambiguity. Everyone's busy looking down their noses at someone.The result is that the group becomes a cozy little swamp of mutual stagnation. Safe and quietly toxic to any real ambition.Now, I’ll admit: I’m probably a bit bitter. Maybe even jealous. I see posts about supportive groups that help each other finish drafts, land agents, launch books. That’s beautiful. Good for you. I just haven’t found it.I’m not a great writer. I'm not even a good writer. I’m average. But I work. I show up. I study craft, submit, revise, and try to get better. I don’t understand why so many people in these groups act like their first draft is sacred and everyone else’s work is garbage.Why even come to a writing group if you think you have nothing to learn?Anyway. Rant over.",

Would an editor pick it up? How would I pitch it?I actually will imagine reviews in my head! Where on Earth is this false sense of importance coming from!Frankly, I’m an absolute nobody and painfully aware that most writers don’t end up with large audiences or financial gain.I also know that if nobody ever read my work, I’d still write it because I’m in love with it. Despite that, writing purely for myself feels so…embarrassing? I’m sheepish about putting in potentially years of work on something just to save it on my computer or print it out and prop it up on my bookshelf. I mean, what else could I do with it?I’d love to get over myself, and throw out that shame entirely. To just write for myself and stop worrying about appealing to others.It should be just as simple as deciding to, right?Still, the intrusive thoughts persist.",

Those three stars were life changing and till this day, it’s the only reason why i still have that dream of becoming an author (sprinkled with a little of bit delusion), the way i see it is, if i can receive three stars from a book that i didn’t really put effort in, i could maybe write a good book if i DO put effort in.Also, i made $0.05 💀",

Strangely enough, I found it randomly on a 5 year oldr/tipofmytonguepost while checking out the sub. To summarize briefly, its when writers use words in fantasy settings that have an origin or etymology deeply specific to earth and our cultures, even if they don't exist in the setting in question. The post in TOMT uses french fries as an example, as using the word in a fantasy setting implies that France (or Belgium) exists in universe. I've seen many instances of this in the fantasy books I read as well, even by authors I'm fond of. Usually its more of a passing thought for me but some times I feel like it can really take you out of the story. I don't think, however, that it's something you can necessarily avoid though without ripping half the pages out of you personal dictionary. So my question is where do you feel like the line is drawn in breaking immersion?",

      "content_preview": "I'm not a native English speaker, so forgive me for being unable to properly put what I'm asking about into words, but I'm not really a writer and I just want to learn more about the craft. It seems when I'm watching movies/shows especially, there'll often be scenes or moments that aren't necessarily there to push the story along or set up moments later on, and can often seem random.A character will trip on something while walking that doesn't turn out to be an important object, and doesn't set up someone randomly finding or stumbling onto something important at a different time, or something like that, maybe a character gets a paper cut at work or loses a bet or something. The weirder the director, the weirder these can be, off the top of my head I just came up with a few random benign examples. And I suppose at a certain level of weirdness/uniqueness they are pretty important for tone setting.I understand these things do a good job at making the world of the story feel more 'real', I'm not saying theyre unnecessary or that I don't enjoy watching them - rather that I see them everywhere and was wondering if it's an actual conscious technique writers use to flesh out their worlds/stories and ground them, or if I'm just hallucinating them. I suppose I tend to be the type of person where if I'm interested in something I'll read/watch it through to the end and don't mind if stuff is extraneous, but I can imagine wider audiences won't tolerate too much of stuff that's downright unnecessary, because it constitutes a greater time investment and commitment of effort on their part than may have been required from the writer to have asked for.",

How did they get my phone number when it's not connected to Facebook but uet knew my Facebook name?Has anyone else heard of this company or have any idea how this could happen or why they'd be offering to publicize my book when?

      "content_preview": "My passion project is...done? Now what?Once upon a time I was a young adult, doing my masters in a completely unrelated field, and had a daydream about a book. I obsessively wrote between studying and work, finished the book and never went back to it. 7 years later, I decided to unearth the project and merge it all together as I had written it on different devices and even filled a notebook with the middle chapters.Anyways, I just finished merging it and doing some minor editing. Of course I'm biased, but I like the story. It's totally something a younger me would have read in one weekend and maybe even some of the sage wisdom in it would have prevented a bad relationship or two. Anyways, now I'm asking myself...now what? I have always been a \"secret writer\". I was the kid that stayed up late, pen in one hand, flashlight in the other, never to reveal my works to a single soul. Even my spouse doesn't know that I wrote this entire book. But now I can't help but think what if? What if I get it published? What if it gets made into a TV series? What if I get a deal and they want a sequel? It has potential to be a series. What if I am actually really good at this author thing and others want to read my work? Or what if it's complete garbage and I should be embarrassed to even dream such dreams?But I know nothing of the actual publishing world beyond what I've read about on reddit and some Google searches. I don't know where to go from here. So, advice? Reality check?For those that have gotten this far, thank you. For added info, I would say that the genre would be YA. It's a coming of age story about a girl navigating life and relationships and finding herself in the process. It's a bit of a rollercoaster ride in terms of ups and downs, as life is. It's currently 73k words.Ramble complete.",

But I thought the whole point of the MFA was to work on a full length novel/collection, develop a writing routine to keep you on track, and build a professional community to help you find editors, publishers, lit agents etc.I sort of expected more from a top university— that they’d better prepare and equip their students to get published.Can anyone comment on if this is the norm for most writers on the MFA route? Is it because all of the feedback in class — does it derail/discourage you from writing? What gives?!",

Heck, it doesn't even need to be a complete coherent story with proper 3 act structure--great if it is--but it doesn't need to be.You can focus on three engaging scenes from a bigger story in your head.The point is, write something of the 6000-7500 range length, then get yourself agreat developmental editor. Let them use this much smaller work to teach you how to avoid the common first-timer mistakes.THIS... will springboard you into making a legit first draft when you go to write your actually first novel.I'm sure people will down vote this advice into oblivion because reasons... but this is the real tip.-Nick Macari",

      "content_preview": "I'm sure I'll get downvoted straight to hell for this, but whatever, let's stir the pot.We've all heard the \"rules\": The Hero's Journey, Save the Cat, the three-act structure, the five-act structure, Pixar's 22 Rules, etc. The protagonist needs to have a fatal flaw, and the story is ultimately about them confronting that fatal flaw and choosing whether they're going to grow by overcoming it and changing as a person, or whether they'll opt not to change, and fail as a result.These are good rules in general, but I feel like they also don't work for a lot of people, and those people will be told to adapt to them or quit writing, like you can't possibly write a worthwhile story unless you follow these guidelines.But what if that's not true?Here are the eight bestselling fiction books of all time:A Tale of Two CitiesThe Little PrinceThe AlchemistHarry Potter and the Philosopher's StoneAnd Then There Were NoneDream of the Red ChamberThe HobbitAlice's Adventures in WonderlandEditors and writing coaches might approve of some of these ... but I think they'd have a fit if you presented them with the others.TakePhilosopher's Stone, for example.The plot is that Harry needs to keep the Philosopher's stone out of Voldemort's hands. Except Harry doesn't even know that Voldemort is alive until 64,000 words into the book, and he takes almost as long to learn that the Stone exists. Basically, you've read an entire short novel before the plot even starts.How aboutAlice's Adventures in Wonderland? You might think it's about Alice trying to get home--except that she never once expresses any desire to go home whatsoever. The closest she ever gets is when she remarks that home was \"much pleasanter\". ButAlice never oncetriesto get home. When she does end up back home, it happens completely by accident, while she's in the midst of doing something else entirely.The Alchemisthas a goal: treasure.But ultimately, the story isn't about the treasure--it's about what happens to Santiago along the way, the places where he stops, the people that he meets, how he grows as a person. The treasure is just a pretext for getting him there.The Little Princeis similar.The narrator crashes his plane in the desert. He meets a boy, who later disappears, and then the narrator fixes his plane and flies away. From the narrator's perspective, the vast bulk of the story is completely irrelevant to his goal. From the Little Prince's perspective, he wants to explore, then when he's done exploring, he wants to go home. We're not even clear on whether he makes it home. Ultimately, the story is a series of parables, and a pretext for the characters to share them with one another.Dream of the Red Chamberis an absolutely epic work, with nearly 40 main characters. While there are themes tying it all together, there's no one plot, no one central character with a single goal, a single challenge to overcome.That's five of the eight bestselling fiction books of all time, where the plot (if it exists at all) is minimal, delayed, or just an afterthought.And this isn't just true of the classics. If you look at fanfiction, you'll see the same pattern. Absolutely, there are epic stories full of adventure and love and betrayal. But you'll also see thousands of kudos for a story where two characters bake a cake together. It's called \"fluff\", and it's actually a pretty popular genre.Yes, you absolutely can write a story where your main character has a fatal flaw that they need to overcome at the bottom of Act Two, or they'll fail in their quest. But don't let a writing coach tell you that this is theonlyway. It's ok if your character is a bratty know-it-all, and she remains a bratty know-it-all through the entire book. It's ok if your character's greatest concern in a scene is surviving a class period with a mean teacher.If the readers are invested in your characters, they'll follow them anywhere--even if all they're doing is baking a cake.",

      "content_preview": "So, I was having some pretty bad writer's block, for months - at least two. Pretty much hadn't written a single word, despite having the most free time I've had in almost a year. Today was the last day of that free time, and I finally cracked and started desperately searching and discovered 4theWords, which if you hadn't heard of it, because I hadn't, is basically like a fantasy RPG but a website for writing. You create an adventurer and write words in set time limits to defeat monsters. I wrote an insane amount of words, used up all my daily battles, and I'm now finding other similar websites that \"gameify\" writing. So far I've used 'Write or Else' which has a timer, word count goal and stats on the side, and also punishes you with loud noises and shaky screens and things if you stop writing for too long. I'm about to try Written? Kitten! which apparently gives you a picture of a cat for each amount of words that you write.So my point is, why don't more people talk about these? I feel like I've spent my entire life watching writers talk about how they tackle the blank page, and how to force yourself to write. And don't get me wrong, I love writing. It's my biggest passion in the world, and I wouldn't be where I am now without being able to escape into my fantasy worlds. And I have tried it all. Looked up all the advice, and nothing ever seemed to work. Until this method scratched my neurodivergent brain in exactly the right way. And I've literally NEVER heard anyone talk about using it!So here in lies my question. Why don't more writers use this? Why is this not talked about more? Like I've seen a version of it with writing sprints, but they never worked for me because there was no real sense of urgency. And obviously it can't be an everyday thing, sometimes I just get so inspired it just flows out of me. But on days and weeks when you're stuck...EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone who's contributed thus far! This post blew up a LOT more than I expected, and I've genuinely been fascinated by all the insights into everyone's different creative processes! I thought I'd share more of my thoughts on the matter after listening to everyone. First of all, I certainly don't think this is a tool I would use often, let alone everyday and certainly not for every writing session. I think writing is at it's best when it comes from an instinctual, thoughtful place, which would be difficult using some of these games. HOWEVER, I also believe that you should have fun with writing - which yes, I have a lot of fun writing, it's my favourite thing in the world - but there are so many different ways to approach it. I personally think these tools are at there best when you just need to make a wordcount, or you're coming out of a long slump or block, and want to just get something down to edit later, because as the old saying goes \"you can't edit a blank page\".",

Every hint feels like efficient subtext to me, but to others it can read as murky or confusing.Has anyone else wrestled with this? What strategies have you used to earn reader trust early in a work, before you’ve built the kind of readership that expects (and enjoys) that level of subtlety?",

I find my secondary characters are often more interesting, but even they can suffer from being too generic.I write out of order and am a discovery writer. I‘ve tried outlining/writing sequentially many times but it kills my creativity and brings my word count to zero. I suspect my character issue is a function of the combination of my weird process and decision paralysis/not wanting to commit to an idea that can’t be easily undone…secondary characters are faster to rewrite, so it is lower threat to commit to a particular personality, conflict, or whatever. On the flip side, I can usually come up with surprising moments, twists, and funny scenes  fairly easily. Do plotters/outliners struggle with this? Do other discovery/out of order writers struggle with fundamental character decisions?",

The story is about a girl (17), grown up in a religious semi sect with a strict father, who falls in love with a wolf shifter. Dad’s not happy.The story stats with him (her father) being murdered and how the police think here shifter boyfriend (and her) did it. The original idea was to have the main story centred around the murder and have their love story mostly hinted at in backflashes. Now, when I’m “editing” it I have had second thoughts and started dividing the book into one pre-murder part and a post-murder part, putting more focus on them building their love story and putting mor effort on how Dad and the “cult” not being in to that. Sort of building up to the murder, and ALSO putting more effort on hinting in the pre- story on who’s the real murderer (and why).I am now feeling that I (knowing my self) are doing way too much, just writing and writing and writing until its just a mesh of happenings. No storyline, no focus.I understand it is hard to give advice when you have not read it but I’m just seeking some one else’s thoughts about it. I want to include so much, worldbuilding, religion, the wolf packs, love, the girl’s parents and their hidden past that affects her in a way she could not have anticipated (small spoiler: her mother is not human, and so is she). It’s all just an web of thoughts and ideas in my head and I’m afraid that I’m letting it go out of hand, just building, and writing and…I think maby I will write it out as it is now and ask someone to read it and se what they think. I’m just a bit lost in my own thoughts.What would you do?",

With events that trigger the different ways that can present. I've toyed with the idea of making it a second-person narration as well, because it could really anchor the idea of looking back and not really understanding why it all made sense.For the ending, I'd want to leave off on a \"did they end it or not\" opening, because ime depression is basically cyclical. Would that be interesting and thought-provoking or annoying ?(The genre would be fantasy-adjacent, even if it's set in the real world).EDIT: There would be conflict, of course. The emotional plot would basically be about the conflict between the protagonist's conscience and what their self-hatred and the need to redeem themselves pushes them to do. The \"physical\" plot would mirror the evolution of that conflict.Mainly I want to write this because a lot of stories about depression don't capture the fact that it's not just being emotionless, it can be very vivid and violent in a way.",

All of them.Sometimes it is really easy to tell what a character wants. \"Frodo wants to reach Mordor so that he can destroy the One Ring.\"Other times it is more abstract or multitudinous. \"Winston wants to defy the will of Ingsoc in whatever way he can.\"A character's desires often change throughout the story. Katniss Everdeen wants to protect her family, then she wants to survive the Hunger Games, then she wants to keep Peeta alive and go home together with him.In my experience, the best characters are the ones whose desires are very easy to articulate— you can basically sum them up in a sentence or two.And it's OK if not every named person in your story has an articulable \"want\"! It's just that those people will probably be more useful as props or narrative forces that facilitate/alter/inject chaos into the story between your actual capital-C \"Characters\".I understand that more experienced writers might find this to be extremely basic advice, but this is something I really struggled with in the past. I wrote over 30,000 words of a romance, before I realised that my principal male AND my principal female were extremely boring humans. Neither of them wanted anything. Shit was just happeningatthem. By far the most interesting person was a supporting character, and it was much easier for me to articulate what she wanted: \"Resia wants to consolidate power and protect the House by undermining the mouth-breathing males she reports to.\"Anyways, that's all from me. Toodle-oo. Happy Saturday.",

      "content_preview": "I've been writing unprofessionally for a long time, and for a while during my youth I really thought I wanted to do it professionally (I even got a short story published in high school). Now, I don't know exactly what changed (probably a combination of fears about salary, interest in other subjects, and crippling OCD) but after high school I kind of just dropped it. I went to college for archaeology/GIS and was looking for jobs in that field for a while, but recently I've started to realize that writing, specifically science fiction/fantasy, is the only thing I really get excited about doing. It's easy say \"why didn't you realize in college that you didn't want to do it\" (and this is a fair question), but in the moment it's harder to figure this stuff out, especially when you're dealing with mental health issues.I know that having an education isn't necessarily required to be writer, but it does seem, at least on job boards, that it's preferred to have a degree in English, Journalism, etc. I have a small portfolio, but really nothing special, and lately I've wondered if it's just better to forget this whole \"passion\" and just focus on a more viable career, maybe doing writing on the side. But I can't shake the feeling that maybe if I applied myself maybe I could make it happen.To be honest, every time I've looked for advice on Reddit, most of the comments are... kind of discouraging. Not in a bad way, per se, they're just trying to save you from future heartache, but I get the sense people are not very optimistic about success in the field (tbf I also get this vibe for almost all career advice on reddit). I like narrative writing and would love to work on a video game, but as you know that's not a very likely lane of success. Basically, it feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place - either I go down a career with a better salary outlook, but I'm (potentially) not very fulfilled. Or, I dedicate myself to writing and (potentially) make no money.TLDR; Am I fooling myself into thinking I can do this, or should I stick with it and try to be a writer professionally?",

Maybe my expectations were too high; I don’t know.This software is actually great at organizing your thoughts. You can just keep making categories and sub categories. But then that’s all it does the best. This ability by itself isn’t anything more than you create different folders and subfolders within your OS. It basically does that within the app. It brings some comfort which is good. But then it totally lacks when it comes to other features like a powerful builtin tool for text-correction, or availability of good layout templates that would make your text ready for being published. I know they say it is not the purpose of the app, but then only the ability to categorize documents is not convincing enough to use it, when I still have to continue using other apps alongside it. To be fair, the fact that they charge one-time only and it is not subscription-based is something to be praised though.Overall, it is just a good app but not a superb one, the way it is hyped.",

      "content_preview": "Hello fellow writers! I’m new here and looking for some guidance. I’m developing a character and want to make sure their experiences feel realistic.Their mother was physically and mentally abusive from early childhood into adulthood, resenting them and blaming them for her struggles. She originally didn’t want children, but the father “forced” her to have them. She felt her career, friends, personal life, and body were taken from her.Their father left for a younger woman.The mother later was hospitalized for psychiatric reasons and struggles with substance abuse, severe depression, and bipolar disorder.The character had to take care of both themselves and their mother, working part-time jobs from a young age.Despite all this, outside influences (friends, coworkers) helped them maintain some stability, including decent grades.(A small side note; the character has amazing mental resilience)I’m trying to understand how the abuse and overwhelming responsibility from such a young age might realistically affect their personality, behaviors, coping mechanisms, and relationships as they grow up. Any psychological insights, examples, or advice would be greatly appreciated!Thanks in advance.Edit / Additional context: I forgot to mention—this character is 27 in his real world and has already been in therapy for about three years. I’d love to hear how much progress someone with his kind of background might realistically have made in that time, and what changes (or lingering struggles) would show up in his personality and relationships.",

It must be an issue with my query letter wah wah wah....\"However...I recently finished a draft of a novel I was actually quite proud of and decided that, fuck it, I might as well see what this 'querying' business is all about. So I followed the advice of the sub, made a list of suitable candidates, queried 80-odd agents over the course of a few weeks in late July, double-checked my materials to make sure I wasn't sending out garbage and, although I realise it's far too early to make any sweeping judgments about whether it worked or not, all I have received are form rejections.Now, I work professionally in academia at a top-rank university, meaning that I thought I was used to rejection.Reader, I am not.Rarely have I felt anything more demoralising than receiving my first six form rejections on something I put literally hundreds, maybe thousands of hours into. My ego is crushed, my resolve ruined and my admiration for the other people in this sub at an all time high.All that is to say: I'm sorry. If I feel like this after only six negative responses, I cannot imagine how many of you feel after literal years and multiple books worth of querying.
