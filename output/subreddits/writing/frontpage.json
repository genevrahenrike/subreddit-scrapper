        "content": "Samples of writing, whether for critique, self-promotion, or general sharing, may only be posted in the weekly self-promotion and critique thread. Requests for writing partners may also only be posted in the critique thread. Requests for school help should be posted in , including posts about school essays or citations. We do not allow advertisements for your book, website, new subreddit, etc., or for you to do so on behalf of another company, outside of the self-promotion thread. This includes both posts and comments. We ask that users frame their posts so they are useful to multiple people. If your post invites answers that are specific to your work alone, it belongs in our brainstorming thread. ‚ÄúLow effort‚Äù posts (two lines of text, repetitive questions, etc.) will be removed. Posts focused on personal sharing may only be posted in the general discussion thread. Calls for submissions (including posts about general writing work) must include 1) payment information; 2) submission deadlines; 3) rights requested; 4) any other relevant information. Directing to a website to answer these questions is not allowed. Please limit yourself to one post per publishing cycle. AMAs may not be posted without mod approval. We prefer subjects be part of the wider writing industry or have done something more than publish a book. Please message modmail for AMA requests. Treat other people with decency and respect. We encourage healthy debate and discussion, but we will remove antagonistic, caustic, or otherwise belligerent posts. We moderate on tone rather than language. Racist, homophobic/transphobic, misogynistic, ableist, and other categories of hate speech (including against ‚Äúacceptable targets‚Äù) will be removed. Please report any instances of offensive talk, and the mods will deal with them. Internet vigilantism and doxxing will not be tolerated. The forum is a place where we all come together to celebrate what we do: write. We will remove posts: berating other people for their genre/subject/literary taste; adherence or non-adherence to rules; calling people morons for giving a particular sort of advice; insisting that their opinion is the only one worth having; being antagonistic towards particular types of books or audiences; or implying that a particular work is for ‚Äúidiots‚Äù, or ‚Äúsnobs‚Äù, etc."

I gave about 5 people hard copies for free. My parents didn't read it, none of my friends, not even my partner read it. I get it, they're not readers, but come on!This is my rant.

No one‚Äôs bought the book, which is completely fine and that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm sad. I didn‚Äôt expect anyone to buy my book because no one knows who I am. It was more the entire process of learning how to publish, learning that getting traditionally published is as impossible as winning the lottery, so pivoting to self-publishing. I wanted to self-publish anyways so I could keep my creative freedom.But learning about how to do it, learning where to get covers and how to market and what sells and what to do and not to do‚Ä¶ making a KDP account and learning about all the shitty things Amazon does its authors and wondering if I just shouldn‚Äôt sell on there even though they hold like 90% of the book market‚Ä¶ All these different things I had to learn along the way seemed fine because I was also still writing my book, and that‚Äôs the part I like.But then I finished it, and published it, and I was happy for about two seconds. And now I feel‚Ä¶ utterly trapped. Like now I‚Äôm stuck on this hamster wheel where in order to gain traction I HAVE to write. And I have to write shit I don‚Äôt care about. I know that‚Äôs not true because the book I just published wasn‚Äôt even to market because I don‚Äôt care about that. I just feel like I entered myself into the capitalist rat race and it‚Äôs making me literally depressed. I want to take my book down off Amazon. I want to delete my KDP account. I want to go back to putting my work up on free forums and get comments from random internet strangers about how much my work means to them.But I don‚Äôt know if I should listen to this voice or if I‚Äôm just scared because this is something new, and I should just give it more time. In truth, I kind of have no other skills and am partially disabled, so if I COULD make money from my work, that would be awesome. But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth the expense of my mental health since I feel like I sold out or something. I hated every aspect of publishing my book. I hated learning about KDP. I hated learning about publishing. I hated the process of finding an artist and getting a cover. And I hate that, because I wrote the first book in a series because I had such plans for this world, that now I feel financially compelled to write book two because having only one book doesn‚Äôt sell. I hate that I think about writing capitalistically now.How the hell do I balance my love and passion for the craft of writing with the gross marketing aspects? Or do I just‚Ä¶ quit?",

Yes, i published my first draft. But this novel was more of an experiment, at that time, i was writing a novel since like 2017, and i just wanted to see if i could use my writing skill to write something different, so i churned out this novel in a month and self-published it, i, of course ,did not expect anyone to actually buy it or even read it but low and behold‚Ä¶ one day i get a notification that someone reviewed my work, a complete stranger and she gave me THREE stars! Those three stars were life changing and till this day, it‚Äôs the only reason why i still have that dream of becoming an author (sprinkled with a little of bit delusion), the way i see it is, if i can receive three stars from a book that i didn‚Äôt really put effort in, i could maybe write a good book if i DO put effort in.Also, i made $0.05 üíÄ",

Strangely enough, I found it randomly on a 5 year oldr/tipofmytonguepost while checking out the sub. To summarize briefly, its when writers use words in fantasy settings that have an origin or etymology deeply specific to earth and our cultures, even if they don't exist in the setting in question. The post in TOMT uses french fries as an example, as using the word in a fantasy setting implies that France (or Belgium) exists in universe. I've seen many instances of this in the fantasy books I read as well, even by authors I'm fond of. Usually its more of a passing thought for me but some times I feel like it can really take you out of the story. I don't think, however, that it's something you can necessarily avoid though without ripping half the pages out of you personal dictionary. So my question is where do you feel like the line is drawn in breaking immersion?",

Heck, it doesn't even need to be a complete coherent story with proper 3 act structure--great if it is--but it doesn't need to be.You can focus on three engaging scenes from a bigger story in your head.The point is, write something of the 6000-7500 range length, then get yourself agreat developmental editor.

Dad‚Äôs not happy.The story stats with him (her father) being murdered and how the police think here shifter boyfriend (and her) did it. The original idea was to have the main story centred around the murder and have their love story mostly hinted at in backflashes. Now, when I‚Äôm ‚Äúediting‚Äù it I have had second thoughts and started dividing the book into one pre-murder part and a post-murder part, putting more focus on them building their love story and putting mor effort on how Dad and the ‚Äúcult‚Äù not being in to that. Sort of building up to the murder, and ALSO putting more effort on hinting in the pre- story on who‚Äôs the real murderer (and why).I am now feeling that I (knowing my self) are doing way too much, just writing and writing and writing until its just a mesh of happenings. No storyline, no focus.I understand it is hard to give advice when you have not read it but I‚Äôm just seeking some one else‚Äôs thoughts about it. I want to include so much, worldbuilding, religion, the wolf packs, love, the girl‚Äôs parents and their hidden past that affects her in a way she could not have anticipated (small spoiler: her mother is not human, and so is she). It‚Äôs all just an web of thoughts and ideas in my head and I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm letting it go out of hand, just building, and writing and‚Ä¶I think maby I will write it out as it is now and ask someone to read it and se what they think.

I don‚Äôt want to share too many details, but this ‚Äúfallen power‚Äù becomes the backbone of the world-building and main arc.

It seems when I'm watching movies/shows especially, there'll often be scenes or moments that aren't necessarily there to push the story along or set up moments later on, and can often seem random.A character will trip on something while walking that doesn't turn out to be an important object, and doesn't set up someone randomly finding or stumbling onto something important at a different time, or something like that, maybe a character gets a paper cut at work or loses a bet or something. The weirder the director, the weirder these can be, off the top of my head I just came up with a few random benign examples. And I suppose at a certain level of weirdness/uniqueness they are pretty important for tone setting.I understand these things do a good job at making the world of the story feel more 'real', I'm not saying theyre unnecessary or that I don't enjoy watching them - rather that I see them everywhere and was wondering if it's an actual conscious technique writers use to flesh out their worlds/stories and ground them, or if I'm just hallucinating them. I suppose I tend to be the type of person where if I'm interested in something I'll read/watch it through to the end and don't mind if stuff is extraneous, but I can imagine wider audiences won't tolerate too much of stuff that's downright unnecessary, because it constitutes a greater time investment and commitment of effort on their part than may have been required from the writer to have asked for.",

So I followed the advice of the sub, made a list of suitable candidates, queried 80-odd agents over the course of a few weeks in late July, double-checked my materials to make sure I wasn't sending out garbage and, although I realise it's far too early to make any sweeping judgments about whether it worked or not, all I have received are form rejections.Now, I work professionally in academia at a top-rank university, meaning that I thought I was used to rejection.Reader, I am not.Rarely have I felt anything more demoralising than receiving my first six form rejections on something I put literally hundreds, maybe thousands of hours into. My ego is crushed, my resolve ruined and my admiration for the other people in this sub at an all time high.All that is to say: I'm sorry. If I feel like this after only six negative responses, I cannot imagine how many of you feel after literal years and multiple books worth of querying.

Since MC is a distant relative of the royal family + he's thought to be the reincarnation of the first king of the country, he has a solid claim to the throne especially considering he defeated the antagonist. He wants the throne because he's aware of the second antagonist's existence, realized how dangerous they are to his people and thinks \"only I can protect my people against this\". The second antagonist also had bad blood with MC's alleged previous life, so it has a nice element of \"I must become King again, defeat them and seal the cycle\". Book ends with him deciding to rest for a bit before he leaves for the capital.Part 2: MC's journey from his Clan's lands back to the capital. He has to pass through the lands of every other noble Clan to go speak to them and say \"hey btw my intention is to sit on that throne and I need you to support this\". There are five noble Clans, so it's more like five small plotlines that follow one another, with some travelling bits in-between Clans. He also meets some of the dying gods of his country (who all knew the first king personally) to receive their blessing. MC is declared King at the end, but asks to postpone the coronation until after he has \"taken care\" of the second antagonist.Part 3: MC, MC's boyfriend and MC's daughter cross the sea and speak to a dude who used to be an avatar of the second antagonist, but broke free of their control. MC goes through a bunch of trials and ends up confronting the three remaining avatars, then the second antagonist. He goed home to be crowned king and proposes to his boyfriend, the end.Just from the summaries, I think you can see how part 2 would be a strong contender for \"worst case of middle book syndrome ever seen by mankind\" because the stakes are so low compared to part 1 and 3. I think it could work better as a set of novellas published as a smaller book. Are there any series where the author has done that sort of thing and it worked? I know the Witcher was novellas first, then books, but that's it.",

      "content_preview": "My passion project is...done? Now what?Once upon a time I was a young adult, doing my masters in a completely unrelated field, and had a daydream about a book. I obsessively wrote between studying and work, finished the book and never went back to it. 7 years later, I decided to unearth the project and merge it all together as I had written it on different devices and even filled a notebook with the middle chapters.Anyways, I just finished merging it and doing some minor editing. Of course I'm biased, but I like the story. It's totally something a younger me would have read in one weekend and maybe even some of the sage wisdom in it would have prevented a bad relationship or two. Anyways, now I'm asking myself...now what? I have always been a \"secret writer\". I was the kid that stayed up late, pen in one hand, flashlight in the other, never to reveal my works to a single soul. Even my spouse doesn't know that I wrote this entire book. But now I can't help but think what if? What if I get it published? What if it gets made into a TV series? What if I get a deal and they want a sequel? It has potential to be a series. What if I am actually really good at this author thing and others want to read my work? Or what if it's complete garbage and I should be embarrassed to even dream such dreams?But I know nothing of the actual publishing world beyond what I've read about on reddit and some Google searches. I don't know where to go from here. So, advice? Reality check?For those that have gotten this far, thank you. For added info, I would say that the genre would be YA. It's a coming of age story about a girl navigating life and relationships and finding herself in the process. It's a bit of a rollercoaster ride in terms of ups and downs, as life is. It's currently 73k words.Ramble complete.",

      "content_preview": "Hello guys!!So I had an idea for a fanfiction (Wild West genre) that I‚Äôm currently drafting that includes my original characters (the plot is already fully fleshed out) that I‚Äôve done myself. However, I‚Äôm wondering about these following questions:What do you wish people would lean more heavily into / do more of when establishing a Wild West setting?Conversely, what do you wish people would do less off especially in a Wild West setting?Are there any tropes / pitfalls / cliches that commonly appear in these types of media? If so, what are some creative ways of subverting / avoiding these entirely?In general, what works for you and what clicks when it comes to a well-written Wild West setting?Thank you!",

      "content_preview": "I'm sure I'll get downvoted straight to hell for this, but whatever, let's stir the pot.We've all heard the \"rules\": The Hero's Journey, Save the Cat, the three-act structure, the five-act structure, Pixar's 22 Rules, etc. The protagonist needs to have a fatal flaw, and the story is ultimately about them confronting that fatal flaw and choosing whether they're going to grow by overcoming it and changing as a person, or whether they'll opt not to change, and fail as a result.These are good rules in general, but I feel like they also don't work for a lot of people, and those people will be told to adapt to them or quit writing, like you can't possibly write a worthwhile story unless you follow these guidelines.But what if that's not true?Here are the eight bestselling fiction books of all time:A Tale of Two CitiesThe Little PrinceThe AlchemistHarry Potter and the Philosopher's StoneAnd Then There Were NoneDream of the Red ChamberThe HobbitAlice's Adventures in WonderlandEditors and writing coaches might approve of some of these ... but I think they'd have a fit if you presented them with the others.TakePhilosopher's Stone, for example.The plot is that Harry needs to keep the Philosopher's stone out of Voldemort's hands. Except Harry doesn't even know that Voldemort is alive until 64,000 words into the book, and he takes almost as long to learn that the Stone exists. Basically, you've read an entire short novel before the plot even starts.How aboutAlice's Adventures in Wonderland? You might think it's about Alice trying to get home--except that she never once expresses any desire to go home whatsoever. The closest she ever gets is when she remarks that home was \"much pleasanter\". ButAlice never oncetriesto get home. When she does end up back home, it happens completely by accident, while she's in the midst of doing something else entirely.The Alchemisthas a goal: treasure.But ultimately, the story isn't about the treasure--it's about what happens to Santiago along the way, the places where he stops, the people that he meets, how he grows as a person. The treasure is just a pretext for getting him there.The Little Princeis similar.The narrator crashes his plane in the desert. He meets a boy, who later disappears, and then the narrator fixes his plane and flies away. From the narrator's perspective, the vast bulk of the story is completely irrelevant to his goal. From the Little Prince's perspective, he wants to explore, then when he's done exploring, he wants to go home. We're not even clear on whether he makes it home. Ultimately, the story is a series of parables, and a pretext for the characters to share them with one another.Dream of the Red Chamberis an absolutely epic work, with nearly 40 main characters. While there are themes tying it all together, there's no one plot, no one central character with a single goal, a single challenge to overcome.That's five of the eight bestselling fiction books of all time, where the plot (if it exists at all) is minimal, delayed, or just an afterthought.And this isn't just true of the classics. If you look at fanfiction, you'll see the same pattern. Absolutely, there are epic stories full of adventure and love and betrayal. But you'll also see thousands of kudos for a story where two characters bake a cake together. It's called \"fluff\", and it's actually a pretty popular genre.Yes, you absolutely can write a story where your main character has a fatal flaw that they need to overcome at the bottom of Act Two, or they'll fail in their quest. But don't let a writing coach tell you that this is theonlyway. It's ok if your character is a bratty know-it-all, and she remains a bratty know-it-all through the entire book. It's ok if your character's greatest concern in a scene is surviving a class period with a mean teacher.If the readers are invested in your characters, they'll follow them anywhere--even if all they're doing is baking a cake.",

      "content_preview": "EDIT: I‚Äôve been reading your responses. As a writer, there is a poverty of words in me; I don‚Äôt have enough to express my gratitude for your thoughts and kindness. Thank you.I‚Äôm sharing my story to vent, to get perspective and feedback, and in case it‚Äôs useful to anyone else.In 2019, I was a 24-year old full-time marketer. I'd spend my days fiddling with platforms to increase percentages of performance and do content audit reports and all these things I felt were pointless because none of these activities created any beauty, helped humanity in any way, or even fed my soul.In 2020, I decided to pursue writing. I'd give it 4-5 years, I said to myself. \"I could always go back to marketing.\" And I figured that was enough time to pursue my dreams. So if I failed, then at least I tried, right? Anyway, my real \"passion\" was filmmaking, but that required capital I didn't have. So I wrote. 2 months later, I got my first and main writing client, and I'd be with this client for over 4 years.In that span of 4 years, I managed to learn how to become a professional-level writer. I won some modest national literary awards. I got accepted into prestigious writing fellowships. My first novel came out to modest success. I've reached the point where my small town knew me as an author, after having my work featured in a few news outlets. I even earned enough as a writer to self-produce and direct my first short film! (It premiered at a festival in San Diego, CA - and no, I'm not based in the US).In 2024, four major things happened:I self-produced and directed my second short film, which was more ambitious and much, much more expensive. Unexpected costs came up, and I ended up going into debt to cover the final 1/9 of the total budget.My long-term relationship ended, followed by the death of a close family member.I lost my job/client, as the client decided to pivot and no longer needed me.I became a full-time author/artist earning purely from newsletter subscriptions, blogging income, and the occasional sales of my products (book, course, toolkit).At this point, my monthly debt payments are higher than the average pay in the big city. This debt is an accumulation of various things, including loans I took to cover health and logistics-related needs for my family (mother, father, siblings, etc.; I‚Äôm unmarried with no kids). A close family member died of cancer; before she passed, she was hospitalized and the bills were high. I helped pay using loans because I come from a poverty-line family. The year before that, in 2023, my younger brother needed life-or-death surgery, which I also went into debt to help cover. Then there‚Äôs the relatively ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù debt from my second short film, which has remained unfinished and unsubmitted for a year because the final product was unsatisfactory. To fix it, I need major editing resources (time and money) I don‚Äôt have.Despite everything, I managed to keep paying my monthly debts. My earnings were highly unstable, but they were just enough to cover both debts and living expenses.Until now.By September, a year after becoming a full-time author/artist, I expect to earn just enough to pay rent and get through the month on the most frugal terms. There will be nothing left for debt payments.I intend to write to my lenders to explain my situation. They‚Äôre legitimate financial institutions, but they‚Äôre known for aggressive collection practices and relatively high interest. I couldn‚Äôt borrow from major banks; they wouldn‚Äôt lend to a ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù like me. I‚Äôll ask for restructuring, lower interest, and similar relief, and hope for the best.Yesterday, I had a job interview at a company referred by a friend. It‚Äôs a strategist-type role at a marketing agency that would cover my monthly debts and modest living expenses, with a very small amount left for savings. The interviewers liked my profile and my test, and they said they wanted to hire me. Nothing is final, and something could still go wrong, but I feel good about my chances based on that interview.In preparing for the job, I was already having a personal crisis. I put it aside to focus on the company‚Äôs test and on the interview. I focused on getting the job first. Now that it feels semi-secured, I‚Äôm letting myself face the personal crisis, which is part of why I‚Äôm writing this.In 2024, the lack of a safety net and unstable income pushed me into survival mode. After a year that felt like a long, extended war, I‚Äôm tired. Yet my best option is to start a new job that reminds me of the soul-killing things I left in 2019. While preparing, I researched marketing platforms, and as I looked at these tools I felt again the pointlessness of it all‚Äîhow inconsequential this life of a marketer can feel, helping businesses get more business. Yes, it‚Äôs basically for the money. I know. I also know I‚Äôm still blessed that I got to pursue my art at all, despite my poverty-level background.I'm tired.Tired of a year that felt like pure survival and still ended in defeat.Tired that my second short film was so expensive and that it failed because I made mistakes as a director.Tired that I failed to become a sustainably full-time author/artist.Tired of the unfairness of watching these authors from upper or upper-middle-class backgrounds get all the attention and big deals, without family debts to pay, traipsing around New York, posting ‚Äúmy life as an author,‚Äù doing whatever they want, and not having to do the content grind people like me go through just to survive as a creator.I would love to say that if I were at least middle class and only had to pay for myself, I could surpass whatever they‚Äôre doing.It annoys me, those cutesy authorly posts about impostor syndrome. This is my bias, yes, but my objective brain also agrees: I‚Äôve never had impostor syndrome, because I know my literary work is just as good, if not better, than what many popular young authors are putting out. Their subject matter often speaks to middle- to upper-middle-class white women, which is what most readers consume in this market right now, and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre getting all the hype and awards.I suppose I'm writing this now to come to terms with my defeat. I failed.My 2019 self thought I'd give this \"pursue your dreams\" a try for 4-5 years. I did it for 6, and I failed. Now, time to get back to marketing.One thing my 2019 self didn't realize is how hard it is to go back to marketing after having tried living as an artist. It just felt so right. This is what I was born to do. This is how I'm supposed to live. This is what makes me truly and genuinely happy.But I failed.I will still continue writing. I have a novel in progress.I write this to help me accept the idea that this is my life, at least for now and maybe the next year or two.I'm tired and I just want to take 2 or 3 months off. Take a proper break, which I haven't had in years. Travel, because I haven't left the country for 6 years. Do some focused writing on my novel. Just live life.But I have to work (and that's assuming I actually get this job). I have to work marketing so I could afford my payables. It feels like such a waste of a blessed life. Spending a year or two of my life doing this crap just so I won't be hounded by lenders. But I don't suppose there's a real alternative, is there? I considered just running away from them but I have to be easily found online to succeed as a literary artist.I just turned thirty this month.",
