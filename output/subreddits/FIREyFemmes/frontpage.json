      "content_preview": "Hi all - 36F American who is better at saving than tax optimization by far. (I am aware I am very lucky and happy to share more about my path...) Current income: 150k + unvested equity of ??? value in an early stage startup Assets (approx) $1m brokerage $400k 401k/IRA $250k cash/HYSA/treasury $200k crypto no real estate Rent/utils are around $2k/month; I spend $3k/month on credit cards. VHCOL city in the US. No kids, no debt, my biggest recurring expenses are all discretionary, like pilates & fancy skincare Decent health, but some chronic conditions motivating me to pull back Total NW @ 1.8m with about $60k/yr spend seems fine at a reasonable SWR, especially if my future includes some work also. Why I want to FIRE: I'm ready to start a second career in the arts and otherwise just be one of those people who fosters kittens and makes signs and noodle casseroles for political rallies 24/7. I am not attached to staying in the US and have looked at ExpatFIRE also. My plan: I do like my job, but I would love to actively plan to never have another one in ~2 yrs or when a natural break arrives, whether or not the startup does well. I feel burned out, like this is the last run of tech I've got in me. Agism for women it tech is real af, though, so I know this is a one-way door, the job market is trash, and my wishlist is of course infinite. So walking way means accepting I am no longer working for that set of lifestyle goals, e.g. a house. Social complications: my boyfriend of ~1 yr (serious but definitely not married yet), is already FIRE'd with a much higher net worth but also higher lifestyle expectations, and sees me quitting work shaped more like being supported by him, even thought I was planning it before we met...  I think it makes him nervous. I also suspect I could seriously titrate my spending down a lot by having less-rich friends and partner -- I regularly pay for nicer date nights, dinners, trips than I would otherwise. I don't plan to have kids on my own, but would with my partner; financial inequality w/ partner does make me nervous. Family advice is also that I should stay in the career as well, something like \"women need their own sources of money\"... but don't I have one? Like... in terms of backup plans, I'm more than fine, right? I am among the luckiest in the world, so how could I not be? Thanks for your time & attention <3",

I got truly everything I wanted: the top of the asked-for salary range, the higher position, and the start date I was hoping for (5 weeks away)! It’s a 16.5% salary increase with 4% 401k match increase. All other benefits are pretty much the same. I’m now trying to decide if I think 5 days/week in office is going to ruin my life, but ultimately leaning towards taking it. Question for y’all: I’ve never put in a notice/quit before. I told new company I would come to a decision and sign by Wednesday next week. Do I talk to current company before signing and give essentially a 4-week notice? Or just sign and wait until 2weeks out for the notice? I am doubtful my current company will counter the offer but it’s possible. I’ve never done any of this before so any advice is appreciated!",

However I remember reading post on here back in December asking a relatively similar question about what to do if the President fires Powell.

I am weary of the impact this will have on inflation and the strength of the dollar. In an article by Chris Giles published in the Financial Times yesterday, he said of the situation involving Cook and the Fed, “There is every reason to fear for the survival of a key pillar of US and global economic stability.” I’m not looking for advice but would love to open a discussion about what this means for investing strategy.

I have had a tacit fear of aging ever since I graduated college, and now that I’m in my late 20s, I’m really starting to feel the pressure of departing my “prime years”. Before anyone gets mad, I am not saying that life ends after you turn 30 - in fact, I believe what many women say that life actually gets better after 30 because you have more money, more stability, and overall more confidence in who you are. However, even though I intellectually understand this, emotionally, I still worry about losing access to the social currency of beauty that we are so conditioned to cling onto. I fear wrinkles, metabolism slowdown, and even just things like getting back and knee pain when I never used to experience such things! At the same time, I am in the boring middle of my FIRE journey and feeling unfulfilled and stuck in my current job but unable to quit or pivot because I need to make money to retire faster. This leads me to constantly fantasize every day about time moving faster so that I can hit my investment numbers quicker and get to an early retirement. I’m looking at my net worth weekly, if not daily, and it’s starting to feel just unproductive because honestly nothing is going to change materially for me until I hit my coastFIRE number in a few years. When you combine these two factors, I feel like I am so mentally split, where I simultaneously cannot wait to get older and wake up the day I become a millionaire in my mid 30s, but at the same time, then I’d wish I were in my 20s again. Does anyone else feel this way? I think there’s probably something in here about living more in the moment and not trying to have it all, but I’m really just confusing myself right now. I don’t want to spend the last few years of my 20s, staring at my investments, willing them to go up faster, but I also don’t know how to snap out of it.",

Salary $220k, down payment $500k, registered savings $400k. I can get: (a) a detached home with a basement suite that matches my lifestyle and hobbies  for $1.5-1.6m ; (b)  a townhouse for $1m-$1.2m; or (c) a two bedroom condo for $750-$900,000. Obviously, I want the house lol. The rental suite would bring in an extra $2k/month, but the mortgage is still $6k/month and that’s a lot. I don’t really want to live in a condo again, and I don’t think the value will appreciate.  The townhomes here generally don’t have suites, and don’t have backyards. The mortgage would be $4k. I am hopeful that I won’t be single forever, but I’m planning on it from a financial POV. No kids and I don’t want any. What do you think? ETA: I have done the house / yard maintenance stuff before, and generally enjoy it. I love hosting dinner parties and guests.  I haven’t been a landlord before.",

      "content_preview": "I didn't do good career or money moves in my 20s, and recently left a job where I was severely underpaid and not treated well ($20/hr). I've been living with my parents and have approx. $18k across my 401k and taxable brokerage accounts. Currently am living on savings, have about 5-6 months of runway left. If I do go broke, I at least know I'll have a roof over my head and food in my stomach. I'm scared about the current economy due to tariffs and the administration's actions. I've been transitioning from GIS to software engineering and I fear not being able to land a job because the job market worsening. I don't want to wait until I'm 36+ to catch up. If I have a job but the stock market is stagnating, I know my savings will be rewarded handsomely when the market booms again. I also need to move out of Texas due to it becoming increasingly hostile, and the friendlier states tend to be HCOL. I don't have any kids, and when I played around with the FIRE calculators, they generally predicted saving 20%+ could get me to FI by my early to mid 50s. But as a tech worker and a woman, I fear ageism derailing that dream. Ie being laid off in my 40s or 50s and not being able to find the same work. I have a vague idea of transitioning to the public sector in my 50s to allow me to coast at the end. My general understanding about avoiding ageism would involve staying up on new technologies, having a network of people who know my worth, being open when people have different ideas than me, staying healthy, and confidence. I thankfully have learned how to be disciplined and cut back a lot of my spending a few years ago. I have no debt - except for the credit card I pay off monthly. I don't smoke, and I've been sober for 5 months. I have no children and plan on staying that way. I'm single, but I probably will end up marrying another woman - I know the DINK lifestyle makes saving for retirement much easier. I'm certain there's women like me who've been in my shoes and did succeed in reaching FIRE. I hope the world will continue to allow this path to be achievable.",

      "content_preview": "Hi Firey Femmes! Long time reader first time poster. Let’s get into it: I was reached out to by a 3rd party recruiter for a position at a large company in my area. It would be a similar job with an upgrade in title that I’d reach in 1-1.5 years at my current company. The salary range is 5%-22% more than what I make now, but I have the absolute minimum desired years of experience, so I asked for the mid range (11-16% more). If I stay at my company, I’d get exactly 20% with a promotion. The recruiter passed my resume along and the company said they like me but aren’t sure about my years of experience (🙄) and asked if I would be open to a lower position (🙄) which is a complete lateral move, for that same salary band. My response was that I am not interested in that at this time, but if they want to still interview me to make a decision about the original position I would do it. That was a few weeks ago and now I have my final interview tomorrow. I received a benefits overview from the recruiter and benefits are fairly comparable, but the biggest difference is 401k match. It’s 4% more than my current employer. I’m 25 and I feel like that much more could get me to FIRE so much faster. Based on the tone of the interviews, I fear they’re going to do the final interview and still offer me the lower position (🙄). However, doing the math, it might be worth it to jump ship for the retirement advantage alone. It’s comparable job functions, comparable cultures, and gets me to FIRE faster. The other difference is i would be going from hybrid to 5 days/week in office 😬 So I want to hear from you: Is a 10-15% bump enough to jump ship for the same title? is going from 3days/week in office to 5 going to ruin my life? any advice on this in general?",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, just looking for some sanity checks here. I posted in the FIRE forum and a kind person (@ thegirlisok )directed me to this forum. My husband and I, early 50s, are so close to being done—maybe a year out. We're sitting on about a $4.2M net worth, no debt, and our house is basically paid off. Our plan is to spend it down to zero and pass on what's left to family/charity, with a safe withdrawal rate of under 4%. My career has been focused on getting one specific, highly-coveted title. It's a \"nice to have\" because it'd open up some cool consulting or board positions down the line if I ever wanted them. I look at achieving title as another \"goal achieved\" similar to a FIRE goal, it is merely icing on the cake. We're not moving the goal post. My boss just got promoted, and now I'm basically playing a waiting game. Scenario A: I get promoted and get the expanded role. Cool, I stay for another year as planned. Scenario B: They hire a new person to fill my boss's shoes. In this case... why on earth would I stick around? My husband is completely on board with whatever I decide. My gut says to just walk away if they don't promote me. I've done some of the best work of my life in the past two years, and the thought of having to start over and prove myself to a new boss is exhausting. I’d be working to make them look good while my own dreams are so close to being a reality. I guess I'm worried I'm being short-sighted. Is there another way to look at this? What would you do in my shoes? Any and all thoughts are appreciated! Thanks!! Edit : - In the FIRE forum, we're being called fake. We're real, fortunately and unfortunately. - We're well-travelled, been to 50+ countries. RE plan is slow travel, both of us want to read a lot of books, and eventually write books. Then open to possibilities that life offers.",

      "content_preview": "Hello ladies, Coming to you for some perspectives.  Due to a series of very lucky events, my husband and I  (both 35) hit FI (15m+ nw, mix of equity in s&p 500 and real estate). I feel very proud of having my current job but thinking that maybe I would want to/need to retire in a few years… but also have a very complex mix of emotions about it.  How did it go for you that have pulled the trigger? We have a 1 year old baby and going to try for a second soon. I’ve been doing research as to what would make the most sense for our family in terms of whether both parents should continue to work or have me stay at home to spend more time with the kids. I grew up with working parents that were not very present emotionally because they were too busy. So I want to be a more involved parent for my kids when they need me more. On the other hand, I believe I learned values of hard work, education, and financial independence from seeing my mom be a boss lady at her job. Right now, I work as a lawyer in a very prestigious but niche position, and I really love my job. I also had an ivy league education that I worked really hard to achieve. So the thought of giving this up- the sense of worth tied to prestige- to be “just a mom” feels daunting… I put that in quotation marks because I’ve learned that being a sahm was actually way harder for me than working, but the society as a whole doesn’t value being a mom in the same way, starting with myself that has this ingrained in me unfortunately. Once I leave this job, re-entry would be very difficult and likely would involve more hours at a firm or a company. I also would want to hire help for chores and a part time nanny because I realized from maternity leave that I hated chores. But then I fear judgement from my own family and friends for being “lazy” at home because I would have help. When I floated this idea, this was the initial reaction I got from my family. And all my friends are hardworking women that have also been conditioned to look down on being sahm, especially the wealthy ones that let hired help do all the hard part while she gets her nails done and do pilates. Let me be real, I will probably also go work out, get my facial, etc. lol. Right now, I can easily justify doing all that because I also work. For now, I want to stay at my job since we have a great nanny and maybe go part time once we have more kids. But the downside of my current job is that it’s not very flexible for us because there’s no regular teleworking available and there’s a bunch of limitations on vacation. So eventually, I feel like I need to leave this job. I am wondering if anyone else also felt this mix of emotions and yet still decided to retire to be a parent at home. Or maybe you ultimately decided to continue working. What was that like? What helped with the transition? Anything I need to seriously consider before deciding to leave the workforce? Any advice is appreciated.",

      "content_preview": "I have no idea if this is a common experience or not. I'm in my 40s, and pulled the trigger on FIRE (at least, for now) to spend more time with my son. I'm a single mom, and I comfortably cleared my FI target number a few years ago. I'm really lucky, and not worried about finances. I know that a lot of people face the question of how to discuss this without disclosing a lot of financial details. When people ask generic questions (\"What do you do?\") in social settings, I have some vague stories about freelancing and consulting (which are technically true, because I have done a small amount of this work, even if it isn't a major source of income). The problem is some close family, specifically my father, whom I have not told. He still thinks I'm working full-time, though eventually he is bound to learn otherwise. He's not familiar with the details of my finances, but has made it clear on multiple occasions that he thinks it is reckless and irresponsible for me to do anything besides work full-time. I think this is partly a personality quirk. He is someone who will always play out the worst-case scenario in his mind (\"What if they repeal the ACA, you develop a pre-existing condition, you can't find any job with health insurance, and you go bankrupt?\"). I think he also tends to equate hard work with personal virtue. Do you have any close family like this? How do you handle them? I will add that my father is smart enough to see through vague stories about consulting. He would surely follow-up with a dozen questions about employer-sponsored health insurance and job security. I already have reduced communication with him over this issue (he lives out of state), but it is not my desire to cut him off. While this has strained our relationship, I do genuinely care about him, and he's getting older.",

Encouragement and advice are welcome. Circumstances: - 42 years old, did not understand investing until this past year - $20k in Roth-IRA with Schwab, split between SCHG, VTI, and SWPPX. Considering moving some funds over to SFNNX. - Have a job I don't enjoy that brings in $5-6k net (am in healthcare, hours vary based on census ). UPDATE: Job does not offer a 401K match. - $112k in student debt at 7%, $15k in debt from family loan at no interest (loaned to help lower principal of student debt) Plan: - Moved back in with family with an intention to limit all social life for at least the next year while I get myself in order. I don't yet know what my monthly expenses will be, but my hope is to keep them within $1500 (figuring out transportation to work is the largest variable; I can take the bus some of the time, but not all the time due to timing of my job). - Aggressively pay off debt first (because at this interest rate, the debt is costing more than the market would guarantee). I have the possibility of switching to a different position that might allow me to kill debt in under 1.5 years - will know by year end. - Once debt is paid, aggressively invest and max out retirement funds. - Hope that I can keep my head down and handle 8 years of having a job that feels painful. But 8 years isn't that long in the scope of things. - Reassess finances and circumstances after 50 to see what needs to be done next. I would love to hear y'alls thoughts, what I can do better, and definitely any similar stories + how things turned out on your end.",

      "content_preview": "Hello all! This is my first post from a long time lurker. I’m 40/F/single with a 9 year old I am really struggling with not wanting to get another roommate after my last (horribly messy) one moved out. I’ve hit Coast FI this year. I’m on track to FIRE at 50 and really don’t want another roommate at 40 years old. I’ve done so in the past for financial reasons but once I had a child, it’s so much harder to find someone that wants to live we me and my child.  I interviewed about 10 women recently when I tried to rent out my spare room but they all ended up deciding they’d rather live elsewhere. My info: NW is $600k. $450k is liquid, the rest is equity in my home. Current pre-tax income is 70k; I save about 25k a year presently. My expenses average $3500/month. I’m just not sure how much closer that will get me to FI and whether it’s worth it or if that is a luxury I can now (sort of) afford after years of living in a tiny 1bed/1 bath apartment with my daughter (sharing a bed) and having a roommate once I bought a home of my own. My home is 1196 square feet. Was a 2 bed/2bath when I bought it. I had the office framed in to make an extra room to rent. The spare room is definitely on the smaller side so that also might be why I’m not having much luck getting a roommate. I previously rented for 700/mo but that appears to be a little high for the small room and my area presently. Our rental market has softened a bit with lots of new apartments being built near me. Can I afford to not have another roommate? I can probably realistically rent my spare room for approximately $600/month with the market now. I’m struggling to justify whether doing so will help me reach FI fast enough to outweigh the burden of sharing such a small space. Thanks in advance for your thoughts and let me know if I missed any important info.",

We have decided to do fully joint so we work as a unit to achieve our goals as a couple and I'm curious to see how others are set up. I make about twice what he makes, for reference. We are both good savers but I'm definitely the strategic money person in our relationship. What I'm thinking: -Each already has own savings/checking at separate banks with brick and mortar and a lot of ATMs. We would agree on amounts we would contribute to start our joint. The remainder would be individual emergency money not really to be used (more fuck you I'm leaving safety net for each of us that I don't intend to ever use). -joint 6 month emergency savings in HYSA in separate online bank, already in use. -we each already have our own Roth IRAs we max out annually, 401k IRA rollovers from prior employers, and brokerages in Fidelity. We would combine the brokerages and make them joint to save for long-term goals (car, house, etc) -We would open up new joint checking/savings from funds from our individual accounts, where our paychecks would be deposited to, all expenses paid through these accounts. We have decided on a dollar limit to check in for each other but all money and credit cards paid through here whether for individual or things we do as a couple (Lego, travel, concert tickets, household items, groceries, everything). Thinking Fidelity for our joint accounts since we would already be set up there but should we diversify to another bank? Any bank suggestions that would have checking and HYSA (so no Chase with 0.01% savings accounts, etc)",

      "content_preview": "Hi gals! I had created a post here asking for estate planning advice for childfree ladies. It was suggested multiple times that I speak to a local estate planning attorney and I thought I'd give my update. As I said on that post, I had already met with one that acted like a car salesmen. Something that prompted the consultation is that now I own real estate. The second consultation was not much better. It sounded like the attorney wanted get off the phone asap. I'm surprised the call even lasted 10 minutes. - Both attorneys kept pushing for a revocable trust. This is without asking for any additional information like for instance what do i do for work. A revocable trust does not offer protection against creditors, so I think that finding out if someone could be more prone to litigation is important. - The second attorney did not mention at all that the estate offers a transfer on death deed. When I asked about it he said it might still need to go through probate, after the call i did some research and found out its not true. There are some downsides like your beneficiary can't sell the place for a while until the estate its settled but this was not mentioned at all. The first attorney also said that even though I had beneficiaries on all my accounts (before owning real estate), my estate could still go through probate and the court could act against my wishes. After my research it seems to me I can juts do POD/TOD for the house and bank/investment accounts and a will to name an executor and for personal belongings. I did not expect these aggressive sales tactics & fear mongering from attorneys but here we are! As a side note- i also went with my mom to a estate planning workshop for seniors. Not once, did the attorney mention anything for Medicaid protection. He also recommended those revocable trusts even though they don't offer Medicaid protection for seniors. My advice is to do tons of research on your own before going to a estate planning attorney.  They will most likely try to sell you a cookie cutter plan without taking into account your circumstances and there might be cheaper/free options like POD/TOD that avoid probate if your have a simple estate.",

      "content_preview": "Hoping to get perspective from anyone who has left a job with 15+ years tenure. My husband and I are ready to FIRE. The only thing holding me back from leaving is this feeling of letting people down by leaving in the middle of a significant project where I am leading a key aspect. I'm burnt out and not feeling engaged. I have really enjoyed my time with this employer, but more recently I have felt a shift in the culture led by leadership that has become toxic. Bottom line, there is a lot of finger pointing, and I am struggling with wanting to stay when I feel like at the end they will find a way to put blame on me. I know I care too much. However, I don't want to leave on bad terms given my tenure and the relationships I have built. Also, I feel guilty about leaving my direct reports without any shield from the leaders. There are probably a handful of people I plan to keep in touch with after I leave. My questions: What would you tell people about why you are leaving? How much notice would you give? Would you instead stick it out until the end of the project (2026)?",

She got certified in mortgage origination a while back, and recently got certified in this specific type of loan. She describes it as \"using your bank account's resting balance and cashflow to reduce your balance quicker and pay your mortgage off in a few years rather than 30.\" Is this a scam??? It sounds too good to be true. I've never heard of one of these which is surprising, b/c I'm a divorce lawyer and clients/opposing parties on my cases are constantly buying/selling houses. I'm in contact with and get/read newsletters from mortgage brokers regularly. I feel like it would have come up at some point, if it were legit. My interest rate is in the 3's so it's not like I'm actively looking to refi. But I'm super curious.",

I have no motivation and spend hours pointlessly obsessing over money and doomscrolling. I've decided that I will stay in the US for another 12 months and save up an additional 150 000$ to reach my FIRE goal (see my previous post for context). In the meantime, I'm committed to creating a happy life. Nothing fancy, I will commit to the following healthy habits: - Limit caffeine intake to one cup of coffee a day - Limit screen time; delete social media -- replace this with reading - Keep my space tidy -- commit to 20 minutes of cleaning every day - Intentionally connect with someone once a week - Get back into boxing 3x/week - Get back into eating healthy (I will get lab work before and after as I'm prediabetic) - Get a financial planner (I have an appointment set up in 2 weeks) - Checking up on finances once a week (I tend to obsess rather than set goals and relax) I won't do this all at once, but stack up my habits. I'm using reddit sort of as an accountability tool and I'll probably check in here again. If anyone else is feeling bleh and is recommitting to something I'd love to hear about it!",
