      "content_preview": "Okay so, I’ve been talking to this guy for about a month now, and I really like him. I have asked him if he’s interested in dating at some point, because I’m not looking for anything casual. He said he likes me, but he couldn’t answer that question and that’s because we have nothing in common, and our lives are really different. But I really don’t think it matters? Because I’m interested in him, then obviously, I’m interested in his hobbies, and I’d like to know about his interests and participate in them. I think it’s important to show interest in your partners hobbies etc. and hear what they’re passionate about!But whenever I talk about my own interests and hobbies, he calls it boring, and even interrupts me to say negative comments about them… I don’t think he understands the concept of caring about the other persons interests, as he has asked me to watch a football match with him, but said “I know you’ll be bored as hell, but it’s an important match” and I was kinda shocked, because of course I wouldn’t be bored?? I’d be happy and enthusiastic, and I’d love to watch something he cares about! But he just doesn’t think the same way??So my question is, does it really matter? Of course it’s easier if you already share a hobby/interest, but I think if you’re genuinely interested in someone, it shouldn’t matter? Or am I being too optimistic?",

      "content_preview": "edit my wife is not a drinker and does not have a drinking problem, this was a one off party so rehab isn’t necessary here. she was laughing about it when I woke her because she’s hammered stillsecond edit, we’ve had a chat. She remembers everything and getting in the bath, states she wasn’t spiked, not assaulted, she hadn’t eaten all day and had drank too much Prosecco. She was very apologetic and understands how bad this could’ve been. I’ve messaged her friends whom were also very apologetic stating they’ll never leave her like this again. Thankyou!I work in the emergency services and do shifts. Today whilst I was working late whilst my Wife was going to a shop opening party with her friends and have some drinks etc.Whilst I’m at work dealing with some incidents I get a text from one of her friends stating she is the drunkest she’s ever been and in a bad way, but that her boyfriend has taken them both home. This is setting alarm bells off in my head and I had a terrible feeling something bad was going to happen.My shift finished and I raced home, I can see the bathroom light on from the driveway. I go in and she’s not downstairs and all other lights are off apart from the bathroom. I’m calling her name and there’s no response.  I get upstairs open the bathroom door and find her passed out, naked in the bath face down. I genuinely thought she’d drowned. Her phone was in the bottom of the bath and so was the bath tray. I was shouting and shaking her and luckily her nose and mouth weren’t in the water, she woke up and was completely incoherent laughing about it being funny. I helped her out of the bath and put her to bed trying to stress how bad this could have been.I’m feeling so many emotions and I don’t know how to approach this tomorrow, I’m angry her friends and family have allowed her to get like this, I’m angry she’s got like this herself, I’m grateful she hasn’t drowned when she probably should’ve. I feel so fucking angry but grateful at the same time, but literally everything could’ve changed in my life today. Please help me approach this as it needs to be approached with everyone involved, how can I do this?",

We moved in together soon a year ago, and I am a person who loves doing things for others and help as much as possible, which means if you need a water I will gladly get up from under my comfy blanket and go get it for you even if you’re right besides the kitchen. And I love doing this for him especially but at this point it has gone downhill, he expects me to do everything all the time even if I’m sick or literally been working all day, and I am on the edge and tired of it. I’ve directly asked him if he could do something and he says “ no I kinda expect you to do it since you’ve always done it. “ and I feel my stomach turn, he’s a guy who doesn’t like change. It had to be the way it always has, which means I always make food I can barely ask for help and I’ll expect a no cause he’s busy playing games online. I always make dinner alone, I clean the whole apartment and make sure everything is filled and here, make sure there’s soap so we can wash hands, make sure there’s food and we’re able to get dinner and such. I take care of plans and write them down, all he basically does is play games and expect to get everything he asks asked. I get up 30+ times a day just to get something only for him, even though he’s way closer and of course old enough and has 2 perfectly working legs. But how in the hell can I get through to him?? Tell him I’m getting sick and tired of doing everything, whenever I bring it up he feels attacked and nothing is changing if it was up to him. But I wanna feel like 2 people in this relationship not alone. So what can I do?? Without getting on his nerves, and hopefully not yelled at.From a tired female",

      "content_preview": "So I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for a couple months now. He's actually one of the sweetest guys I've been with, he plans surprises, he cooks for me, he massages my feet after I get back from runs, just a walking green flag. I feel really safe and cared for with him. It's been really refreshing, especially compared to some guys I've been with before. And I've had my fair share of experience, like well into double digits. He know, and it's never been an issue. I could tell he was curious, a little intimidated maybe, but I always told him it didn't matter.Recently, while we were having a pillow chat after sex, he asked me how he compares down there compared to the other guys I've slept with. I laughed it off and tried to dodge it with a joke, but he insisted. I told him it didn't matter because I'm with him now, but he kept pushing, said he wanted to know. I said fine, and started thinking. He insisted that he wanted full honesty, that he wanted us to be be 100% transparent with each other, so I promised I'd be 100% honest. Eventually, I told him he's \"a bit above average\". He thanked me for telling him.The thing is, it was a lie. I couldn't bring myself to be honest, because as far as I remember, he's the smallest I've ever been with. Not by a little, like noticeable smaller. I don't remember every single hookup perfectly, but yeah, I'm pretty sure.To be clear : I don't care, and I'm perfectly happy with him. Like I said before he takes care of me in other ways, and I'll take a sweet, attentive man over good dick any day.Still, I just couldn't get it out, I didn't want to humiliate him. It’s been gnawing at me, because I promised the truth, and he trusts me.I feel so conflicted now. Do  I tell him the truth?",

      "content_preview": "My bf (33M) and I (30F) have been together since January. We're both sure of each others deep feelings for one another. However he is my first real relationship, while he is a widower. At times he can be a bit overly possessive and I'm not sure how to deal with it and whether thats normal or not? We are now at a point where he accuses me of cheating by \"his definition\". His definition being, that other men might \"think\" about being with me, which I'm not promoting or welcoming but dont believe is in my control.In february I started doing EMS-Sports which requires me wearing a bodysuit and getting personal training. For years I have struggled with fibromyalgia and this training seems to be the only sports helping (its just a 20 minute training per week, I dress at home, go there to train at my booked appointment and leave straight away). His issue with it is that theres male trainers there who can eye me in the suit (since its got electric wiring, I cannot just put clothes over it) - its a black tight suit covering me from neck to ellbows and knees and kind of resembles thick diving clothes. So I have done my very best to only train with the female trainer there (changed my work shifts to be available when she was working, skipped when she wasnt there, etc.), but she just quit her job there while my contract is still signed for another 18 months and is quite pricey. She quit two weeks ago. So last week i skipped the training, but this week I attended the training with a male trainerwho tried to do smalltalk like \"did you have a good weekend? “ so I just said yes, later he asked if im doing something fun next weekend so I responded with\" yes, spending it with my boyfriend\". I told my bf about it and he said I needed to quit or hes leaving me.He has issues with quite a few general things I do. For instance, I work in IT and he hates that I have to work with mostly men. Meanwhile I have worked for this company for over ten years, never had relations with people there and am very professional (never flirty or so). Hes an IT guy himself, btw, not at my company though. He also has issues with me making more money. He wants me wearing very baggy clothes. I have to get physical therapy because Im very hypermobile and get dislocated bones/ribs easily, have been going to the same very professional therapist for seven years. My bf hates that its a man.Now I mightve considered quitting the sports, but really its him threatening me to leave that bothers me so so much.",

      "content_preview": "I'm looking to see how others wouldve reacted to this situation... For context, I've been dating my now ex for 5 months. Things were mostly smooth except the little things that were becoming consistent. He would often change, delay, and/or cancel plans last minute for a variety of reasons. He often knew things would change but didn't let me know until right before we were to meet up. He was 30 min late to our first date.I'm a person who really values their time and requires a bit of planning. I have been understanding, forgiving, and flexible to his everchanging timeline. I did bring up several times, that of this became consistent, it would be a problem. Then I told him that it would be a complete deal breaker if he cancelled big plans. He always promised to \"make it up to me\" but never did and he never changed.Well, that time came. He was away for work for a month with minimal to no contact due to the nature of his work. We had planned to rejoice the night he came back. It started off with him saying he'd come straight to my place. Then he said he needed to drop off stuff and get clothes at his place(he lives with his family). A few minutes later he calls me to tell me he's staying to have dinner with his parents. I told him that it was upsetting because I had dinner waiting for him...his first question was to ask what it was.....Then he texts me to tell me he won't be long and insisted he'd come over even after I said not to worry about it right now. I'm waiting and waiting. I get a call but couldn't answer right away but received a text stating that his family had a surprise party for him and that he wasn't coming at all after all. No invite, no acknowledgement of the hurt, and a vague, noncommittal plan to \"come over first thing tomorrow.\"That was it for me. I waited a whole month for him and planned several days in advance to have a nice dinner. Cleaned my apartment top to bottom, shaved, got dolled up....for nothing. I called him out and told him that it was weird his family planned a surprise party knowing we had plans AND didn't even bother to invite me. He started back pedaling and saying I was invited and that he wanted to see me. I stood my ground and told him that I couldn't do this anymore. I stayed firm in my decision and had him pick up his things the next day. I wonder if I was too harsh in not having a more in-depth conversation about the issue although my decision would've been the same.TLDR. Broke up with my bf because he was consistently flaky. He knew my boundary but decided to disrespect it. What would you have done? was I too harsh?",

      "content_preview": "I am 3 mo postpartum with my first baby. My fiancé and I flew across the US to go to his best friends wedding. My fiancé was the best man. The first day we got there, I noticed the maid of honour being overly friendly towards my fiancé. But being that I am freshly postpartum, I thought that maybe it was my hormones making me feel uncomfortable and annoyed. The next day we had a dinner with everyone, and the same thing happened. Everything that came out of my partners mouth she had a comment to make. At this point I was very annoyed so when we got back to the hotel I told my partner “Jennifer seems to be overly friendly towards you” to which he just said he was sorry and he would keep that in mind”. I ended up not being able to go to the wedding the day after because my baby was fussy and needed me. It has been a month since this event but I just noticed that 2 days after we got back home I saw that he searched her on instagram and TikTok. Is this something I should bring up to him or drop it?",

She memorized all the lyrics. I know her constantly singing it can be a bit annoying but I used to drive my parents crazy singing songs from the lion king so I didnt mind too much. My husband however hated that film and I tried to encourage her to sing only when hes not around.Yesterday though, once she sung golden, he flipped out and screamed at her and warned her not to sing anything from demon hunters anymore. I tried to calm him down but he accuses me of lying to myself and says I secretly wanted it to stop and that hes the brave one enough to do something about it. As a result of his screaming, she wont talk to him.How do I get him to realize that its not ok to scream and to apologize?",

He then mentions he only likes skinny/petite women. The same friend turned to me and said “I’m surprised (my boyfriend’s name) changed his type and is dating someone like you”I was taken aback, drunk, and a bit confused by what he had said. During this conversation I found out I am the first girl my boyfriend has dated who is not “bigger” or “thick” and his friend explained my boyfriend would always brag about bigger girls being better in certain ways (ass and tits) and my friend and I decided to leave mid conversation because she could tell I was getting uncomfortable.She told me not to think too much about it because I am an overthinker, and I kind of want to talk to my boyfriend about it just to ease my mind?

I've told him that, if he wants to stop being so lonely (and maybe get a gf), he needs to actually do something with his life; stop playing video games/watching anime/vaping in his room; try to better himself as a person; and actually go outside and connect with people. Get healthy hobbies, go volunteer!Instead, he recently found meaning in the church. It is unfortunately a very right-wing church, and he has become very passionate about it. (Our family grew up lightly Christian, but drifted away from religion over time.)His pastor told him they've seen a new phenomenon: Lots of young men like my brother are joining the church, more than ever before (especially from nearby universities), and the church is very excited about it. They want to organize them for something meaningful.A few of those churches in the area have put together a group of young men (mostly college-aged) to \"defend the unborn.\" They're going to protest outside of providers as a big group.My brother says these young males just want to \"make their voices heard.\" But to me it sounds like an intimidation tactic against vulnerable women. I'm livid.I feel like I don't want to support or have someone in my life who does that. I know different politics can coexist, but this one is a red line for me (for some deeply, deeply personal reasons). Nuclear options available. Do I cut ties? How do I handle this? Any advice would be appreciated.tldr;my struggling younger brother joined a pro life group for young men. It's a red line for me, and I'm considering cutting ties with him.",

      "content_preview": "I (28m) have feelings for my best friend (27f) of over 15 years. Growing up I would say that it was always pretty clear that she was interested in me - and people would often point it out - but I never felt anything more than friendly towards her. Now we are older, I've seemingly out of nowhere developed feelings for her, but she is in a long term relationship. Do you think I should admit to her how I feel? Sometimes it feels like we kind of dance around the topic. We talk a lot about some really deep stuff. I have no idea if she still has any romantic interest in me after just being friends for so long. I think I am confused - on the one hand I guess if I don't tell her and then she gets engaged or something, I'll always wonder what might've been. But then on the other, if I do tell her, it could put strain on our friendship (I don't think she'd cut me off though), which I'm scared about. I'm not sure what I would want her answer to be either, or if I'd want to \"do\" anything about it. I don't have a lot of dating experience so I wouldn't be a great partner anyway. I just feel like I'm running out of time to figure it out.UPDATE: Thanks everyone - you've all confirmed what I think I already knew really. I need to be a respectful friend and get some therapy. If ever we are both single, I'll revisit things.",

We’ve talked about plans to get married and start a family a couple years ago. Once we got engaged I started planning the wedding right away. I noticed his family never asked about wedding planning and he always shrugged this off. I began asking him more about his first marriage, the wedding, talk of kids, and the divorce. My fiancé treats me very well, is attentive and kind but something about hearing the stories of other women dating men who never officially divorced possessed me to dig deeper. That’s when I discovered on my own that he never got divorced. I was beyond shocked and betrayed. He was then very remorseful and confessed to other secrets, most centered around money. Now, a couple weeks and therapy sessions later, I have again discovered on my own that there was an overlap between his last ex and our relationship. This man has given me so much joy and yet has also been capable of lying so many times. I have never been someone to dig into someone’s past, certainly not to this extent. This is not my first serious relationship but I now have so many questions as to what’s “normal” for people and relationships. Is this man capable of being honest? Is there any scenario where staying is a good choice for me?",

      "content_preview": "My (38F) husband (44M) and I have been married for just over two years. Before our relationship, he was married to a woman named Lexi (43F). They met in their twenties and were together for nearly a decade, including seven years of marriage.During their time together, Lexi was diagnosed with cancer. He supported her throughout the entire journey until she eventually recovered. Not long after her recovery, she expressed a desire to explore life independently, which ultimately led to their divorce.Several months ago, Lexi reached out to him. The three of us had dinner together, and I found her to be warm, kind, and easy to talk to. Shortly after that evening, she asked to speak with him privately. During that conversation, she revealed that her cancer had returned. This time, the outlook was more serious, and she confided that she did not think she could go through treatment again on her own.My husband told me everything, and I supported his decision to be there for her. I even offered to help, but Lexi gently declined, saying she did not feel comfortable being that vulnerable around someone she did not know well. I respected her honesty and stepped back.As time went on, my husband became increasingly involved in her care and emotional well-being. At first, I tried not to question it. I understood how much she was going through and how much their shared history meant. However, as the weeks passed, it became clear that something had shifted. His presence in our shared life began to fade, and I could feel the distance growing.Two weeks ago, he sat down with me to have an open conversation. He assured me that nothing romantic or inappropriate had happened between them, but he also admitted that the level of support Lexi needed was not something he could provide while also being a husband to someone else. He said he believed we should separate, at least for now, and that he would understand if I chose to move forward with a divorce.He left our home shortly afterward, and we’ve had very limited contact since. I’m torn about what to do next. Part of me feels like I should ask for a divorce and start moving on, but another part wonders if I should wait and see how things develop.",

      "content_preview": "Tonight, I (21F) cooked dinner for my boyfriend of almost 2 years (22M) and me. I made a main dish and some jalapeño poppers as an appetizer (8 total). I was really looking forward to them because I haven’t had them in a while.We sat down to watch a movie, and I was still getting settled and hadn’t started eating yet. Over about 15 minutes, he ate all 8 of the poppers. When I went to grab one, the plate was completely empty. I didn’t get a single one.I asked why he didn’t leave me any, and he said, “You didn’t say you wanted any.” I was kind of surprised because I made the whole meal for both of us, so I thought it was obvious they weren’t just for him. He said I’m overreacting because they’re “just snacks” and he was hungry.I feel annoyed because 1) I took the time to make them and 2) it didn’t even occur to him to leave me one. But now I’m wondering if I’m blowing this out of proportion or if this is a sign he can be inconsiderate sometimes.Isthis maybe a sign that he doesn’t consider my feelings sometimes?UPDATE :We ended up talking about it that night, and I realized he honestly wasn’t trying to be rude. At first what he said sounded like him dismissing the fact that I was upset, but his reasoning actually made sense. I had made dinner for both of us, and the poppers were kind of an extra thing on the side. He thought they were just something I made for him because I know he loves them, and I did just kind of place them down on a small plate in front of him, so he didn’t think twice about finishing them off. I hadn’t said anything about them beforehand so he genuinely just didn’t think about it.As soon as he realized how much it hurt my feelings, he felt so bad and definitely made up for it. That night he went to the store, bought everything to make more, and gave me a whole plate before he touched any. The next day he made another batch and made sure I got first pick.For context, he’s a big guy, about 6’2 and built like a football player, so he can put away a lot of food. He wasn’t trying to be inconsiderate. He was distracted by the movie and honestly just really liked my cooking.Everything is good now and he learned his lesson.😂",

      "content_preview": "So as the title says, my (34F) ex husband (34M) (together 10 years, separated 3) is getting married in the next week.We are not amicable. I left, he was abusive, police were involved ect ect.We are only still in contact because we share custody of two children. This is also deeply high conflict and we are currently in the middle of family court.I genuinely have no issues with his fiancé, she seems fine if a little naive. I have moved away and re-partnered and am genuinely happy he is getting married - maybe he will finally focus his attention elsewhere and leave me alone.But, I will be seeing him the day after the wedding to do handover and I’m not sure what the etiquette is.If I say nothing I’ll be painted as bitter If I say congratulations I’ll be painted as passive aggressive.I’m not sure what other options there might be 😅Reddit what is the socially acceptable choice in this situation.",

      "content_preview": "Halloween is always something I've enjoyed. Ever since I was a child it would be a time for my dad and I to watch movies, decorate the house etc and I have a lot of good memories of that.My girlfriend and I have also enjoyed celebrating Halloween and we usually have movie nights, carve pumpkins and go to local events if there are any on. We tend to have things for the full month.This year my dad passed away so I mentioned to my gf wanting to make this Halloween special. We planned a couple of events in town to attend, we said we'd go on a day out somewhere I used to go with my dad, we planned a movie night and said we'd attend a scare maze event that is not far from us. It was nice knowing we have a lot planned for the month.The tickets for the scare maze go on sale next week so we haven't got tickets yet. My gf mentioned today that she'd made plans with friends for three separate evenings next month so she can't afford the plans we've made. She said we can do the movie night but that'll likely be it.I asked if she was serious and she said yeah. I pointed out we've had things planned for weeks so she shouldn't have made other plans knowing it's all unaffordable.I said she knew how important it was for me and it feels shit to know she'll happily cancel the second her friends want to meet up.She accused me of guilt tripping her but I pointed out if she feels guilty then maybe she should look at why. I said she shouldn't be cancelling everything we've had planned for weeks just because her friends want to meet up.I said she should have told her friends she can't make it if it was unaffordable for her to go without cancelling plans we've already got.How would you handle this?Tl;dr my girlfriend and I had a lot of plans to celebrate Halloween this year which meant a lot to me as it’s something I used to celebrate with my dad who passed away this year.  She’s now cancelling pretty much all of them because she’s made plans with friends instead. When I expressed upset she accused me of guilt tripping her.",

      "content_preview": "As the title reads I just broke up with my fiancé, my partner of 7 years. One of the major problems in our relationship was that he didn’t contribute to the household. This being he didn’t help with chores often (in his words because he works so much) and he didn’t spend money on supplies for the house (new vacuum, toilet paper, trash bags).However after having broken up last week he has miraculously resolved these issues with himself. Now he washes all of his dishes, he bought himself a ton of bathroom items, a new vacuum just for him (ours is old and rickety but gets the job done). Now I get that he is buying these items because he is going to move out (possibly) and he doesn’t want to share items.It’s just very anger inducing because I’m wondering where all this effort and money came from. He couldn’t have helped me buy things and do chores before but now that we’re done he can..? My question is how do I not flip the hell out that he’s so selfish and manipulative?!Edit/update: My profile has a previous post with more information for those interested in additional details. He is for sure moving out in September (at least that’s what he told me today).Thank you to everyone who has interacted with this post, I’m still hurting and healing. But I’m just going to remain optimistic on what the future holds without someone selfish being unappreciative of me.Last update for awhile: he’s not able to move out in September as previously mentioned. He hasn’t gotten approved for the apartments he applied to. I don’t have the funds to move out so I’m just stuck until the start of December at least.  For those asking, we both work full time jobs. I was able to get a friend to agree to move in once he’s out. His job does pay significantly higher than mine however he does not pay more in bills because he screwed up his credit and bought a very expensive truck. I was also a student up until halfway through July when I graduated with my bachelors. Not bragging but I did receive honors as I was very dedicated - just to give you the perspective that I didn’t have a lot of free time either to be cleaning up after everyone.",

They are still in contact now - he just doesn't live in our city.She says that, because he is still a \"good friend\", if he would ever come visit our city she would like to go for coffee or a meal with him so they can catch up.I made it clear that, for me, entertaining any form of relationship with a past fling is disrespectful and not something I am okay with. She did not take it particularly well saying that nothing would happen because \"they are just friend and the fling happened long ago\", but eventully said that she respected my boundary.That still left a sour taste in my mouth and I don't feel like I can trust her now, and because of that I would like to end things.Am I exagerrating or would this kind of situation make you upset too - to the point you would consider leaving?Edit: It's not just a normal friendship because he keeps hitting on her, which is ultimately my biggest reason for being uncomfortable.",

Again, nothing unusual, until she gets to a guy we’ll call Jeff.“Jeff is so attractive, you wouldn’t believe it”Nothing too bad here, we occasionally acknowledge people as attractive, but then she doubles down, explaining how every time he talks to her, she blushes because of how good looking he is.Her coworkers have caught on and now jokingly refer to the guy as “the love of her life”And that was it. I didn’t really know how to respond, but it kinda upset me. Am I being too insecure?I’m not upset she finds people attractive (I do too), but why tell me? There was no punchline, just “I find this guy so attractive, everyone notices”. It just seemed bit mean to tell a partner.Looking for honest feedback. Does it sound like I’m being too insecure? She’s done similar-ish things occasionally that have made me feel the same way, but I’ve been quiet about it as I don’t want to come off as jealous.

We grew up with different rules and different opportunities in life. I understand the culture differences. This however maybe its just a personal difference. I hate leaving the kitchen unclean after we have food, he usually prefers to immediately lay down in the living room. We usually navigate between the two, each of us compromises at times. Usually it hasn’t been a problem until yesterday. Yesterday he wanted to immediately lay down after cooking and eating, i agreed without a fuss and was excited to show him a few videos i took of our kittens. We went over to the living room and as soon as we laid down, he got up told me to be quiet for a minute and started recording the kitchen in the most horrible state it ever is. I asked him why he did it, he said to just share it with a friend. I got very much embarrassed. Now I grew up in a culture where you are heavily judged about the state of your house, and no matter the amount of therapy I wont be able to fully remove those feelings from within me. I explained that it makes me and us look like bums and that is not a proper representation of our kitchen or home. He got mad told me i cannot dictate what he records or shares with his friends. This lead to a huge argument. And we aren’t talking currently. I believe he owes me an apology because all he needed to do was show understanding over a topic that makes me feel uncomfortable and not record the house in a terrible state. I am also not the ocd fake type to clean just for guests or pictures but a kitchen after cooking is not how the kitchen looks like usually. It feels unfair. And i feel judged by his friends. I do not know that but I feel very embarrassed, all of which could have easily been avoided. Thoughts?",

      "content_preview": "I have been dating my boyfriend for 1.5 years now. He has several mental illnesses such as severe OCD, anxiety and autism. He has told me he is better because of medication and therapy and he doesn't show any over the top symptoms. He is \"quirky\", but I guess is quite pleasant to live with.Recently, I was at his house and he was fixing some furniture. He asked me get something from his garage. I had to go digging around a bit. Before I did, I accidentally dropped a box which sounded like it contains glass. I opened the box to check if I had broken anything. Inside were some syringes and needles. There were small bottles full of a yellowish liquid, which some of the syringes also contained. There was also measuring equipment inside. It looked like a strange project. I was curious as to what this was. I didn't expect anything very bad.I showed the box to him and apologised for dropping it. He looked inside and exclaimed \"just put it back\". He seemed panicked though. I asked him what it is and he said \"I can't remember\". I asked again, and he kept trying to snatch it off me. He was very annoyed and I knew he was hiding something, maybe an addiction, so I kept on arguing. I told him he has to trust me and if it is \"nothing\", then why is he defensive? He eventually gave up and started explaining, after I promised to understand and not judge.He said his mental issues make him worry and obsess excessively. He has bad mood swings which get extremely bad. He feels helpless, alone, he doesn't sleep for days and stays up thinking, he stops talking to everyone etc.. Years ago, he created something which will end his life quick. He said much of his improved mental health is owed to his \"lethal injections\". They stop him from worrying because he can always reassure himself that there is an easy \"plan b\" if everything goes wrong. He took his injections everywhere in the past, but now has them tucked away. I asked him if he has used them, and he said he has gotten close many times in the past.I don't know how to react to this. I kind of understand, but it seems so off. I don't see him as \"normal\" anymore. He looked so proud about spending time and money creating \"lethal injections\" that it was almost freaky. It also clearly shows how suicidal he is and his fragile mental state. I'm really upset because he is such a good boyfriend (intelligent, kind, genuinely a good guy etc..) and as sad as his situation is, I don't know if I can live with him. How can I properly react to this situation?TL;DR I recently discovered that my boyfriend keeps homemade lethal injections around because he says it helps with his mental health. I don't know how to react to this information.",

      "content_preview": "I have tried posting this too many times lol.I've never used Reddit before, only seen videos, but I'm hoping to get some much needed insight. I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 4 years. Our relationship has been very good for the most part, some fights here and there but nothing worth noting; until a week ago.I got a call from my brother telling me my mom had passed away last Friday. Growing up, I was never super close with her (we were usually fighting), but over the last 5 years our relationship improved tremendously. We'd text throughout the week, and every Sunday I would go on 4-5 hour drives with her on speaker to keep me company, talking about anything and everything under the sun. She became my best friend. For context, my boyfriend knows how close we had gotten and had even joined me for some of those drives.Now is the problem. My boyfriend has a fairly close group of friends that he keeps up with, usually gaming with them throughout the week. Then, once a month, him and his friends will hang out and drink. He let me know a few days prior that he would be hanging out with them that Friday.When I got the news, I immediately called him, breaking down and telling him I didn't know what to do and that I knew I needed to be with him tonight. He went from consoling me to saying, \"I let you know a few days ago I have plans with my friends, I only get to see them once a month.\" I told him I understood, but I really needed him and I'm sure they would reschedule, to which he said they definitely wouldn't be able to as they all have their own responsibilities. After some more time going back and forth, I gave in and said I would be okay with him going as long as he left early. Since he leaves at 7pm, I said I would like for him to come back by 11. He agreed.I spent the night going through texts with her, photos, everything I could. I tried to distract myself with other things but nothing worked. Eventually, 10pm rolls around and I text my boyfriend, \"Will you be leaving in an hour?\" to which he responds, \"You told me 12, so I'll be leaving then.\" I told him I said 11 and I was standing by that. He didn't respond after, and came home at 12. I asked him why he didn't reply and why he didn't just come back an hour earlier. He immediately got upset with me, telling me I was being selfish for ruining his night with his friends, him spending an extra hour there means nothing since he still left early, and I would be fine since I \"didn't spend my childhood with her anyways.\" I told him I didn't even want him to go out with them that day to begin with since I had just gotten the news but I agreed to it under that specific condition, and so had he. He could also just catch up with his friends when they game during the week. The fight ended with him telling me I was again being selfish as he doesn't get to see them in person often, and that I shouldn't expect him to drop everything for me.We've been fairly cold to each other since which has left me overthinking and reevaluating our relationship. On one hand, I am extremely heartbroken he wasn't there for me and know that's not something I want for my future, but on the other hand, his words have definitely gotten to me and I feel bad for separating him from his friends. I also know it would break me more to lose someone else so close to me. Where do I go from here?",

      "content_preview": "We’ve been best friends since high school and have talked nearly every day for 12 years. Even after I moved across the country (twice), we stayed close. I was her maid of honor 7 months ago, and she was supposed to be mine. Then she abruptly ended our friendship last week with a scripted voicemail.Some background: I was diagnosed with BPD at 20, which helped explain a lot of unhealthy behaviors I had in my teens, especially compulsive lying. Through therapy (and a medicated brain), I’ve made huge strides. I’m now able to call myself out in the moment, apologize, and try to repair trust when I slip up. My therapist also suggested the phrase “slow your thoughts, and focus on the truth” for my friends to use when they’re unsure if I’m being honest. It’s embarrassing when said out loud in a group, but it’s also been helpful. My friend knew about this and had used it in the past, always with kindness.She knew me years before I was diagnosed, when I had no coping skills and was deep in teenage insecurity. I’ve made a point to clarify past lies whenever they come up, especially stuff from high school, and I’ve taken full accountability. I know I was the main reason for a rocky foundation of our friendship, but I had thought we had made great progress strengthening it. Our overall values have always aligned, our actions just didn’t always support them.Two weeks ago, we went on my bachelorette trip. While we were there, she shared a few embarrassing high school stories I had previously admitted were lies, and she did it in front of everyone. It felt intentional, and honestly, humiliating. When I asked her about it later, she said she was just anxious because she didn’t know the group well (these were my cousins, sorority sisters, and other college friends). They all are also aware of my struggles with telling tales, but also know it’s something I’m constantly working on.  I figured it was her awkwardness and let it go.Then the next morning, I found out she called my mom. She told her about us getting drunk the night before, and brought up things from my past (drugs, one-night stands, sneaking out of the house, etc). My mom was confused and concerned. I’m 28 and she doesn’t care about the details of high school and college as long as I’m healthy, safe, and making better choices now. Her only comment was, “If I had known in the moment with any of it, I would’ve helped you sooner.”I called my friend to try to talk about why she felt the need to involve my mom. No response. I texted her twice over the next day and even sent her photos from the trip, trying to open the door to talk. Nothing.Two full weeks passed with silence.Then, on the day of my final walkthrough with wedding vendors (a day she had access to on the shared schedule and was supposed to be at), she called and left me a 60-second voicemail. In it, she said she was stepping down as matron of honor and that we should no longer be friends. It was clearly scripted. She then sent the exact same message to my fiancé and my mom.I called and texted her, once each, after that. I wasn’t going to blow up her phone, but I did want a conversation. I wanted to understand.Since then, I’ve spoken to my other friends from the trip. They told me she had pulled several of them aside individually during the weekend to complain that she didn’t get enough alone time with me. She also shared more embarrassing stories about me from when I was 16 or 17. The general consensus was that I hadn’t done anything wrong during the trip itself, but her energy was off and she seemed like she was trying to prove something.I’m not mad that the friendship ended. I understand people grow apart. What’s hurting me is how it ended. No warning. No conversation. Two weeks of silence, followed by a cold, rehearsed message the week before my wedding. I thought our friendship could survive the past, especially since we had grown and supported each other through so much.She was supposed to stand next to me at the altar. Now she won’t even respond to a text.I know I haven’t been a perfect friend. I know my past issues may have been exhausting. But I also know I’ve grown, always been there for her, and I’ve tried to make amends when I’ve hurt people. I really believed our friendship had weathered the hardest parts already.Now I’m a less than a week away from my wedding, trying to focus on joy and celebration, but I keep coming back to this massive sense of grief and confusion. I don’t know what changed. I don’t know if something happened that weekend that pushed her over the edge. I just wish she would’ve talked to me. Even a final conversation would’ve helped me move on.How do I handle this lack of closure? Especially when I want to be present and happy for my wedding?",

      "content_preview": "Hello, I'll keep it brief but basically I (22F) have been in a relationship with my bf (23M) for 6 months now. We met on dating apps and had a bit of a rocky start since he didn't tell me he was seeing someone else at the time and I got the hey girly text, which led to us not talking for a month. I know how it sounds but I truly believe we have a strong connection now, I've never felt this way about anyone before and it took me a while but he managed to regain my trust after that. However we both recently moved houses, I took a 2 bed flat with my best friend (we are both pursuing a master) and he works already but wanted to be closer to the city centre. I found him a very nice flat from a friend that was moving out, but it was a two bedroom so he needed someone else to make it affordable. My bf found a flatmate online and I was a bit wary at first because it was a woman and they have similar interest, which I brought up (asking if he would be comfortable if the roles were reversed). He dismissed my concern saying he simply would have moved with me (regardless of the fact I already had plans with my best friend) and wouldn't let that situation happen anyway. At the time I let it go since there was a deadline to apply for the flat and he didn't have anyone else to share it with. But since they moved in together I can't help but feel uneasy, when I'm over I feel like I might be intruding as it's not really my flat and when I am away (visiting family over the summer), hearing about them watching shows together or talking in the kitchen drives me crazy. Some really simple things (like she got my bf some of his fav food as a gift) make me overthink so much, and I don't know how to calm myself down. Is there anything I can do to be less jealous and more comfortable in this situation? Would appreciate any help at all. Thanks ! Tldr: my bf moved with a woman flatmate recently and I feel awkward and jealous about them doing normal flatmates things together, how do I get over this feeling?",

It needs to be said that my net income is about 3 times as his so I wasn't expecting like diamonds or anything. Just like relatively cheaper stuff that I couldn't justify buying for myself. I also sent him links to things that I found cool but couldn't justify buying (Kill Bill T-shirt and some fake earrings).He got nothing, he said he was trying very hard to find something that I will like and just couldn't figure anything out. That was one fight. The second was about how he went about getting the cake. I asked him to place the order in advance because I feel more comfortable planning ahead of time. How insisted that he knew the bakery and he could easily get the cake an hour in advance. The day before my birthday, I asked him once again if he could just place the order and he snapped at me.At that moment, I gave up. I told him to cancel everything, and I went out with strangers and celebrated with them. He called asking if he could join, but I said no. He apparently got an emergency therapy session and the therapist also told him that was a dick move.I know he didn't mean to hurt me, and he's been apologising and offering to buy me whatever I want, but I'm not able to let me anger go. He knew this was important to me and he went out of his way to ruin it for me and I'm not able to get over it.How do we move forward from this? I need help and advice. Couple's therapy is on the table but right now I'm still too angry to have a conversation.PS: I also plan his birthdays and get him gifts.",

We are having a planned pregnancy and our daughter is due in october!My fiance had a high school sweetheart  who he dated since freshman year till his sophomore year in college; she died  due to breast cancer. I never knew her but in the beginning of our relationship he never failed to mention how she was a beautiful person. He has admitted to me that i always wanted to marry her and imagined them having kids. He loves me so very much and has always been a great partner.Recently we were on the topic of baby names. I am mixed, (Ivorian and Brazilian)  and my fiance is from Costa Rica. I was things of the name Antonia, but was definitely open to other options.He suggested we name our daughter after her.  Not a middle name, not a “Gracie-Anne” kind of thing where you have 2 names, but her first name.His ex’s name is very unique and not something common where it could be nicknamed different or not be directly a tribute to her.  I believe her name is a cultural name as well and neither of us are from that culture.I told him, id be fine with it being her middle name or a nickname even, but he told me he really wanted to make her name his ex’s. I would like to make it clear I have nothing against the idea of naming kids after lost loved ones but, just not my first baby. I have a strong feeling that our daughter is going to look just like me which will make it more awkward.He just came home from work and is in a really good mood, I feel tense writing this next to him.",

      "content_preview": "I [32F] have been with my partner [37M] for almost eight years now. He has been such a grounding force in my life and we have moved forward and built a really comfortable life together. When we met I was in one of the most severe depressive episodes of my life - we stuck together through job changes, losses of family members and pets, lifestyle changes and health scares (on both sides). I’m recurring to this Reddit because honestly I’m embarrassed to talk about this with anyone irl.In the grand scheme of things he’s genuinely such a good addition to my life. Always looks out for my safety, wants to ensure my health and comfort, loyal, honest, etc. There are smaller cracks though that I tend to ignore in favor of all of the good things.His previous relationships weren’t exactly ideal. When I met him he’d been divorced for a year (his previous wife of 5 years cheated and was physically abusive). I’d never really been in a relationship that lasted over a year before him. That led to a lot of jealousy and resentment.I’m the extrovert of the two, and I used to really enjoy going out dancing with my friends - he doesn’t dance and doesn’t trust me to participate in nightlife without him. Naturally, I compromised for the sake of the relationship and stopped partying almost entirely - it felt like the grown up thing to do. I still hear comments every now and then about how much of a slut I used to be and how I could cheat on him at any moment. Those always sting, I’m not exactly a confident person.He always seemed to get annoyed if I try to make too many plans without him (for reference, twice in a month would make him annoyed but he wouldn’t fight me on it - more than that would be pushing it). I get confused because we both work from home, we basically spend every day together and still make plans on the weekends to go out to eat or shop for new items for our collections.As of about a year and a half ago, I’d catch him listening to borderline redpill content on TikTok and laughing along. It unsettled me, and I’d mention it and react at times, but it never really went anywhere. At times he’ll go on rants about how all women are liars and whores, which makes me pretty distressed knowing the comments he’s directed at me personally before. More often, I’ll hear him criticizing women as a monolith rather than complimenting me directly as his partner.Yesterday he said “You know what? I never said anything because I was being politically correct but I guess I would classify as a misogynist.” He then went on to say how he basically hates all women except his mother, his sister, and me. I didn’t really react at the time, I’ve barely started to process it to be honest. I get this pit in my stomach the more I think about it, because I’m very aware of how tenuous my being an exception to the rule is.I’ve brought up couples therapy before and he laughed in my face, so I genuinely don’t know where to go from here. Do I throw away eight years of building a life together? How do I fix this?(Appreciate your help if you’ve read this far)",

      "content_preview": "Hello againQuick update to my last post. I knew my post would be controversial which is why I sought the opinion of internet strangers than my own family or friends. Thanks to everyone who gave advice.Nothing juicy. I talked to him about it, expressed how excited I was to be marrying him but said I did not like the ring. He took it okay. He was a little upset but more of an ego hit than anything. He agreed to return the ring and have me pick out a new one. He wants me to have a ring Im happy with and will have forever.He feels bad he listened to his mother but he thought she would be a good source of information. He doesn't have a big support network and none of my family or friends would have been able to keep a secret (he wanted the proposal to be a big surprise). I did tell him he should listen to his future wife from now on lol.He picked a heart shaped ring after because he got me a promise ring a while back that was heart shaped. He didnt know that the style was very... polarizing.So yeah. We communicated, and now I'll be getting a ring that fits my style.The only remaining issue is how we tell friends and family about the ring changing. Any suggestions?Thanks again",

He looked baffled as it seems he was ready to go into details.A little backstory, last month I had the flu, my period, and a UTI (2 antibiotics) all at the same 4 days span, it was exhausting and I was bedridden. I didn't ask him for anything, at the time we were staying at a 5-star all inclusive resort (part of a 2 weeks holiday) and he was spending most of his time with our son.I don't ask him to do anything for me during my period, but he seems to dislike me expressing any human needs - I said to him he lacks empathy for me, and doesn't view me as a human. He did not deny.How would other women out there respond if their man said this to them, or made them feel like their monthly period is too much to handle?",

It has been a hell of a journey this past year, nothing tests a relationship like kids haha. We have had a lot of communication breakdowns recently and he has told me he is feeling extremely under appreciated for everything he does for us, and he does do a lot. So I want to make it very known to him that I appreciate him so much and I wouldn’t be able to stay home with our son and enjoy these moments without him.So PLEASE people, give me the best ideas you have for showing him appreciation. I have got him a Father’s Day gift that I know he will love, but I’m sure there’s acts of service I can do or something else that maybe men might be able to give me input into? I feel like gifts doesn’t show him he’s loved and appreciated and there’s only so much I can think of inside of my brain.If anyone needs any context around anything let me know, appreciate any help ☺️",

      "content_preview": "I’m questioning myself a lot because I have always assumed I’d be the type of husband who is unconditionally supportive of my wife’s ambitions. Honestly, I feel like such an asshole, so don’t be shy if you think I’m being one.So i’m a lawyer, and my wife has worked in the service industry her whole life. When we met a few years ago, she was a server at a nice restaurant, but before that she had been a manager or held more high ranking roles. She’s a badass, if you watch The Bear you know the vibe of the fine dining world, it’s a serious career.  She made a lot more money than servers at regular restaurants, but definitely a lot less than me.So in our early dating we had barely any time together because I worked normal business hours Monday to Friday, she worked weekday evenings and a lot of weekend days. When we started to get really serious and were looking at moving in together, the lack of quality time bothered us both and I eventually offered to financially support both of us. This was after a lot of her complaining about the job, wanting to stay at home, her making jokes about wanting to be a trophy wife, etc. I just want to be clear that she was more than on board with this and there was no pressure from me. This wasn’t a political thing, neither of us buy into like tradwife bullshit, it was more like “well I love you, you’re unsatisfied with your job and our time together, your income isn’t really needed, what if you focus on doing art or maybe you’ll go back to school or something.”She enthusiastically agreed and I was the sole breadwinner for about two years. Eventually she started getting kinda stir crazy and wanted to get back into her career which I supported. She got job as an assistant manager at a fine dining restaurant, and she was intentional about making sure she was in charge of weekday day shifts so that she and I were at work and home during the same hours. We’ve both been happy with this, I’m happy she feels fulfilled and in her lane again. When she went back to work about a year ago, she said she would make sure she wasn’t working nights and weekends.Anyway, the general manager position came open at this restaurant, which would mean nights and weekends, and also 60+ hour weeks. She was extremely excited that the owner wants to interview her for this job. This led to a fight because she told me about it and I was like “oh… well, let’s think about it.” She was really upset that I wasn’t like unconditionally excited about it. Honestly I do regret not leading with congratulations for even being considered, that’s on me. She has a temper, and was pissed off at me for having any hesitation about the job. She called me controlling and kinda implied I was being sexist. And this was just from me not being totally on board, I definitely did not say I didn’t want her to do it, I didn’t ask her not to take it, let alone like give her an ultimatum or something.  So to say the least, I have to approach this really delicately if I’m going to say I prefer for her not to take it.It bums me out a lot because I feel like her staying home was a very mutual decision that we made while moving in together, like “this is the life we want.” I also feel like that at least as recently as going back to work she was making promises about not working nights and weekends. It was a mutual priority and I feel like I have a right to be sad she wasn’t to change that.We are a really active couple, we are best friends, we are very joined at the hip and I really hate the idea of eliminating most of our free time together. It’s not an exaggeration to say she and I would basically never be working at the same time. If this promotion was a 9 to 5 job, there’s no question I’d be her biggest cheerleader.So, honestly, I don’t want her to do it and I feel really guilty about that. And to be clear I’m not going to try to stop her if she’s determined, not going to threaten. If I tell her I don’t want her to do it and she decides to anyway I’m not going to divorce her or something, but i know she’ll be really upset. Is saying nothing the only good husband thing to do here? Is it reasonable for her to be angry at me or think I’m controlling if I say “honestly I don’t want you to do it, but if it’s important enough to you to do it anyway, I support you.” I should also say that realistically any general manager job in her world is going to work like this, I don’t really have the option of asking her to compromise by looking for a general manager position that only works day shifts somewhere else.",

      "content_preview": "So me and my boyfriend have been together for about 4 years. We've had our ups and downs, but overall we have a really solid relationship.We live together and have been struggling financially a lot recently, mostly due to college debt. My boyfriend also can't work more than 3 hours per day because of several mental disorders. Our parents on both sides are not really in the picture.Well, a few nights ago my boyfriend went out without me which is usually fine with me. According to him, he told his friends he wouldn't drink much because he needed to save up. His friends were already really drunk and told him how he's become so bland and annoying recently, he couldn't have any fun anymore and one of them said he would give him 250$ if he cheated on me. This friend has never really liked me and has often made weird comments like how my boyfriend could have done way better or how boring I made him. I know he cheated on his ex gf several times.Well, long story short, he did it. My bf made out with a random girl at the bar and went home with her. The worst part is he didn’t even tell me. I found out two days after through a \"hey girly text\" from the girl he cheated with. I immediately confronted him and he owned up to everything. He cried, said he was sorry and that he just did it for the money. He wanted us to not be as stressed about money (he did buy groceries for us with it).I have been avoiding him as much as possible since then, he has been trying his hardest to make up. I dont know what to do. I feel extremely betrayed, but i believe that he really did it for the money. How can i move on from this situation?",

      "content_preview": "I (33m) and my wife (35f) have been together 12 year and married for 5. Recently we've hit a point in our marriage where its as good as done. For the last 12/18 months she has become alot more distant and has had little to no interest in having sex whilst also withdrawing emotionally. We have spoken about this more times than I can think of and it normally results in an argument and the odd time she would say it will change. It changes for a few days and goes back to the old ways. She also never initiates sex and rejects my advances 90% of the time. This was never the case throughout our time together until the last 12/18 months and it began to become a major issue. I've lost all self confidence due to the constant rejection. She's even at times said that I have an obsession with sex. It probably has become that way due to the lack of it and the desire to make love with my wife.She works with a guy called James(28m) and from the start I've felt something off with him. She is in a few work group chats, in which he is the only mail. I has seen he had been messaging her around 2 years ago, when she was showing me something on her phone and I'd asked what that was about and she said it was about work. She had then started to go on more work nights out and then changed her WhatsApp settings so other people can't see if you're online or read messages, while also becoming more protective of her phone. One night she came home drunk and I stupidly looked at her phone and she had messages from James, they weren't bad but just seemed odd he would message her outside of their chats if they're only talking about work. I'd held it in for a few days before explaining to my wife that it made me feel uncomfortable and insecure and I'd appreciate it if she'd keep their messages for their work chats. She went ballistic and refused. I then said that she's not considering how I feel and being very unreasonable, especially as 3 or 4 years prior she'd asked me to leave a work group chat because she felt threatened by one of the girls I worked with. I didn't argue and done it with no questions asked.After speaking with her about James texting, she said she would stop and understands my point and apologised. A few weeks later, same thing. She was.on a work night out and came.home drunk. Curiosity got the better of me and I checked her phone, Stupidly again and seen replied from James but no messages from her. Which would indicate she's deleted the. I confronted her the next day and she denied. Said she didn't know about messages and that k shouldn't have been on her phone. I never accepted that and she kept her story. The next day when asked again, she admitted.to deleting messages because she knew I didn't like it. I never fully believed it but accepted her apology and she promised she wouldn't do it again. I advised that if she does then the trust is well and truly gone and that it could be what.ends.our already struggling relationship. Friday past, she went out with 2 wives of 2 of my best friends. I collected them and she was drunk and being her usual drunk self, cheeky and defensive. When we got home she was texting someone and I said who are you texting. She said noone and began shouting and calling me names. I laughed and rolled around in bed and tried to sleep. She did get into bed and put her phone under her pillow, on silent and Internet turned off. She got up quickly to be sick in the bathroom without her phone so. So opened it and seen messages from James, however. None from her. I'd had enough. I went mad. Shouted at her and she laughed at me, got into bed and said \"are you going to cry now?\".The next morning, I got up and went out with our children. Came home, left them with her and went to the bar. She text apologising and I told her I'd had enough and not to talk to me. I came home drunk. She tried to talk to me and I gave her some home truths. Told her I wanted her out because I'm not losing my family and home over her decisions. She's adamant nothing has happened and they're friends. I messaged James, asked him phone me. He waited two days before he did and I threatened I'd beat the life out of him and he hung up and blocked me. She's since turned this around on me and claims I'm controlling and has no respect for me or my feelings. I'm now back at my family home while she is in our home with my kids. Any advice on my next move? Please",

I still feel very iffy about this whole situation and if things don’t go well in marriage counseling and I don’t get the honesty I need, its wraps. Good news.

      "content_preview": "I (32F) have been married to my husband (36M) for 6 years. It's my first serious relationship. I love him, he's funny, charming and intelligent and we share a lot, but he has always been a little hot headed.Some context first: a few months ago, a situation at work went badly and I fell into the burnout. I’m autistic, and the burnout has made my executive dysfunction much worse. I’ve been on sick leave ever since.I have very little energy. Even basic things leave me exhausted. I sleep a lot, socialize very little, skip meals. I know it's bad but I am doing my best.My husband has been very frustrated that I’m not respecting his needs. We don't haev sex, I don’t cook every day, and the house isn’t as tidy as he’d like.Multiple times, I didn't take care of things while he was at work so he yelled at me. others, I made him ignore me for hours. I tried to explain that I was struggling too much and he replied that I was using my situation and exaggerating my symptoms for attention.I tried to push myself to meet his needs and keep up with the house, but every time I quickly got too tired and had to stop. I tried to tell him but said he didn't want to hear it because he has enough on his plate.I never know if I am going to make him angry. I have been crying almost every day and I don't know if it's the burnout or if it's because I can't be there for him. I felt like it would be better for both of us to take a break. He refused and said thdt as his wife, it was my legal duty to be there in sickness and in health.Two weeks ago, I finally told him I wanted a divorce. He had a meltdown and he yelled for hours, saying I was just confused because of my mental health. he apologized later and said I shouldn't act irrational like that. I hesitated for a few days and I told him I still wanted to leave, amd he had another meltdwn.Yesterday, I woke up and went downstairs to find my husband, his parents, and my parents, all waiting for me.They said they were extremely worried, that they never get news except from my husband. He reported to them he was scared for me because I was isolating and harming myself.They told me it was okay to need help. That I needed stability. They said they were all there for me no matter what. I cried the entire time. I felt cornered, humiliated, and defensive. I felt like that was not normal. But now I don’t know what to think.After they left he said he contacted my GP and psychologist to let them know how bad it is, and booked an appointment with a psychiatrist on my behalf. He said they all care about me and want to help me be myself again.Part of me still wants to leave, but another part of me wonders if they’re right. I still love him. And I’m definitely not at my most stable right now, I am in the fog. to be honest I feel really selfish and guilty about all of this. I am completely overwhelmed.Could  you guys give me an outside perspective on this?Thanks a lot.EDIT: thanks everyone, so many replies, I am grateful. I can't answer everyone right now but I can give a few thoughts and infos:I see my GP every two weeks. I was on Cipralex but we had to stop becaus of side effects, now we are trying mirtazapine. I had already seen a therapist before a few years ago and my husband called her and my GP  yesterday to tell them I needed help before bookng the appointment with the psychiatrist he found. I'll go to the appointments and give them my perspective.I have an ok relationship with my parents, they see me as fragile and don't always understand the autism. I think I will try to talk with tehm about what was going on and ask if I can stay with them temporarily. and get better before deciding on the divorce.I'll rest for now, this is a lot to take in. Thanks everyone.",

      "content_preview": "My(40M) wife Laura (40F) have been together for 10 years married for 7. My relationship with Laura has always been great. She had a lot of pain from her ex who emotionally abused her but she was always the kindest person I knew. I fell for her pretty quickly and knew almost right away I wanted to marry her. Laura has a daughter Riley(19F) from her previous relationship, I didn’t meet Riley until a year into our relationship and she did not warm up to me right away, she has a complicated relationship with her dad who has been in and out of her life and resented her mom dating at all. I tried to be understanding, didn’t try to fill a father role in her life and gave her space. Things were especially hard for a few years after they moved in with me about a year into our relationship. Riley acted out a lot, she broke anything I’d give her, was getting in trouble at school a lot, and constantly told us both that she hated us and wanted to live with her dad. Her dad would not take her and barely even paid any child support though, Riley still blamed Laura and I though and this caused some issues between us but I loved Laura a lot though so I put up with Riley’s outbursts for her and we made things work. Eventually when Riley was 14 her dad got remarried and basically cut her off completely which devastated her, Laura and I did our best to support her, we got her into therapy and took a trip to cheer her up and after a while Riley started to improve, her grades went up and she stopped getting in trouble as much at school. I tried to be consistent, I went to her soccer games, helped her with homework, and over time we developed a better relationship. Things have been great since then and the three of us have become a family, I wouldn’t change a thing about our dynamic.The thing is last week Riley came to us and confessed that she was bi and she wanted us to meet her girlfriend. I have no issue with her being bi, told her that we were proud of her and were sure that we would love her girlfriend, I started making plans to have a dinner with all of us so she could meet the family. My wife though was just quiet the whole time and staring at her daughter. My wife comes from a really religious household so maybe I should have known but she had always seemed fine with LGBTQ+ people, I guess she is one of those people who is fine with gay people existing as long as its not one of her family. She just told Riley to get out.The room got quiet, Riley and I looked at each other and I saw Riley was on the verge of tears. Her mom started yelling her, she called her some really awful things and told her that she didn’t want to look at her, she said that unless she went to a religious conversion camp that Riley had to get out of the house and she wasn’t welcome here. At this point I finally jumped in, I told Laura to stop, that we were not going to kick Riley out for being who she is and my wife started going off on me now. She told me that I was betraying her, choosing a sinner (I don’t want to write what she actually said) over her and that unless we got Riley fixed she wasn’t family anymore. I told Riley to go to her room and that Laura and I had to talk. I tried to talk Laura down but she wasn’t hearing it, she is adamant that she wants her daughter out of the house, not only that but she wants to cut Riley off completely, take back the car we gave her, stop paying for her classes and therapy. She actually blames the therapist too, and me for wanting to get her into therapy in the first place. I tried to tell her that would leave her own daughter vulnerable but she doesn’t care. She actually hopes that when Riley hits rock bottom she will come back and then we can pay for her to go to a religious conversion camp. I’m strongly opposed to these kinds of camps, and I told Laura as much. We didn’t get anywhere in our conversation and went to bed without resolving anything. I got some reading material for Laura that I thought could help but she refuses to look at it, she isn’t budging on this and wants to kick out her only daughter. I don’t think I can support this, I’m not even sure if I can look at my wife the same way. She was always so loving, but seeing how hateful she can be to her own daughter disgusts me. How can I help Laura accept her daughter? And failing that, how do I help Riley? I’m worried about her, she has been extremely depressed and crying since last night.Edit: thank you all for your comments. They made me realize what matters here. I don’t think I care about the marriage anymore I just want to help my step daughter. Can I legally force my wife to leave the house? It’s a premarital asset in my name. Any suggestions on how to have a talk with Riley and what to say so she knows I will support her no matter what would be great. Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do to cheer her up? Should I be trying to force some kind of reconciliation between her and her mother or would that just cause more damage right now? Literally anything you can think of that would make her feel better would be amazing. Also just any parenting advice for a 19 year old girl, I think I’m about to become a single father unless my wife does a complete 180 but I don’t have a lot of hope thereQuick update: My wife went to go stay with her parents for now, she still isn’t budging and thinks I’m betraying her because I’m siding with Riley. I don’t know if our marriage can ever recover but I made my choice and I don’t regret it.Had a talk with Riley to let her know that I will support her no matter what and she is always welcome in my home. Like some said she started blaming herself for the marriage issues but I let her know I couldn’t turn a blind eye to my wife’s views on this regardless, and I’d rather know and get divorced than live in ignorance. We are having a movie marathon tonight and ordering some pizza to cheer her up, her girlfriend is coming over dinner Sunday and I’m looking forward to meeting her. Riley is having a rough time, there’s been a lot of tears but she let me know how much it means to her that I’ve always been there for her. I don’t think she will want to see her mother for a while if ever which surprised me.",

      "content_preview": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years, and have lived together for a year and a half. Recently we've been talking about moving from our apartment into another one in a nicer area, but every time I search, she insists I look at 2 bedrooms because she wants her own room. I have several issues with this however.For one, she currently only pays 200 dollars out of the 1695, while I take care of the rest as well as utilities. I make about 60k whereas she makes around 30-40k, so i don't mind. But a 2BR would cost at least 2200, and whenever i tell her she's going to have to help me with more money, she gets upset.Secondly, we're essentially in a dead bedroom. She's on BC and anxiety medication, so her libido is nonexistent. So my concern is that if she has her own room, I'm essentially living with a roommate and not my girlfriend. I've also brought this up to her, and she gets upset.I feel like I already give a lot in our relationship and receive very little in return. And despite her arguments, I doubt giving her her own room would help our relationship. I'm trying to get her to understand and avoid a breakup, but things are looking to be headed that way if things persist. Is there any hope here?Edit: i appreciate all the honest responses. It seems there's a serious discussion to be had with her, but i should prepare and expect a breakup. Thanks, everyone.Edit 2: I've received a fair amount of input, and majority of you have helped me with your insight. I have zero intention of ever moving into a 2br place with her. I'll post an update at some point, most likely. Appreciate you all!",

I havenevertold him \"no\" to any of his adventures but given my situation and inability to perform many necessary functions around the house like yard maintenance, care for a dog and 7 chickens, haul garbage to curb, etc. (we live on 3 acres), I did this time.He keeps pushing me on the request and I finally told him to do whatever he felt he needed to do but that there would be repercussions to his choice of going; that I was not interested in being in a marriage with somebody who chose a vacation over taking care of his spouse.Would you let him go on his trip?

Ya’ll were right. She said I should have told her when it happened and I reassured her a dozen times nothing happened, but she said she needed time on her own and she called up her friend and gave her hell too. She asked me to leave the house for a couple days and last night I slept in the car hoping she would tell me to come back.Nope. Her friend texted me and asked to talk so she called me on the phone. I argued with her about why she would do something like that. She apologized and she told me she just kind of caught feelings fir me because she saw how well I treat my wife and she wants what I have with my wife . She knows I got kicked out and she keeps calling me and telling me I could stay at her place while my wife cools downI’m not so sure on her intentions though. What can I do moving forward now that I am sleeping in the csr and my eife is doubting me??Edit: my marriage is pretty much over.. my wife is going to divorce me. I did go an talk to her friend and she told me the truth and it hurt me deep down in my soul. My wife is in love with another man who is more established and is older and makes a lot more money than anyone in my age bracket.Her friend first told me that my wife was basically emotionally cheating snd I didn’t believe her until she showed me some semi old texts between her and my wife. She mentioned her being satisfied with me as a provider, but I wasn’t enough for her and I was too immature. I confronted my wife and she broke it to me that she is going to let things go with way me.Her friend offered me to stay at her place in the spare room while we sort things out with our lawyer and the custody of our baby. You guys can bash me all you want over me staying here for now, but I am honestly done and lost what I cared about most.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone,I’ve been with my partner for 13 years. We’ve built our lives together and gone through so many milestones. For the most part, our relationship has always felt safe, honest, and built on trust.Within the last year, he started a new job in the service industry, which naturally involves late nights and interactions with lots of people, including women. He was always very open about that, and I understood.About a month and a half ago, I saw a screenshot on his iPad of a DM he sent to a local girl on TikTok. When I asked him about it, instead of just answering, he immediately got defensive, calling me crazy, saying I didn’t trust him, and that he’s never given me a reason not to (which is true). But the way he denied and got angry made me feel like he was hiding something.I admit I let my emotions get the best of me and sent some angry, hurtful texts. After that, he told me he wanted to take a break. This was shocking to me because all I did was ask about the screenshot, and in the past he’s been very forthcoming without me needing to ask.I asked him to take a few days to cool off and think, because I thought maybe he was just reacting out of frustration. He said he still loves me and acknowledged how intertwined our lives are, but insisted he wanted space.The very next day, I noticed on his iPad that he had downloaded multiple dating apps. He doesn’t know that I saw this. Seeing that completely broke me. It felt like our 13 years together meant nothing, like he was already moving on before I could even process what was happening.I feel blindsided and heartbroken. I keep going back and forth between thinking he’s just acting out, or that maybe he’s been checked out of this relationship for a while and I just didn’t see it.Where do I go from here?",

      "content_preview": "Im '24F' married to my husband '26M' currently. We have been together for over 4 years we have a 2 year old son and a 6 month old daughter and I've never been happy with him.It feels like I'm not allowed to disagree with him about anything at all even small things like what brand of paper towels we buy. I've been walking on eggshells this whole time.After having our son i realized my husband is actually kind of a jerk. He never helped me with anything, not housework, not changing the baby, not even just keep an eye on the baby so I could go to the bathroom.Then I had our daughter via c-section. My son at the time was 35 pounds and I wasn't supposed to lift anything more than the baby for 6 weeks. My husband didnt even last a day of taking care of our toddler. The night I got home from the hospital I was already having to pick him up, change him, feed him, make dinner, clean the house, all while my husband found knew fun things to do on his computer while he was on paid family leave.I am currently a SAHM and I get that I dont bring in an income, but I just feel like too much is put on my shoulders. If it was just the kids it'd be fine but then I also have to kepe my son from making his dad upset because I dont feel like having a new hole punched in the wall.So my question is, is anyone in a genuinely happy relationship? Does it exist? Are there people who can have grown adult disagreements, that dont turn into yelling matches?As a little girl i always thought it'd be happily ever after and id be in love and treated like a lady but sadly I've found this isnt true. Im feeling super hopeless with the way things and if I left my husband id just be sad and alone for the rest of my life.",

      "content_preview": "My parent was dying of cancer and in the hospital the last month before they passed a week ago. My bf of 8 months (Tom) has been having mental and emotional crises, which escalated when I couldn't be there for him because I was the primary caretaker of my parent and then their legal guardian/medical power of attorney toward the end when they couldn't communicate.I worked 12 hour days nonstop to ensure my parent was comfortable, their financial/legal affairs were in order, and coordinating international relatives to come say their goodbyes. Watching my parent in so much pain, and sometimes terror about the pain and impending death, was unbearable. I did everything for my family so they could all just rest and grieve. All I asked from my boyfriend was to not bring negativity into a difficult situation and to just BE there for me in a neutral or helpful capacity.The day my parent was dying, Tom asked me to call him because he's being \"attacked\" by negative forces. I told him no, I have minutes to hours left with my parent. He spiraled. My parent died. Tom asked for help the day after they died. I said no, I need to plan a funeral, find a cemetery plot, etc. I told Tom he can only attend the funeral if he is emotionally balanced and doesn't take energy/resources from me, that he cannot be on his phone, and he has to find a suit (he doesn't work so he does not have nice clothes).He could not do this and did not attend the funeral. The day of the funeral, he again called and asked for help. As well as the day after. He was then upset that I didn't help him, because from his perspective, he was suffering because he was trying to help my parent but was not \"guided properly\" and therefore was made susceptible to be attacked by negativity, which is what caused Tom's agony.The past month was the hardest of my life. He wasn't there for it. I understand it is because he was also having a hard time. But I can't help but think - what if there is a future crisis, and he isn't there again? What if I'm having our baby, and he doesn't show up to the hospital? What if there is an accident?He swears he's past the worst of it and he's \"cleansed\" now. I cannot maintain smoothing over his emotional volatility, chaos and negativity for any longer.Before this, Tom was an alcoholic, but when I told him he needs to quit or I'm leaving, he did quit. Is it possible for a person to pull out of this situation too? Yes, I told him he must be in therapy if he wants to be with me, and he started the process, but hasn't gone yet.TLDR: Is Tom being absent when I needed him most enough to leave him, or do I give him another chance?",

      "content_preview": "My boyfriend and I have been together for around 5 months now and he is the sweetest, most caring man. We’ve ran into a road block that neither of us can figure out how to fix.When he was younger, his sister was raped by his mum’s boyfriend, and then a little later in life his niece was raped by another relative. Because of this, he (understandably) has some issues trusting men, especially strangers. The problem we have is he isn’t comfortable with me going for nights out with my friends without him, for fear of something bad happening and him not being there.We don’t know how to make him feel better about this. He trusts me, I trust him, it’s this external threat that would make him a nervous wreck if I went out.How do we go about making him more comfortable? Any suggestions on how to help him deal with this? How to help him feel better?Thanks guys",
