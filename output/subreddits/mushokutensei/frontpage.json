If you've been listening to them using the subscription you have some time to burn through as many as you like for now. After they leave the Plus Catalog they should still be available on the platform but you'll have to purchase individual novels with cash or credits. Just wanted to toss out a warning for anyone else working through the series on the platform like me.  Good luck!",

It felt hurt to read how many times he is going to get walked over, dumped, and left broken to deal with himself. I don't hate anyone, but my impression of Eris went from top 2 to bottom.

      "content_preview": "I decided to write up an analysis of Spiral to show my appreciation for it. As the OP starts we enter a tent, similar to the one Rudy holed himself into at the end of season 1. This establishes that the entire OP is about Rudy's inner emotions and thoughts as he dwells on his experiences so far. The first thing we see in the tent is an empty bird cage. Metaphorically, bird ages symbolize holding in your emotions out of fear, such as in Charles Bukowski's Blue Bird. One keeps the bird in the cage because he is afraid it will fly away. Rudeus' cage is already opened and he's already been hurt because of it, as when he was vulnerable with Eris and let her into his heart, she broke it. The frame changes to show what the three birds left behind to remember them, three feathers, representing the holy relic, the pendant, and the hair. From here we can see something else with a similar meaning. A spilled wine glass with a stain on the ground. The glass is a restraint just like the cage, holding in the liquid, but now that it's been spilled, it's impossible to put the liquid back in. The loss of innocence, the pain of betrayal, none of that is reversible. It leaves a permanent red-colored stain on his heart. The wine is used similarly in-episode. On his tenth birthday, Philip offers him wine and he drinks with Sara. No wine is spilled in those scenes. However in both of the scenes where he did have sex, with Eris and with Sylphie, he did spill his glass, letting those emotions out of their restraint. People have said that the white figure is Sylphie, but her long hair and lack of elf ears indicate otherwise. She's a representation of the idealized feminine, made up of pure white light. White light made up of the three primary colors, red blue and green. Rudy desires a connection with women, and this figure represents that connection with women generally. As we travel along her body, we see flashing images. A blue flash to a labyrinth with a teleportation circle and a green flash to the university library. (The order he first met them, and the location he will reunite with them.) Next we see the white figure in a field of lilies fly into the starry sky, Leaving him behind and out of reach. Lilies on the ground represents his rebirth and the starry sky represents the new heights that seem impossible to reach for. As he goes to take the hand and form a connection with her, his red-colored stain forces him to pull back and he finds himself all alone once again. His hand falls limply to the ground as barely builds the motivation to get up out of his bed. Next we see Rudeus walking forward, downtrodden. He's not looking forward, to the future, until a blue bird flies past him and leads him to the university. This is both literal, because Roxy is the one who told him to go there in the first place, but metaphorical, because Roxy represents the ability to live seriously and look towards the future instead of dwelling on your losses (which we see at both the beginning and end of season 2 Roxy helps him with.) She teaches it's possible to start \"from zero\" and to not give up on himself, so he takes a step forward and enters the university. As he walks through a hall of memories, he remembers the things he still has and we see the new friends he will meet. Many of them are reaching out for something (Zanoba for his art, Julie for freedom, and Nanahoshi for a magic circle to take her home) but they have the courage to reach out and not pull back like Rudy did. Next we see Rudy ascending a spiral staircase in the memory hallway. Thanks to his new friends, he's spiraling upwards instead of downwards (hence the title of the song, Spiral.) Here we see a red bird flying off in the opposite direction. However, both Rudy and the bird are heading upwards, representing him and Eris going on separate journeys of discovery and improvement. Next we see Elinalise clutching her pendant and looking downwards. She's accepted her lot in life (the curse) and the suffering it causes her such as separating her from her children, the pendant being the only connection she has to them. In contrast, Cliff, covered in dirt from fighting the guys spreading rumors about her, is looking upwards to a future where the curse can be cured, even if it's difficult and rough. After rescuing Sara, Rudy reaches the final destination of the memory hallway. A classroom where he's haunted by Orsted and the fear of losing everything again. A green bird flies in front of him, dropping two feathers for its two identities, Sylphiette and Fitz. Rudy's eyes light up as he follows the green bird, turning white as it flies past Luke and Ariel just like her hair. The bird leads him out of the tent from the beginning to bookend the OP. As Rudy goes outside he clutches the single green feather, representing his past memories of Sylphie in one hand. With his other hand he reaches forwards and we go back to him in the bed. He's still reaching, his hand doesn't drop and he has the feather's manifestation, the pendant around his neck. He smiles and we see the bird flying towards the stars and he remains reaching out for. With confidence, he's able to get up and continue his journey.",

Put a new perspective on turning point 2 where Orsted said Paul Greyrat never had a son. \n‚Ä¢\tMoore deceiving Rudeus during the escape from Atofe\n‚Ä¢\tPerugius‚Äôs rescue after the Atofe battle\n‚Ä¢\tRandolph encounter and the reveal that he was just helping Pax get laid in peace\n‚Ä¢\tRudeus escaping the Milis Knights‚Äô barrier, then summoning armor to finish the job\n‚Ä¢\tThe Blessed Child revealing Zenith‚Äôs perspective, and Lara‚Äôs communications with Zenith\n‚Ä¢\tGeese revealed as Man-God‚Äôs disciple. I was wondering why Geese kept calling Rudeus boss, and it put a new perspective on their first interaction in beast forest prison. \n‚Ä¢\tNanahoshi learning Rudeus‚Äôs identity\n‚Ä¢\tSara and Soldat both calling out Eris individually for the way she treated Rudeus. \n‚Ä¢\tOrsted tolerating kids‚Äô pelting\n‚Ä¢\tOrsted feeling lonely after the kids stop pelting\n‚Ä¢\tAbyssal King‚Äôs attack\n‚Ä¢\tKalman II reveal\n‚Ä¢\tKalman III and Gal Farion cornering Rudeus while in disguise, immediately revealing themselves (shouting their names) before disposing of him\n‚Ä¢\tThe next-generation gang taking care of Man-God, with Lara leading them out via teleportation Thanks for the ride!",
