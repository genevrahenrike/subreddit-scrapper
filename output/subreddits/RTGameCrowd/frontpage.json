He gains a John Coin whenever he: Pisses off a friend, 2 coins if they are a woman. Kills someone. Dan can insert a coin into the slot in Gambling Man's chest and activate his stand by pressing the button on his head. Afterwards Gambling Man will transform into a different form. The result is randomized and Dan can reroll a result once every 5 minutes with a new John Coin. Gambling Man's transformations last for 1 hour. Masaides GLA. Gambling Man transfems Into a Masaides GLA and Dan can drive it as if in Mario Kart. Item boxes will begin to spawn in the area around Dan. Gun. Gambling Man transforms into a gun with unlimited ammo, the gun is any gun Dan has used on stream in a game for at least 5 minutes. Danishiro: Gambling Man transforms into Danishiro. While in this form Gambling Man can show the networth of every indivaul he can see. If Dan kills an individual with this form he will automatically gain their networth. Minecraft: Gambling Man leaves Dan until a new John Coin is used. Cool down Timer still applies. Never Punished: While in this form Gambling Man is immune to all damage. The sirens: Gambling man will transform into a massive toad, during which if he speaks, all who hear his voice go into a panic trying to get away, with people going insane with too much exposure to the voice (pretty much hearing it for the entire 1 hour transformation, resets everyday) Mr Balatro: he transforms into a clown head/small card with a clownhead, and Dan gains an incredible amount of luck, enough to make Domino feel unlucky, particularly around gambling or card games, however if Dan stops touching the card/head he immediately loses all luck and the transformation is cancelled Feel free suggest or  new additions or edits. I wanna see if i can get to 10. Edit:6 and 7 were contributions by u/dead_headpgones_sad . Thank you.",
