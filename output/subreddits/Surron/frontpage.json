As an owner of a light bee, I feel like it handles speeds 45 mph+ better than the Bonnell (but have never tested that speed on a Bonnell). I can also put strong motorcycle tires that are essentially invulnerable to flats, which I can't do on the Bonnell. Are there any other reasons to pick the light bee, from experienced riders who might own both? Thanks in advance",
