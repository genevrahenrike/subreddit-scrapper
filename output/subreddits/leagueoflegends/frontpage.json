Sure, and while the original account in question was indeed hand leveled, they found out he had plays a number of games on purchased accounts, which was grounds for this sort of action. I personally think this is great, and having zero tolerance policy for this sort of smurfing will hopefully immediately cease content creation of the type.",

They stomp and get stomped. Every block ends 3–2 or 2-3.KC→ Pure chaos. Great with Vladi, terrible with Nisqy. And yes, Nisqy still plays full scrim blocks.Vitality→ The honey moon phase ended right after beating KC.BDS→ Not scrimming against the top 4 because those teams hate scrimming them.Heretics → The weakest playoff team. They also don’t get scrims vs top 4 and can’t beat the teams they do scrim against.Extra Info:G2→ Best team in Europe right now.MKOI→ Their scrims are still fiesta coinflips full of mistakes.FNC→ Showing improvement compared to their regular season results.KC→ (here’s the juicy part) They’re still rotating midlaners, with some blocks on Vladi and others on Nisqy. Other teams feel thatKC players try harder when Nisqy is playing, but they actually get better results with Vladi.BDS→ Top 4 (+GX) teams actively avoid scrimming them after bad experiences: showing up late, 1-hour reviews mid-block, and endless remakes.VIT→ No signs that their performance vs KC was the norm rather than a miracle. Theyshouldbeat Heretics comfortably. Important to note: MAC and PAD were reportedly told they’d be fired if Vitality don’t finish top 4.Sources:https://youtu.be/DswnfRfiAO4?t=3792https://youtu.be/N6lQgVCMVBo?t=1813",

A lot of work went in from everyone all year long, so it's great that all of it paid off.Now up next is EMEA masters where we have decided to compete to try to achieve the first ever Golden road in tier 2 league.After that, I have no clue where LR will go. The team was started as a fun content idea this time last year between myself, Baus & Nemesis. The size that it's grown to and the amount of support for the team is absolutely unimaginable. And with that in mind, I really want to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible and not repeat what we've done this year.Taking it to the next level for next year so far has been a challenge. Towards the end of the year, I'll do a long video to give insights about most things that have happened behind the scenes and ideas that were floated around. Lots and lots of discussions over the last few months in attempts to open up doors for next year have started closing, and there has been endless barriers. But there's still a promise of possibilities for next year, so fingers crossed we can find the right direction 🤞2025 will always be remembered in my mind as the year of Los Ratones regardless ❤️ This group of players has been absolutely magical to work with in my first year of coaching, and they're all so incredibly talented.For now, eyes on the Golden Road or, I guess, Silver Road ?And then, hopefully, we will have a plan ready for next year 😌There's been a lot of discourse on whether Los Ratones will proceed to EMEA Masters or do content instead on a bootcamp in Korea. I honestly think this is better, having a definite competition and goal to work on will be more interesting for me since there are stakes. I am curious on how Caedrel will balance being a Costreamer for Worlds and being a Coach (assuming they go far again this time). What are you guys' thoughts on this?",

      "content_preview": "It feels like returning to the days of NA and EU LCS, where we had to base our entire schedule around when the Americans were playing. To think that Riot is running two of the biggest esports in the world but can't be bothered to make a second studio is absurd. It would be unheard of in any other serious sport, especially one with this level of budget behind it: Imagine a tennis event being rescheduled cause they have to use the same arena to run paddle that weekend, when the arena was built to play tennis!The schedule is already a mess, and now I have to check every week for if the games are randomly played on a Tuesday instead? Patently ridiculous. If you can't run the two games at the same time, which a company of Riot's size absolutely should be able to, then at least prioritize the game you actuallybuilt the studio for.Riot's released documentaries in the past about how they can have event spaces ready for Worlds in a month, but Riot can't be bothered to set up an alternate venue for Valorant in case of conflict clashes?Ridiculous.",

      "content_preview": "Hello!I play League of Legends for 10 years and I have had my periods of being stuck - sometimes for long periods of time in lower divisions. I am not saying that the game doesn't have some problems like smurfs ruining low elo, people purposefully slow inting games or how the itemization for some champions suck, but until these start to become real problems there's a lot a player can do to improve their playstyle.So, here's my list of what things a player should or not should do in order to increase their winrate :=>Don't play if you are tired. If you played a game take a break, at least for a few minutes. Clear your mind, relax. Don't push yourself in a streak of games, especially if you are on a losing streak. The fatigue and accumulated frustration will only cloud your strategies and patience.=>Don't be greedy. Most of the comebacks come from opponents getting cocky and being greedy, exposing themselves in unfavorable positions. Wait for them to do this mistake and punish them for it, take the shutdown gold and scale to close the gap.=>Be positive. Contrary to the belief that you shouldn't use chat, in fact, use it. Try to calm down teammates that are flaming each other. Sometimes it doesn't work, I know, but there are instances where it can work and that just means an extra chance of winning that costs you nothing.=>If you feel like you're gonna lose a game, like, it's a feeling that suddenly comes out, then you should probably dodge. Like, seeing a Nunu support instalocking with ghost and clearence or having them already flame in champion select due to support not giving the mid his pick position.=>Play champions you are the most comfortable with. Your mechanical and micro movements skill expression will be better even against a counter than playing a champion you barely know how to move with. Have a rotation pool for at least 3 champions you knew really well for different situations such as when your team needs a tank, an AP or an AD.=>Focus to end the games. Don't try to stall a game for trying an 1v5 pentakill. Pentakills are great dopamine rush cocktails but they are quite rare to achieve due to how many things are out of your control. It's enough for a Malzahar to flash and R you and your quadrakill/pentakill is gone but also you gave your enemies some gold to scale and comeback.=>If you play with a duo try to maximize the cooperation between you by playing either adc + supp or top and mid. Avoid playing jungle or any other combination. Why is that? Because as top and mid, if you can pick late game champions and just farm, you have a better chance of controlling how enemies are getting fed and you both can keep an even pressure on the map. If one of you goes alone as adc or supp, they rely on a random that might not perform as expected so there's wasted potential.At least that would be it from my experience. Applying some of these tips should improve one's winrate from 30-40% to 60-75%, that of course, until they reach their peak division. What other advice would you add on that list and how well or potent these advices do you think are?Thanks.",
