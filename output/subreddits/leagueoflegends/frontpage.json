A lot of work went in from everyone all year long, so it's great that all of it paid off.Now up next is EMEA masters where we have decided to compete to try to achieve the first ever Golden road in tier 2 league.After that, I have no clue where LR will go. The team was started as a fun content idea this time last year between myself, Baus & Nemesis. The size that it's grown to and the amount of support for the team is absolutely unimaginable. And with that in mind, I really want to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible and not repeat what we've done this year.Taking it to the next level for next year so far has been a challenge. Towards the end of the year, I'll do a long video to give insights about most things that have happened behind the scenes and ideas that were floated around. Lots and lots of discussions over the last few months in attempts to open up doors for next year have started closing, and there has been endless barriers. But there's still a promise of possibilities for next year, so fingers crossed we can find the right direction 🤞2025 will always be remembered in my mind as the year of Los Ratones regardless ❤️ This group of players has been absolutely magical to work with in my first year of coaching, and they're all so incredibly talented.For now, eyes on the Golden Road or, I guess, Silver Road ?And then, hopefully, we will have a plan ready for next year 😌There's been a lot of discourse on whether Los Ratones will proceed to EMEA Masters or do content instead on a bootcamp in Korea. I honestly think this is better, having a definite competition and goal to work on will be more interesting for me since there are stakes. I am curious on how Caedrel will balance being a Costreamer for Worlds and being a Coach (assuming they go far again this time). What are you guys' thoughts on this?",

An employee might have thought that the skin was already limited. If so, I hope Riot realize that.There's already more than enough limited content in the game.",

They stomp and get stomped. Every block ends 3–2 or 2-3.KC→ Pure chaos. Great with Vladi, terrible with Nisqy. And yes, Nisqy still plays full scrim blocks.Vitality→ The honey moon phase ended right after beating KC.BDS→ Not scrimming against the top 4 because those teams hate scrimming them.Heretics → The weakest playoff team. They also don’t get scrims vs top 4 and can’t beat the teams they do scrim against.Extra Info:G2→ Best team in Europe right now.MKOI→ Their scrims are still fiesta coinflips full of mistakes.FNC→ Showing improvement compared to their regular season results.KC→ (here’s the juicy part) They’re still rotating midlaners, with some blocks on Vladi and others on Nisqy. Other teams feel thatKC players try harder when Nisqy is playing, but they actually get better results with Vladi.BDS→ Top 4 (+GX) teams actively avoid scrimming them after bad experiences: showing up late, 1-hour reviews mid-block, and endless remakes.VIT→ No signs that their performance vs KC was the norm rather than a miracle. Theyshouldbeat Heretics comfortably. Important to note: MAC and PAD were reportedly told they’d be fired if Vitality don’t finish top 4.Sources:https://youtu.be/DswnfRfiAO4?t=3792https://youtu.be/N6lQgVCMVBo?t=1813",

To think that Riot is running two of the biggest esports in the world but can't be bothered to make a second studio is absurd. It would be unheard of in any other serious sport, especially one with this level of budget behind it: Imagine a tennis event being rescheduled cause they have to use the same arena to run paddle that weekend, when the arena was built to play tennis!The schedule is already a mess, and now I have to check every week for if the games are randomly played on a Tuesday instead? Patently ridiculous. If you can't run the two games at the same time, which a company of Riot's size absolutely should be able to, then at least prioritize the game you actuallybuilt the studio for.Riot's released documentaries in the past about how they can have event spaces ready for Worlds in a month, but Riot can't be bothered to set up an alternate venue for Valorant in case of conflict clashes?Ridiculous.",

Just throw everything and the kitchen sink at an immovable sponge of a boss with lame mechanics (with ocasional pumpkins in the mix), all while dodging endless variations of projectile spheres.Enemies with inflated HP aren’t fun in shooters, and they’re just as lame in Doombots.",

      "content_preview": "Damn, I’ve never been this disappointed and upset about something I ordered.First of all, you have to assemble the statue yourself. It comes in four separate pieces, and you basically have to build your own figure.The Ahri figure doesn’t sit firmly — it’s loose. Whenever you try to rotate the statue, all that really happens is Ahri shifts to the side and pops off the base. The parts don’t properly lock together like I’m used to with other figures; instead, they’re just held together by magnets.On top of that, it arrived broken. Some pieces of her clothing literally fell off the moment I took it out of the box. Thankfully, I recorded the unboxing.The statue itself feels incredibly cheap. The red orb in her hand is slightly transparent, but it’s full of air bubbles and even has dirt or dust inside.Her fingernails look awful too — the paint goes right over the nails onto her fingers.Inside her coat there’s also some kind of dust or dirt stuck in the paint. I honestly don’t know if I received a prototype or if they actually thought this was acceptable to sell. That’s just insane.I really hope I can get a refund or an exchange for a higher-quality version, because honestly — this cost me $320, and if I had known what the quality was like, I wouldn’t have paid more than $50, if that.Edit:Here you can see glue residue, the messy paint on the nails, and dirt trapped inside the orb.Here you can see how badly her neck is painted + how poorly it's made.Here you can see the broken part.Edit 2:My confusion — if you can even call it that — doesn’t come from the fact that I had to assemble the statue. That’s NOT the problem. The issue is that the figure doesn’t stay together properly; it’s loose and wobbly the moment you touch it. The magnets are very weak, and I honestly think this could have been done so much better. It has nothing to do with laziness — I just find it crazy.On top of that, I own the Spirit Blossom Ahri figure, which doesn’t have any of these issues. That one is far more solid, much higher in quality, and looks exactly like the 3D render.Small addition: The fur on her back, where the tail comes out, is also loose and I’m worried it might fall off as well.",
