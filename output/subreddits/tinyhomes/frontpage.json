      "content_preview": "I converted our attic into a small studio about 420 square feet and fought hot peaks in the afternoon and chilly mornings. I went with a 12000 btu mini split after checking insulation and window area and placed the indoor unit on a gable wall to avoid short cycling across the slope. For installation I mapped a short line set run to the soffit, used a proper wall sleeve, planned a continuous downhill condensate route, and had a licensed tech pull vacuum and opened the precharged system to keep the warranty intact. Cooling is finally even across the room and the sleep timer keeps nights steady without blasting cold air. For anyone who has done an attic setup, did you size up due to heat gain from the roof or did proper shading and a reflective underlayment let you stay at 12000 btu?",

Right now, it’s set up with the kitchen appliances along the wall, but because of the open flow and windows, I keep imagining it as more of a cozy living area instead. The wood ceiling makes it feel warm, and I can picture a couch and a small table fitting nicely here. For those of you living in tiny homes, do you think it’s better to keep this as a kitchen since it’s already started that way, or would converting it into a living room be more practical long-term? I’d love to hear how others approached similar spaces in their layouts.",

      "content_preview": "It just also seems like the most perfect house. The idea of living in such a small space sounds amazing. I think I'm the opposite of claustrophobic lol but I'm also a minimalist. My plan is to build a 200sqft / 61sqm house. It would be slightly bigger than the bedroom I've lived in since I was a kid (I still live with my parents), but if you add in the bathroom it would be about the same size maybe a little smaller. My current bedroom is absolutely perfect and it's actually very empty (it's 165sqft / 50 sqm). The fact that it costs much less than a normal house and that there is very little house to heat/cool so utilities aren't quite as expensive makes it even better. Not sure how much building the house would cost though. Is $30k USD not counting land realistic in the US assuming I'm living in an average-priced city? Does anyone else feel the same?",

      "content_preview": "Hello! So i will start off by being completely upfront and specify this is a situation out of need rather then a want. Due to personal medical reasons i can not live on my own so i decided to buy a shed which is a 12x32 barn style. Putting it on the land my family owns so i can be closer to them for support while being independent as i can be. I got the shed as a brand new repo so the payments are very small for something that is quite nice, as it already has the basic wiring and electric package as well with a breaker box. Making it something i could afford. (Not intending to brag but to add context to the situation.) Now, however, i am stuck at the point where i am a bit lost. I know i need: Insulation Vapor barrier (I live in the humid south) Green board/dry wall (All all the stuff to do that) Shower and bathroom stuff. (We already have plumbing and septic tank figured out) Kitchen? New front doors (barn ones are horrid to insulate i heard) and new windows to double paned. Is there anything else i need? I know i should have done more research before the contract was signed and i paid the money for it. As i see everyone saying not to buy the type i did, but i really need to make this work. I wanted to come here to people who have likely seen others make mistakes or lived them yourself so that i can try and avoid them.  For example i saw someone say they needed to pull the siding off to put house wrap to prevent condensation. Any advice is welcome, i only ask that comments like \"Just sell it and rent\" or \"Just live with your family in their house\" be avoided as that is not an option as i am already doing that and have nothing but a couch essentially and i work late and long days from home. Causing tension in my family. The goal i am trying to reach for clarification: Livable and able to keep cool without it being hundreds a month Prevent mold and rot Comfortable and accessible for someone with mobility issues Cost efficient and doesn't break the bank. I wanted to thank everyone in advanced for any and all replies. This means everything to me. Thank you.",

Here are the questions we have so far: Anyone know of any contractors that build tiny homes in/around crown point, IN? To buy a plot of land to build on, is there a single type of loan to cover the land and the construction together? Or do we need a lot loan first, then a construction loan after that? We are not looking at land owned by a developer. We have found blueprints we want to build from online already (a 625 sqr ft home with a basement for our home, the primary, and a 395 sqr ft AUD for the backyard as a guest home for my elderly mother for when she visits on weekends). Any recommendations or suggestions would be amazing and extremely appreciated.",

Everything seems perfect but the actual trailer and chasis seems to have some surface level rust setting in and I'm wondering if that a big big problem, I intend to contact some trailer builders nearby and maybe look for a caravan seller or manufacturer to see what can be done but just throwing this out to see if anyone has any advice. I don't have pictures of the issues but it's fairly extensive rust that seems to be solely surface level, it certainly does not seem like a  structural issue. Thank you in advance for any help.",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone! I’m very new to the tiny house discussion, so I appreciate your time and expertise. I grew up in poverty, and was very housing insecure growing up. I’m an only child who was raised by a single parent who truly sacrificed everything for me, it’s just really hard to raise a child by yourself these days. (Which I’m sure you understand!) I’ve always known that I’d eventually have to finance my mom’s retirement and/or housing. Now that I’ve purchased my first home, I’m doing more research on what it would look like to find sustainable, long-term housing for my mom. With the cost of living these days, it’s much more financially feasible for me to build an ADU/Tiny Home on my current property than for me to buy a separate investment property. (Which are easily ~$250K where I live.) So, a few questions: Is a tiny home a solid option, or should I try to go for an investment property? If you’ve build a tiny home on your property for a family member, do you have any advice or warnings? Do y’all have any builder recommendations for tiny homes that would fit comfortably on a 9250 square foot lot? A little less than half of that is our back yard (if my math is even slightly correct). Looking for something well-made and pretty, as I live in a neighborhood with lots of pride of ownership and some pretty rigorous aesthetic standards. (Nothing too specific, but whatever we ordered would have to be approved by the HOA’s Architectural Review Board.)",
