      "content_preview": "Hi all, we are in southwestern Virginia, Zone 7A. We've been smothering a section of our front yard through the summer ‚Äì¬†all the grass seems to be dead! We are now hoping to order plugs in the next week for an October 1st planting. I've been using Roy Diblik's \"Know Maintenance Perennial Garden\" and Benjamin Vogt's \"Prairie Up\" as inspiration ‚Äì hence the very dense planting with grasses woven throughout. Our soil seems to be mostly clay with some loam at the top (apologies if this isn't the right terminology ‚Äì¬†rookie here!) This is on a very slight slope in essentially full sun ‚Äì¬†sunnier in the morning and shadier in the afternoon. This section is bordered by walkways and our driveway. This is section is roughly 500 sq. ft ‚Äì 55' x 19' x 58' Below you'll see our Draft plan (a triangular layout of grasses and perennials) Key describing the plants in the plan, along with our questions My main questions are: What grass should we use for the matrix? We were hoping for prairie dropseed, but we've heard soil may need to be drier. Deschampsia goldtau was recommended ‚Äì¬†any thoughts? Also considering \"Cape Breeze\" switchgrass, a shorter variety, though many folks think it will still be too tall. Any other ideas? Is this too many types of perennials for our space? Should we pare down? Should the \"drifts\" of perennials be larger? (More perennials per drift?) Are we well balanced with bloom time? I'm very interested in adding smooth aster (currently in the plan) and showy goldenrod (not yet in the plan) but worried they'll spread ‚Äì¬†any thoughts? Potential additions or replacements: Sedum, cosmos, Joe Pye weed, butterfly weed, catmint, lanceleaf tickseed, gillenia trifolata ‚Äì¬†any feedback on those is helpful too. All thoughts are very welcome. Thank you! Draft layout of grasses and perennials Key for draft layout",

I am not someone who has achieved a NoLawn. Far from it. We bought this home in 2022 and the previous owner was a landscaper who had a full monoculture lawn. We've let it go a bit and I'm sure it's not great that the front lawn is full of weeds and clover and crabgrass. But in the back yard, amidst the rose bushes, some milkweed popped up and because I follow this subreddit, I let it grow. Nothing really happened last year but some aphids. This year though... I have had the privilege of seeing two monarch caterpillars and what I think is a ladybug pupa? I just love how typewriter-like the little caterpillar is as it munches through the leaves. :D",

It doesn't hold standing water, it just is muddy and any attempt to mow will just cause ruts. It's a great spot for an unmowed prairie type area. I have some swap oak trees planted there as well. I might mow it once or twice a summer. I am looking for something that will look good when left unmowed. I would think it might need to be a cool season grass.",

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôve let my lawn grow wild this summer because my daughter loves picking the weedy flowers and I hate the culture of 1/4‚Äù lawns. Well this fine Saturday morning 3 of my neighbors got on their riding mowers and mowed MY ENTIRE LAWN. No permission was asked. My husband really doesn‚Äôt want to make enemies with our neighbors but said he would call the cops if I wished. I‚Äôm not a confrontational person sadly. But I‚Äôm so heartbroken. Is there anything I can plant this fall on our neighborly borders that will pop up in the spring to surprise them? ETA: my lawn was mostly clovers, weedy flowers, and corn stalks. We live near fields of it and some found their way into our yard. When my husband went to speak with them about sparing the corn they told him they were going to cut all of it no matter what he said. ETA 2: I think we‚Äôre beyond being friendly neighbors. Aside from the fact that they didn‚Äôt ask us about it, I forgot what I now realize was an important detail. These 3 men had their wives and kids watch them mow our lawns. To me that states that they already don‚Äôt like us. This was an effort to humiliate us into complying with what they think lawns should look like. Anything we do to ‚Äúmake amends‚Äù from here will confirm in their minds that we‚Äôve been handled and aren‚Äôt worth respect. Bottom line this was DISRESPECTFUL.",

      "content_preview": "My Advice: Do Your Research Before Starting a ‚ÄúNo Mow,‚Äù ‚ÄúBee Lawn,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPollinator-Friendly‚Äù Lawn Mid-West, Hardiness zone 4 If you‚Äôre thinking of making big changes to your lawn, take some time to research first. Over the last three years, we‚Äôve been transitioning our lawn into a pollinator-friendly space. When we hired a lawn care company a few years ago, we were shocked by the amount of chemicals and herbicides they used. That experience pushed us to try something different. We started by adding a bit of micro clover to our lawn‚Äîwithout fully understanding the timing, temperature, watering, mowing requirements, or other factors that impact lawn care. Despite that, the clover still worked and looked great. To keep this post from getting too long or complicated, here are a few key lessons we‚Äôve learned: What is a bee lawn? To me, it's a traditional-looking lawn with short flowering plants mixed in‚Äîplants that can tolerate mowing and require less water and maintenance. Intermittent mowing helps. Even micro clover can grow quite tall. If grass and clover grow too much, they become difficult to manage, hard to mow, and can attract critters. Mowing extends bloom time. Regular mowing removes dried-out flower heads and encourages more blooming. Add turfgrass. Fine fescue or Kentucky bluegrass can help fill in the lawn. We found fine fescue better‚Äîit needs less watering. We had large bare spots without grass; clover looked good at first but eventually died off, leaving room for weeds and a patchy lawn. Creeping thyme hasn‚Äôt worked well for us. We‚Äôre in the Midwest and still trying to get it established. We plan to try other flowering plants. Self-heal is next on our list. Don‚Äôt mow too short in late summer. We learned this the hard way‚Äîour lawn was overtaken by crabgrass after a short mow during a hot spell. In summary: If you want a low-maintenance, low-mow, and low-water lawn, aim for a drought-resistant turfgrass mix (like fine fescue), clover, and low-growing flowering plants that can be mowed. And never mow shorter than 3 inches.  Do your own research since my advice can change as I learn more.",

I called the city and of course no one who deals with those violations is available to speak to me. They'll \"call me.\" The cherry on top is that the violation was noted two days ago with the requirement to fix by yesterday, hung on a door that is almost never used! So I didn't see it till this morning. To say that I was fuming when I saw it is an understatement. But now it's time to put emotions aside and take action while I wait for this supposed callback. I am hopeful that the notice is just in regards to a few plants I have let get a bit over six inches on the boulevard. I am worried that it's more than that and the city will cut down my beloved garden then charge me for it. I moved my certified pollinator garden sign to a more prominent location. I am going to seek out additional certifications/signs to display and educate. I will ensure the boulevard is at or below six inch regulation (gotta wait for those weed whacker batteries to recharge). I have a friend who is a city engineer contractor who is familiar with interpreting and being in compliance with codes who I have reached out to. I am a master gardener and member of the local garden club so can utilize those resources if necessary. I know the county extension agent and can reach out to her for assistance if needed. What am I missing? What else can I do? Thank you for any help/resources!",

We'd prefer to replace the grass with something he doesn't have to do anything with (or maybe once or twice a season with either trimming or cutting it back). On the other side of the property line is the neighbor's driveway. We'd prefer to not have anything lean over to his side, because he's a cool old dude, keeps to himself, and he maintains his driveway and property like a park. I don't want to cause him any stress. I was thinking grasses that grow kinda long but I don't want it to spread to a gravel driveway. Thoughts? Image here: https://imgur.com/a/d5ZxqY4 EDIT: Full sun most of the day.",

      "content_preview": "I don‚Äôt have a lawn, but whenever I‚Äôm driving in the rain and see sprinklers blasting away, it agitates me furiously. It feels like such a waste of water. I know rain sensors exist, and of course, people can just pay attention and turn their systems off when it‚Äôs raining, but realistically, not everyone does that. Has anyone found good alternatives to the classic rain sensor? Are there better systems or approaches for water-efficient irrigation that don‚Äôt require people to be so on top of it? Additionally, when it comes to city or commercial properties, I sometimes see clearly busted sprinklers that flood the sidewalk or street. Who would I even talk to about that? Do you report it to the city, the water department, or property management? Would love to hear what solutions people have come across!!",
