      "content_preview": "(SECOND EDIT WITH RESOLUTION) Turns out my original source dataframe was actually grouped rowwise for some reason, so the function was essentially trying to take the mean and standard deviation within each row, resulting in NA values for every row in the dataframe.  Now that I've removed the grouping, everything's working as expected. Thanks for the troubleshooting help! (EDITED BECAUSE ENTERED TOO SOON) I built a workflow for cleaning some data that included a couple of functions designed to standardize and reverse score variables.  Yesterday, when I was cleaning up my script to get it ready to share, I realized the functions were no longer working and were returning NAs for all cases.  I haven't been able to effectively figure out what's going wrong, but they have worked great in the past and I didn't change anything else that I know of. Ideas for troubleshooting what might have caused these functions to stop working and/or to fix them?  I tried troubleshooting with AI, but didn't get anything particularly helpful, so I figured humans might be the better avenue for help. For context, I'm working in RStudio (2025-05-01, Build 513) ## Example function: z_standardize <- function(x) {\n  var_mean <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n  std_dev <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n  return((x - var_mean) / std_dev)   # EDITED AS I WAS MISSING PARENTHESES\n  } ## Properties of a variable it is broken for: > str(df$wage)\n num [1:4650] 5.92 8 5.62 25 9.5 ...\n - attr(*, \"value.labels\")= Named num(0) \n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr(0) \n\n> summary(wage)\n wage   \n Min.   :  1.286  \n 1st Qu.: 10.000  \n Median : 12.821  \n Mean   : 15.319  \n 3rd Qu.: 16.500  \n Max.   :107.500  \n NA's   :405 ## It's broken when I try this: df_test <- df %>% mutate(z_wage = z_standardize(wage)) > summary(df_test$z_wage)\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The code below is an example of what I'm working on. If I don't add a fill color to geom_label() , then the labels are plotted correctly with each bar. However, when I add the line fill = \"white\" to geom_label() , the labels revert back to the position they would be in with a stacked bar chart. The image in this post shows what I get when I add that white fill. Does anybody know a way to keep those labels positioned above each bar?

Also, since I'm not really a heavy R user I'm also curious about the following from the community: what R/RStudio can provide that is still essential that prevent you from migrating to other languages and IDEs, such as Python +VScode? where the AI integrations are usually much better.

The groups vary in order of magnitude between 10 respondents up to 4000 respondents. How do I sensibly provide a measure of uncertainty so my audience gets a clear understanding of the variability associated with each score? Initial research suggested that parametric measures of uncertainty would not be appropriate given the groups can be so small. Over half of all responses come from groups that have less than 25 respondents. So the approach would need to be robust for small groups. Open to bayesian approaches. Thanks in advance!",

Today, however, its relevance appears to be gradually waning. What lessons can R developers draw from Julia’s trajectory? I propose two key points: First, build on established foundations by deeply integrating with C and C++, rather than relying heavily on elaborate just-in-time (JIT) compilation strategies. Leveraging robust, time-tested technologies can enhance functionality and reliability without introducing unnecessary technical complications. Second, acknowledge and embrace R’s role as a specialized programming language tailored for statistical computing and data analysis. Exercise caution when considering additions intended to make R more general-purpose; such complexities risk diluting its core strengths and compromising the simplicity that users value.",

My study is a 3 (Group; between) × 3 (Phase/Measurement; within) × 2 (Order of phase presentation; between) mixed design. I initially tried an R simulation, as I know that GPower is not very precise for mixed repeated-measures ANOVAs. However, my supervisors feel it is too complex and that we might be underpowered anyway, so, under the suggestion of our uni statistician, I am using a mixed ANOVA (repeated measures with a between-subjects factor) in GPower instead. We don't account for the within factor as he said it is implied in the repeated measure design. I’ve entered all the values (alpha, effect size, power) and specified 6 groups to reflect the Group × Order cells. My question is: does the total sample size that G Power returns assume equal allocation of participants across the 6 groups, or not? From what I understand, in G Power’s repeated-measures ANOVA modules you cannot enter unequal cell sizes, so the reported total N should correspond to equal n per group. However, I’m not entirely sure. Does anyone know of an explicit source or documentation that confirms this? Thank you very much in advance ☺️",

When I view the data frame, the row numbers came from the original data frame, so row numbers go into the thousands, despite it having only 738 rows. I'm trying to get the row number for a datetime.

I have a codebase that looks like: > data_extraction\n  > extract_1.R\n  > extract_2.R\n> data_prep\n  > prep_1.R\n  > prep_2.R\n> modelling\n  > ...\n> my_codebase.Rproj\n>.Rprofile Each script requires that its immediate parent directory be the working directory when running the script. Maybe not best practise but I'm working with what I have. This is fairly easy to run in RStudio. I can run each script, and hit Set Working Directory when moving from one subdirectory to the next. After each script I can restart R to clear the global environment. Upon restarting R, I guess RStudio looks to the project root (as determined by the Rproj file) and finds/sources the .Rprofile. This is not the case in Positron. If my active directory is data_prep , then when restarting the R session, .Rprofile will not be sourced. This is an issue when working with renv , and leads to an annoying workflow requiring me to run setwd() far more often. Does anybody know a nice way around this? To get Positron to recognise a project root separate from the current active directory? The settings have a project option: terminal.integrated.cwd , which (re-)starts the terminal at the root directory only. This doesn't seem to apply to the R session, however. Options I've considered are: .Rprofile in every subdirectory - seems nasty Write a VSCode extension to do this - I don't really want to maintain something like this, and I'm not very good at JS. File Github issue, wait - I'll do this if nobody can help here Rewrite the code so all file paths are relative to the project root - lots of work across multiple codebases but probably a good idea",

      "content_preview": "oRm is inspired by sqlalchemy. I kept wanting to reach for an ORM solution to provide a backend for things like interactive shiny tables or reproducible data entry. So, as they say \"be the change you want to see in the world.\" For those not previously introduced to ORM, it's an object oriented approach to CRUD operations via objects (rows) and their related data (foreign keys). You can think of oRm like a wrapper that takes your tried and true DBI connection methods and dbplyr filtering syntax to make R6 mutable objects. And once you have your objects, the real magic happens in the relationships. you can jump straight to the pkdown site here . A couple of points to get out of the way before I give an example: This package is not for analysis and statistical work, it's not for reading large tables (though it can), and it doesn't seek to improve on or compete with dbplyr, in fact I use dbplyr under the hood so I can rely on their dialect agnostic syntax as much as possible. Yes, reticulate does make sqlalchemy very easy to port into any R work. But what if you just don't know python very well, and / or don't want a .Renviron and a .env , and .renv/ and a .venv/ in your project? And a couple of features that I'm not going to get to in this post, but are likely to interest some people: with.Engine allows for a managed transaction state with automatic rollback in case of failure. on delete and on update support for related objects. Some dialect specific support, for example making use of a flush() method and RETURNING for postgres backends. Okay, now show me what it looks like Sure thing. oRm uses a few key objects: Engine: your db connection TableModel: a model representing a sql table Record: an object that represents a row in a table Relationships: mappings between TableModels that define how observations are linked together. The example below is based on the idea of having a data team entering measurements of plant heights during the course of an experiment. Engine The engine uses DBI under the hood. So the syntax should be very familiar, some might even say the exact same to what you're used to. This example uses SQLite, but you should be able to plop whatever driver you want in there. library(oRm)\n\nengine <- Engine$new(\n  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),\n  dbname = \":memory:\",\n  persist = TRUE # this arg is sqlite memory specific, not always needed\n) Your engine will manage opening and closing connections for you. You can also implicitly create a managed pool with the argument use_pool=TRUE . There are a few methods that you might find useful from your engine itself, but for the most part you just define it and leave it be. TableModel You can use the TableModel$new() method, but I like the hierarchical structure of building my table model off the engine it relies on. Defining a TableModel you give a table name and a list of Columns. Measurements <- engine$model(\n  tablename = \"measurements\",\n  id = Column(\"INTEGER\", primary_key = TRUE),\n  observer_id = Column(\"INTEGER\"),\n  plant_id = ForeignKey(\"INTEGER\", references = 'plants.id'),\n  measurement_date = Column(\"DATE\"),\n  measurement_value = Column(\"REAL\")\n)\nMeasurements$create_table() Records Again, you can define a Record$new() but I like to make my records from the TableModel they came from. m1 = Measurements$record(\n  observer_id = 1,\n  plant_id = 101,\n  measurement_date = as.Date(\"2025-07-30\"),\n  measurement_value = 14.2\n)\n# and after we have m1, we need to explicitly create it in the db\nm1$create() At this point, we have our object representing a single row. If you go no further, this will give you CRUD functionality at the row level. The methods assigned to a Record are named to align with CRUD: m1$create()\nm1$update(measurement_value = 15)\n# m1$delete() The 'R' belongs to the table, since you're reading from there. Here's an example to get our m1 object from the table itself. You can use dbplyr filter syntax here. m1_read = Measurements$read(observer_id == 1, mode = 'get')\nm1_read If you've gotten this far, I'm going to consider you formally interested and refer you to the pkdown site for seeing the Relationships in action. This post mirrors that documenation, so you'll pick up right where you left off here.",

I then calculate a distance matrix, and perform hierarchical clustering. To plot the dendrogram I use: fviz_dend(hcr, cex = 0.5, horiz = TRUE, main = \"Dendrogram - ward.D2\") This gives me the dendrogram, but labelled with the line number in the file, rather than the distillery name. How do I make the dendrogram use the distillery name? Happy to provide the full CSV file if this helps.",

The second is a large DF with other events and their dates (date_2). I am interested in creating a third DF of the events in DF2 that happened within 7 days of DF1’s events. Both DFs have person IDs and DF1 is the primary analytic file, I’m building. I tried a fuzzy join but from a memory standpoint this isn’t feasible. I know there’s data.table approaches (or think there may be), but primarily learned R with base R + tidyverse so am less certain about that. I’ve chatted with the LLMs, would prefer to not just vibe code my way out. I am a late in life coder as my primary work is in medicine, so I’m learning as I go. Any tips?",

For example, say I'm collecting data on conductivity and chloride (Cl-) concentrations (both in the field and in the lab) and making a linear regression model to find if there is correlation (model: Cl = β1EC + u). Let's say that the actual relationship between Cl- and conductivity is a prefect correlation. When the sample size is small, I would imagine that the data in the field will a much larger p-value, as though the 2 are actually perfectly correlated, the residuals from field data will be a lot larger (due to omitted variables*), so the p-value of the coefficient will be a lot smaller.  However, as the sample size increases, the difference in residual coefficient from the lab model and the field model should decrease, I think. Is my understanding correct? If not, what have I misunderstood? Also, the smaller the p-value, the smaller the residuals, so the smaller the R 2 value, right? * Omitted variables could (from what I understand) lead to omitted variable bias (so the coefficients will be inaccurate).

I always get frustrated when I have the occasional need to merge PDF files and/or remove or rotate certain pages. Like most others, our corporate-default Acrobat Reader does not have these built-in features (why?), and we cannot use external websites to handle any sensitive info. Collectively, the world must've wasted many, many hours on this issue trying to find an acceptable workaround (e.g. finding a colleague that has the professional Adobe Acrobat, or wait for IT to install it on their own laptop). It's 2025 and no one else should suffer any more. So I've created an app called PDF Combiner that does exactly that. It is fast, free, and secure . Anyone with access to R can load this up locally in less than a minute, and no installation is required (other than a few common packages). Until Adobe decides to step up their game, this does the job. 🌐 Online demo 💻 GitHub",

      "content_preview": "I am a senior majoring in Political Science (BA) at a DC school. My school is somewhat unique in the land of theoretical-based Political Science degrees and I have taken 6 econ classes as well as a TA position with a micro class (earning a minor), a introductory statistics course, as well as having learned SPSS through a quantitative-based research class. However, I feel this is still not enough to justify a valuable, competitive skill set as SPSS is not widely used anymore it seems and other than that, what can I say... I can read and analyze well? So this is my dilemma and I find myself wanting to add another semester (I was supposed to graduate early this December so this wont really delay my plans, just my wallet) and take both an R-studio class and Python class. I would also add a data analytics class that develops a research paper with multiple coding programs. Is it a good idea to pursue a more statistical route? Any advice about this area helps. I loved my research class and messing with datasets and SPSS even tho it's a piece of shit on my computer. I want to be competitive for graduate schools and the job market and my career advisors have told me that polisci and policy analysis is going down a more quantitative route.",

I want to plot the means per season for each year in a geom_point(). I have Year and Season as two factors, and mean Temperature as my dependent variable. Is there a way to plot this so i have the seasons in order over the years (so 2005: spring, summer, autumn, winter; 2006: spring, summer, autumn, winter; etc)? I have tried making a combined Year_Season factor, but then it just keeps ordering itself by season, so i get all the springs of every year first, etc...",

      "content_preview": "Good morning, I have a question regarding Conway-Maxwell Poisson and pseduo-R2. In R, I have fitted a model using glmmTMB as such: richness_glmer_Full <- glmmTMB(richness ~ vl100m_cs + roads100m_cs + (1 | neighbourhood/site), data = df_Bird, family = \"compois\", na.action = \"na.fail\") I elected to use a COMPOIS due to evidence of underdispersion. COMPOIS mitigates the issue of underdispersion well, but my concern lies in the subsequent calculation of pseudo-R2: r.squaredGLMM(richness_glmer_Full) R2m R2c [1,] 0.06240816 0.08230917 I'm skeptical that the model has such low explanatory power (models fit with different error structures show much higher marginal R2). Am I correct in assuming that using a COMPOIS error structure leads to these low pseudo-R2 values (i.e., something related to the computation of pseudo-R2 with COMPOIS leads to deflated values). Any insight for this humble ecologist would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

With Python I like one line does one thing code even if you end up with lots of intermediate variables. With (Frontend) Javascript (React), I love the way they define functions within functions and use lambdas literally everywhere. I'd like to see examples of R code that you think is beautiful to look at. I know that R is extremely flexible, and that base, data.table and tidyverse are basically different dialects of R. But I love the diversity and I want to see whatever so long as it looks beautiful. Pipes, brackets, even right-assign arrows... throw 'em at me.",
