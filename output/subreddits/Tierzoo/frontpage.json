      "content_preview": "I'm a committed Monotreme player, having mostly played Zaglossus Genus char's (Short noses just don't vibe with my aesthetic for some reason) But lately I've been wanting to mix it up a bit, maybe increase the difficulty in a fun way. I heard about the \"Make your own custard\" achievement and it sounds like fun, so i was wondering if anyone has any tips or build suggestions? I haven't yet tried a semi-aquatic or amphibious char, so the idea of playing as a Platypus intrigues me, but i'd like some advice on relative time-to-egg-production and lactation volume for various species as i would like to turn this into a speedrun of sorts, and if the platypus has slower metrics obviously i would need to shelve that curiosity for now. I'm eager to listen to any advice you may have.",

      "content_preview": "Yes. Chimps are massively overrated. They’re about 1.5x as strong as humans pound for pound. With an average weight of 50kg, a human weighing 75kg essentially equalizes the strength difference. Chimp skeletons are more or less inferior versions of humans skeletons. They are more dense, which is an advantage, but terribly stubby makes grappling their only advantage and option. The simple fact is that a well trained human can accurately strike (kicks, mainly) with incredible newtons of force that no other ape can match. A chimp has a grappling advantage and a terrible bite. A well placed leg kick (which are incredibly easy to land, might I add) would cripple it. Similarly a well placed strike preferably elbow or knee to the chin / jaw / temple or any other weak points would similarly cripple. Chimps are ridiculously overrated for several reasons. Firstly there was a botched research paper that placed them at 4-8 times the strength of a man, which was later debunked. Secondly, there are some horror stories with chimps and humans; mind you these involve an older lady and a grown chimp. Not the match up here.",
