He is a physician and loves history of science, but what he really, really enjoys is writing, his dream is to become a writer.The only things he mentioned wanting are an exlibris and some posters for his room. He has everything!I thought about designing him an exlibris but I’m scared he won’t like the design… and I also thought about engraving a fountain pen with a short sentence about how much I want him to pursue his dream (still haven’t thought about it though). He likes writing in fountain pens.I don’t know, what do you think about these ideas? Can you think about something better?thank you a lot!!",

But I’ve also heard that sometimes combo products don’t really do each function well, or they break down faster than single-purpose items. For parents who’ve tried similar things, did buying multi use toddler gear actually save you money and space in the long run, or did you end up replacing it anyway?",

Given that my local Tractor Supply has dedicated about 20% of its floor space to Carhartt gear and I see young adults in urban areas wearing the brand, I get the feeling that it’s not like it used to be.Which brands are still up to the task?",

I'm wondering about other options - high-quality stuff that can be dismounted and remounted at a new location without a tremendous amount of effort.Any recommendations?

      "content_preview": "It’s come to my attention that a lot of people are struggling to find high quality clothing that is actually worth your money (especially in this economy). So, I’ve put together a list of things to look for whenever you shop:1. Material100% natural materials like cotton, wool, silk, linen etc. are good indications of quality. If not, a high % of those materials. Some forms of viscose are okay, but only if they are closed-loop (I use an app called Toxome to understand what is good/bad)The material is fit for the intended use. Your t-shirt should not be not transparent, your warm jacket should be warm, but that doesn’t mean your diaphanous summer dress is low quality just because it’s made of a gauzey material.Good hand, feels hefty, thick, soft. The weave is consistent, smooth, comfortable and not scratchy (unless intentionally rustic)Colors are true to the vision of the design; patterns are clear cut, not “blurry,” no bleedingFor knits, long fibers, less fuzz (no acrylic)More work/material intensive weaves are often a sign of better quality. For knits, a tight 6 ply thick knit is warmer but takes more material than a loose, holely knit or a 2 ply thin knit. For silks, there’s plenty of cheap crepe de chine out there, but a silk faille, jacquard or twill, less so.2. MakeCut on the biasDrapes wellReinforced button holesHas extra structure that makes the garment fit the curves of your body - examples include interior facing, darting at the waist, a yoke along the shoulder, a seam or multiple seams along the back of a blazer or coat; the parts that should be stiffer (collar, cuff, placket etc) have an extra layerHems and seams are finished sturdily and cleanly; the stitching is consistent, lines are clean; no hanging or loose threads or random puckering bad hemFully lined when you want it fully linedPatterns match across the seams vs. no pattern matching3. Finish and details“Bells and whistles” are made well - metallic elements, even just the zipper are hefty and not light and flimsy, no rustingButtons - mother of pearl, horn, etc.Small interesting elements of design (for example, a contrasting lining in a cuff that you might roll up)Interior materials (linings, pocket fabric, the tags) are not cheap and scratchyA rubbery lining along the inside of the waist for trousers helps hold your tucked blouses downBra snaps that hold your bra straps in place for sleeveless items",

This coat has been sitting in a closet for probably more than 20 years. It's got the classic must of sitting for so long and it has a decent amount of cat hair on the inside for whatever reason. I was hoping someone could give me some advice or tips on how to clean take care of and maintain this. My father was a very big man and I'm a slender regular dude in comparison but it's still fits me pretty well. It's the only thing I have left of any family. I'd love to keep it protected and safe but I couldn't bring myself to look at the one thing I have left every couple months so I plan on wearing it on a regular basis. Again any help would be greatly appreciated. (Sorry for poor punctuation I'm at work and voice typing is so much easier)",

I’m trying to find something to give to him to show my appreciation but I have no clue what it could be. He is interested in all things tech, recently started enjoying Legos, spending time outside, wants to learn to skateboard, enjoys single-track riding, fixing cars with his friends, enjoys a fancy bourbon drink every now and then.
