He is a physician and loves history of science, but what he really, really enjoys is writing, his dream is to become a writer.The only things he mentioned wanting are an exlibris and some posters for his room. He has everything!I thought about designing him an exlibris but I’m scared he won’t like the design… and I also thought about engraving a fountain pen with a short sentence about how much I want him to pursue his dream (still haven’t thought about it though). He likes writing in fountain pens.I don’t know, what do you think about these ideas? Can you think about something better?thank you a lot!!",

But I’ve also heard that sometimes combo products don’t really do each function well, or they break down faster than single-purpose items. For parents who’ve tried similar things, did buying multi use toddler gear actually save you money and space in the long run, or did you end up replacing it anyway?",

After a few hours of walking around the city, my feet were sore and I had blisters from my old pair. Definitely not fun. So I’m looking to pick up some proper walking shoes this time. I’d like something comfortable for long days on my feet, durable, and not too bulky if possible. I’d love to hear your recommendations. Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "My father passed away several years ago. Yesterday I received his old outback oil skin duster in the mail from family I've never even met. This coat has been sitting in a closet for probably more than 20 years. It's got the classic must of sitting for so long and it has a decent amount of cat hair on the inside for whatever reason. I was hoping someone could give me some advice or tips on how to clean take care of and maintain this. My father was a very big man and I'm a slender regular dude in comparison but it's still fits me pretty well. It's the only thing I have left of any family. I'd love to keep it protected and safe but I couldn't bring myself to look at the one thing I have left every couple months so I plan on wearing it on a regular basis. Again any help would be greatly appreciated. (Sorry for poor punctuation I'm at work and voice typing is so much easier)",

I recently graduated with my graduate degree but I am looking to get something to celebrate my husband and his contributions towards my schooling. When I started my program we had a 10 week old and 22 month old so there was a lot of laundry, cleaning, late night feedings, and keeping my head on straight that he immensely helped with. I’m trying to find something to give to him to show my appreciation but I have no clue what it could be. He is interested in all things tech, recently started enjoying Legos, spending time outside, wants to learn to skateboard, enjoys single-track riding, fixing cars with his friends, enjoys a fancy bourbon drink every now and then. A little bit of everything which has me stumped on which way to go for him! Thank you for any and all ideas!",

Recently, I learned this faucet was recalled in the U.S. by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) due to excessive lead content.When I checked the company’sofficial recall page, it clearly listed bothAmazon.com and Amazon.capurchases as covered. After I emailed Kicimpro about this, they later updated their website and removed theAmazon.camention — but I had already taken a screenshot showing it was there originally.https://www.kicimpro.com/recall/Taken on 2025-8-28https://imgur.com/a/9nEbaIITaken on 2025-9-02https://imgur.com/a/tVguK7BKicimpro told me that faucets sold in Canada were “not affected” and claimed Health Canada had reviewed the case. That didn’t sit right with me, so I contactedHealth Canadadirectly.Their response:They are aware of the U.S. recall.They conducted a reviewbased only on information supplied by the manufacturer.According to that info, Canadian units are considered “not affected.”Therefore,no recall in Canada.They also explained Canada’s product safety system is “post-market,” meaning companies self-police, and Health Canada mainly reacts to incident reports.So in short:U.S. customers: protected by a recall.Canadian customers: told our units are “different” because the manufacturer said so.I wanted to share this in case other Canadians purchased this faucet. If you’re concerned, Health Canada has a reporting form you can submit (even without injury):https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/apps/radar/CPS-SPC-0001.08.C.html",

      "content_preview": "I'm looking to purchase a washer and dryer soon, and have narrowed down to two options.I'm curious if any of you have experiences with the Maytag ones in particular?(There's no shortage of advocates for the SQ TC5!)For $1,890 I can get Maytag's commercial-grade washer (MVWP586GW) and dryer (MEDP576KW)-- both of which have solid reviews online and via various Appliance Youtubers. They also have much better warranties than typical big box purchases.For $2,540 I can get theSpeedQueen TC5andLG DLE3400W.This would be a superior washer and inferior dryer for $650 more than the Maytag set.One consideration is that I don't know if I'll stay put in my current house/state for a decade -- if I did, I think going with the SQ would be a more obvious decision. But if I end up moving in a few years, I'm not sure I'll want to haul the washer around.But if the Maytag is fairly close to the TC5 in terms of performance, reliability, and warranty, I'm willing to roll the dice a bit. (Would also put on Amex to get their free purchase protection and extended warranty, negating a bit of risk.)Thanks for any input and/or sharing your experience!",

I'd like to put in a custom closet system (my landlord stated they'd allow it), but it needs to be something that I can actually buy for life; something I can take with me wherever I moved next.Someone recommended the Container Store Elfa system... but I'm concerned that it might feel a little flimsy. I'm wondering about other options - high-quality stuff that can be dismounted and remounted at a new location without a tremendous amount of effort.Any recommendations? Budget is flexible but I guess if I had to put a number on it - $10,000.",

The fit of the jacket is on the smarter and more fitted side as I walk to work in it. I'm tall, 6ft (female) size 14 and struggle to get coats long enough in the arms. Ideally would like a really long coat so I'm only having to take off one thing when I get in (dog goes nuts when he's muddy or wet, so need a quick change to stop him getting mud and water everywhere 🤣).Looking for recommendations for a long coat that will come down over my wellies, that's roomy enough for layers in the winder and waterproof as opposed to water resistant.",
