      "content_preview": "In a completely blatant attempt to justify Bobby Kennedy's lethal attack on all Americans by doing everything in his power to limit the availability of Covid vaccine, Trump is calling into question the efficacy of the very vaccine he once called 'Brilliant.\" The vaccine that medical experts around the world credit with saving untold millions of lives. Folks, he is sowing the seed of doubt hoping to quell the groundswell of criticism from citizens who fear a new pandemic because so few will be able to be immunized. Where once the federal government paid for the shots with no cost to the vaccinated, now the new rules dictate you must first go to your doctor for a prescription and then pay anywhere from 140.00 to 200.00 dollars to receive the shots! Seniors over 65, and those with chronic conditions and some children are still covered, but the rest of us are on our own, being completely abandoned by Trump, Kennedy, and the entire Republican congress. Insurance companies may pay for the shots now, but in Jan. the coverage may change. Human nature, being what it is, means few of us will either find the time, or have the perhaps thousand dollars necessary to protect a family of four, and will simply hope for the best. If so, a new pandemic is all but assured as the disease will again run rampant through our homes, schools, and, once again, anywhere people gather. MAGA, how can you justify this attack on you, your family, and all of America? See this: Trump admin live updates: Trump urges companies to 'justify' success of COVID drugs Story by Kevin Shalvey • 2 ...Trump calls on drug companies to 'justify the success' of COVID vaccines. Amid turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, President Trump on Monday called on pharmaceutical companies to \"justify the success\" of their COVID vaccines. \"It is very important that the Drug Companies justify the success of their various Covid Drugs. Many people think they are a miracle that saved Millions of lives. Others disagree! With CDC being ripped apart over this question, I want the answer, and I want it NOW,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform. I have been shown information from Pfizer, and others, that is extraordinary, but they never seem to show those results to the public. Why not??? They go off to the next 'hunt' and let everyone rip themselves apart, including Bobby Kennedy Jr. and CDC, trying to figure out the success or failure of the Drug Companies Covid work,\" he continued. Trump called on the companies to \"clear up this MESS, one way or the other!\" and said he hoped Operation Warp Speed -- a key achievement of his first term -- was \"as 'BRILLIANT' as many say it was.\" It's unclear what exact data Trump wants the companies to provide. Studies show COVID vaccine programs saved millions of lives during the pandemic.

      "content_preview": "There were two attempts to overthrow our legally elected government -- treason -- and although Trump himself cannot be indicted while he is the sitting president, he is an 'Unindicted Conspirator' 'in the Wisconsin case. Once he is out of office justice will come cascading down on him and he will spend the rest of his miserable life in prison. The case in Wisconsin regards the counterfeit electors report that showed Trump the winner in that state. It is the same report Mike pence refused to read. (See following article). But the real doozy is the ongoing case in Georgia. This case revolves around the Trump/Giuliani/Scott Perry (to name a few of the traitors) scheme to have Jeffrey Rosen (the interim Attorney General at the time) announce the FBI was having questions about the election and was going to open an investigation. With this excuse, Trump thought he could impound the voting machines and announce the election results were invalid.  What the schemers didn't consider was there was an honorable patriot in office. Rosen refused to go along with the scheme. Trump then said he would fire him and replace him with a shyster lawyer, Jeffrey Clarke (Since disbarred, I believe) who would do his bidding. Rosen stood his ground, telling Trump that if he was fired the entire upper tier of the Justice Department would resign en masse . That shut the two-bit, Nazi tyrants up, and they went with the phony elector scheme instead. There will be trials, and like all punks and cowards, when their lawyers tell them they are facing hard time they will squeal like all pigs do. These guys in Wisconsin can. and will, name names. Names in the White House, names in the House and Senate, and names in State Houses across the country. Why do you think Trump and his co-conspirators are working so hard to install an authoritarian state. It is the only way the will dodge the wrath of the electorate. See this: Wisconsin judge rejects motions to dismiss charges against Trump aides Story by SCOTT BAUER • 14h • 3 min read © Morry Gash MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge Friday declined to dismiss felony charges against two attorneys and a former aide to President Donald Trump who advised Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year. Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland rejected the motions to dismiss the 11 felony charges filed against the three defendants. The charges are for using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump that year. Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin, Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised the campaign, and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020, all were initially charged in June 2024. The case has stalled as the judge considered their attempts to have the charges dismissed. Each of the 11 of the felony charges they face carries the same maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. “Troupis does not show that the First Amendment protects the right to commit forgery, does not show that the government violated his right to due process by entrapping him into that forgery, and does not show prosecutors must exercise discretion to charge an accused of his preferred offense,” the judge said in rejecting the motions to dismiss. The charges were brought by Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat. Kaul is considering running for governor in 2026. He declined to comment. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and again last year but lost it in 2020 and tried unsuccessfully to overturn his defeat. The state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023. Federal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin. Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, allow their electoral votes to be split between candidates. The Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/wisconsin-judge-rejects-motions-to-dismiss-charges-against-trump-aides/ar-AA1L3c8y ?",

Because the Republican Party has complete disregard for the Constitution, the rule of law, and any code of morals or ethics whatsoever, it poses a clear and present danger to the Republic. It is therefore the duty of every patriotic American to fight for its abolishment.  That means campaigning against and publicly humiliating Republican officeholders for their support of criminality and fascism, turning public opinion against them, until we reach a point where it becomes impossible for Republicans to hold a majority on a state or national level ever again.

      "content_preview": "Seems like the voters are catching on to the real effects of Trump and the Republican's Big, Beautiful (Bullshit) Bill. So rather than change any of exploitive measures of the bill, they have decided to simply change the name. This way, they figure. the dupes, simps, yahoos and goobers who accepted the legislation without understanding the harm it will do to the ordinary American citizen, will just forget it exists. That's how dumb they think you are -- maybe sometimes with good cause like when you vote against your best interests when you choose to believe the obvious lies of the racists, fascists, and Republicans. They wrote the Bill, you accepted the Bill, and now they are laughing their asses off at how easy it is to manipulate you. See the duplicity here: Trump scrambles to rebrand ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ amid 'alarm bells' over popularity Story by Sarah K. Burris • © provided by RawStory President Donald Trump is at work trying to rebrand his 2026 budget legislation, known as the \"Big, Beautiful Bill,\" as a kind of tax cut not for billionaires but for the middle class. Trump announced at his Cabinet meeting that he was changing the name because it's \"not good for explaining to people what it's all about.\" He went on to claim it was about creating jobs. Some of his own supporters have criticized Trump for a bill that added considerably to the deficit and made any tax cuts for everyday Americans temporary, while other tax cuts for billionaires on items such as private jets are made permanent. Meanwhile, the bill also issues steep cuts to Medicaid, free meals for children in schools and food stamps. CNN's Jeff Zeleny commented that this is happening in the background as Republican lawmakers travel home for the August recess and get an earful from their voters. \"And some alarm bells are going up about the popularity of this sprawling piece of legislation that the president signed into law,\" Zeleny said. \"And of course, it is far more than a tax cut. It's also about cutting Medicaid. It's also about cutting food stamp benefits and so much more. But the president — he likes his branding. He likes his slogans, but is now signaling that he does not want to call it that heading into the midterm elections. He wants to call it a working-class tax cut.\" Zeleny noted it would be interesting to see if Trump can \"unring that bell.\" https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-scrambles-to-rebrand-big-beautiful-bill-amid-alarm-bells-over-popularity/ar-AA1LgKVo",

      "content_preview": "Trump has openly stated he would use the power of his office to seek retribution against all those he considers enemies. He has even gone so far as to absurdly label Hillary, Biden, and Obama as treasonous. Treasonous, as in actively conspiring to overthrow the government of the United States. Not sure, but I think he named Eric Cartman as co-conspirator. Now he has gone one step farther. In order to protect the criminals in his orbit (like refusing to release the Epstein files which seemingly name government pedophiles other than those already suspected) he has fired prosecutors and quashed indictments of almost anyone who has contributed to his campaign. Campaign, as in his personal bank account. Yes, Trump and the Republican toadies sniffing his rear have gone so far to create the 'Greatest Government Money can Buy!' The thing is, it is no longer a government. It is a centralized criminal empire not unlike the Mafia; a well organized enterprise where rules and laws do not matter, where the Godfather and his congressional henchman openly defy existing law, and like days in the Old West run the sheriffs out of town. See this: Justice Department dismisses case against a Trump donor, adding to credibility crisis Story by Steve Benen • In early April, Donald Trump’s White House took a highly unusual step, firing a career federal prosecutor in California because a right-wing influencer told the president he should. A former veteran of the local U.S. Attorney’s Office said it was “bizarre” and “insane” for the White House to take such a step. Nearly four months later, Trump’s Justice Department dropped a case against restaurant group Fat Brands and its chairman, Andy Wiederhorn — which was a case the fired prosecutor was working on at the time of his ouster. NBC News reported: Wiederhorn, who pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing, was originally accused of using Fat Brands, a prominent restaurant chain owner, “as his personal slush fund.” A related IRS investigation alleged that Wiederhorn was also a “serial tax cheat.” Now those allegations are gone. The Justice Department has wiped the slate clean. As a matter of optics, the available facts don’t look great. Wiederhorn, for example, was a Trump campaign donor last year. This year, the White House took the highly unusual step of firing the prosecutor overseeing the case, only to have Trump’s Justice Department abandon the charges altogether soon after. It is possible that this is all just a coincidence. Maybe the developments have nothing to do with the fact that the Fat Brands chairman supported the Republican ticket last year. Maybe the White House had a good reason — which it has not shared — to dismiss the career prosecutor working on the case. Maybe nothing untoward happened in this case at all. But a funny thing happens when a Justice Department abandons its credibility: It becomes awfully tough to give it the benefit of the doubt. In recent months, Americans have seen Trump’s Justice Department purge employees who worked on cases the president didn’t like. We’ve seen Attorney General Pam Bondi play the role of a hyper partisan activist aligned with the White House’s political agenda. We’ve even seen Bondi fire her personal ethics adviser. Patty Hartman, a 17-year former Justice Department official who was fired after having worked on Jan. 6 cases, recently told CBS News, “The rules don’t exist anymore.” She added, “There used to be a line, used to be a very distinct separation between the White House and the Department of Justice, because one should not interfere with the work of the other. That line is very definitely gone.” In a social media post, Hartman went on to write, “We appear to be driving straight into an abyss that holds no memory of what democracy is, was, or should be.” Predictably, all of these developments have had a destabilizing effect. A separate Washington Post report, published earlier this month, noted that employees across the Justice Department and FBI have been fired without explanation or warning, “creating rampant speculation and fear within the workforce over who might be terminated next.” Given all of this, is it that outrageous to think many will see the DOJ’s handling of the case of Fat Brands and its chairman and wonder about possible improprieties? Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor, wrote in The New York Times this week about the Justice Department suffering a “credibility crisis” inside courtrooms and out. If administration officials expect that crisis to fade anytime soon, they should probably lower their expectations. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/maddow-blog-justice-department-dismisses-case-against-a-trump-donor-adding-to-credibility-crisis/ar-AA1JFieJ",

      "content_preview": "Trump and the Republicans are doing their damnedest to undermine, if not totally destroy, our social and security safety nets. By weakening or shredding the many bureaus and agencies that guarantee our welfare in the event of an emergency they hold complete control over the electorate. Like Simon Legree with his whip, or the southern states with their racial discriminatory practices and gerrymandering, they control the levers of power and either we kneel before the tyranny of antidemocratic bureaucrats and oligarchs or suffer the consequences of services withheld and not delivered. . Only Toadies and panderers are appointed to high government positions and with the fervor of nationalistic bigots they enforce the laws they endorse and ignore those they don't condone. Such is the state of America today. To paraphrase Trump, himself, 'If you don't fight like hell, you will no longer have a country to fight for!' See this: Which government agencies have suffered losses under Trump During Donald Trump’s presidency — particularly in his second term — numerous U.S. government agencies have experienced significant losses, including layoffs, budget cuts, and structural changes.
