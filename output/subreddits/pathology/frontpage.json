I want to ask if there's a pocket book - handbook that I could practically have always with in the laboratory to find histology and pathology stuff? An example of a book for example is \"Color Atlas of Cytology, Histology, and Microscopic Anatomy\" bit it's outdated. Are there any similar and more recent books like this?",

I'm super into chemistry so I wanted to major in something in that field, but honestly I just want to know what the right path is right now or what I should be looking at.

      "content_preview": "Hey all I’m a new path intern who has been interested in forensics even before starting med school. I’ve been doing autopsies since second year of med school and feel very comfortable around decedents and just the nature of the field of forensics as a whole. However sometimes, this shit just gets to me. I can’t always predict which cases strike me, because they tend to be all over, but just sometimes a particular case will just mentally fuck me up. Yesterday I did a fetal autopsy that really affected me. I’m not sure if it was because it was the first one I’ve done alone as a “the” doc or if I’m just tired from a long surg path rotation, but it just has stayed with me and I even had nightmares about it, which has never happened. 99.9% of the time I’m genuinely good and fine and happy to do what I do but every so often it feels like the trauma and exposure builds to the point of breaking and I’m stuck wondering what’s wrong with me that I willingly choose to go into this field. I also feel like this is just not spoken about within this field and people are just expected to be okay with this all the time (which goes for all of medicine really). Anyone feel this way sometimes or am I just tired and physically and emotionally exhausted? Or both??? Please keep in mind I wouldn’t pick any other field or subspecialty, I absolutely love forensic pathology and most days I’m excited and grateful to go to work. Today just isn’t one of those days.",

Tons of great sessions, new research, networking, and honestly it's just nice to connect with people who \"get\" what we do day-to-day. This year's in San Diego (so not a bad spot either). I went before and felt like I learned a lot that actually carried back into the lab. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for CE, new ideas, or just to meet others in the field.

I have a residency in mind that I'd really like to go to based on reputation/location, but I won't get the chance to do an away there til MS4 year--would it creepy to email current residents there and ask them for any advice on things they were involved in during med school that they think helped them get into this residency? Is there anything I could do before away rotations to learn more about specific path residencies? Is there any sort of network for med students to meet other med students interested in path? For research-- my school doesn't do any academic path, so I just have a couple case reports. Is there any way to find path research either on your own or by reaching out to other schools?",

I'm kind of tired of people on here who frequently shame the private practice pathologists who a) are willing to be honest about their job situation at all, and b) accept \"low-paying jobs\" that allow their \"bosses\" to lowball them, therefore \"fucking over the field\" for everyone. These confident responders seem to suggest that we should, on principle, simply wait for, or move for, a job that pays a minimum of $35 per 88305 (the medicare professional component reimbursement). I wont even get into weeds of practicality of the waiting/moving part; but, did you know that all full time surgical pathologists are fools to accept below this rate? (This would be >$800k/year for most full time pathologists, annually, at least). Needless to say, we would all love a job like this. And also needless to say, they might as well be non-existent for most practicing pathologists today. We need to navigate the CURRENT job market, today. This leads me to ask any pathologists: what are your criteria for private practice jobs that dont \"fuck over the field\" if we accept them - i.e. a fair job? (reimbursement, benefits, case load) link to some examples of jobs currently on pathoutlines that meet these criteria describe how we can rehabilitate those of us making a measly $300k-400k instead (especially in big cities) these magical high paying, fair labs are usually said to \"not advertise on path outlines.\" Empower us by providing tips on how to get these \"unadvertised\" jobs? if youre going to say that you only find these through \"connections\" and \"networking\", that's literally what we all already do. Thank you ahead of time for those willing to share your two cents.",

I have been interested in pathology lately, and I am greatly considering it as a guide for my college and major choice. However, my parents disagree with my path Not that they hate doctors, but from their research, they believe pathology is an easy blame target by other doctors if something went wrong (and I will be living in stress the rest of my life facing dead meats) and they will be heavily exposed to toxic chemicals. These claims seem quite contradictory to my research on the career. Another aspect they mention is AI. For some reason, they really want me to go into medical physics (with shorter years), saying AI will likely take over pathology. So, while I do a deeper dig into the career, can anyone tell me if these are valid points to not choose pathology? And if not, what are some major requirements and courses if I am going premed? (Background information, neither of my parents has medical experience. But they are very stubborn about what they believe. So I need some experienced people to tell me about how it actually works)",

So if you want to be generous you can count that one but even these instances theres only a handful. Then I see this villi with confidently 4, but it doesnt get worse than this and this is the only villus with the lymphocytes clearly in their location and identified by morphology.
