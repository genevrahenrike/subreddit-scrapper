Please tell me what I forgot and I'll continue to update the list based on your comments. The idea is to help people for their side deck building depending on the meta (or simply the decks they think they will encounter). I'm sure that I ignored a lot of good techs versus niche strategies so I need you ;) I don't include cards that are used to help the engine (like Fusion Duplication in Branded or any archetype traps) because there are too many of them and in general people already know what fits well their own deck. I also don't include normal trap handtraps because it's obvious that they are always an option if you already run them. Different Dimension Ground (vs deck that relies a lot on GY to combo) Dimensional Barrier (vs decks that use mostly 1 summoning mechanic except Link) Destructive Daruma Karma Canon (vs everything but particularly good vs Link) The Black Goat Laughs (vs everything but particularly good when a specific monster is mandatory to combo) More niche: Simul Archfiends (a Dimensional Barrier-like effect that allow 1 summon of each card type but works also vs Link) Mischief of the Gnomes (vs decks that needs specific levels in hand/field, for instance synchro/ritual/xyz engines and mix of them) Artifact Sanctum (vs decks that are sensitive to an Artifact monster like Lancea) Heavy Slump (vs Mulcharmies specifically) Threatening Roar (vs battlephase-only oriented decks) Mutually Affured Destruction (vs decks that have to reveal cards to combo) Depend more on your deck: Eradicator Epidemic Virus (if you often have DARK 2500+atk) Deck Devastation Virus (if you often have DARK 2000+atk) Full Force Virus (if you often have DARK 2000+def) Dogmatika Punishment (if you don't rely on extra deck) Torrential Tribute (if your monsters are often protected from destruction) Please tell me what I forgot ;)",

      "content_preview": "OK, so there are 3 cards that fit the criteria of what I need clarification on: Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon, Ranryu, and Virgil Rockstar of the Burning Abyss. All of these cards state you can only control 1 of them at a time. If they become book of mooned and flipped face down, then that condition no longer applies and you'll be able to summon another one face up, reinstating the condition. Now normally, when you flip the other version of the card face up, the \"You can only control 1\" condition will take effect and force you to choose which one to destroy and send to the Graveyard. Now, all of these cards have an effect if they are destroyed by battle or card effect and sent to the Graveyard (except mirrorjade, which also includes being banished). If they are destroyed by game mechanic like this, then their effects won't activate. Now here comes the unique ruling: Say you have one face up and one face down of 1 of these cards. You pass turn to your opponent, and they transition into the battle phase and attack over your face down monster with enough attack to destroy it. According to game rules, monsters with the passive condition \"You can only control 1\" don't take effect until AFTER damage calculation, in the time where the monster is marked for destruction, but before it is sent to the graveyard. Now what happens first? IS the monster destroyed by game mechanic, or is it destroyed by battle? If it's the latter, then their effects go off as normal, but if not, then they don't. I can't find any rulings pertaining to this scenario. The only rulings I could find were from around 2009 with \"Amazoness Tiger\" ( https://web.archive.org/web/20090217182013/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/yugioh/en/gameplay/faqs/cardfaqs/default.aspx?first=A&last=C ) and even so I'm not satisfied with the ruling because it's not specific enough as to whether the card is destroyed by battle or game mechanic, presumably because at the time it didn't matter because Amazoness Tiger doesn't have a destruction effect. What do you feel like is the correct ruling? In my opinion, I feel as if the card is destroyed by battle since that came first before the card's \"You can only control 1\" condition is able to take effect. But I could also see it going the other way. IS there an official ruling that I'm not aware of?",

I've been playing Yugi for a while, like for 5 years, but I stopped paying attention to the meta and keep playing my incomplete salamangreat-cyberse with my friends. Now I found a really cool store here and there they have their own tournaments and I signed for one 2days ago and you should know how this ended. I played 3 matches vs a melodious, a blue eyes and a P.U.N.K and ended 1-6 in total. I'm not saying I've lost all hope in salamangreat but now I'm searching something new and I filtered this options: keep playing sala and upgrade it or start searching a good snake-eyes deck to win the locals. Keep in mind that was the beginners tournament, they also have K9 kryston, nouvelous, dragon maid, purrely and gem knights and I really like to play some combo-negations deck that could pass some negations in the way.

The only issue is that the only card in my extra deck I can swap out for Donner is cross-sheep, which protects me against contact C.  Of course donner can protect me under contact C as well, but under the circumstances that I used obedience schooled and then my opponent uses contact C, would I be able to summon Donner as it's a \"BEAST\"-warrior type, or am I strictly locked to beast type monsters?",

If not, what should I invest into, knowing I’m a student on a budget. What archetypes do you recommend, from which booster boxes (I like the feeling of opening packs what can I say) Anyway, give me your best advices, if you have any. Thank you for your time",

Been slowly getting back into the game after a an almost 8 year hiatus after I saw how affordable paper play is again, even at the top level, and am currently trying to get a grasp on Yummy. I've found a few replays and written lines featuring Hornet Drones/Engage as 1 card starter but found something curious. They all seem to end with a negated Snatchy in the MMZ and a live Snatchy in the EMZ. The MMZ Snatchy is supposed to be summoned off Lollipo Yummy Way who negates the effects of the summoned monsters not for the turn but while they stay on the field. Is this an oversight on the player who present these lines part? I find that hard to believe, since at least one of them is a credible player with tournament experience and wins so I'm wondering what it is that I'm missing.",

Without having multirole on the field, can I still add Shizuku's linkage in the end phase and then activate it, or do I MUST have multirole face-up on the field with the extra effect active to be able to activate the linkage in the end phase? Thanks in advance. I ask because with Sky Striker Ace = Zero there would be a combo where you add linkage in end with with Shizuku and then yo activate it immediately always during the endphase of your turn to summon it, so you add a follow-up and then create a disruption during your opponent's turn with a non-target bounce with lemnis a non-target pop with zero and you can banish lemnis to link summon Zeke, again during your opponent's turn for a temporary banish.",

      "content_preview": "Good day everybody as previous months, i am here to confirm that the project is taking a new big change. in the last weeks i have been reading more and more posts about new and old players returning to the game, and being excited to learn all the new stuff, despite how steep the learning curve looks to be. this has make me very happy, because the main reason i started this entire project was to create a safe space where help players could get accustomed to the rules of the game, before moving to the real deal. I started this project around 1 year ago, exactly because i was reading a huge number of posts from people being dissatisfided from the game comblexity, and feeling that it was not worth trying, so i am very happy that things are changing for the better. due to this, i decided to slow down the \"beginner format\" project, and put all my time on working on the \"goat format PSCT rework\" project. For the past weeks i have been reading the goat card rulings to be sure that the cards work as intended, and it is taking quite some time to do that. You can check all the rpogress i make at the following link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15JVMCcOZlxJpwziCvbuQRFIbA5gXlTti/edit?gid=841372651#gid=841372651 today i am asking for help from the community, on working on this project, because double checking every single card is a very time consuming issue. i am looking for someone to help me in the following aspects: - checking that the card text actually rappresent how the card works in goat format - checking if the card text is not misleading or can be interpret in a worng way - checking if the cards are helpfull for someone that is still learnign the game - make a duellingbook account to store the cards that we have made so far - create printable versions of those cards, so that people can use them as proxies to learn the game --------------------------------------------------------- i want also to announce that, while i was working on this project, i came up with the idea of a new format, that i will probably work on in the future. today you will only have a hint of what it will be about, but it takes inspiration from \"Rush duel\", \"Cross Duel\" and a specific card that appears in a manga called \"Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V The Strongest Duelist Yuya!!\". untill next time, have fun duelling!",
