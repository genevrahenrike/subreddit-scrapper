In a time where my pride was probably more bruised than my body perfect strangers quickly came to my aide without hesitation.  Again thank you from the bottom of my heart.  BTW I’m ok.

The driver was stopped and looking to the right before turning and the woman quickly ran out to put the stroller about a foot in front of the car. The driver started to go and then quickly slammed on the brakes (and did not hit the stroller). The woman then started screaming at the driver and pounding on the hood of her car and punched one of her side mirrors off before storming away. It was a really disturbing encounter and my husband talked to the driver because he witnessed the whole thing. Since then I’ve seen this woman several times downtown storming around with a stroller. Today I saw her pushing the stroller with little feet sticking out and then about 2 minutes later saw her again walking by herself smoking a cigarette. Anyway, I’m just curious if anyone else has had run ins with this woman and if they know if she actually has a baby or not. I really hope it’s just a doll she’s pushing around in there. She is a young looking white person with blondish hair, maybe 5’3”, who is reasonably well dressed.",

Along the way, my worst parts of myself won over, and I was fired for fraternizing with the staff, as well as harassment. I was ashamed. I left Santa Cruz in December and started over. I want to apologize to anybody who has been hurt by my actions. To those of you who have strong opinions of Alderwood- I personally know the Hamdy family. I can tell you that they are not racist. They were nothing but kind to me. I enjoyed working for them, and genuinely wanted Alderwood to succeed. My ego was badly bruised by my being fired. I’ve been in the industry my whole life and love it. I have some great areas of strength, but managing people is not one of them. Nor will it ever be. I fully know that now. Chef Mikey is a great human, and has a wonderful vision. What he is working toward is filled with integrity, skill, hospitality and love. Due to my shame and ego, I was holding anger and hoping for his demise. I rescind that and want to publicly confess my failures and transgressions. Along with the other women in the Santa Cruz area that I dated - when things fell apart and I did not accept it, I apologize. I lack certain human capacities that make me psychologically and emotionally dangerous.",

Since then, I’ve ended that relationship. I’m hoping to get in touch with the guy who asked me out — he seemed sweet, probably in his early 20s with dark hair. I stayed loyal while I was with my ex and declined then, but now that I’m single, I’d be interested in reconnecting. If you asked out a female boardwalk employee at a food booth recently, feel free to DM me! I’ll keep details private until we chat. The interaction took place on July 23rd.",

      "content_preview": "Cotoni-Coast Dairies (pronounced Cho-TOH-ni) is managed by the Bureau of Land Management and is open from sunrise to sunset. The section that opened on August 16 consists of three loops. I visited last Sunday and I was the 4th car in the parking lot at 7:15 am. I hiked all 8.5 miles and by the time I got back to the trailhead at 11:15 the lot was very full. My main takeaways: Since it just opened it’s VERY popular. I went early to try to beat the crowds and I would strongly suggest that you do too for the best experience. Probably 30-40 mountain bikers passed me, mostly in a few large groups. Almost everyone was very kind and announced themselves/had bells. I only saw one guy hot dogging it around blind curves at an unsafe speed. One MBer commented to me that “mixed use can be pretty chaotic”, and it was a little hectic at times but overall people were courteous. Hikers: be aware that some of the trails are very narrow, especially on the steeper sections of the Tree (Huyya) and Wildcat (Toróma) trails. There are lots of mountain bikers who are psyched to check out these trails, so be prepared for that. Try to remember that a lot of the work on these trails was done by Santa Cruz Mountains Trail Stewardship, which began as a mountain biking association. Mountain bikers: the trails are great and very well constructed, but this ain’t Demo or the upper UCSC singletrack. It’s much more like Wilder Ranch, but busier. You will definitely experience hikers and dog walkers who are visiting for the first time and aren’t going at your pace, so please be patient and wear a bell so they can hear you coming. As noted above the trails are narrow in parts. Try not to make the hikers jump off the trail to avoid being hit. Dog walkers: leash your dogs and please pick up after them! And no dogs are allowed on the Wildcat (Toróma) trail The three loops: Hawk (Káknu) Trail loop is 2.5 miles long through open coastal grassland and chaparral. It’s got southern exposure so be sure to wear sunscreen. Dogs allowed on leash. Tree (Huyya) Trail loop is 1.6 miles down and back up a steep redwood canyon. Nice and shady, but the trail is pretty narrow and steep in sections. Dogs allowed on leash. Wildcat (Toróma) loop is 4.4 miles (including connector to Tree (Huyya)) and starts in coastal grassland and mixed broadleaf/douglas fir forest with lots of beautiful lace lichen, before ascending a steep redwood canyon. The section on the south half of the trail is downhill only for mountain bikes. No dogs allowed on this loop. Remember that lots of your neighbors helped build this trail system and be respectful! Thanks, Obama for designating the National Monument and thanks to all the BLM staff who worked hard in less than ideal circumstances to get this place open to the public. Stay hydrated (no water is available at the trailhead so remember to bring your own), wear proper footwear and of course, Pack Your Trash! happy trails!",

For the past 5 years or so, a man drives down my street (Pennsylvania Ave in midtown) every night around 10-10:30pm and throws out three empty tall Modelo Especial cans. I mean it, every. single. night. Like clockwork. Everyone on the block knows and hates this guy, and we all pitch in to clean up after him a couple times a week. We first started seeing him during the Covid shutdown and since then, we’ve caught him maybe 30–40 times? I yell and wave at him every time, we make eye contact and he just smirks and throws the cans at me. I seriously can’t explain just how insane this is. He drives a beige-ish SUV, maybe a Honda CRV? I can’t ever catch the plates in my blind rage. I live down the street from a liquor store, so my working theory is he gets off work, slams a 3 pack of tall boys, and then ditches them on the drive home. Everyone on the block knows him. We call him the Modelo Man.  Our own bogeyman. So: Does anyone know this man? Can anyone make him stop? WHAT DO I DO? (Modelo Man, if you’re listening, please for the love of god just stop. You are low key terrorizing an entire neighborhood.)",
