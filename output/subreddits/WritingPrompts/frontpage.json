      "content_preview": "Inspired bythis prompt.Quick note before we get started, I misremembered the exact wording of the prompt, so I apologize if it doesn't line up exactly right, but it was too good to not pursue.***My younger sister Emma is a magical person. She always tries to make the best of any circumstance, is fiercely loyal to those important to her, and can always bring smiles to the faces of those around her.She’s also, like,realmagic: transformation sequence, superhuman abilities, using a wand to fire off blasts of sparkly energy at monsters, the works. She’s not the only one, either - she’s part of a team of five girls who don brightly-colored outfits and defend the city from the monsters that keep attacking it. Not sure who the other girls are - I had an idea, but got distracted and forgot. This has happenedmultiple timesnow, way too many to be a coincidence. Apparently, recognition interference is another magic power they have?The only reasonIknow about Emma is because this one traffic cam near our house caught her transforming from her magical persona back to civilian mode. I made sure to overwrite that footage with some earlier material, keeping her secret just that. (Also, please don’t ask mewhyI was looking at traffic cam footage.) After some deliberation, I decided to ask her about this - delicately, of course.“Hey, Emma?”She looked over. “Yeah?”“Is something wrong?”“What do you mean?” she asked, frowning in confusion.“Well, you seem distracted lately, and you keep disappearing at weird times. I’m worried and thought I should check in.”She gave a nervous “uhh,” but stopped when I raised a hand.“I’m not looking for a full explanation, just a yes or a no. And please be honest. Is there something going on?”After some hesitation she said, “yes.”“Okay. Is this something that, for one reason or another, you can’t talk about? Or, you aren’tsupposedto talk about it?”Even more hesitation before another “yes.”“Okay. Is it important?”“Yes,” she said, looking surprised and a little confused.“Is whatever you’re doing making the world a better, safer place?”“Yes.” There was no hesitation this time, and the look of determination in her eyes caught me off guard.“Okay then,” I said with a nod, and then headed into the kitchen to make myself a sandwich. After a few seconds, she followed me in.“Is…that it?” she asked.“Yeah?” I replied from the fridge. “You seem to have a good handle on this, and I’m willing to trust you and your judgement.” I looked over one shoulder. “And if you need someone to talk to, I’ll listen.” Emma smiled at that.“Thanks.”“Sure thing.” I turned my attention back to the fridge. “Hey, do you know where the mustard is?”***After that, life…continued. Emma and her team fended off monsters. I worked an after-school job at an electronics store. Occasionally, I would stall Mom and Dad for a few minutes when Emma was running late(-ish). Or make up a vague-yet-plausible excuse as to why she wasn’t around. Things were fine…until the Incident.It was an average Tuesday. We got a weekly flyer from a nearby grocery store. Internet forums were dissecting the latest episode of some mediocre reality show. A monster attacked the Post Office and was soundly defeated. Yeah, usual Tuesday stuff. And then at 7:03 PM, there came a knock on my bedroom door.“Larry?” It was Emma. “Can we talk?” I got up from my desk, walked over, and opened the door. Emma was standing there, looking…not guilty, but conflicted?“What’s up?” I asked.She hesitated before asking, “if someone asked you to do something, and you didn’twantto do it, but if you didn’t do it then something really bad would happen, what would you do?”Blink, blink.“I, uh, huh,” was my response. “Could you be more specific? I could really use some,anycontext.”She shifted in place, cringing. “No.”“Okay, wha-” I started, then stopped, then started again, spurred on by an intrusive thought. “Does this have to do with the Thing You Don’t Talk About?”More shifting in place, more cringing. “Yes.”I groaned, running a hand through my hair. That simultaneously simplified AND complicated matters! “Okay, well, I would consider what good and what bad would come from doing this versus not doing this. I would also consider alternate options, like only doing part of it or doing part of it and doing something else in place of the rest. Or scrapping that and doing something else entirely.” I sighed again. “Look, have you made a decision yet, or do you still have some time to think?” She looked up.“I’m supposed to give an answer by Saturday.”“Okay, that’s…you got time. Like I said, think it over, try to think of some alternatives. And wait until Saturday to lock into any specific action.” Emma nodded. She didn’t look happy, but she did look…less devastated? Things are still bad, but they’re not AS bad.“Okay. Thanks, Larry.” She walked away, and I closed the door and returned to my desk.Older Brother Protective Instincts(™) were kicking in. After some huffing and fidgeting, I decided to Delve. I put on my VR headset, and reached out.One thing I have neglected to mention before now is that Emma isn’t the only one with powers in our family. My powers showed up about a month before the monster attacks began, no idea if it’s connected or not. I have technopathy - to an extent, I can control and manipulate electronics. I need to be in contact with something electronic for it to work, though, hence the headset.Tapping into Emma’s phone, I looked into the Location Tracking. Whatever happened, it happened today - Emma was fine this morning, if a little panicked about the Math test scheduled for today. Okay, Home, School, normal so far, the Post Office, that checks out, what the? She made a stop between the Post Office and Home.She spent nearly thirty minutes at Elite Microsystems? It’s a large-ish company, involved in a little of everything, appliances and computer systems are their main focus, and they’ve got an office building downtown. This…is not normal.I looked at the time and groaned. I have an English paper due Friday that I haven’t started yet, and likely won’t be starting tonight. Frustrated but determined, I reached out, found the Elite Microsystems building, and began working my way in.You know how in Action/Spy films, the Important Thing is protected by an array of red lasers, and the Hero has to pull some crazy gymnastics to get in and out without breaking any of the beams and setting off the alarms? That’s the closest Real World equivalent I can think of to what I was doing. Admittedly, it wasn’t as harrowing (andnowherenear elegant) as the movie fare, but it was something. Some places have garbage security (please don’t ask how I know that), but Elite Microsystems had a very sturdy set-up. After a great deal of careful maneuvering, I was in.First stop, Security. A place like this is bound to have loads of cameras up - they can’t afford not to. Looking through the records for today…there! Emma shows upby landing on the roof!(Way to make an entrance, kiddo.) She goes down some stairs and enters the office of the big boss himself, Orson Marfont.No cameras inside the office, doors are shut, window blinds are closed. Fast forwarding. Twenty-some minutes later, Emma walks out, looking noticeably less happy than when she walked in. Not sure what happened, but I know where to look next. Everything here is on a network, so getting into Mr. Marfont’s computer is easy enough.Let’s see what files have been opened today. Several. No, no, interesting but no. No. Hello. They’re planning to release a magical girl toyline? Okay, that sounds like a promising lead. Put up some search filters…bingo. They want Emma to be the spokesperson for the toyline. Hmm, pretty sure that violates some rule magical girls have to follow, not using your powers for personal gain or something?Looking. Contract for Emma? Ugh, this thing is over fifty pages long and filled with legal jargon. I consider this a red flag. Looking. Nothing else stands out. Any private messages or e-mails? Okay, here’s some back-and-forth exchanges. Let’s see, Marfont promised to make a hefty donation to Silver Oak Children’s Hospital if Emma agreed to be the spokesperson. That’s good. He also hinted that he wouldn’t if she didn’t. That’s bad.……ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THAT BASTARD WASN’T PLANNING TO MAKE ANY DONATION EITHER WAY! GAH!No, no. In, two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. In, hold, out, hold…Okay, I’m calm (enough) now, thank you focused breathing.So, this sleazebag is guilt-tripping my sister into doing something she doesn’t want to do, all for a reward that doesn’t exist? Unacceptable. You have picked the wrong fight Mr. Orson Marfont, and now you get REKT!***It took a long time to get everything ready. Long enough that Idefinitelywon’t be starting that English paper tonight. (Especially since tonight is now technically this morning.) Still, all that time was spent productively, digging up and compiling evidence of Marfont’s crimes - and let me tell you something, there was A LOT! Accounting fraud, insider trading, embezzlement, tax evasion, sexual harassment, violation of environmental regulations, bribery, corporate/industrial espionage, corporate/industrial sabotage, he even had a few business rivals assassinated!Once I got all that together, then came the really tricky part: there are several things that needed to be done, and they all had to be done at about the same time. Deep breath, and here we go. Evidence of Orson Marfont’s crimes were sent to every news source in a one-state radius, as well as every police station. Almost immediately thereafter, all of Marfont’s in-country bank accounts were flagged for suspicious activity and were promptly frozen. Meanwhile, his off-shore accounts were emptied and closed.Head throbbing and drained mentally, I went to bed and slept. Mentally juggling about a dozen separate connections REALLY takes it out of you. Please take my word for it. Don’t try it yourself.***It was on the front page in the newspaper. It was on every TV news station. It was blowing up on social media. Orson Marfont, CEO of Elite Microsystems had been arrested on suspicion of numerous crimes, and was being held for questioning.(He wouldn’t live to stand trial - that night, he disappeared from his cell. Almost as if someone had teleported him out. My guess? Somebody else with powers and an axe to grind. Not sure, don’t care. Two days later, the police would find what was left of him, which wasn’t much. And what WAS there was very…spread-out.The police promised to look into the matter, and they did. Not very hard, and not for very long, but theydidlook.)Emma looked relieved at the news, though still a little sad. When I asked her about it, she told me she had heard a rumor that Marfont had been planning to donate a lot of money to Silver Oak Children’s Hospital, which definitely wouldn’t be happeningnow. I just smiled, patted her head, and told her not to worry. I had a good feeling that somebody else would step up to help. Emma gave a smile in return before walking away.Of the money I drained from Marfont’s off-shore accounts, I wasn’t planning to keep much - 5% AT MOST. As for the rest? Well, charities across the state - food pantries, homeless shelters, orphanages to name a few - would be getting some much needed, much appreciated financial backing in the months to come. But first, Silver Oak Children’s Hospital would receive a very generous,very anonymousdonation. I smiled as I sat down and got to work.‘Don’t worry, Emma. Your big brother is watching out for you, always.’",

      "content_preview": "Original prompt hereWanted to try my hand at writing a somewhat realistic villain while still respecting the prompt. Whether I succeeded is up for interpretation. Regardless, I hope you enjoy!——The possibility that itcouldhappen always lingered day after day, an omen that would spell the end of my life and all that awaited in my future. I wasn’t stupid, nor was I naive - you can thank my parents for that - but I didn’t let it get to me much. Worst comes to worst, they’ll come for me, if only to protect something more valuable.They’ll come for me… they will…Oh yeah, I almost forgot; I got kidnapped. Big surprise.…not really but you get the idea.My parents are big time Supers. Government contracted and politically connected. Theprofessionals, if you will. Dad can melt steel with his eyes and Mom can bench press a freight train - multiple of them, stacked on top of each other - and not break a sweat. And they don’t just have raw power, they also aren’t stupid. They know how to talk to the right people and say the right words. Donating to political campaigns, attending fundraisers, socially engineering the people that turn the gears of government. These efforts obviously didn’t go unrewarded: the government awarded them contracts for business and favours to cash in. Not to mention the intrinsic security that superheroes already provide. The military practically salivates at the opportunity to snag the contracts.Was it basically corruption? Absolutely. Illegal? No one cares. At least not enough to do something about itI would talk about how my siblings inherited their powers and dove into herodom as well - if only to please Mom and Dad - but they aren’t relevant to this story.No, what matters to us right now is me, currently in the back of a vehicle bound, blindfolded, and gagged. And as I sat there in silence with nothing but the drone of the car to occupy my senses, I thought to myself “it happened”. I can only guess as to what my captors want: money is probably something they want, perhaps information, or they just want to fuck with me. Or them. Anything goes right now.The low drone of the car is joined by chatter between the driver and who I presume to be the mastermind behind my capture. I hate that I can only hear one half of the conversation.–Authenticate.“Where upon France do the poppies grow?”Handshake.“In Flanders’ Field to comfort the fallen.”Query.“Update me. What’s happened so far?”Reply.“We’ve secured the asset. Currently en route.”Everything went according to plan. Astheno almost smiled.Almost.“For the love of god make sure you aren’t being followed. What’s your ETA?”“6 minutes out.”“I’ll prepare for the hand off. End communication.”A click. The line went dead.Astheno sighed. She still had work to do.–I felt the car slow to a stop. Seems like we’re here.“Gentle, understood? We can’t risk damaging the asset before the hand off.”“Loud and clear.”I wonder what they’re talking about for a moment before I suddenly feel a piercing pain in my arm and everything going dark.–Astheno frowns, the sight before her a familiar one, for it is simply a bargaining chip.Herbargaining chip to get what she wants. Such a reductive term, she thinks, for what lies bound, gagged, and drugged before her is an innocent youth, having committed the unfortunate crime of being related to the wrong people.Astheno hated this part. Asthenoalwayshated this part.Yet her part she plays. It is simply an efficient method of extraction. Whether it’s money or information, having something desired by the other party gives you needed power in any exchange. Power to make your own demands. Of say, somethingyoudesire in turn. And right now, Astheno wants information out of this poor child's parents. She isn’t stupid either. Many a time negotiations have broken down, each failed attempt teaching and refining a valuable lesson:One is none. Two is one. If it’s important, you need a backup.Truthfully she could execute the contingency right now and have the requisite information in due time. But doing so would be resource intensive, and why bother when you can acquire it for far less? It is simply more efficient.Astheno still frowns. She hates doing this, but it is simply more efficient.–I feel myself slowly coming to, tired out of my mind and aching unbelievably. What on God's Green Earth did they pinch me with? I feel likeshit. I feel myself bound to something, a chair I think, while my mouth is still gagged. Eventually my eyes adjust to the lightning and the diminishing drugs and I finally get a look at the room I now find myself in.Very… non-descript. I see a monitor directly in front of me, who knows what that’s for. The lighting shields the walls into shadow making them a blank slate. And since I can’t look behind me, this is the best I can go off of. Fuckingwonderful. As I look around trying in vain to find anything identifiable, I finally see… her.The absolute bane of a lot of people’s existence, my family included. A complete menace to society at large. A force of conniving evil and malevolence. Someone who thinks nothing of human life. Someone completely drunk on sin. Someone so evil she earned the moniker ofsupervillain. And she wears it with pride.Someonesoevil my parents never bothered to tell me anything about her despite her history and my risk of being kidnapped. Nice going, mom and dad. I had to snoop at files forgotten on desks to scrape together what I know about her.Astheno is the name I see most often associated with her. I’m sure she has an actual name but for the sake of this exchange - and the fact I never actually learned it - I shall be referring to her as such. The files didn’t have any pictures so I’ll take the time to describe what she looks like. Short blood red hair sits atop her head while what looks like an eye patch covers one of her eyes. I can’t see much detail on her body given the lighting, it looks like a black overcoat with long coattails while on her hands are black gloves. That’s really all I can make out right now.And with good timing, I think she noticed me.She has a sickening smile as she examines me, a singular red eye of hate bores into my skull. I can only imagine what’s going through her head right now. Probably nothing good, I’d wager. Eventually though, she speaks.“Well now, it seems you’re awake.”A sickening low tone dripping with malice to match a sickening smile to draw out terror. The files do not do her justice, she is fuckingterrifying. Of course, I can’t reply to her since, y’know. Nonetheless she continues.“I hope you had a good rest. We need to have averyimportant discussion with your parents.”Each syllable only exemplifies the aura of raw malevolence radiating off her. I try my best to not be intimated. It’s not very successful. I can only watch as she grabs some kind of remote and points it at the monitor in front of us, roaring it to life. And when the static clears, I finally see some familiar faces.–Astheno wore an evil smile as the faces of familiar superheroes came into focus. She can have fun with this part, at least. A quick wave to greet her negotiators, practiced to instill fear.“Hello there.”“What the fuck do you want?” The cyclops barks.“Wait, is thatDylan?!” The walking muscle points out. An intensely boring name, she thinks.“Indeed, you have failed in your guardianship. Though a boon for me, since now your child has fallen into my grasp.” She pricks, invoking yet more malice. If she’s going to have fun, might as well have alotof fun, no? Besides, it’s not often Astheno can have direct access to the source of her infinite disdain at no personal peril.“What do you fuckingwant, bitch?!” The cyclops barks again, heaving his chest in some attempt to intimidate. It’s not very successful.“Ah, thank you, I was getting to that,” She begins, ready to enjoy the faces of terror, “See, you have something I desire. Documents, files, all classified. But I will need them for a project of mine, so your task is to hand over what I request.”The careless parents exchange looks. They knowexactlywhat she’s talking about. Still wearing a facade of confidence, the cyclops speaks.“And if we don’t?”Asetheno can’t suppress a maniacal smile. This is thereallyfun part.She walks over to the nearby table and picks up a gun, a simple pistol is all this needs. A quick press check confirms the gun is loaded, exactly what she wants. In full view of these ‘superheroes’, of course. It’s important for them to know the gun is loaded for the next part.She walks over to the bargaining chip bound in front of them and aims the gun directly at its head, ready to savour their faces as she makes her promise with a look of pure assurance.“...then I will shoot your child in the head.”For a set of failed parents that can’t even keep their own safe they sure put on a show of worry. Of course, she’s engineered this moment to maximise anxiety. The press check earlier was for them to know the gun was loaded, and her finger directly on the trigger is her promise to them:I will kill your child if you disobey me.Once emotions take over rational reasoning her demands become infinitely harder to reject and hopefully leads to the desired compliance. But Astheno still needs to finish her little play, so the show goes on.“You can’t be fucking serious!” The muscle wails.“Oh, I quite am,” She assures, “You of all people should know that I follow through on my promises.”“You can’t expect us to justgiveyou those files! They’ll fucking RUIN US!” The cyclops screams in despair.I wonder how that could’ve been avoided,she sardonically thinks. It seems like they ran out of steam quite quickly, all they can do is watch in a stupor as she lays out their fate.“Of course not, thisisa deal after all. If you wish to protect your files, then you must give up your child. And if you wish to protect your child, you must give up your files. Those are the terms of this deal.“But though I may be cruel, I am notirrational. I am quite understanding if you don’t exactly have classified files within arm’s reach. So I will give you twenty-four hours to retrieve them. If we can come to an agreement, then I will honour my end of the deal and release your child.“But if we cannot come to an agreement, then I will honour my promise and kill your child right here.”She lets the moment hang for an uncomfortable amount of time, letting the dread of a potential family death - apreventabledeath - linger in the air. She really hopes they can come to an understanding; though she has her contingency if things go awry, that depends on whether this negotiation succeeds or not. As seconds turn into minutes, the stupefied pair turn their heads and talk in a hushed silence. That’s good, she can pull the gun away without them noticing: her finger was getting tired of resisting.Minutes bleed into more minutes. They keep talking.More minutes bleed into even more minutes. They are still talking.As it was about to become repetitive, they finally turned to face her.“Do I trust that we can come to an agreement?”“No.”…oh dear, this had the potential to become messy. She has to be careful.“Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.” She baits, hoping it was a mistake. She already has her gun aimed and her finger willing.“Our answer isno,” the cyclops reaffirms, “We arenotcooperating with you.”This was becoming very difficult very fast. One last chance to fish out compliance.“Forgive me if I don’t believe you, but can you fault me for finding it quite absurd that a superpowered mother and father that espouse the values of justice, truth, and progress would so willingly consign their own child todeathjust to protect your employers?“No, no, that is simply preposterous! Imustbe mistaken in thinking this is the decision you have come to, so would you please take this chance to correct this mistake?”“As far as everyone cares, we never had Dylan.”The last thing Astheno sees is the thermal ray that bores directly into the screen, returning it to static.This was going to becomeveryannoying, wasn’t it?–This couldn’t be happening. This couldn’t befuckinghappening! I didnotjust see my own fucking parentsdisownme right in front of my fucking eyesand in front of a fucking supervillain for Christs sake!Did they really just abandon me to someone like her? Just to cover their own ass? I didn’t want to believe it, this couldn’t be real. This had to just be a really involved night terror that I’m just about to wake up from, it HAD TO BE!But it wasn’t. It was all real. Each passing second only sealed what I already knew.I started thinking about things. Of Mom and Dad. Of my siblings. Of my family as a whole, as the individual pieces, of the different combinations they made. It just became even more obvious now.…I thought they still loved me, atleast…?–Astheno was in a stupor of her own making, completely paralysed by the incessant and contradictory movement of her mind as she processed the events that had just happened. The logical order was clear: They had rejected her demand, she offered them two chances to accept, they rejected both of them and disowned their child. Thus, the negotiations have broken down and she must execute her contingency.It was that last part that was the root of her paralysis: theydisowned their own child in front of her. They were well aware of the loaded gun pointing directly at their child. Theyknew. This was so comically evil that she almost wants to laugh at the absurdity of it all. She doesn’t even try to keep her gun level as it slowly falls from its target as she considered a terrifying possibility:Did she miscalculate? Did she make a mistake? Was thisherfault?She thought she accounted for all the variables: she knew they weren’t exactly tight knit but the collected messages still indicated enough familial bond to elicit dangerous anxiety. Surely they could’ve fetched one of their other children to play hero, if they didn’t already notice the absence and went off on their own? Surely they would’ve noticed they were being tracked and enactedsomekind of contingency to, if not prevent, at least impede her?Surely they would’ve at leastcared?No good, she’s going in circles now. Speculation can occur infinitely but is ultimately meaningless if not referenced to reality. She rushes over to the now orphaned child and removes the mouth gag with haste. She's getting answers before she goes insane.“Speak. Now.”–The whiplash from the change in tone was intense. Before, she spoke with so much edge that I was worried she would cut herself on it. But now? That malice was gone. She spoke with focus and direction, no emotion save sheer determination. It was quite bizarre to witness, a good distraction from what just happened.But it looks like she wantssomekind of explanation. From me of all people. I don’t know if she’s going to kill me. Shedidpromise that if Mom and Dad didn’t cooperate that she would shoot me, and Daddidstraight up tell her ‘Go ahead, see if I care.’.Well, if sayingsomethingwould let me live even a few minutes longer, why not at this point?“I’m… not entirely surprised.”The look on her face changes again, it almost looks like a scowl.“Youknewthis would happen!?”What the fuck? Of course I didn’t!“I didn’t! I didn’t!”“Then whatgives?”I took some time to collect my thoughts again. I’d have to be careful with what I say to her, loaded gun and all.“I thought… they still cared about me, at least? I thought they would’ve cared enough to… doanything?“Why are they doing this? WHY? WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS?!”I can’t hold it in anymore. Tears stream down my face as I reckon with the agony of being unceremoniously abandoned by my ownparentsto a god damn supervillain who could quite literallykill me on the fucking spot. I truly thought they still loved me, cared about me, wished the best for me, their own fucking family!WHY?I just keep crying as I lament my own foolishness forwanting to believe my parents loved me.A loud bang brings me back to the present. Did the gun go off? I blink the tears out of my eyes and look around, seeing Aestheno at a table hunched over. The tone that emerges is, again, unlikely any I’ve heard from her.“Why…? Why?“WHY?!”The gun was thrown directly at the monitor, cracking it spectacularly to match the indignant bellow that preceded it.“What a fucking joke… truth? Justice? Compassion? It never meant a fuckingthingto you fucking degenerates! You fucking two-faced sociopaths are going to be death of me, I swear to Christ all mighty! How can you possibly lecture the government on social equity and justice when you willingly surrender your own fuckingdaughterto your actual nemesis? How amIthe only person to ever show her even ashred of empathy!? You were her parents for what? 16 years? If you never bothered to evenattemptto care about her then why didn’t you just give it up from the fucking start!? She didn’t deserveanyof this fucking torture!”Aestheno continued on with her incessant rant… and I never would’ve thought I’d actuallyagreewith an actual supervillain about anything, let alone my own parents. But in her impassioned speech delivered to no one in particular, a singular word caught every last mote of my attention:Daughter…how could she possibly know? I didn’t tell a soul, not even my siblings or my friends. And… why is she… respecting it? I wasn’t anywhere close to looking the part, to my dismay. So how could she see it?Why can’t I see it?It felt strange, to be validated like this. For the first time in my life someoneactuallysees me for who I am, not who they want me to be. But of all people it had to be a supervillain? One whokidnappedme, no less?What a fucking joke, indeed.–Aestheno had long cooled off from her tirade. With emotions winding down, logical thought could take over decision making, and there was a lot to decide. Like for example: what to do with the tied up girl - newly orphaned - now sitting in the room with nowhere to go. Truthfully she didn’t have a clue what to do, this was completely unprecedented. Still, something needed to be done.Closer examination revealed she had stopped crying and looked to be deep in thought. Aestheno could take a guess as to why. Still though, this was no place to keep her.“Hey, are you there?” She had dropped the act completely, instead speaking with a concerned tone. The girl simply nodded. Good enough.“Give me a name, nickname, anything I can work with.”The girl had a look of surprise before winding into thought again. Truthfully Aestheno already knew what was likely her name, but this was no time to feign intelligence, or anything for that matter.“...Allie.”The girl - now Allie - uttered her name meekly. Good enough.Aestheno moved swiftly, hitching the knife on her waist to cut the ropes that bound Allie whilst avoiding the cuffs that kept her hands tied. With that, she motioned for her to follow.–I followed Aestheno down some halls. It looked like this was a big building or compound I was in, not surprising for someone of her talents. My hands were still cuffed so I couldn’t really do anything even if I wanted to.IfI wanted to, because realistically? There was nothing I could do.We eventually stopped in front of a cell with 2 intimidating guards standing at point. Aestheno unlocked the door with a key taken from one of the guards before unceremoniously shoving me in, locking the door behind her. While I recoiled from the shove, I overheard Aestheno speaking to one of the guards:“Hostage procedure. 5 days unless stated otherwise.”“What about the files?”“I’ll be in touch with my contacts, this won’t impede my plans.”“I’d be disappointed if it did.”“So would I.”“If I may, what exactly happened up there?”“Negotiations broke down spectacularly. I’m actually impressed with how terrible it went.”“Yeesh, sounds rough. Should I page-”“No need. It wentthatbadly.”“Fucking hell…”“Just keep them safe. It’s the least I can do right now.”“Understood.”And with that, Aestheno walked away, leaving me effectively jailed inside her compound. With nothing else to do I took a seat on the uncomfortable bench to reflect on everything that’s happened today. This fucking sucks.–Aestheno sighed in her office. She had a lot of work to do.",
