I’m using: Sync Module 2 Blink Outdoor 3 cameras Blink Camera 4 Our property is pretty large, and I’m struggling to find a good placement for the Sync Module so that all cameras stay connected. Also, the Blink devices aren’t showing strong Wi-Fi signal, even though we have a well-covered FRITZ!Box mesh network. Does anyone have tips on how to improve range or the best way to position the Sync Module? Are there any external solutions (repeaters, mesh integration for Blink, etc.) that you’d recommend? Thanks in advance for your help!",

From motion or the app. Last time it did this I could turn them from the app, but now that doesn't even work despite the app confirming the lights are turning on. When I swapped the batteries for the floodlight unit and snap the bracket into place the lights do flash on for a second as they are supposed to. I've changed the batteries for both the floodlight unit and the camera, powercycled both units, reconnected the wifi. I have not deleted/re-added the units from the profile or deleted/reinstalled the app. The camera records fine and the motion detection for it is good. I do get some ghost recordings once or twice a week. If tried all the official troubleshooting. Does anyone have any definitive answers for this particular issue. Getting the wired version IS an option, but I want to see if there's a fix for the Wireless first.",

I found out it was stuck in night mode because it accidentally detected motion one time while stuck in night mode and it was just really bright white recording and you couldn’t make out anything in the video. The only fix I have found for this is going in and opening up live view EVERY morning then it will manually switch to day mode.

So 2 weeks back and forth with blink , setting changed , hub reset , factory reset , re added hub. I juat looked in the box of my other cameras and found another brand new hub - set it up added my home and bam all working . . . Clearly the last update fooked something up and stopped it recording local clips If you have another hub set it up it took 5 mins",

They have the Sync Module device. I have an annual subscription. I went away for a few days assuming that I could monitor them. I left the router on and all three were working when I left. However, within a very short period both the wireless cameras went offline. The wired camera worked as usual recording clips and permitting live view. From time to time, I would check the status on my app (iPhone) and it would say it was last updated a day or a few hours earlier. However, neither of the wireless devices ever came online. I could see on my router app that only the wired camera was connected to the wireless. As soon as I arrived home, both wireless devices started working. I assume that this was because the app on the phone was now in proximity to the Sync Module (and/or the cameras themselves). This is pure speculation on my part. Is there a way to resolve the wireless camera going offline for several days for no obvious reason? Why would the wireless cameras not work just because I am some distance away?",
