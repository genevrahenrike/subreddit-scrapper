Lactic acid has robust clinical backing for exfoliation and smoothing, frequently chosen for moderate cases. Salicylic acid helps with follicular plugging but is often considered less effective compared to the other two for KP .",

I have tried everything: Every acid (salycilic, glycolic, láctic), retinoids, tretinoin, urea, physical exfoliation, creams (like cerave SA) and serums (even the ordinary peeling solution). I even try laser hair removal and changing my diet. And if you ask, yes I also went to the dermatologist. I’ve already gave up, years ago until I saw a tiktok of a girl who went to the derm and he prescribe her a cream (no brand, just made in the laboratory) that has Salycilic acid 6%, hydrocortisone 1%, and lactic acid 12%. The girl said the derm told her to use it only for 2 months no more but she had results in a month and now she use it occationaly. I contacted the same derm to prescribe the same to me and let me tell you its been 1.5 weeks and never in my live I have felt my arms like that, any part of body is as soft as my arms now. Its like a miracle, I cant believe it. I still have the hyperpigmentation but I plan to use it the two months the derm told me to. I hope I can help someone with this, because like I said is like a miracle for me. Also the coments in her tiktok page said the same thing, it works.",

      "content_preview": "Hello! I’ve spent the last couple of years going through tons of Reddit threads trying to get rid of my strawberry legs . After testing a bunch of things, I wanted to share what finally worked for me. For context: I’m an Indian woman in my late 20s with PCOS, so laser didn’t really work for me (neither for keratosis pilaris nor for hair removal). The game-changer for me? Dry brushing!!! I don't know who that beautiful soul is who suggested this during my months of research, but man, that made such a difference. Invest in a good brush with soft bristles (shouldn’t feel scratchy or harsh). I use it twice a week before showering, moving the brush in gentle circular motions. I do it all over my body, taking my time and it’s honestly worth it! On non-brushing days, I rotated between: CeraVe SA body wash CeraVe Urea Body Cream (I can’t say for sure if they alone made a difference since I was experimenting a lot, but they probably helped support the process.) I also used: The Ordinary Glycolic Acid or The Inkey List Glycolic Stick (never on dry-brush days, that’s already enough exfoliation!). Dry brushing before shaving also gave me better results. After showering, while my skin is still damp, I always apply a good moisturizer. My go-to is cocoa butter, but any rich moisturizer should do. It took months of consistency, but now my legs have a healthy glow and I’ve actually been complimented on them multiple times. Hope this helps someone out there struggling with the same thing <3",

The cream is on the pricy side and very thick, which makes it uncomfortable to apply, but if it'll work then it would be worth it. I can't shower every day, but aim to every 2-3 days, and when I do I use CeraVe Sa Smoothing Cleanser. It's a chemical exfoliant, but I'm unsure if that's enough. Would using that in the shower, plus going over my body with an exfoliating glove be too much? My KP is very severe on my legs and upper arms and I've been trying and failing to find a routine that works for decreasing it for years. Any advice would be extremely appreciated.",

I've had it for sooo long, I think I first noticed my KP when I was first going through puberty and had mentioned it to my parents but they didn't care. My parents are fairly conservative and do not like me showing skin at all, they would make me wear denim jeans to the beach lol. I think they thought me having KP would just make me less likely to show skin. But now that I am an adult with a job and money to spend on skincare, I thought I would share my progress here! Attached is a screenshot from a google doc I've created to keep track of my progress. I've just switched to a higher concentration of Urea, I'm an ICU Nurse and had a patient who was prescribed a Urea 22% cream while in hospital. This person had extremely dry rough flaky skin and we weren't really sure what it was (not KP, ?possibly an allergic reaction/eczema flare), but the Urea improved the person's skin significantly (THE ROUGH SKIN SHED AND LEFT THE PERSON WITH GLOWING SKIN!!!) leading me to do a bit of my own research on Urea and its uses in higher concentrations. I'll see you guys in about a month or so for another update! https://preview.redd.it/kp-progress-v0-vu7c5cmd33kf1.png",

      "content_preview": "Hi I've been struggling with redness on my face for years. Recently I've tried Dr Jart Cicapair and it helped significantly by covering a huge part of the redness. However, after like three weeks I've started to notice that the facial redness after removing the concealer increased by a lot. What used to be full-flush redness is now the norm at it got me really scared. Does anyone know if the concealer caused this? First I thought it was the way the concealer has to be removed. It's quite hard to remove so I tried cleansers (which I think really break me out?) and also wiping my face really hard with a towel. But the last time I used Cicapair and cleansed my face with something different than cool water is almost a week ago and the redness is still extreme, way worse than it was before I first used it. Did I ruin my face permanantly or will this wear off with time?? My full routine is washing my face in the morning with cool water, applying sunscreen (Beauty of Joseon Aqua Fresh) and washing in the evening with cool water (shower). When I used the concealer it was concealer after sunscreen and cleansing at night. If someone has made similar experiences please help me out. Now I'm just waiting for the redness to go back to pre-drjart levels and maybe I want to try out the Hero Cosmetics Rescue Red Correct one as soon as it's better but I'm really scared it's going to stay that way.",

The fact that it has these two ingredients(raspberry ketones and indigo naturalis), which are not usually in skincare products and are not really tested for safety makes me a little concerned if they could be harmful. What do you think?",

      "content_preview": "I am not comfortable sharing photos, but I am happy to share my experience. TL;DR - My mild KP and redness have improved significantly with consistent use of SmoothKP after a few months. Process: Every morning, after lightly dampening my arms, shoulders, neck, and chest with water, I apply a quarter size amount. Every night, I lightly dampen the areas again (or just don't towel off fully after a shower) and apply a quarter size amount of La Roche-Posay Lipikar Triple Repair cream. Every couple of days (or after a lot of sweat/dirt/sunscreen), I exfoliate the same areas in the shower just using my hands with CeraVe SA Cleanser. Results: The bumps and dry flaky texture of my skin have improved more than I ever thought possible. I would say I am 95% smooth. I do not get many bumps anymore, and my redness has noticeably gone down. I wish the redness would completely disappear, but I am so relieved that this simple routine has worked this well that I really can't complain. Bonus: I don't have to be paranoid if I accidentally miss a step every once in a while. It doesn't seem to be a detrimental mistake. I was pretty nervous to purchase a topical product this way, but holy moly I am so glad I did. As someone who has tried TOO MANY products and processes over the years to find the issue only got worse, I am deeply appreciative that u/Poem_KP is developing solutions that actually work. I will be a lifetime customer. Also, I NOW GET TO WEAR SLEEVELESS CLOTHES IN THIS SUMMER HEAT! WOOHOO!",

I don’t have raised bumps anymore, my arms are pretty much cleared up with the occasional small bumps on the back and my legs have no more texture, just a bit of redness where the KP bumps used to be. Before it constantly looked like I had goosebumps on my legs. Here is the routine I have used. For my legs I stopped shaving, I started using depilatory cream on my legs twice a week. That was a major game changer for me since I was very prone to ingrowns from KP. I use Amlactin(green bottle) at night and a heavy ceramide cream in the morning every day and ordinary glycolic acid in a mister bottle once a week a few days after using the Nair cream as to not cause irritation. I also really like the bio oil lotion, not the oil though. My arms were always worse than my legs, visible poppable white heads on my KP all over my arms and sandpaper skin texture on the backs of my arms with red inflamed hard bumps. I started using the glycolic acid in the spray bottle 2x a week after my morning shower followed by a very hydrating cream like Cerave intensive moisturizing lotion, then sunscreen. I use this every morning regardless of if I use the glycolic acid. In the evening I use Amlactin on my arms as well. I shower every second day as to not dry my skin out too much and I use the Slather bar from Topicals. It’s a bit expensive but it lasts a while and you get two bars. I lather up with a bar and then wash with a soft sea sponge, not a loofa since there is a lot of chemical exfoliation in my routine and I don’t want to scrub my skin and agitate it. I know this is a lot of work but it has made a noticeable difference after maintaining this routine for 3 months. It may not work for everyone but I had success so I wanted to share!",
