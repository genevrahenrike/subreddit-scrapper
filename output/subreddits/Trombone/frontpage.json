I compose music for trombone and this is one of my latest books: a series of jazz studies for bass trombone based on standards that can help develop improvisation phrasing that is bass trombone in style and also perfect for concert solos with or without a backing track or live rhythm section.

I play a Schilke 53 on my tenors: small shank for the Yamaha Custom Z 3B clone that I play most, large shank for the Besson BE944 orchestral horn that I play rarely. I‚Äôm currently playing a Getzen 1 1/2 G - assume that it‚Äôs a Bach 1 1/2 G clone - on the bass. It feels pretty good but I‚Äôm wondering if the rim difference between the tenor and bass pieces will screw me up over time; it hasn‚Äôt so far. I know that mouthpieces are a highly individual choice but I wanted to get perspectives from other tenor players who double on bass. Should I try to get a bass rim/piece that‚Äôs as close as possible to my tenor ones or do the opposite (clear differentiation)?",

It feels like my tongue just refuses to get out of the way, so the air is there but nothing comes out. Once I‚Äôm past that first note, everything‚Äôs fine until i stop playing for a few minutes, and then I inevitably have the problem again. I know its at least partially mental, because if I play with a metronome (or in ensemble with a conductor) I don‚Äôt really have the problem ‚Äî the external cue makes it clean. But when I‚Äôm on my own, my tongue totally chokes that first attack (no matter how legato) and the note doesn't come out. I‚Äôve tried many fixes like just blowing with articulation and then buzzing it, etc. but the hesitation is still there, even if i really focus on just a light \"dah\" articulation. It started basically overnight and hasn‚Äôt gone away after a week. Has anyone else had this exact issue? Did you find something that actually fixed it long-term? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content_preview": "Hey! I have played trombone for six years and then stopped because my teacher wanted me to play mostly folk music which I don‚Äôt really enjoy. Unfortunately I sold my trombone back then. That's about five years ago. Now my main instrument is bass guitar and I'm starting to study jazz this year. But I want to get back into playing trombone and playing jazz on it aswell. So in my search for a new instrument I have so far put up a few criteria: it should be a tenor trombone with a trigger and a 6¬Ω mouthpiece. Besides that I don't really know much about trombones yet. I have found a few local used listings that match those criteria. What do you think about these? I don‚Äôt really want to spend more.. Yamaha Ysl 356G for ‚Ç¨900 Yamaha Ysl 648 for ‚Ç¨1000 Jupiter JTB1100FRQ for ‚Ç¨700 Jupiter JSL-636R for ‚Ç¨400 2 Max Enders Mainz without a model name for ‚Ç¨490 / ‚Ç¨700 Thanks in advance :)",

      "content_preview": "Back in 2011 I was getting back into playing trombone regularly after an extended hiatus. I posted on Craigslist looking for opportunities to play, and the only bite I had was from a punk/ska band. Back in high school I would have jumped at that, but my love of punk had faded a fair bit by my late 20‚Äôs and I declined the invitation. A couple years later, I was hanging out with a friend who had played in several off the wall groups during college and grad school and talking about music. He asked why I said no to playing with the group and when I didn‚Äôt have a solid reason, he said, ‚Äúman, you ALWAYS say yes when someone asks you to play in the band! You can always quit if it‚Äôs not a good fit.‚Äù Fast forward 8 years and one major relocation later and another punk/ska band asks me to sit in for a benefit gig. Thinking back to my buddy‚Äôs advice I said ‚Äúsure‚Äù. Now, six years later, and COVD aside, I‚Äôve been a regular with the group ever since and it‚Äôs been one of my favorite musical experiences of my life. Today, we played our last gig together for who knows how long. I‚Äôm moving away from the area for family reasons and bidding them adieu for now. Hopefully we get to play together again in the not so distant future, but my summers of loud outdoor concerts are going to be different now. Then again, I‚Äôm sure there will be another band I can say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to. TL;DR, if someone asks you to sit in with them, give it a shot, even if you‚Äôre hesitant. You might get years of fun and some good friends out of it, and even if not, you‚Äôll get more experience!",
