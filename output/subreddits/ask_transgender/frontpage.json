Even when I hear all the negative things placed against the trans community, I still feel that indescribable need to become a woman in the outside. I’m feeling doubt because my mother is saying that I NEED to feel disgusted and appalled by my male body- which, at this point, I’m mostly apathetic to it. I feel no self pride in my form and know I’d be happier as a woman. Another point is that I feel like my male clothes are only to cover my body. I can’t express myself like this. I feel that I could express myself in dresses or other female clothes, but I don’t feel like a femboy or drag or cross dresser, yet I’m told that I’m not trans for this point alone.

I am into muscle building and normally wear tight t shirts. I have started and stopped transitioning few times during this. My Endocronologist have been very helpful. Every time I stopped transitioning, dysmorphia came back stronger and I started estrogen again. All my hobbies are masculine like body building and hunting etc. I do not like men.

Seriously, I don't know why that's such a complicated or strange question.  For example, if some young guy were in a motorcycle accident and was an organ donor, doesn't it seem possible that his genitals or at least his penis could be transplanted on to another guy who, let's say, had his genitals damaged or lost in military combat?  Moreover, I wonder if a penis couldn't be transplanted onto an FtM trans individual?  (I know this isn't exactly a story with photographs that you would find in \"People\"  magazine in the grocery store checkout line. It's not like someone getting a face transplant - they can show pictures of that. They can't show pictures of male genitalia. But doesn't it seem possible that it has already taken place somewhere in the world?)",

Some have really turned all of that against me now and use it to win arguments and even may refer to my deadname or misgendering in an aggressive manner. And I unfortunately have reacted poorly too - where I should have just walked away. Why does this happen and how can we truly trust people? The ones close to us? Im feeling a bit gutted.

      "content_preview": "I (21, AMAB) have been questioning if I'm a woman on and off for... I think a couple of years, now. To be honest, I still haven't taken many if any steps in the way of experimentation or actual transition in part out of fear of 'rocking the boat', but I'm also kind of starting to worry that that's indicative of a lack of desire to actually transition. I think the first couple months after I started questioning I was kind of riding a high of the idea of something changing in my life that could end up making me happier, and it's sort of hard to remember if I've had spikes of that same high since then or not. It's really difficult to know what things are genuine feelings about the idea of being trans and what are just things I'm tricking myself into feeling because I've absorbed so much information about being trans and I'm trying to delude myself, y'know? Honestly, it's kind of disheartening to realize, but it's not like I'm crying myself to sleep over dysphoria every week or unable to see 'me' in the mirror. For some reason the idea of coming out of all of this just to be 'Cis+' or whatever just feels so disappointing? And kind of shitty, too, in the sense that I spent so much time thinking and reading and in trans spaces just to turn out to be someone weirdly obsessed with the idea of transition. It's like 3AM, so I'm not sure if this makes much sense or not, TL;DR Just still pretty stagnant in the questioning process and now starting to wonder if I need to just drop the idea entirely or not. Happy to elaborate in the comments, thank y'all for your time and patience.  Hopefully I'll get this sorted one way or another.",

I want HRT, I want a feminine figure and breasts but I’ll be damned if I’m only dressing in women’s clothes or making my voice sound different. And to be quite honest I quite like the way my face looks with a beard… anyway TL/DR any body got any experience as a bearded lady? Workboots, mustache, lacy undies and a cracking pair of boobs.

But I’ve never felt dysphoria before. I don’t hate my body. I don’t feel like I was born in the wrong body. I don’t look in a mirror and hate what I see. I don’t feel uncomfortable being a man. But yet I’m still “questioning” anyway. And I know that cis people don’t really think about it to this extent, so it has to mean something right? Like if I were cis I wouldn’t ask my friends to call me she/her pronouns or call me Maisie or wear dresses or put socks in the chest of said dresses to make it look like I have boobs. But I don’t feel dysphoric and that’s what makes me so confused. I don’t hate my body or hate being a man but I am still questioning anyway. I don’t feel like a girl. I don’t feel dysphoria. I don’t hate my body. I don’t feel like I was born the wrong gender. I’m a man. I feel like a man. But yet I like being called She and Maisie it makes no sense. One stupid fucking unfunny joke ruined my god damn life AND MADE ME HAVE A FUCKING IDENTITY crisis. Like I don’t feel like a girl but I put socks in my dress to make it look like I have boobs. I don’t fucking understand it. My mental health is fucking crumbling. I’m just a confused man in women’s clothing. Why does this keep happening to me? I just wish it could go back to the way that it was. The way it was before I started “questioning”. The way it was before I made that one unfunny joke that spiraled into an identity crisis. I never had to think about it before. It was just a fact. I’m a man. Because that’s what I am. I do not feel dysphoria. I am comfortable with my gender and being a man. But yet I’ve been questioning my gender for months and it makes no sense. Like none of any of this shit fits my experience. I can’t be cis because I like being called she/her and Maisie. I can’t be trans because I still know that I’m a dude and I like being a dude and don’t feel dysphoria or hate my body or gender. I’m not non binary cuz I’m not neither gender or both, and I’m not genderfluid because I’m not a man one day and a woman the next. None of it fits. I just want it to go back to the way it was. When it was so much simpler. Before my life was ruined by an unfunny joke that went too far. When it wasn’t a question.",

      "content_preview": "Hello all, I am a 32 year old MtF, post op with bottom surgery. In terms of my transition, I'm very happy with my appearance. My question and symptoms are purely for quality of life. Originally I was on 1 mg of divigel, which seemed to serve me fine. After surgery, the divigel seemed to reduce its effectiveness. From 120 pg/ml to 90 to 60 over 2-3 years. And with it came very bad menopause symptoms including vaginal degradation from dryness I changed to injection of estradiol cypionate 5 mg/ml at 0.3 ml which seemed to clear a lot of issues up. Then, 4 months later, I got the same hot flashes, vertugo and vaginal dryness/atrophy. I increased my dose to 0.4. and now I'm on 0.45 and I feel it happening again. Has this happened to anyone else? Is my metabolism getting that much faster, and is there a dosage or form of hormones that can just let me exist without getting these crazy symptoms every 4-6 months? Maybe I should switch to valerate so I can get a higher dose, or pills so I can take them every day? I'm very active and not very worried about blood clots. Anyways I would love some wisdom from transfems who have been in the game for a while haha, it's been so hard to figure out. I'd love to just know that the dose I'm on will be sufficient. (Edit: I will add I've gotten much more into sports over the years and have started exercising 3-4 days a week with high intensity, I'm not sure if that would change my needs. And don't worry I do plan to talk to my doctor, just wanted some wisdom from the community haha)",

      "content_preview": "Hey all, looking for some advice. Last July, I started HRT. I was on 2x 100mcg Patches every week and 5mg of Finastride daily. About a week in, I started feeling the side effects, mostly nausea and light-headedness. I knew it was normal, so I just decided to ride it out. When it came time to renew my prescription, I chickened out of phoning my doctor to get bloodwork done (thanks, crippling anxiety), so I just continued with the dose I was on (I'm with GenderGP in the UK as my provider). I still felt the side effects but, again, decided to ride it out until my next prescription was due in. When that came around, I still didn't go to my GP for bloodwork. Instead, I opted to switch from patches to gel (same dose) because I was told gel had better absorption. After a few more weeks of feeling like shit, having some ups and downs, I decided to just stop with the intent of going to my GP and getting help. That was back in January and I still haven't been to my GP because anxiety (and other family issues). The last year has been rough, mentally and physically, but I know I want to go back on HRT again. The issue is that I'm still feeling the nausea and occasional light-headedness that I felt when I was on HRT. So now I'm at a crossroads. I'm considering restarting using Cypro as my blocker because I've heard a lot about the long-term side effects of Finastride, but I guess I'm scared to feel the same way I felt last time and I'm unsure what to do. I don't know if it's worth going to my GP now and getting bloods done, despite not having any HRT in my system for over half a year, or if I ride it out until my next bloods are due and getting help from there. I guess I'm just looking for any advice or help because, honestly, I can't keep going like this.",

I wanted to see if my experience aligns with others though before using this analogy to explain dysphoria. The best way I can describe my experience is listening to your voice on a recording. No one really likes listening to their voice on a recording because we don't sound the way we sound to ourselves. It feels dissonant and just makes you want to cringe. It's definitely you in the recording but it's not the you you're familiar with. You think, \"is that really what other people hear when I talk?\" Dysphoria is like that but happens more often, like whenever you look in the mirror, or are referred to with the wrong pronouns, or just when you hear your speaking voice regularly. Did I hit the mark?",

      "content_preview": "Hi! I'm 22 AMAB and genderfluid. I would say my feelings are split roughly in the proportion: 20% male 40% non-binary 40% female My gender changes usually over the course of a few hours and so changing how I present in that time frame isn't really feasible and would be pretty exhausting if I kept it up. Transitioning is a paradox. If I don't transition then I would be able to avoid all social stigma surrounding being trans and also my gender would still match how I present 20% of the time. BUT I I also feel such intense gender envy at times that it's almost tangibly painful. It sometimes feels so invalidating to know that I'm trans and simply do nothing about it. If I do transition to female then I will face A LOT of social stigma, plus the added effort, stress, and cost of transitioning (not to mention any adverse health side effects hrt might have or infertility). But I will be able to more often feel that I'm living true to my gender. I suppose I could try to be androgynous but I think unless I came out and explained it, people around me would just think I was too effeminate or soft or weak. It just feels like a struggle, what can I do? :/",

I did not anticipate such a close day, i did tell them im  flexible and would prefer it to be soon but  damn.. 3 weeks? I feel so illprepared! -I need to quit smoking like asap -l was Wondering if I need arnica -gotta arrange a recovery place So many factors that stress me out already. I know 1 already said it but im really thrown off by how soon the surgery was scheduled It'll be a ~ 5h surgery including: Thick skin rhinoplasty -Type 3 brow bone reduction through incision ear to ear 4cm behind the hairline -genioplasty(i have a upturned weak chin with a fold) Please feel free to answer me with your advice or anything:) Wishing everyone a good day and health!",

      "content_preview": "Hi. I've been identifying as a man for over five years now (known for longer), I'm known as a man to my friends, school and a few family members. I turned 18 this year, which means I can finally apply for the dysphoria diagnosis you gotta get over here in Finland to get T etc. But the thing is, I'm suddenly doubting everything so hard that sometimes I'm panicking because what if this all was just some mistake. Thing is, I've dealt with a base level of derealization & anxiety for around seven years now. I've had a shit ton of other mental health slumps to overcome in these past few years too, some of them because of feeling hopeless cuz I'm trans. I had a rough upbringing, so that fucked me up for a bit. Now I'm (mostly) back on my feet but the derealization is still there most days, though I've noticed it letting up more than usual these days. I've never gone to a professional about it or told anyone but a few friends. Anyway. It's cuz of this kinda disconnect that I've been feeling doubtful about being trans. Like, what if I've just been faking it or deluded myself to believe I'm something I'm not you know? I've caught myself thinking what if I'm a woman after all and just have been dumb and disconnected these past few years???? And sometimes the thought doesn't feel all wrong if i think hard enough. But then again when I try to imagine my life as a woman...it doesn't feel right either. I wanna be an uncle, a brother etc. Not a sister or aunt or wife. I think the change is what scares me cuz what if I get on t, get top surgery and suddenly realize I've always been a woman? Or I don't recognize myself anymore, or I just feel like a woman dressing up as a man? Or what happens if I suddenly realize now that I'm a woman and have to explain to everybody that I'm not who I thought I was??? But I dunno. I feel like a man, but also don't. I don't know how to explain it. It could be a type of dysphoria ngl, that I just don't feel \"man enough\" right now and feel like I gotta prove myself by being some version of a dude I'm not...but everything for some reason scares me now. Could be internalized transphobia, which I think I might struggle with... I'm happy when my chest is flat or when my voice becomes deeper when I'm sick, when I pass to someone and stuff but also I feel weird sometimes when I think about being seen as a man. I feel insecure about it I guess? Like I'm not at all sure anymore. As if I haven't binded my chest for years and years, as if I didn't fight like hell at my old school to be seen as a guy, as if I wasn't sure about it before, as if I don't hate when my hips show or my chest isn't completely flat. I was so sure just a year or two back. But now? I don't know what the fuck happened to suddenly make the one thing I'd been looking to as my literal lifeline (applying for that diagnosis) seem so daunting and scary and unsure. Please if anyone has felt like this before hmu and tell me how you got over it. Thank you in advance.",

I'm basically only doing estrogen monotherapy essentially after a bad experience with Spironolactone. Anyway is oral Estradiol actually safe to take whether in the short or long term? I was very hesitant about getting an oral Estradiol prescription because I worry how it would impact my liver. I mean I wanted to get Estradiol injections. However I wouldn't have been able to get any prescriptions for that since I don't live near by a medical facility that could provide those medical instructions. Also how effective can oral Estradiol be with achieving great feminizing physical changes as well as actually suppressing T without any anti androgens being used?",

One thing that has haunted me both pre and post outing is having to introduce myself to others. Before, i always felt like my soul was getting mutilated, just active self sabotage/harm, small part of me always died then. Now i just feel fucking strange, like im just inducing people into some collective psychosis, where they have to see me as a normal woman even when they clearly share this lingering feeling of light judgement/othering. A miniscule blink, subconscious up and down stare after i tell them my name, taking note of all the gender “impurities” causing disharmony between social and my own preffered reality. This doesnt happen with everyone, but its pretty consistent. Does one get over this or should i just suck it up and maybe lie about shit even more? Ok maybe embrace the fantasy, just start saying shit, construct an alternate social reality yeah. Righ now i just find myself not saying my name to people at all which is pretty funny but also makes me feel more evil",

      "content_preview": "-Is laser facial hair removal permanent, or if a person decides to stop, will hair eventually grow back? I noticed after one treatment my facial hair has slowed its growth to a snails pace, the hair doesn't get longer than 1mm at all places of my face, I only need to shave barely once a week maybe longer whereas before laser it would be 5mm long in a week. -which is the preferred laser type for mtf trans faces? Diode or candela type? My laser provider uses diode (Elysium pro). I have no experience with different types just this one. 👍 Thanks",

      "content_preview": "I wanna try out trans tape/taping bcuz I have breathing issues and can't bind w/ binders/sports bras (w/o discomfort) and Ik taping doesn't restrict your chest/breathing like that and so I was looking for some advice on anything you know about it. Examples of questions I have (though there is a lot more, so just say whatever you know pls): Is there anything dangerous about taping? How do you put it on/take it off? What do you recommend specifically to buy if I'm on a budget? What's the longest I should wear it for? Can I go swimming w/ it on? Can I wear it w/o a shirt over it? Etc. Any tips, advice, and/or facts are much appreciated, thank you",

When speaking or writing on past performances, is it right to say he, as it was pre transition, or do I apply her retroactively, when speaking of the past?  Should I say ‘she was known for being loud and boisterous’, when referring to appearances when still identified as male?",
