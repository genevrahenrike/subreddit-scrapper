      "content_preview": "Hi guys! I have received like a bazillion texts on my experience going through with Prison caning, and I can not reply to all 100 of you in my DMs 😭so let me make a post to answer your queries. For context, I took the strokes from 2021-2023, total 12 strokes. All charged in Prison, not sentenced with strokes. Yes it hurts. But it’s solely up to different people’s pain tolerance. Similar to how a tattoo on your neck would hurt but not to another person. Yes flesh does drop on the floor, especially for those of you taking more than 6 strokes. Anything above 2 already abit crazy ngl. Pain is intense. Yes, there can be female officers present. Yes, you will be caned only by SPEAR team officers. No, there is no way of knowing when you will be getting caned. It’s completely random and a surprise, unless u and the officers are super duper close 🤣. Then maybe they’ll tell u LOL. Yes, they do offer spraying iodine on your buttocks after the caning but to me, I’ve tried it before and there isn’t much difference. No, other inmates won’t be able to see you getting caned, but there can be more than 10 officers present at a time. Max I see was full room lol. Yes, you won’t be able to sit or sleep or bathe or shit properly the coming days. Any long side effects? Not for me, no. But I’m no doctor. Can’t guarantee. But long term scar have la 🤣 It’s a 30 mins process. They unlock you, cuff you, walk you to caning zone, ask u strip and change to the armoured caning pad that exposes your butt cheeks, then wait for ur turn. During your turn, you thumbprint a form (think it’s digital now) and waiver, then go strap onto a gurney that straps ur wrist, ankles, and legs, making movement impossible. No escape Liao 🤣. Every stroke will be about 5-10s gap each time, and you can hear the cane whipping the air. Just focus on breathing. Deep breath, just before it hits breathe out. It helps a ton. But feel free to dm me asking about other questions :) or if still need to clear it up haha.",

      "content_preview": "Hi! This is sort of a part 2 from my “Criminal” experiences whilst I was still active there. You may refer to my profile and my past posts for references to how I know all these As I mentioned in a comment which got viral, some famous ah Beng influencers that we all know made their pot of gold selling K Pods and Vape, and still do today. Why are K Pods seemingly unstoppable? I have a personal story to share: After my release in prison (This is a follow up to my previous post) in 2023, I had a bunch of criminal friends still. They never changed, never found meaningful work, and kept asking money from me, who was already climbing up the financial ladder. Literally one day, around June 2024, the FIRST EVER hint of K Pods were mentioned. It was a fresh batch, nobody knew what was truly inside, people just knew it were drug laced vapes. I believe the first batches were rumoured to have been laced with Anaesthesia, Weed, and other drugs. I have tried it too, but thankfully my body has never been able to get addicted to something (I don’t smoke or vape too). But it is strong. Very strong. Within the first couple of puffs, your body will go slightly numb, your eyelids will droop, you start to yap nonsense, and you can barely handle daily tasks. My friend crashed to the floor, while I noticed that It got me very aggressive. U can barely even feel pain, because ur body is numb. That is how strong it is. My dear friend was unfortunately not so lucky and he got addicted. At first, I didn’t rlly care if it was sold in sg or not. But I started seeing people I knew die. They started appearing in the news, and nobody rlly knew how they died. Like some of yall know, influencers like WhiskeyPrincess died, amongst a few others. Because people were using it like vapes, and it is Extremely common to see people vaping. Everyone does it, every time of the day. Even my taxi uncles were doing it 🤣 So I had a hard stance on it because it was literally MORE DANGEROUS THAN ICE, GANJA, POWER etc. Unfortunately, my friend got so addicted, he even ran out of money, and to raise money he actually started being a supplier of K Pods. The worst part is, He legitimately even asked me to help him sell it, and label it as vape so that more people, underage people, would willingly buy it. How fucking fucked up is that? Needless to say, I cut ties w him, and he’s currently under police investigation. And what makes K Pods so desirable? Apart from its strong effects, it is fairly cheap, it is rechargeable just like a vape (ofc not forever, just a few times), it is “trending” now and people want to act cool, amongst bad peer pressure. And here’s the bomb — The profit margin is insane, which is why so many suppliers are selling it. My friend was raking in $25 per Pod, and now imagine, thousands were buying it daily. U could buy a Rolls Royce in a year! I hope everyone can wake up and stop supporting this. It is so sick to see so many people suffering from K Pods. Honestly, uw to vape, go ahead, just don’t touch K Pods. I don’t support it but I hope u understand that K Pods can kill, in just 2-3 months of using it aggressively like a heavy smoker. It’s way more dangerous than Ice or Cocaine. Wake up your idea. Ofc if u don’t vape, that’s even better too. Your life is on the line. K Pods are a slow acting poison that WILL kill you eventually. If everyone is still on the same dosage of k pods that they’re taking, in 5 months time we will be seeing news of bodies found lying everywhere in Singapore. Think properly la. I am an ex convict that changed, so why can’t you?",

Instead of nipping the problem in the bud when it is small, the authorities prefer to \"monitor\". Years later, the problem becomes big enough until they have no clue how to effectively solve it. Take a look around you: Vaping, PMAs burning down houses, PMAs speeding at walkways, HDB hoardings, bird feeding, allowing delivery companies to use void decks for sorting, motorists not yielding at pedestrian crossings, being lenient with the No eating/drinking on public transportation, and many more. I feel that our government is now helmed by stupid people.",
