Just watched the episode where Brie told Brady the truth about Lark and then things happened on the pool table, their chemistry is amazing! Also I loved the Christmas episode, it really gave hallmark. And I loved the drive in video showing outside episode too! Can't wait to finish the rest of season 6! I need season 7 to come out immediately lol.",

      "content_preview": "When season 2 ends (the best 2 seasons are the first 2 imho) you become the new writer of the show. How would you move forward? I’ll start; it’s a great moment to fix the timeline. Season 3 will start with a time jump. as for Charmaine; her pregnancy is almost done, skip Todd and stop the messing around with Jack and get right to Calvin being the father of her kids. Jack being shot will take longer to heal and it will trigger is PTSS even more. Skip the fire in his new house, skip the drug story, etc. Focus on the PTSS. I would stick to Cameron being an replacement for Doc, but also make him stir up things more between Mel and Jack. I really like Brie. So I would find a way to introduce Brie into the show. Her dealing with her ex boyfriend will get a bigger part in de show. And Brady ofcourse. Preacher will somehow end up with the woman in the bar (forgot her name). Maybe later Paige will start to appear again. Skip Kaia. Somehow I want to make Hope less annoying 😅 Not really interested in Lizzie, so no idea what to do with that part. So maybe it’s a good thing that I’m not a writer in real life, but for me that would make the show even more interesting to watch. Still drama, but not all the drama from the current seasons in 6 months.",

Copy paste from Wikipedia: <...> as Lizzie (season 2–present), Connie's troublemaking niece from Los Angeles. I thought she would be a rebellious teenager who gets in trouble. And at first she was something like that. And that's why I disliked her and Ricky: I was \"scared\" she would ruin Ricky's character. However, later on she wasn't such a bad kid and... I got to like her and Ricky as a couple. And she becomes kinda cool, however, I don't like her and Denny. In short, I have mixed feelings about Lizzie and just curious what fellow fans feel like.",

It is really a PHENOMENAL show to have me in my feels every second of the way!! I need to know what happens next. And personally, I think after Lark overheard Brady and Brie talking , she went and took all the money and either went back to Calvin or going to be on her own.

      "content_preview": "I'm a horse girly. This is a rant about all the mistakes I've noticed in this show, just a heads up lol. It's for me to rant, but also to let not-horse-people know, that what they showed in the show horse-related is super dangerous for the horse and rider (mostly horse). EVERYTHING that involves Sugar in this show is a really bad example on how to handle horses. I love this show (except for the fact many of them should go to therapy and hardly anyone does) but mistreating animals and kids always gets to me. Also, putting Tucker (Charmaines dog, who also kinda dissappeared?) from hand to hand and gifting a puppy on Christmas comes to mind too. Don't know why they needed to add this topic. I love horses so much so most scenes with horses make me angry lol. My biggest ick is how they tie Sugar on a knot halter. They can break their necks/nose bone if they're tied to a knot halter, DON'T EVER DO THAT. They do this in every western movie and show. I've seen the injuries that could happen if the horse spooks! Also, horses are social, they need at least 2, why did they wait until the wedding to give away Sugar/or find a 2nd horse? And at the end, they have only one horse and no talk about adding a 2nd. Ugh! And none of them know anything about horses. You can't just buy an animal you know nothing about, tf? How on earth did he survive a fire and a winter as a domesticated horse out in the wild? Why do Hope and Jack think it's easy to teach a horse how to accept a rider (Western ppl often call it \"breaking\", which I find highly inappropriate, as it seems to me it's due to Western riders often breaking the will of the horse, which I assume is still done but is more outdated luckily)? Why do they make it look easy for Jack to teach and ride Sugar? It's like Flicka and all those movies where there's just a special connection and suddenly horse and rider appear perfect together all over again. Idk if Sugar really was green, maybe someone knows what horses Lily and Tara were riding cuz I don't remember, but if Sugar was in fact green, there's no way Jack could hop on a horse, that's rising (front hooves up) because of the pad, within a few hours then canter around. It takes a while. Especially if you don't wanna traumatize the horse. Idk if he was riding once or more in the past (with Brie and parents), but if it was just this once, how does he remember how to put on a western saddle? (I'm an English rider, but I heard it's a bit difficult to put on a Western saddle and idk if it fits well, maybe western riders in the comments can answer that) Btw, Jack (well, the actor) can't ride well. Yes he stayed on in a canter, but he was hopping in the saddle like a bunny. That's bad riding lol. Also riding without a helmet, but I know western riders tend to not wanna protect their brain, so I guess that's close to reality and my only issue is kids who might watch the show and refuse to use a helmet because of it (and all the other shows). And Jack said he tied him behind the barn for HOURS because of the wedding? Did they not freaking put up fences in all those weeks so he could go out? Do not ever tie a horse unattended for more than 10 minutes! And now let's ride on a horse, mind you, not even in training, as two adults. Won't risk the horse's back at all (sitting without a saddle, which Mel did, is uncomfy for the horse and sitting BEHIND the saddle is risky because the back isn't as strong back there). And cantering on hard ground as well which is also great for the legs (im being ironic btw). Why do they always do this in shows/movies? If I wasn't a horse person I would think that's beautiful with Mel's dress, but not with the knowledge I have. And why is Mel so goddamn mean about Sugar? It's unlike her, and she always wanted a pony as a kid? I get the responsibility is immense, but she seems to dislike Sugar for what he is. I fear that since Jack kept Sugar, there'll be more horse scenes in season 7 and maybe even after. I hope they only show Sugar out on the fields grazing with another horse. Apparently they love to do everything horse-related wrong, so that'd be the only good they could do. Did y'all notice anything good or bad that I didn't? All animals related, not just horses.",

I have been so team Brady and Brie. Obviously because they were in a relationship first and I never thought they'd break up. So when they broke up, and she got with Mike, I was really upset and still rooting for Brady and Brie.. Okay, fast forward, season 6... SPOILER SPOILER when they had the affair, I got a little bit excited but then, I don't know. I'm conflicted. I hate cheating anyways so even though they were together first, I felt icky about it even though I was initially thinking \"FINALLY\". I kind of feel bad for Mike and I also think I wouldn't be upset if Mike and Brie ended up staying together. He has grown on me and he is way healthier for her to be in a relationship with. I'm really curious what everyone else thinks about it too. Did you guys have a preference initially, that has changed? Are you still rooting for whatever relationship you were rooting for in the beginning? I'm very torn.... I just feel like Brady is so in love with her and they have that passion and chemistry that she doesn't have with mike.. On the other hand, Mike really is such a good guy... The lawyer and cop duo is such a power couple and the easy drama free vibe of their relationship also draws me in. I don't know.. It's so hard for me. I don't know who I want her to end up with now!!!! I understand why she's so torn.",

      "content_preview": "Virgin River has moved to Mexico!  Although Vancouver filming ended on June 20th, additional scenes are currently being filmed at Hacienda Cenote Oxman (site used in other Netflix shows.)  Alexandra Breckenridge (Mel) and Martin Henderson (Jack) were seen filming in pics leaked online by fans. Could this be the couple’s long awaited honeymoon? Or babymoon? Now news about Charmaine and her twins. Casting information confirm her twins are to appear in the  block of episodes 1-2 and shooting outside her salon is in the block for episodes 7-8. Hopefully this means they are alive and well throughout the entire season. It seems Lizzie and Denny’s little girl is scheduled to make her debut in block 3, episodes 5-6. A Grace Valley Mobile Medical Unit has been seen parked in VR. Looks like Doc’s medical license suspension will not be resolved quickly. Cody Kearsly (Clay) is a former rodeo rider who comes to VR looking for his younger sister. They had been in foster care and separated. Could this be Marley? And although it was suggested that Marley would give up her baby to Mel and Jack, could she decide to keep the baby after reuniting with her brother? Some final shooting in Vancouver was done at a location that appears to be Roland’s (Hope’s ex) ranch. Cast members were dressed in period costumes and it is suggested that the town event will be a Civil War reenactment. Wagons and fake horses were on set.  I think a theme about the California Gold Rush would be appropriate. Didn’t gold miners and panners shout “Eureka” when finding gold? This information has been taken from “What’s-on-Netflix”, June 30.",

But Mel and Jack get just shrug their shoulders and accept that text massage as if it's totally normal that some things just come up so you don't go to the wedding of your friends. I'm so mad. I'm certain the last minutes will reveal that Charmaine is in some weird hostage situation or the twins are taken from her by Calvin or something like that.",

Jack and she (apparently she didn't mean it) agreed that they were in it for fun.  Friends with benefits if you will.  She apparently didn't take that to heart (which, let's be honest, over an extended period of time, I get her WTF attitude at the initial confrontation).  However, as the 1st season drug on and into Season 3 now (yes, I'm playing catch up), she is still \"it's my world and you're just living it,\" \"why could you possibly have a problem with the decisions I'm making b/c well, everything is about what I want\".  I don't know if she makes it past the pregnancy, but I would not be heartbroken if her character is unalived in childbirth.  I might eek out a tear b/c that is a sad situation (especially with having had two still births on the show thus far), it seems like we are due a full on adult woman who has bad behavior to also go gently into that good night.",

One show I’ve grown to enjoy is Virgin River, partly because it’s shot all over BC, in places I hike regularly. Something I’ve noticed over the past few seasons has stuck with me. During filming season, I occasionally visit locations when my schedule allows, and every year, I seem to run into the same small group of women. I just saw them again this week. They’re clearly not local, but they’ve become familiar faces even to some of the cast, who’ve come over to say hi more than once. They’re often chatting with crew or people on the production side and always seem to know exactly what’s being filmed and where. One of them even posts comparisons of the show’s scenes with the real-life locations, public stuff, but detailed. That’s fair, of course, but it makes me wonder if they’re getting more than just geography. Sometimes it feels like they might know elements of the plot too. One of them may work in the industry, which could explain it. Maybe I’m just sensitive to this kind of thing, my day job is in compliance, where things like discretion and access really matter. Still, the whole setup has made me curious.",

      "content_preview": "Okay, hear me out. What if Virgin River isn’t real — not in the way we think. What if everything we’re seeing is happening in Jack’s mind… because he’s still in Iraq, badly wounded or in a coma? Here’s the theory: Jack never made it home. The entire series is his brain trying to construct a version of peace, love, and redemption — a kind of mental escape from the horrors of war. Let’s break this down: ⸻ Virgin River is TOO perfect (and conveniently imperfect) The town is small, quiet, scenic — it’s basically the opposite of Iraq. Everyone has tragic backstories, but somehow people keep finding healing, love, and second chances. Sounds more like an idealized post-war fantasy than a real town. ⸻ 2. Mel is the emotional anchor Jack wishes he had Mel shows up as this beautiful, grieving nurse with trauma of her own — but she’s also a healer. It’s very possible she represents the compassion and care Jack craves while lying injured in a field hospital. She always “sees” the good in Jack. It’s the kind of emotional safety net a soldier might imagine as he’s clinging to life. ⸻ 3. Time and logic are… flexible Characters disappear and reappear. Plotlines resolve themselves strangely quickly. People forgive and forget major betrayals in a single episode. This dream logic tracks if Jack’s subconscious is stitching together a narrative where everything eventually works out, even if it’s messy. ⸻ 4. Jack’s PTSD moments aren’t just memories — they’re cracks in the illusion Every time Jack has a flashback or struggles with trauma, it’s his mind trying to pull him back to reality. The bar fights, the panic attacks, the drinking — it’s like his dream is struggling to hold itself together. Virgin River starts feeling less like a peaceful escape and more like a place on the verge of collapse. ⸻ 5. Why hasn’t he ever left Virgin River? Think about it — Jack talks about getting away, about change, but he never really leaves. That’s because he can’t. He’s stuck. Possibly in a coma. Virgin River is the mental construct he’s built to feel okay. ⸻ TL;DR: Jack never left Iraq. Virgin River is a coping mechanism, a dream world he’s trapped in while his body lies somewhere, waiting to wake up… or not. And if this theory is true, the final episode of the series could end with him waking up in a hospital bed, surrounded by machines — realizing Mel, Preacher, and the bar never existed. Just a theory. But once you start looking at the show through this lens, it’s kind of hard to unsee.",
