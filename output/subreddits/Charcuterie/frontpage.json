      "content_preview": "Hi, everyone: So, I very recently (like two days ago) received a fresh morcilla from a family friend that always insists on bringing me some. Most of the time, it is either vacuum-sealed or frozen, but this time, the friend forgot to do either of those things, and now I find that it has mould and that the casing is a bit slimy too. (Picture added for you guys to see the extent of the damage) Is this in any way recoverable or should I throw it to the trash? https://preview.redd.it/morcilla-help-v0-d9pz2hzog5mf1.jpg",

So: Step1: put layer of the salt on the bottom odf the barrell Step2:put layers of pork, salt between each layer Step3: fill it up with brine and seal it up Questions: -add brine hot or wait till its cold? -Add herbs between layers of pork or just boil them with brine? -i wanna use bay leaves, thyme and garlic are they ok? -i used to do this without brine and salt pulls bloody moisture from the pork, should i get rid of it before preserving?(Put in Salt, refrigerator for a day or 2 and then proceed the steps)? -should i change the brine every once in a while? -brine is in the barrell whole time? Thanks for any help, i did salt pork couple of times but without brine, meat wasnt submerged only the blok√°dy water that came out and i got a feeling it wasnt 100% (it tasted good but i m worried about bacterias).",

      "content_preview": "Hi all, I'm looking to buy a PH meter for making salami at home. Ideally, it's one with a reasonable price (ideally less than 200 CAD), has a replaceable electrode because buying a new PH meter every 1-2 years gets a bit expensive (so that rules out the Hanna Meat PH Meter), and is made by a reputable brand. I've looked around, and found the Extech PH100 (and PH110), which looks promising: https://www.itm.com/product/extech-ph100-exstik-ph-meter (130$ CAD) https://www.itm.com/product/extech-ph105-exstik-replacement-ph-electrode-module (63$ CAD) (Of course, I also need to acquire the buffer solutions). In the description, it says that it works well for solid and semi-solid applications. So I would guess it's good for meat, but since it doesn't have a spear tip (like the popular Apera PH probe, which is quite expensive in Canada, or the Hanna meat probe) I wanted to be sure it would be ok. But, if anyone has other recommendations (other than PH strips) then I would also be interested ! Thanks.",

      "content_preview": "We've got a Hobart slicer at home that does a great job of cranking out <1mm slices on our coppa and salami, but (as with all meat slicers) it's a bit of a pain to clean each time. To minimize the amount of slicer cleaning we need to do, we've tried batch-slicing a bunch at once and then vacuum sealing the slices in a bag, layered in offset rows on top of each other. However, after opening up those bags later, the thin slices have nearly fused together, and its difficult to peel them apart without them shredding completely. I'm sure we could solve this by putting parchment paper or something between each slice, but that makes packaging pretty laborious. Does anyone else know of a better way to manage this? Thanks!",

My question is what is the reason behind the variations and, when following a recipe, does using one brand or the other affect the quantities of cure #2 that I should use?

      "content_preview": "I‚Äôm going to try doing a whole muscle cure for the first time and decided on doing bresaola. I found a pretty good recipe that I‚Äôm thinking of using, however, I got a hot sauce recently that I really enjoy and wondered if it the flavors of it would go well with something like a cured beef product, so I figured maybe mix it into the bresaola cure. However, I don‚Äôt know if that would actually work? The recipe I‚Äôm using is mostly just cure #2, salt, sugar, and spices used to season the meat and then put into a vacuum bag for two weeks before moving to the chamber. Would using a ‚Äúwet‚Äù ingredient like a hot sauce during that phase mess up the cure? Thanks!",

      "content_preview": "I recently resurrected a broken 24-Bottle Dual Zone Wine Cellar by Wine Enthusiast with some parts from eBay, and now want to use it (instead of a regular dorm fridge as a curing chamber). It has two zones, the bottom one is as low as 46F and the top one is to top one 54F. Are both of these cold enough (with Prague powder)? The design is thermoelectric - I guess that is good for humidity control. Of course, no space for humidifiers or dehumidifiers. Questions: What should I use to increase the humidity - a saltwater plate at the bottom? Do I need to have a fan to move the air around and possibly help with saltwater evaporation? At this time, I do: pork loins, pork tenderloin, duck breasts, Armenian basturma from beef tenderloin (when found on sale) or eye round.  What is the ideal temperature/humidity range for these? Should I use a wine shelf to put the meats on or hang them with twine? Is cheesecloth really needed? https://preview.redd.it/wine-fridge-to-curing-chamber-and-some-relative-newbie-v0-ps5eoafe7nif1.png",

I just made it for the first time and it turned out great. But I was wanting to try it without the sodium nitrite. I understand that the sodium nitrite is mainly used to prevent botulism primarily in sausages where the sausage casing can create a low oxygen environment where botulism bacteria can grow. I know you can salt cure whole muscle cuts of meat of beef and pork where the muscle is denser where the only concern for bad bacteria would be on the outside of the cut of meat. However since chicken muscle allows bacteria from the outside to permeate  towards the interior of the muscle, would that create an anaerobic environment that would be a risk for botulism?",
