      "content_preview": "Welcome to the Physique Phriday threadWhat's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong -see here) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:Physique critiques.Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due toRule 4, andLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere toRule 1. This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.So phittit, what's your physique pheel like this phriday?",

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong -see here) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:Physique critiques.Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due toRule 4, andLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere toRule 1. This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.So phittit, what's your physique pheel like this phriday?",
