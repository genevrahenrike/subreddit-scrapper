I live equal distance between both, I’m hearing on the grapevine that frimley is very good, but the midwife at my local GP is linked to Hampshire (Basingstoke) so for now I’m booked there. We have a tour of Basingstoke soon - I know looks aren’t everything but frimley looks much nicer 😬 very grateful to hear any and all experiences. I’m a FTM with a low risk pregnancy if that helps.",

Not nice to see for those just scrolling by! Please report to mods any not marked. Also, to signpost resources for frequently asked questions: I have increased discharge, is this normal? \"Yes. It is normal to have more vaginal discharge in pregnancy. This helps prevent any infections travelling up from the vagina to the womb. Towards the end of pregnancy, the amount of discharge increases further. In the last week or so of pregnancy, it may contain streaks of sticky, jelly-like pink mucus.\" https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vaginal-discharge/ Is my discharge normal? Google images can be helpful here, but in general \"Contact your midwife if it smells unpleasant or strange It is green or yellow you feel itchy or sore around your vagina you have pain when you pee\" https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vaginal-discharge/ Is this my mucus plug? Again, Google images can help you identify what you are looking at. Baby Centre UK has a great resource: https://www.babycentre.co.uk/l25008775/what-a-mucus-plug-looks-like-photos Please try to find the answer yourself before posting pictures. Also please do not rely on Reddit strangers to accurately identify your bodily fluids. Always contact your midwife/healthcare team if you are concerned. I'm only 28/33/35 weeks, and I think I've lost my mucus plug. This is usually not a reason to worry, unless accompanied by other symptoms. \"You can lose a piece or part of your mucus plug at any time during your pregnancy, but it may regenerate. So, before getting too worried that yours has dislodged, consider that what you’re seeing may be other discharge.\" https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/mucus-plug-early-pregnancy#losing-it-early Always contact your midwife/healthcare team if you are concerned.

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I’m expecting my second (due date 14.09, but induction booked for 8.09) and can’t decide whether to go for a planned C-section or try for another vaginal birth. With my first I had a 3b tear, but honestly my recovery was ok — I was up sitting and walking straight away and didn’t go through a rough time like I know some mums do. This time, the doctors are leaning towards recommending a C-section, but they also said if I want to go vaginal, they’d probably induce me at 39 weeks to avoid the baby getting too big. That’s left me a bit nervous, because I’ve also heard induction can sometimes increase the risk of interventions and tears. I just keep going back and forth in my head. Part of me worries about another tear and the long-term effects on continence/pelvic floor, but then I’m also nervous about C-section recovery, especially with a toddler to look after. Has anyone been through this? Did you choose a section after a 3rd degree tear, or did you go vaginal again? Would you do the same if you had to decide again? Thanks so much! I’m really panicking here which isn’t helping that oxytocin 😂",

      "content_preview": "This is a very much wanted pregnancy through ivf at 38 yo but efing hell, it has been hard in every way. The sickness and fatigue have never worn off, I am definitely not \"glowy\" or \"forgetting I'm even pregnant\" and now I'm getting nearly daily pains that do not match up with anything I've read about and are scary as f*ck. The first time it started while I was jogging at about 16 weeks. It felt like period pain so I immediately stopped, walked home and phoned the midwife line. The pain wore of after sitting for a short amount of time and midwife said its just my bodies way of telling me it doesn't like that activity anymore. So I stopped running. Then it happens again on a short walk back to my car from work, then twice after a warm shower and on and on until any little thing seems to set it off and the only way to get rid of it is to rest with my feet up or lie down. Midwife just says I need to listen to my body and rest whenever I get it and maybe I have a sensitive uterus? So I'm on holiday in Devon, trying hard not to push it and was planning on an extremely short walk with my brother. The pain started in the car on the way to the walk! By the time we get to the tearoom at the bottom of a hill at the START of the walk, I'm in agony, needing pain killers, building crampy pain, dizzy, nauseas and feeling all hot and sweaty. Sitting doesn't help and I end up lying on the grass in the rain looking like a loon for about 20 minutes. Never felt so bad or been so scared in my life. Pain finally subsides enough to get back up the hill to the car where I end up having to fully decline my seat and not move for the 45 min drive back to the airbnb. Then napped for 40 mins. Feel better now but still a bit sore. Feeling baby boy kick often now and 20 week scan was perfect last week so I just don't know what's going on and can't find any info to help me feel more at ease. Am I really going to have to spend the rest of this pregnancy no more than 10 minutes walk from a couch or bed?! Should I ring the midwife again? Pretty sure there's not much they can say apart from listen to your body, but this is so scary and no one else seems to have it! Anyway if you've read all this thank you. Please let me know if you've experienced anything similar...",

      "content_preview": "Just wanted to post here as I previously had whilst pregnant. Birth Story❤️: I was admitted to triage on the Saturday with a high blood pressure at 39+3. I hadn’t had any symptoms and had never had a high BP before, but it was caught at a routine appointment that I had for a sweep! Once admitted to triage I was told that I would not be leaving the hospital without my baby, and that he needed to be born that weekend. I had told myself through my whole pregnancy that I would never have an induction (out of fear of the risks), and that I’d always opt for an elective C section instead. However, when given the choice, I changed my mind completely and agreed to have the pessary inserted that evening. About 6pm I had the pessary inserted and was admitted onto the maternity ward. I found the insertion a little painful so the midwife gave me gas and air which was perfect and helped so much. At 11pm I was just sitting on my hospital bed and and felt a slight pop (I thought I’d farted😂), it was my waters! They started pouring out of me and I noticed they weren’t the clear colour i was told they’d be, they had Meconium in them. Because of the Meconium, I was transferred back to delivery suite and had a cervical check to be told i was 2cm dilated. Around an hour or so later I started having contractions, but didn’t particularly dilate any further. I was told only my hind waters had broken and they offered to break my front waters, so I agreed. Like the pessary, I did find this very painful alongside the contractions but the gas and air worked wonders! My contractions started becoming closer together and more painful and so I opted for a remifentanil PCA for pain relief. About 10am on the Sunday I was told they’d need to administer the Oxytocin drip due to my labour not progressing and only being at 3cm. At this point I was exhausted and had been in labour for 12hrs and so I requested a C section. The doctors had no problem with this and were more than happy. Due to having Meconium in my waters, the c section was classed as an ‘emergency’. However, the whole thing felt so controlled and calm and I actually really enjoyed it and got to meet my healthy baby within an hour of requesting the C section❤️❤️ this was a week ago now! I made this post just to highlight that you can have lots of interventions like I did, and still feel 100% in control. During pregnancy I was TERRIFIED of labour and was convinced I’d get some horrible complications. This was nothing like my birth plan (natural water birth!!), but id do it all again tomorrow. I was not scared at any point, and never questioned my decisions. If anyone’s got any questions please let me know as I feel like I experienced quite a lot of things!😂",

I went in for my 12 week scan and mumbled to the sonographer that I was sure I had a blood clot in my arm (previously had a DVT in my leg post partum) but that my GP hadn’t taken me seriously - despite a family history of clots of PE’s. Thankfully my sonographer was amazing, I ended up kept in overnight for monitoring, onto blood thinners then sent home the following afternoon. The unexpected news forced us into telling our family as a precaution and honestly - I didn’t want to tell them for another month or so. I found it difficult having everyone knowing last time. I’m not having to inject myself until the end of my pregnancy, two injections at a time due to the dose and I’m not managing. It’s psychological this time, last time I managed fine. I don’t know what’s up with me, I guess I’m just a bit overwhelmed plus the usual pregnancy hormones? I dunno, I’m delighted I’m pregnant and we can’t wait for our LG to be a big sis! But I think I just feel out of my depths. Is this normal? Should I speak to my midwife for some additional support, or I ride it out and wait and see if the second trimester high kicks in? I’m just out of sorts, feeling flat. TIA",

Last week I asked if I could get a sick note to sign me off work for the week because you aren’t allowed to take more than 2 sick days in a row without a note at my company. I explained how sick I was, how my energy is so low that I am falling asleep whilst I’m meant to be watching my toddler and how I just can’t keep up with life at all, and this absolute gem of a doctor signed me off for three weeks!! He was honestly so validating, said I have hyperemesis and need proper time to recover and that a week won’t do much for that. I cried when I saw the note because yeah, I do need time, I was just trying to keep everyone happy. But my doctor understood pregnancy and how debilitating it can be enough to do this for me and I just really appreciate him. That’s the post really! But I guess whilst I’m here I’ll also say to anyone please don’t suffer in silence! There is so much support available during pregnancy and everybody should be allowed to live as comfortably as they can in this already uncomfortable time ❤️",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone, Writing this with my 7-day-old newborn in my arms. Really happy to share my positive birth story with you all. I hope it might offer some encouragement or insight as you navigate your own journeys! My labour officially started when my waters broke around 10 pm (confirmed by the midwife at 11 pm), but I suspect it actually began earlier that afternoon when I noticed a small trickle while I was manically bulk-cooking stews to load up my freezer (hello nesting!!!) — I just didn’t want to admit it was the start! On request of the midwife, we headed to hospital, where I had my first very light contraction and was sent home at about 4 am with instructions to return when I was 4–5 cm dilated or by 4 pm at the latest. I went home, caught some sleep, and tried to have a calm day — watched TV, went for a park walk, and got into this trance-like “zone” (not hypnobirthing, just my own rhythm). My partner filmed me. Looking back at that video, I looked a bit possessed! As the day wore on, my contractions grew closer and more intense, but I chose to stay home past the 4 pm deadline because I didn’t feel I had progressed far enough and was reluctant to go in and slow things down, as I’m not a great fan of hospital. Then, around 6:45 pm, something switched in me — I had this instinct that it was definitely time, and I wanted to get to hospital NOW. At triage, the midwife checked me and I was already 8 cm! At UCLH, over 6,000 babies are born each year, but they have only about four birth pools — so it’s really pot luck. I was lucky enough to get my requested spot in the midwifery unit with a pool. Over the next few hours, I kept progressing well, but things got tense. Because I was technically heading towards 24 hours since waters breaking, hospital staff started putting deadlines on me and pushing for an induction — which would have meant leaving the birth centre for the doctor-led unit. My birth plan made it clear: no inductions. My partner became my fiercest advocate, really pushing for the rationale behind why they were making certain decisions so we were comfortable and making informed decisions. My midwife sorted of hinted she thought the deadlines were nonsense too but had to toe the line. I kept yelping mid contraction, “I’m not going to that other room!” The compromise was a vaginal exam at 11 pm (when they wanted me to move) to see where I was at. Luckily, I was 10 cm dilated and the seniors gave the go-ahead for me to stay in the birth centre. That was exactly the motivation I needed. True to form, I was bloody minded and determined not to leave my birth centre room or change plans. So I pushed — and pushed for 25 minutes. And then he came! It was incredible to see his little head emerge as I was leaned over, and hearing him cry right there was just amazing. I came away from my birth feeling so positive about the experience. I just got in my zone, listened to music, and sort of shut off. That worked for me, but you must find your own “good.” I bought a TENS machine but didn’t use it, I bought massage oil and we had a go but I didn’t like it, I didn’t need hypnobirthing tracks — I had a bit of gas and air but didn’t really rate it, to be honest. But that was my birth and what was right for me — and I would have never known that until I was in it, doing it. So, go with the flow. This forum has been so helpful — a combination of lurking and posting for advice. It’s been warm and friendly, and just what I needed, so thanks to you the community that make it. Here are some takeaways from my pregnancy experience to pass on: 1.\tAdvocating for yourself during labour takes a lot, especially when you’re tired and overwhelmed. Be really clear with your birth partner about what “good” looks like for you, and get them to ask lots of questions so you can make informed decisions. We had a rule to always ask for 5 minutes (if safe) to discuss and then decide.\n\n2.\tPeople often want to give you stuff — I hate waste, so I bought all my clothes from Vinted and asked for no clothes as gifts. Instead, I offered a list of useful things people could get us. It really helped us end up with things we actually needed.\n\n3.\tPregnancy clothes are generally crap — check out my post asking for recommendations on non-horrific pregnancy brands. My favourites turned out to be Beyond 9 and Isabella Oliver (all Vinted). I also leaned heavily on baggy band t-shirts.\n\n4.\tTake the day off when you’re sick from work — I got in my head about taking time off (and actually took quite a lot during pregnancy). Seriously, look after yourself.\n\n5.\tPelvic floor care needs nuance — my pelvic floor was very tight, so doing loads of Kegels would have made things worse. From 12 weeks, I focused on relaxing my butt and vagina. If you can, see a women’s physio to understand your body and get personalised exercises. Honestly, best £90 I spent. Happy to answer questions in between cluster feeds and mum-life!",

It's like I hit the week before 3rd tri and I keep finding myself falling down rabbitholes about Lucy Letby, or lurking on preemie and recurrent miscarriage subreddits. I have no idea why but I feel compelled to seek out these morbid and difficult subjects. I think the preemie obsession is because I'm trying to reassure myself that even if my girl was born literally this week she'd probably still be okay as she's almost 28 weeks now (modern medicine is so amazing, there's some absolutely tiny babies that can survive and thrive) but I have no logical explanation for the others. I have autism and often find myself having special interests which are a bit alternative/dark, but this feels very on the nose and morbid given my pregnancy",

      "content_preview": "Trigger warning: loss, miscarriage Having now gone through two ectopics and lost two tubes, I wanted to give all of you some potentially life saving advice. First of all, ectopic pregnancies are rare. But they are life threatening. Most importantly: many have an atypical presentation. That is: you may not get typical symptoms as they are presented on the NHS website. I have heard too many stories of women being ignored, being told it’s a regular miscarriage or not being seen to in a timely manner. Ectopics grow fast, you can feel fine, and then in 24 hours, you can have a rupture that requires emergency surgery. Given that women’s pain is often ignored, that ectopics can be very sneaky in how they present and given how slammed the NHS is, I would like to offer some practical advice as someone who has now had 2 ectopics resulting in the loss of two tubes. If you suspect you are having an ectopic pregnancy, but you’re not sure - perhaps you only have one symptom - don’t waste time going to your GP. Go straight to A&E and tell them you have the symptoms of an ectopic as they are listed on the NHS website. Tell them you have one sided pain, bright red blood and shoulder tip pain. Put on a show. Say your pain is 7/10 or above. Yes, you are technically lying. No, when you consider what is a stake, it isn’t wrong. If you present with all three symptoms, even if you are stable, they have to admit you, and this will trigger a clinical pathway which will result in your HCG being monitored every 48 hours and multiple ultrasounds which will continue until the pregnancy is located in the uterus. Taking this action early could save your life. Not doing this may risk it. In 2015, I had an ectopic. I suspected it was what I had. I just… knew. But it presented strangely - cramping on both sides and bit of bloody discharge. They thought it was a miscarriage and sent me on my way. I kept going back, they kept telling me the same thing. It hurt, I was feeling dizzy, so they booked an ultrasound in a week’s time. Two days later, 5 days before the US, I collapsed and bled out in my home. We called an ambulance, and category ones were delayed by 20 minutes in my area. I was an hour away from A&E by car. If it wasn’t for a voluntary helicopter being on standby, I would have died in my home, in my husband’s arms. Second ectopic pregnancy, I presented with very minor pain. Very, very minor. A little tiny twinge on one side and light bleeding. I wasn’t taking any chances, so I lied to A&E, full theatrics, listed out symptoms by the book. Because of this I was closely monitored over the next week. It was indeed an ectopic. I had my last tube removed. I’m heartbroken, but I’m alive and safe. 6 women die in the UK each year due to ectopic pregnancies. Please, don’t be a statistic. It costs less than £500 to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy. Your life is worth so much more than that. Plus, if they catch it early, you may be able to keep your tube. If you’re even a little concerned: just lie. It’s not worth the risk.",

The toilet is dirty (with the bodily fluids of others) and the so is the staff room - I’m talking people leaving piles of food. I don’t know why but I’m really panicking about this, I think particularly because I have a food allergy and I’m so scared of cross contamination (the staff room smell also makes me retch). Also because of some of the bleeding I’ve had with the SCH, the dirty toilet feels so undignified. A health and safety risk assessment has been done, but I don’t think it was taken that seriously… Anyone else been through such a situation with work? I’m planning on spending my lunch break on a bench outside work…",

I have mentioned the off coloured discharge to my midwife twice and she said to just keep an eye on it. No itching. No smells.

Had a bit of blood yesterday morning. Carried on throughout the day but only after using the toilet. No flow to it. Just got up and as I sat on the toilet I could feel it coming out! Again doesn't seem to be a flow to it. It's thinner than period blood. No cramps or anything. Going to ring mau up when my kids are awake and see what they say. I am absolutely dreading having the speculum as it really does hurt and it also makes me bleed even more - typical with ectropions making everything so sensitive! Half of me just wants to ask to be swabbed for infections and to leave the speculum out of it - they won't be able to see much if I am bleeding anyway! Anyone else been in this situation?

      "content_preview": "More using this as an outlet than a question, but because I was a regular at the gym before pregnancy for 10 years I thought keeping it up during pregnancy would be a breeze. How wrong I was. The first trimester took me out completely, and the fatigue never fully lifted until about a month th into the second trimester. During this time I did a home workout about once a week and went for walks but that was it.  Although I'm now regularly going to gym again, started at around 18 weeks and now 22 weeks. The weights have gone down drastically, nowhere near as strong as I used to be. And the cellulite is definitely there. My body has changed quicker than expected and I must admit the cellulite is taking getting used to for someone who always had an athletic build. Im in awe of what my body is doing growing a little human, but how fast my body has changed is taking getting used to. I guess part of it is preparing for a babymoon and I tried on my old bikinis. It's so different seeing myself this way but I also want to embrace it. With seeing all the fit mums on insta than continue to workout through pregnancy and nothing seems to change besides the belly, I guess I compares myself a bit, which I shouldn't. Im not an influencer, I don't have free days, I have a full time job and, a home to look after, and family to make time for, which are all blessings im grateful for and that these things take up my time. Writing this out has made me feel a lot better, and maybe it might help with someone else.",

The following day my friend excitedly shared she had just received a positive test. Unfortunately her pregnancy resulted in a ruptured ectopic which has understandably affected her mental health and possibly even fertility. I have been her main source of support (and advice since she received poor care and some negligence at her hospital) throughout. My issue being we have now shared our news with family and friends and I’m at a loss uat how I approach this with her having gone through what she has. I’m also worried she will feel hurt that all the way through I was pregnant myself and never said. Any advice appreciated! 🩵",

Only just got the diagnosis today at 27+3 and feeling pretty upset and overwhelmed- feels like this pregnancy has one thing after another and baby girl is so so so loved and wanted but I just wanted a peaceful third trimester after a very stressful 1/2 with low pappa and a 1:39 risk of T21 (NIPT came back low risk thankfully ) It’s over a week until I’ll meet with my midwife but I can’t work out the risk balance - low pappa small baby vs GD big baby. My son was born at 40weeks at 8lbs 12 so quite big. It makes me very scared for my birth options as I really want a VBAC as c section recovery with a toddler sounds hard. I also - selfishly - just want to have a v birth for myself. But now I feel my risk factors - pappa/GD/high bmi - are just going to funnel me down a c section route and I feel very sad, scared and deflated this eve. (FYI I had a great c section experience last time around so it’s not prejudiced, I just really want to try a v birth) Any one else in this boat? Feel like my body isn’t doing anything right this time around. I know I’m just feeling sorry for myself this eve and I’m very lucky overall but just feeling sad.",

I am pregnant, planning to take 9 months maternity before baby goes into childcare, and my partner only has 2 weeks of leave. We aren't eligible for shared maternity because I am a PhD student. I just don't fully understand the seeming imposing of gender roles onto our lives, in that I, the parent growing the baby, am entitled to SO MUCH MORE time off than my husband. It feels like the government is trying to push me into the role of \"primary parent\", and push my husband out into a role of \"provider/secondary parent\". We all hear so much these days about how we need to parent 50/50 and make sure our workload at home is equal, and yet the government seems to not agree? It feels really sexist. I am aware I will also need time off to recover from the birth, and I am not complaining about getting too much maternity leave, I am just beyond shocked that my husband, whose job has great benefits, only gets two weeks of leave after the birth.",

My mindset at the moment is that if I can maintain sobriety and improve my stability/circumstances then I will continue with the pregnancy - if not, termination. I don’t really have anyone to speak to as my mother passed away, my dad is abusive and I have lost the majority of my friends due to my addiction. I’m 23. The hospital have told me that they’ll ring in ths morning to arrange the ultrasound. What else can I expect if I go forward with the pregnancy in regard to doctor appointments and also treatment by healthcare professionals? I am diagnosed with EUPD, I miscarried a few years ago and was denied pain relief (before drug use) purely because of my diagnosis (this was outright stated and is not an assumption by me).

I have previously posted here about my anxiety with giving birth as my first daughter was measuring small and I was induced, that was nearly 6 years ago. After 3 losses and my first being small I had extra scans throughout my pregnancy. I missed my last consultant appointment due to the system in Wales being changed from paper notes to online so I was in limbo as nobody knew if I was under consultant or midwife led care. After trying nearly everything to get labour going TMI - my husband and I had sex in the morning, we went about our day, into town and by the time I got home I was really little gushes like when you start your period unexpectedly. I had a shower, sorted my hair out and called triage, I went in for an assessment to check if it was my waters, test came back that it was and I waited to see a consultant to decide if I would be midwife or consultant led. He has no concerns and decided I was fine to go under the care of the midwife led unit. I got home around 2:30am. Come morning at 40+2 I’m getting period like cramps, they just got more intense, I used a birthing comb and we called my mother in law to come get my daughter as she lives over an hour away. I started timing my contractions and my app immediately said get ready to go to hospital. As soon as MIL arrived we took off without calling ahead as everyone was in panic mode! I went from 4 mins to 2 mins apart on the 10 minute journey to the hospital and when we arrived some concerned bypassers took one look at me and ran to get a wheelchair, it was very dramatic! I was rushed through and in the room by 11:30am. Things got intense, I asked for an epidural/ a c-section/ anything! I went through the whole “I hate this/don’t want to do this/flat out NO!” Haha!  I was told there wouldn’t be any time for an epidural so went in the pool instead - this hadn’t even been on the cards for me and I had no birth plan due to not knowing who’s care I would be under until 2am that morning. Once I was in the pool, it was an immediate relief, I had gas and air and I’m not sure how to explain it but my mind and body completely connected - I accepted my fate and knew I had to do this and staying calm and breathing would help. My body did what it had to, it pushed when it needed and I didn’t force anything - I was mooing quite a bit, I made sounds I didn’t know I could make! 3 surges and her head made an appearance and one more big one and her body flew out. My beautiful daughter came into this world in the pool at 1:20pm, I was in the water about half an hour! I was so scared about the pain before and it did suck but wow, I’ve never felt so proud or in awe of my body and what it did out of natural instinct. Women are amazing and if I can do it and feel so empowered you can too! Your body really does know what to do. I’m still riding the high and have a new found appreciation for natural birth. I want to thank this sub too, I’ve read posts daily and had words of encouragement from strangers that have helped so much.",

      "content_preview": "I finally had the time to type out my final birth story. I’ll try and make it short-ish. Three months ago, I gave birth to my fifth and final baby which was an experience I never expected, but one that turned out to be the most instinctual, raw, and fulfilling of all my births. This needs a disclaimer as I’ll be very honest but I don’t want to encourage freebirth in any way by accident. While this birth was healing to me in many ways, it was also incredibly lucky. I’ve experienced almost every type of labor: two inductions, one spontaneous labor, and one c-section. For my 5th child I wanted a repeat c-section and a planned hysterectomy. What happened instead was something I had always quietly and secretly dreamed of but would have never done (for hopefully obvious reasons) - a freebirth. But it was an accident, not a conscious choice and I think that’s very important to mention. Especially to anyone influenced by online freebirth spaces that seem to downplay the real risks to the mother and baby. Some of the rhetoric I’ve seen in those circles disturbs me. Even more so as a nurse who worked intensive care for years and has seen free and home births gone wrong in patients that were then admitted. While I dreamt about it, the thought of it was truly horrifying and not something I would have ever done deliberately. Babies have been born still, and yet their mothers are still praised for “following their instincts” over seeking help. That’s not okay. At least not in my opinion. Now the birth itself. In the morning, I started feeling contractions. Having had three previous vaginal births, I knew things could move quickly. We called my parents to come watch our children while we prepared to head to the hospital. At the time, contractions were about ten minutes apart, so I told them to go ahead and have breakfast and take their time. Looking back I’m so glad I was ignorant to how fast labour could go as otherwise I would have given birth in our car. Within 10 minutes, my contractions were suddenly two minutes apart. I asked my husband to check me as best he could which is something we were both a bit unsure about, but it felt necessary. He looked up at me and said, “I can feel some hair I think, I’m not sure.” That was the moment I knew we weren’t making it to the hospital. I asked him to grab a thick blanket and set it on the living room floor. I then asked him to stay with our daughters in another room upstairs so they wouldn’t be scared or see/hear anything that might be traumatising to them. I dimmed the lights, opened the doors to our garden, put on a timer to check on my contractions, got on all fours, and started rocking my hips but within five minutes I felt the undeniable urge to push. After about ten minutes of pushing and guiding with my own hands our daughter was born. I caught her with my hands and it was raw, surreal, and beautiful 🩵 I could hear the birds and light rain when she entered the world. However quickly I noticed she wasn’t breathing. Like my second daughter, her cord was around her neck twice. So I started stimulating her, rubbing her chest and back, and giving her rescue breaths with my mouth. She finally coughed and started taking short breaths and then after some more rubbing let out a loud cry. It felt like forever, but I know it wasn’t. I remember grabbing the owlet we had at home already and placing it on her to double check on her oxygen and pulse. She looked fine to me before I did and I know this isn’t the best or complete reassurance but in those moments you have to help yourself with what’s available sometimes and hey medical help was on the way already! I wrapped her and myself in another blanket, cleaned myself as best as I could, somehow pulled my dress back on to not be completely exposed (I still had the cord attached so I tried to hide all of that somehow) and we introduced her to her big sisters quickly before the ambulance arrived. I just wanted them to know everything was ok before I was rushed off. My husband had already called for one after checking on the children when my contractions started. At the hospital, I was given medication to help with the delivery of the placenta, and we were taken to the maternity ward to be checked over. One little funny moment when we arrived: I passed my community midwife and she beamed and said, “Aww, congrats! She’s beautiful! Are you going home?” I replied, “No I’m coming in actually as I just had her at home.” She looked mortified and then happy. Thankfully, by the grace of G-d, our daughter was and is healthy, I was stable, and after about six hours, I discharged us and we went home. Our family is now complete. Birth can be powerful but it is also unpredictable. I’m grateful that this experience gave me the peace and closure I secretly hoped for in completing my family. I got to experience the beauty of a hands-off, instinctual birth on my own but only because it happened unexpectedly. If you are seeking an undisturbed birth, please consider having a qualified midwife present. You can always discuss your preferences and have the calm, low-intervention birth you want but with the safety net you might need. I’ve now experienced every kind of birth, and I’m happy to answer any questions 🩷 Edit: spelling because I typed this out during a school holiday (if you know you know haha)",

Anyone had any experience with chronic UTI’s in pregnancy and how was this treated by the obstetrician? Thank you!",

First I was told I need to book vaccine appointment in advance. Try to book an appointment, told it's a walk in clinic (which I'd then missed for the day). Then they say we will do at next midwife appointment. She tells me to go to walk in. Go to walk in and the clinic is closed for a management meeting . With all the news coverage about declining vaccination rates you'd think maternity services would be all over this, and making it as clear and easy as possible. I can't blame anyone for thinking vaccinations are not necessary. Absolutely no urgency from NHS on educating or supporting women to get them. I've managed to book one via my GP but that entirely relies on the patient looking for them themselves. End rant...",
