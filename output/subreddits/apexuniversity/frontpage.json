What I work with: Radeon 7800xt, Ryzen 5800x3d and a 144hz monitor with1440p. When in a game and walking around, I have mostly 300fps. I notice from time to time, at the start in the dropship, it can drop to 160. But in fights, with lots of bangalore smoke and caustic gas it runs between 240 and 300. I have been reading that many capped their frames to 190, not sure if that is still a thing. With my 144 hz monitor, do I even have a benefit of frames above 144? I used to have it capped at 144 fps via steam start options on my old video card. I read, you should set it 4-5 frames below the monitor max hz, when using freesync. I do have freesync on as well.  I am a little confused, as to what works best in Apex, since allegibly some movement tecs (superglides) work better on lower frames and I even read someone saying, bunnyhopping does not work on 144 and 300hz. Is there anyone who can shed some light into this and explain, what the best thing to do would be? Thanks a lot :)",

I don‚Äôt think its my pc. I have a decent build, a 7600x, 32gb of rams and a 3080. Am using a 1440p at 165hz monitor. I play on stretch but swapping it to native doesnt change anything either. Using a lamzu x fnatic thorn with a 4k dongle mouse and a 8k polling rate HE nuphy keyboard. Lowered both the polling rates to 500hz or even lower and still no difference. I fix my frame rate to 162 fps using rtss. I have autoexecs to lower everything in game to make it smoother. I thought maybe because everything is on low, the game is not utilizing my gpu, so i maxed out everything. However, it is all to no avail. I removed the autoexecs, i deleted the game and redownloaded it. I‚Äôm using ethernet connection too. But it all still feels laggy. Am i doing something wrong? I‚Äôm at my wits end trying to make the game feel smooth. Could you guys help me out with some settings/ a video i can watch please. Would really appreciate it :(",

I'm a solo que player for the most part so I've noticed this quite a lot, now I can also have it wrong so correct me if so. If you're drop zone is somewhere in the middle of the map where you're surrounded by other enemy teams, wouldn't it make more sense to push a team or 3rd party a fight that's on the edge of the ring rather than trying to push further in to the middle of the ring where there's a way higher chance multiple teams will all just collapse on to you? Obviously you'd have to account for where you are within the ring and where it's going but generally speaking it just makes more sense in my head to go take the fights towards the edge of the circle rather than the ones in the middle of the circle.. I've noticed so many randoms I get put with who will disregard this tactic and 9 times out of 10 we put ourselves in the middle of two teams and get DPd lol.",

So I decide to switch to controller so I can carry with me my console. So far I have 100 hours with controller and I‚Äôm trying to figure out my sens. I started with 4-3 linear no dzn(I dont mind the stick drift) because every body recommend this . I like the tracking but I have problem with the hip fire . Something keeps feeling off. I found recently a new sens 4-1 linear no dzn and bleed through alc all to 0 and per optics x1 = 3.2 x2 = 3.3 And all the rest = 3.6 . And it feels really good especially the x3 and x2-x4 scopes. Does the alc make a difference or it‚Äôs just a placebo . Does the bleed through work or it‚Äôs just a myth. Is it better to stick with the regular 4-3 linear to be consistent ? Any other suggestions for controller?",

      "content_preview": "Hey all  - dropping this tip here to help out with any mnk players that may be struggling with superglides. The background for this is mostly programming mumbo jumbo that i don‚Äôt get but essentially it breaks down to this. The keys on your keyboard are split into activation regions and based on these regions certain combinations of jump and crouch will NOT WORK AT ALL for supergliding. Or the timing window is so small that its success rate is way too low. I spent a lot of time frustrated w my superglide timings to find out this was the issue. If you think you might have this problem, go to the apex superglide trainer on google ( https://apexmovement.tech/superglidetrainer/ ). Enter your crouch and jump keybinds and see if you can hit the timing consistently. If you can‚Äôt switch your crouch key and look for a combo that works. For example, I was trying forever with ‚Äúspace‚Äù for jump + ‚Äúv‚Äù for crouch and i could only hit the timing like 5% of the time. I switched it to ‚Äúspace‚Äù + ‚Äún‚Äù and immediately hit the timing right 95% of the time. Def give this a try if you‚Äôre a mnk play struggling to superglide.",

      "content_preview": "Despite playing since the early seasons (probably 3 or 4) I'm horrible. I'm going to explain some of my issues. It's a long post and actually my question isn't exactly clear, simply looking for some guidance. Maybe I should just quit playing. It's not like I'm actively trying to be better, but pretty much I'm playing every day. (expect I took a break roughly for a year S10-S12) I suppose some of the reasons are that I'm not a good play are: First of all, I think I'm older than the common age group, and feels like my response times a bit slow. (When I started playing counter-strike, it was Beta 4) Game Mechanic I suppose I played mostly games with `hitscan` mechanic, instead of projectiles Adjusting myself to recoil seems/feels impossible. My PC ADHD & Anxiety & OCD + Fun award. 1. Age I can't exactly say this is a real reason, but feels like my response time gotten really slow in time. I used to play Quake 3 Arena, Unreal Tournament, HL1 Death-Match, running and jumping all around, dominating now when I play Apex, everything seems too fast&random, last couple of years, tried UT and CS:GO, by the time my brain registers someone shooting at me, or realize there's an enemy, I'm dead. So this affects how I play. 2. Shooting Mechanics I enjoy the weapons with different mechanics, Quake had this laser cannon for instance, it would take some time to shoot. But this mechanic works good when there is only 8 to 10 players, 6v6 or PvP. Recoil patterns for 20 something different weapons feels a big challenge for me. First I can't release my damn finger on the mouse and just shoot when the player is really right under the cursor, but no the enemy also jumps, flys slides, does something and by the time I adjust I'm either dead or my magazine is empty. Also need to shot where the enemy is going to be by the time by bullet lands, instead of right where are they right now. I can guess some of your suggestions at this point, but I'll add more. 3. My PC: Hardware & Configuration My pc wasn't that great, right now it is OK..., enough to play APEX, using a mediocre Redragon keyboard last year got a nice Razer mouse. But I can't seem to find best DPI, Mouse speed, per zoom config for me, for a while seemed like I managed to find a good config setup, after that game crashed and all my config disappeared, had to do it all over again now it doesn't feel right, but spend so much time so, just went with some config, `OK` enough. Really don't know how to make sure what is good for me. 4. Psychological Issues This is kind of a deep subject but I'll try to explain as much as I can. First I'm not playing Casual but Ranked. - In casual mode, the players I encounter feels too random and it's not exactly rewarding much. Also given the fact that I'm playing %99 of time solo. ADHD: Communication When my teammates aren't communicating instead just randomly push a team or just disappear completely while I'm still trying to find a weapon or something I just got completely get lost in the moment or just got distracted with something, when my teammates share their plan (or best when they do this by talking) I'm immediately a better teammate. Otherwise everyone expects me to anticipate their behavior when they get killed then they decide yell their opinion about how trash I am. ADHD: No response to my communication When I say things, like let's do this or I'm doing this. Just nothing. Silence, either they ignore or they don't acknowledge. So there are times like I don't know what to do. One moment they're running behind me, then, they her some shooting noises and going after it while I'm still running towards to previous marked location. At that moment trying to catch up to them and sometimes get killed on the way. - Not everyone can play good as you expect them to play There are absolutely awesome players, watching them in awe, but if the other team are just as good, they need a teammate as good as them and sometimes I am not that player, I don't know what you are thinking. So can they emancipate that I may not be as good as they want me to be, and attack bit more cautiously? Anxiety Knowing that I'm not a good player, I'm trying to compensate that with tactical play and decide to playground. This is works awesome with some teammates. Instead of getting bunch of kills, trying to pick my battles. I'm not shooting at 300m away enemy with alternator instead try to sneak in then catch them off guard. When you do that, I can't get positioned the way I want and I panic. I panic a lot! Instead of switching weapons accidentally use my ultimate, stuck in menus and so many other things. OCD This isn't something I can defend, like in the heat of the battle, sometimes I get lost in my utility kit. Example A Last ring, 4-5 teams around hiding in a corner waiting for a good time to engage, then my brain goes like, \"oooooh so many death boxes around, I wonder are there attachments that I need\" and I start going through everything then boom suddenly someone appears behind and I'm dead. This isn't happening when I'm able to communicate with team mates Example B Trying to make the best plan, and place my nexus to best possible location if anything goes south. While my teammates are running doing something, I'm telling them that I'm going to this way, going to place a nexus because the ring is in this direction. Do not engage. So trying to increase our odds. 3 outcomes: They engage, by the time I meet up with them, they are dead and pissed. Now I'm on the run for respawn. I got separated from my team instead I get killed, then they get killed, the are pissed. Works flawlessly, I get back, we engage, we get 3rd partied, getting away with nexus... If my team mate says, hey your nexus can wait we're good, or let's do it together. Boy I'm so happy when they acknowledge, say OK or DON'T Commentary about how bad I am Previous game, I played so good, my self esteem is high, this affect my next game, I'm good on the next one too then the other one is so bad, and getting yelled at, something about my mom, how idiot, trashy stupid I am. When my teammate is getting trash talk I'm immediately intervening an warn trying to lower the tension. When it's me being trashed I try to ignore it as much as I can, but after that I can never recover. I'm doomed to play even worse in the following rounds. Just wanted to release some stress after work, wanted to have some fun. I'm already battling with so many things and I'm loosing my confidence in myself just because I am bad at playing this damn game. So. I really don't want to stop playing this game because I like it, but also don't want to be the reason you lose the game, or get annoyed because of my incompetence. Question is something I don't want to ask. Should I stop playing?",

      "content_preview": "Just moved from the UK to Korea and am wondering how to play apex here. I tried playing a few games and the lag has been so bad it's unplayable and I can barely finish a game without it crashing and my computer overheats like crazy. I read online that Koreans use a VPN and set their IP to Japan but I tried that and it didn't help at all, plus they're both on the ap-northeast-1 server anyway so I don't get it. I've seen old vids where some other people have a list of cities/countries in their data centre but mine only shows continents so idk. Apex is like the only game I play so I'd be devestated if I couldn't play anymore. Can someone explain what I should do?",

Is it best just to stay away and play around the smoke? Recon legends can't see through smoke to my knowledge ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Edit: now that the season has been out for a few days I'm no longer worried about \"smoke meta.\"  Caustic is way more of a pain than Bangalore in my opinion.
