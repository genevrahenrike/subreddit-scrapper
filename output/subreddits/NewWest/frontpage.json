      "content_preview": "Hey New West! So I'm looking at moving to New West in the new year, current place has lost its charm. Trying to stay under 1900/mo for a 1 bdr, and allows dogs. That's basically my only criteria. Preferably not a high rise as even concrete ones seem to suck at sound dampening. Companies I know to avoid -Mainstreet - they are shit regardless of the city, haven't dipped from a showing quicker than going to one of theirs. CAPREIT - I know they aren't mainstreet bad, but they would be a last resort -Realstar - about on par with the above -Onni group - I haven't seen them talked about but their corp google reviews are horrendous, so def makes me sus of their places. Also what's with that block between 5th and 4th on 12th? Seems like a concentrated sketch are - not shocking that it's mostly mainstreet buildings. Seems like Boardwalk ditched BC entirely a while ago which is a shame, they were decent in other cities I lived in. Is any any corporate landlord that's not shit? Thanks in advanced!",

I’ve now been in line three times at Moody Pool and the amount of times I’ve seen people get mad at the front staff for letting in people in 15 minute increments (which is when they do their headcount) is ridiculous. People going up 2-3x in a half hour asking when they’re going to be let in. Yesterday, I saw a gentleman reprimanding a staff member for blocking the entrance so people didn’t just walk right in. Yes, it’s hot, and it’s busy, but let’s remember to be respectful. It costs $2 to go to these pools, which is a blessing. They are heavily subsidized by the city and do not make money.",

Looking at a 3br/2ba apartment with 1 adult and 2.5 teenage boys ( 1 is staying in the states with his dad but will come for holidays etc). The info for the buildings we are looking at say water is included. (The nelson, the Beverly, the Westminster, and 150 braid). What is an average electric bill/internet ( highest speed we can get due to gaming and streaming); is garbage separate?  To give you an idea for comparison in Oregon we are in a 4br/2ba and the average electric bill is 280/mo USD summer and 450/mo USD winter; Internet is 190 USD mo, plus water is about 180 USD and garbage is 36 USD monthly.",

It took over an hour for the ambulance to arrive and 40 minutes for the fire department.

On Sunday evening we witnessed what I believed to be a dead sturgeon lying on its back at the surface (floating), when after about 5 minutes it flipped over and went deep. That fish appeared to be approximately 6' in length. Then this morning I witnessed another 6' sturgeon floating past on the current - I neglected to take a picture as I thought it was simply the same fish which had now actually died. Then within another 10 minutes 2 other sturgeon drifted past, both floating on their backs and drifting with the flow of the river. Has anyone else notcied similar scenes of dead fish recently?",

His Quixotic ramblings although sometimes amusing should not be tied to our council without approval (he alone doesn't speak for the people of New Westminster) yet it seems that Global BC features him more than any other city politicians by an extremely large margin. Could it be that someone's political career is getting a little hand up in name recognition for future elections? I honestly don't know, but I sure would like to see and hear from literally any other city politician at this point.",
