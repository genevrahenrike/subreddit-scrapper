      "content_preview": "So i signed up for oracle cloud free tier in hopes that my hosting costs can be eliminated now although my account was accepted it took like weeks before i even finally got a free tier account loaded up  and honestly for the first month or two it was actually looking good didnt spend a dime and was getting 24 gb. It felt way too good to be true. Until reality kicked in. I got a email a few months later from oracle telljng me i have a unpaid invoice of about 112 dollars Btw this is basically how much it would cost to host my bot on a cheap VPS for like 2-3 years I tried ignoring it because i was on a “free tier” account and thought it mightve been some bug or something. I then get another email a month later saying they will be suspending my account in a month if the invoice is unpaid. And then i start realizing im fucked. They then immediately shut off all my vps and all my bots turned off i lost all my files and data i had saved in it and then shut down my account. I called a tech support guy and he told me basically this verbatim The always free tier means that its always free “for that time period” essentially its free for a certain period of time until they make you pay I went into this thinking i was going to make money with free hosting ended up paying more than i even wouldve paid on my normal vps",

Our use case: - Community management bot with AI-powered features - Auto Q&A for users (natural language, not slash commands) - Advanced spam detection beyond AutoMod Discord's response: - Said our use cases can be implemented without Message Content Intent - Suggested using slash commands and AutoMod instead - Mentioned concerns about AI/ML processing message content (even though we don't store data or train models) The confusing part: We specifically outlined scenarios where slash commands don't work, where Discord's native features fall short, and included actual user requests from our community managers asking for these exact features. But the reviewer just keeps saying it's not \"unique\" enough without actually addressing any of our points. What's really frustrating is that we researched a bunch of approved bots (MEE6, WickBot, BoltBot, etc.) that are doing very similar things and they all have Message Content Intent. Like, our features feel pretty standard for community management bots. Questions: Has anyone successfully appealed a denial or got approved on a second try? What made your use case \"unique and compelling\" in Discord's eyes? Any tips for better positioning AI-powered features? Really could use some guidance here - feels like I'm missing something obvious but can't figure out what. Thanks in advance! 🙏",

It makes a thread with a button for users to click, and does some logging to a backend db.  Each time a user clicks the button, it sends an ephemeral message to them in the thread confirming they're 'in'.  in addition to that, it pools the entries, and every 2 seconds it spits out a list of new entries to the thread as well.  Each giveaway allows exactly 100 entries.  After 100 entries, it closes, removes the button, and spits out a list of all the users that entered, that we run through random.org to select a winner live. For the 'not insanely popular' (they're all popular) giveaways, it works like a charm, but for the REALLY popular ones, so many people are pressing the button so fast I'm getting rate limited and the bot chokes with the confirmation messages due to rate limits. Any tips on how to handle this better? I really want confirmations sent for anyone that enters the confirmations should be as close to real time as possible",
