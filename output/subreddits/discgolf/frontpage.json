      "content_preview": "Hello there! You have stumbled upon a post about the history of mini discs. Dearest reader, let me reassure you that the knowledge I am about to give you is useless. But before I go off the deep end rambling about minis, here are the only 3 things you need to know about a mini: 1.      They exist. 2.      The PDGA has rules about minis, here’s a link that breaks those down . 3.      It is highly recommended that you pick your mini up after using it as a marker. There is no competitive advantage to earn by using certain mini markers. Hell, you can use a cookie as your mini . But… for whatever reason I was curious enough about minis to research them. And when I research frisbee things, I usually make reddit posts. So, if you like this kind of stuff, you can follow my username. I also do disc reviews here too! 101 of them to be exact. Also, not to make my long-time readers feel old, but I have been doing this for 5 years now… Yeah, I don’t like that either. What is a Mini Disc You’re on r/discgolf , but the spirit of this series is to assume you know nothing, so I am going to explain what a mini disc is. For my more seasoned readers just skip this and take pride that you already know what a mini disc is. A mini disc, as you can guess, is a small disc. We consider a “normal” disc to be something PDGA legal, which these days means that the disc must be 20.9cm in diameter. Technically anything below that would qualify as a mini disc. However, the PDGA (being the persnickety little rascals they are) have defined a standard range of sizes that a mini disc can be ( 7-15cm ). Which may sound weird , why would the PDGA care how large your mini disc is? Well, in sanctioned play a mini disc is used as a marker for your lie. So, it needs to be large enough so your card mates can see your marker. But if it is too large, there is a chance you may mistake it for a normal disc. Hence the restriction. Despite, or even due to their small size, mini discs have become the defacto souvenir for disc golfers. If you play a tournament with a player’s pack, odds are you are going to get a mini. Go to a brewery that supports disc golf? Odds are they have minis you can buy. Having a wedding? Well, some disc golfers give away ceremonial minis too. Did you just become a PDGA member? Well, for joining you get a mini with the PDGA logo slapped on the front so you feel SPECIAL. Mini Disc Golf? I imagine there is a shared memory held by many of us when we got our first mini disc. We all wanted to throw it right? By this point in our lives, we’ve already established that throwing “normal discs” is fun. Well… Why not throw small discs too? The next thought you may have is… does mini disc golf exist? Mini golf is very popular, so it would make some sense that Mini Disc Golf could exist. And it DOES! People play mini disc golf and there are mini disc golf courses. There are even organized mini disc tournaments that are run by the mini disc federation . Mini disc golf is not spread very far unfortunately, either you live near Lancaster PA, or you don’t. With that said, temporary mini disc courses pop up all over the place. Also, they are easy to make since their footprint is smaller than a typical course and you could easily make one in your back yard if you live out in the country. Not to mention a good mini disc basket can easily be found under $100. Mini disc golf is often played indoors and there are basket and mini sets designed specifically for this that are pretty cheap. Typically, these minis sets are made with lighter weight minis, so they won’t mark your walls up when you inevitably miss. But at the other end of the spectrum people do throw mini discs for distance! Those discs are typically heavier and have driver profiles. The Innova Mini Driver is probably the most popular disc for mini distance throwing. With a mini driver, Simon Lizotte broke the mini disc distance world record with a throw that measured (527ft)! WITH A MINI. PDGA Rule History The original rule set for disc golf that came about in 1978 did not mention anything about using markers. Your marker was simply the disc that was on the ground and that was the end of the story. In 1982, you could use another disc as a marker if you wanted to. No size was specified, and it was assumed that you would just use another disc in your bag. The 1990 rule set was the first that specifically mandated minis as markers in place of normal discs. Finally in 2002, a mini was needed for repositioning a lie. Here is a cool timeline that breaks down PDGA rule changes through 2006 . I want them to update that… Pre History I’d like to think most of you are familiar with the origin story of the Frisbee. Again, part of the ethos of this series is to not make any assumptions. So, here is the history of the Frisbee in an extremely brief one paragraph summary that skips over numerous important details: It is debated what the earliest “frisbee like” objects would have been. However most agree that cake and pie tins from the 19 th century made for the first true durable “frisbee like” flying saucers. In the late 19 th century, a company called “Frisbie Pies” began delivering their pies in pie tins like this one . As you can imagine, people started to toss those around. Throughout the early 20 th century there are documented examples of people playing with various metal / plastic lids and finally someone (Fred Morrison) had the bring idea to make a flying saucer toy in the 1940s .  That toy (and various knock offs) were extremely popular over the next two decades. However, in 1964, Ed Headrick and Wham-O released the “Professional” Frisbee ™ and the rest is history. Which leads us back to minis! It does not take a large leap of imagination to guess that if people were throwing pie tins around for fun, that they would also throw lids around for fun as well. One such small lid was so notorious for its accidental tossability, that its story ended up in a 1957 Sports Illustrated article . I wish I could link that article, but it seems as though the SI online archives barely work anymore. It amazes me how long it took for a mini frisbee to be made; you’d think its creation would line up with the first disc toys, but no. You must wait until the late 1960s for the first true mini frisbee toy. One interesting outlier I found was on a collector’s website from the 1920s. The website is: (HTTP link, not HTTPS) http://www.marvinsflyingdisccollection.com/ It’s an old school web page and I could not link the image of the disc I wanted to show directly, so I am just going to embed it in my post. https://preview.redd.it/the-history-of-mini-discs-v0-w78712m3oqmf1.png According to Marvin, this is an early disc toy from the 1920s! Which would predate nearly every modern frisbee toy that we typically associate with being the “first frisbee.” Unfortunately, I cannot find a lot of information about that toy, and I did find another source that put it around the 1940s . Also, the discs appear to be made from cardboard, so I’m not sure if it counts, but hey, it exists, have fun with that knowledge. “Frisbee Era” The first disc that I consider to be a mini disc is the Wham-O Mini Frisbee , which dates back to 1967. These were popular toys in their day, not as popular as Frisbees themselves, but popular enough that Wham-O STILL makes them . In the 1960s and 1970s these were by far the most prevalent mini discs available, and they were everywhere. There were also plenty of knock offs. So much so that fast food restaurants like Burger King and Burger Chefs gave away mini discs in the 1970s. And it was during the 1970s when mini discs started to get used for other things aside from being toys you toss around. As new frisbee associations started to form, such as the IFA, PDGA, and DGA, mini discs began to be used as an advertising medium and as business cards. Here is Steady Ed’s business card mini from 1976 . Mini discs were included on trophies for early frisbee events, here is an example of a frisbee golf trophy from 1977 that featured a mini . It is commonplace these days to get free minis in player’s packs and such was the case in the earliest days of disc golf. “Disc Era” As the disc golfing world began to move away from Wham-O in the late 1970s and early 1980s, new companies began to make mini discs as promotional / giveaway items for tournaments. Now, Wham-O was still the mini king in the early 1980s, but there were newcomers, the first notable example being Discraft with the Micro Sport Disc in 1979. https://preview.redd.it/the-history-of-mini-discs-v0-3ydnkrw7oqmf1.png Destiny Discs (maker of the Super Puppy, the most popular disc before the Aero) would make their own mini disc as well, namely the California Mini Flyer in 1981. 1981 is also the year that disc golf got its first “mini only” disc manufacturer, Sport Flyers Unlimited , which was ran by self-proclaimed “Mini Disc Entrepreneur” Tom Lander. Sport Flyers Unlimited took a decent chunk out of the Wham-O dominated mini market in the early 1980s, but by the late 1980s they were the leading mini manufacturers for disc golfers. As you can imagine, once Innova and Discraft started to take the mini market seriously Sports Flyers faded away into obscurity. But, for about a decade most disc golf events that gave away minis gave away Lander’s mini. But again, eventually Innova and Discraft took over and Lander’s Sport Flyers faded away around 1992. Innova The year is 1986, 3 years after Innova’s beveled breakthrough and they are currently dominating the golf disc market. Something that they still arguably do to this day. So, it should come as no surprise that the industry leader in disc golf would start to make mini discs. But with an Innova twist, Innova’s minis were beveled minis. In honor of their flagship disc, they were known as “ Mini Aeros .” Unlike the Aero, the Mini Aeros did not become an instant runaway success. Throughout the late 1980s most of the minis given away at tournaments and events were still Wham-O or Sports Flyer’s minis. That is, unless Innova ran the event. It was around the mid-1990s that Innova started to become the industry leader in mini production. Part of that was due to Sports Flyers Unlimited fading away and Innova just controlling the “normal disc” market share. It was also during the mid-1990 that Innova started to produce premium plastics for their “normal” discs. As you can imagine, they also started to make premium minis, although in much lower numbers. The most valuable Innova minis are those that were made in Champion Edition plastic. Which are prized for both their rarity and from what I’ve read, their throwability. In 2003, Innova transitioned from Aero minis to their current day Aviar minis . This was not just a name change, Innova actually changed the profile of their minis to mimic an Aviar. Here is a side by side .  Standard collector logic applies. First runs are valuable and since something changes, some people prefer the old-style Aero minis for whatever reason. Again, the special ones are made in premium plastic. Current Day Mini discs are very cheap to make and do not require the same level of precision needed for normal discs. Because of that, there are a TON of mini discs manufacturers these days. Most of them are not worth mentioning, but I will mention Zing Minis . They have mold variations for their minis, so they are doing more than the standard promotional / marker only approach by most manufacturers. This should go without saying, but nearly every company that makes discs also makes minis. Also, unlike normal discs, you can make a mini out of anything really and the PDGA will not care. Because of that, in recent years “boutique minis” have started to become more popular. Here is one made out of wood that I found on Etsy for example. Besides wood, glass, resin, and metal minis are also common too. In recent years “Macro Discs” have become popular. These are fun minis that are just shrunken versions of normal production molds. Popular ones include the Mini Buzzz, Mini Tesla, and Mini Nuke. Be careful, some of these macro discs lie between the maximum mini size (15cm) and the smallest disc size (21cm). Not that anyone would ever call you out on using one of these as a mini, but just in case. That’s All Folks The cool thing about minis is that you don’t have to really care about them. I almost never hear of anyone having any kind of brand or mold loyalty to their mini marker. With that said, minis are often seen as sentimental items. If you play a lot of sanctioned play, you are going to be using your mini quite a bit. So, just like your “lucky pencil” from high school you may grow a bond with your mini. Not me though! I am terrible about leaving my mini on the ground. But when I do remember it, at least I can pick my mini up, unlike some people …",

What discs would you recommend for the beginner who's only ever going to play twice or so a year? What are the most forgiving discs, that hide poor form and let a new player get the best score or have the most fun they're going to have without diving headfirst into the sport? Which 2,3 or 4 discs are you going to grab when you hear a mate say they want to come along to see what all the fuss is about, and you just want them to enjoy the afternoon? ( I've read a lot of threads advising beginners to get disc x, because it will be brutal and teach them exactly what they're doing wrong - and I guess I'm interested to hear what discs are the very opposite of that)",
