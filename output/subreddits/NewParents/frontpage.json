      "content_preview": "The night before last my partner insisted I sleep in the guest room to get a good night‚Äôs sleep and he would come wake me if baby needed feeding (EBF). They went to bed at 10pm and I woke several times throughout the night but nothing. I was worried she needed something but he made me promise to trust him and not to come in. Finally around 6.30am I hear them pottering about while he‚Äôs changing her nappy. I ask if she seriously didn‚Äôt wake up at all. He says ‚ÄúOh yeah, she did wake up at 3.30am but I just left her for ten minutes and she went back to sleep.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Our baby has never cried in the night so I always took her being awake as a sign of hunger. I‚Äôd get her up, change her nappy, feed her, burp her, hold her upright and be up for around an hour at least once, usually twice a night. Last night I tried it for myself and sure enough she woke up around 3.30 but went right on back to sleep with no intervention. I ended up waking her up myself at 6 because my boobs hurt! I can‚Äôt believe all the sleep I‚Äôve been missing out on! Just posting here in case anyone else might be in the same boat.",

Playing on the floor during every wake window (but some days that's too tough and we have to walk around with Mom). When the babysitter comes during my work meetings, it's different every week, so we keep her on her toes. Set schedule? We don't know her. We're just vibing and it's honestly taken so much anxiety off my plate. Chaos is okay, y'all. Baby will find a schedule when they're ready.",

      "content_preview": "I really wanted to share this because my entire 1st month with my LO was a nightmare... HE WOULD NOT SLEEP UNLESS BEING HELD I would drive myself crazy trying to find the \"safest option\" to get him to sleep and all I got back was \"that's dangerous, do safe sleep 7, don't risk it\" etc. so I'd stay up ALLLLL night while holding him, falling asleep with him in my arms because I was shamed and ignored. But I want to be clear that I HEAR YOU, I SEE YOU, I GET YOU. Sometimes these babies LITERALLY WONT SLEEP ANYWHERE ELSE. Not in a cuddle curl, not in a bedside bassinet, not in a dock a tot, no I don't have someone to just take him while I sleep - and I get you're so freaking annoyed with people shoving it down you're throat like as if you haven't already tried these things a billion times. Sometimes all we can do it do what we can and try to make it as safe as possible, because going 48 hours without sleep caring for a child because people are blind to reality and expect perfection over something we literally have no control over (baby's sleep!) definitely isn't any safer either. Hope this helped someone ‚ù§Ô∏è Update: Even with this post and many of others sharing their experiences, people are STILL shaming me and others lmfao",

      "content_preview": "Long time lurker, first time poster. My baby is currently 6 months old, she just started daycare last Tuesday. I took her to the doctor the day before on Monday to get her 6 month shots and talked with them about her starting daycare so they were aware, mainly bc i anticipated she would probably start getting sick a little more with daycare and germs. Her first day was okay, they said she was fussy but that‚Äôs to be expected with first day. I met 2 teachers who told me they would be her teachers for her classroom. They were both nice, and they seemed so attentive and caring. It made me feel better. The second day I dropped her off the morning teacher was there everything seemed fine, when I picked her up from her second day it was a completely different teacher I hadn‚Äôt met, I tried asking her how my baby‚Äôs day was, she couldn‚Äôt tell me. She said ‚Äúumm I‚Äôm pretty sure she had a good day‚Äù then I asked for her last bottle because I noticed it wasn‚Äôt in her bag and she didn‚Äôt know where it was. Luckily I found it. It made me a little uneasy the afternoon teacher couldn‚Äôt tell me how her day was and didn‚Äôt know where her bottle was. I also noticed an unexplained scratch on her wrist. We got no incident reports or any explanation which again made me a little anxious. But I told myself she‚Äôs with other babies ranging from 6mos-12mos so I‚Äôm sure small scratches will happen from time to time and not to overreact. When I dropped her off on her third day, her teacher told me that she is not taking bottles fast enough and she‚Äôs a very slow eater, I explained that‚Äôs her norm on bottles she really likes to take her time. She‚Äôs only given bottles by dad sometimes and daycare. I breastfeed her 95% of the time at home. I also asked how the day before was since the other teacher couldn‚Äôt tell me. Her teacher did the so/so hand motion and said it was an improvement from the first day but that‚Äôs all she said. Throughout the day the kept updating the app that she was refusing her bottles, only drinking a few oz at a time, not finishing them. I messaged them and told them to please let us know if we need to pick her up or come up there to try to get her to eat. They messaged back and said they got her to take the rest of it so it was fine. I get there to pick her up that evening and it‚Äôs 2 teachers I‚Äôve never met again which I didn‚Äôt like but, trying to go with it. I understand teachers probably call in and get sick themselves so I told myself maybe that‚Äôs why the last 2 days it hasn‚Äôt been the teacher who said she would be in here for afternoons. The teachers told me she had a really good day and she is a happy baby which made me happy, a little shocked given everything with the bottles but I thought maybe this meant she was adjusting. As I‚Äôm putting her in her car seat i notice pinpoint purplish red spots that looked like bruises all over and all the way around lower legs below her knees. There had been no incident report made and the teachers didn‚Äôt say anything when I picked her up. She had on shorts all day and I noticed it right away when buckling her in so in my head there‚Äôs absolutely no way the teacher missed these. I walked her back in and took her to the directors asking them to explain these marks on her legs and why I wasn‚Äôt notified. They agreed it looked like bruising and told me another baby couldn‚Äôt have caused those marks which really sent me into a panic. They advised I take her to the ER to be checked out and in the meantime they would reach out to all teachers that had been in her room and ask them if they noticed them. I picked her dad up and took her to the hospital. At the hospital they explained with suspected child abuse they have to do a full skeletal work up and run labs to make sure there‚Äôs nothing internally wrong and to rule out anything that would cause this medically. My poor baby had to endure getting an IV, 22 X-rays and a head CT. I was distraught. She was so upset during all of the tests. At the end, all labs were clear and luckily all X-rays and CT were normal. The doctors essentially said they can rule out there is nothing medically wrong with her to cause these marks and started a CPS case listing the daycare as the perpetrators. Also, during all of this the daycare messaged us and said the teachers denied seeing any marks on her all day. It‚Äôs also worth noting they uploaded a photo of her at 10AM that day and there are no marks on her legs. So it had to of happened sometime after 10AM and before I picked her up. We took her to her pediatrician the next day (the same one who had just seen her Monday) and she agreed it did appear to be bruising on her legs and my baby or another baby couldn‚Äôt have created those marks on her legs. So now we are waiting for CPS to do their investigation to see what happens next. I have sent messages to the daycare letting them know we have decided to unenroll, & asked them to remove cards from autopay so we aren‚Äôt charged another week. We also still need to pick her up her extra belongings we left. No response. Idk if it‚Äôs bc they know there‚Äôs a CPS case or what. It‚Äôs been 3 days since the incident and the marks look a lot better but they‚Äôre still there and I‚Äôve been a wreck since. I‚Äôm so angry at myself for sending her. I feel like I sent her directly into harms way. The CPS worker said it can take up to 45 working days to finish the investigation. I don‚Äôt want to ruin anyone‚Äôs reputation, I don‚Äôt want to falsely accuse either I just want to understand what happened to my baby and how apparently none of the teachers saw it. Has anyone gone through something similar? And what happened in the end? I‚Äôm sorry if it seems like this is rambling I just wanted to see if any other moms had advice. Thanks for reading (:",

Because if we stay home for too long, she gets bored as well - only going for daily walks and shopping won't cut it. So out we go, or we try to. Almost always, it's a catastrophe. Car ride? Fine for 10 minutes max, after that, full on crying. Falling asleep in the car seat is not a thing. Being out after her last nap? Full on drama. The stroller? Fine for fifteen minutes sometimes. Any more than that, no can do. The carrier? Alright for naps but no more than that. Like how is this supposed to work?? Even if I manage to get to my destination, it's usually exhausting because I need to make sure baby is entertained enough and she won't accept anyone else to hold her either. Sometimes, just sometimes it would be nice to get a break and to enjoy going out for a little bit. I'm hoping it will get better as she gets older but right now this is hard. Sorry for the rant, just needed to get this off my chest for once. Love my baby to bits but some days are just sooo hard. Edit: Oh wow I didn't expect to get so many replies here. Thank you so much for your advice, solidarity, empathy, and kind words! Still reading through comments and replying to as many as I can manage.",

Deleting tik tok, instagram, and learning that I can indeed eat a meal, clean the house, and chill without using a video or show as background noise has made all the difference. Also I‚Äôve noticed my patience with my baby and older children (like my nephews/friends children) has improved so much. I now reserve phone time for after bedtime or my lunch break! introducing screens is super cool if you want to! My reasoning was I‚Äôm scared of a child having unmonitored access to the internet. When we do introduce TV I‚Äôm planning on utilizing DVDs as opposed to streaming services/YouTube to prevent that from happening",

One of them asked whose she was, and when my wife answered \"both of ours\" the woman looked at the two of us, laughed, and said \"you can always tell who the real one is.\" I've honestly been pretty down about going in public together since then. Most people are less brazen but I get a lot of those kind of looks. My other problem is that it kind of feels like there is nothing that makes my relationship with my daughter special other than breastfeeding/pumping milk. Her other mom is better at calming her than I am, and she's a very social and confident child so she doesn't look for or need reassurance from me. I make a point to talk, sing, and play with her but she's so friendly that I might as well be a neighbor. On the other hand, when my daughter and my wife lock eyes she lights up and it's like she knows that's her mom. I love my daughter so much it takes the breath out of me, but it really hurts to feel like just the partner of her mother, when I'm her mother too. Thanks for letting me vent.",

To be clear I understand that online is going to be biased towards people struggling who are asking for help, but god forbid you accidentally mention that your baby slept 8 hours or is overall happy and chill ‚Äî you‚Äôll be shushed and shamed for even bringing it up. Anyway, just curious if anyone else feels this way, a bit unsettled by the apparent inability to be happy for other parents who may have one thing or another going well for them.",

      "content_preview": "Im a FTM and naturally fell down the rabbit hole of baby sleep when my LO was going through her 4 month regression. I didn't understand why she was waking up so often and found myself influenced by the \"sleep training\" world. I started implementing schedules, playing around with wake windows, timing naps etc all in a desperate attempt to get my baby to sleep longer stretches at night. The amount of hours I spent on Reddit and TikTok trying to find a magic solution was criminal. I was beyond stressed, sleep deprived and regret spending so much time obsessing about my baby's sleep. People were telling me it was because my baby had sleep associations to being fed to sleep so that's why she was waking up. I always felt that was wrong - when my baby woke in the night she wasn't looking to nurse and in the past she had connected sleep cycles despite being nursed to sleep. It wasn't until I stumbled across the Possums Sleep Program (recommended by another Redditor) that my perspective completely changed. The author (a Dr) spoke about how sleep is not determined by associations, its determined by sleep pressure and the body clock. She encouraged feeding to sleep because its the most natural and quickest way to get your baby back to sleep in the night. She also encourages letting abby sleep in natural light during the day so baby only takes the sleep they need to take the edge of their sleep pressure. This was shocking to me because alot of the stuff i was reading previously was saying all naps need to be in a dark room with white noise. I agreed with majority of what the author was saying and implemented some of her strategies. Since doing so my baby is sleeping long stretches at night and naps are no longer a battle. Sleep will happen when sleep happens - its inevitable and it just goes to show sleep associations are complete rubbish. I wish I didnt feel like I was doing something wrong by feeding my baby to sleep in the early days. The honest truth is that babies wake frequently in the night during certain periods of their development because they are growing and learning new skills. Its completely normal. We survived by doing shifts and riding the wave. Once baby came out of the regression she was doing 4-6 hour stretches. I still feed to sleep. I dont know what the purpose of this post is other than to maybe help someone else out there who may be struggling like I was. If you feel sleep training isn't right for your situation and want to explore a different approach I highly recommend Possums - it honestly isn't talked about enough and is all scientific and evidence based.",

When I first saw my baby at birth, I was shocked. He was white, very white (I am mixed race Creole). My first reaction was not happiness, nor fear, but just: ‚ÄúWho are you? ¬ª I know he'll take color and I know he looks a lot like me, but I managed to ruin the first time I saw him. It's only been two weeks and I'm already exhausted. His mother had an infection and I had to deal with everything alone. (It's not his fault, of course.) Despite that, I blame him. It's visceral. I'm angry with her. I don't show it directly but I think you can feel it... and poor thing. And the worst part of it all, what makes me feel the most horrible, is that I can't love my baby. Well‚Ä¶ yes, I love him, but I haven‚Äôt yet felt this ‚Äúunconditional love‚Äù, this famous thing that goes beyond everything. I take care of him, I am meticulous in his care and his meals because he didn't ask for anything and that's my role. But that's all. I can't give him sincere affection. In short, I regret the situation. If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have had children. The worst part is that it's only been two weeks, and I feel worse than I ever have in my life. I feel like a horrible person ‚Äî and I probably am. I just had to write it down somewhere. THANKS.",

      "content_preview": "Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs changed with my wife since she‚Äôs had our baby. I want to be supportive, but I‚Äôm not really sure what to do any more. I‚Äôm with our newborn baby 10+ hours a day taking care of her, and most of the night feeding (I do all except one of the feeds). She is so amazing and honestly such an easy baby. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt mind taking care of her 100% of the time if I had to. My real struggle has been my spouse. I love her so much and want to do everything for her, but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gotten into her and I just can‚Äôt manage any more. She asks me to do exercises with the baby to make her less tense. I do them maybe 2-3 times a day when I can remember and she‚Äôs awake. But she gets upset that I‚Äôm not doing them 4-5 times a day a day. I try to match that frequency, but honestly sometimes I just forget. She has very specific requirements for me feeding her. How to position the bottle, how to support her back etc. And I try to do these things, but sometimes I just want to get in comfortable position. Unfortunately, when she notices I‚Äôm doing it wrong, she always comes by and gives me a lecture and try to correct me. There‚Äôs been tensions about non-baby things too. I was doing yard work yesterday and I absent-mindedly trimmed a plant of hers. She just got so angry today, went on and on even I said sorry, I won‚Äôt do it again etc. Same thing with cleaning. I clean all the bottle and pump parts, and if there‚Äôs any oily bits or residue, she gets upset. She got upset cause the oatmeal I cooked her wasn‚Äôt the right consistency. That the bottle is in the wrong position. That I forgot to take baby out of the room when she was sleeping (even though she never takes the baby out of the room when I‚Äôm sleeping during my shift). I tell her it‚Äôs just not possible for me to be as exacting or engaged as she would like me to be. I‚Äôm getting 3 hours of sleep a night, if not less. She doesn‚Äôt seem to really care, she is really having none of what I tell her about how I feel. She literally tells me I have to do things exactly, or I‚Äôm just engaging in learned incompetence. (This is literally what she says.) She did promise to try to control her anger. I am just so tired I can‚Äôt possibly meet all of desires. And because of that, I just don‚Äôt know what to do any more when I‚Äôm around her‚Ä¶ I really want her to be happy and help her as much as I can, but it seems impossible.",

He says ‚ÄúOh yeah, she did wake up at 3.30am but I just left her for ten minutes and she went back to sleep.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Our baby has never cried in the night so I always took her being awake as a sign of hunger. I‚Äôd get her up, change her nappy, feed her, burp her, hold her upright and be up for around an hour at least once, usually twice a night. Last night I tried it for myself and sure enough she woke up around 3.30 but went right on back to sleep with no intervention. I ended up waking her up myself at 6 because my boobs hurt!

      "content_preview": "Long time lurker, first time poster. My baby is currently 6 months old, she just started daycare last Tuesday. I took her to the doctor the day before on Monday to get her 6 month shots and talked with them about her starting daycare so they were aware, mainly bc i anticipated she would probably start getting sick a little more with daycare and germs. Her first day was okay, they said she was fussy but that‚Äôs to be expected with first day. I met 2 teachers who told me they would be her teachers for her classroom. They were both nice, and they seemed so attentive and caring. It made me feel better. The second day I dropped her off the morning teacher was there everything seemed fine, when I picked her up from her second day it was a completely different teacher I hadn‚Äôt met, I tried asking her how my baby‚Äôs day was, she couldn‚Äôt tell me. She said ‚Äúumm I‚Äôm pretty sure she had a good day‚Äù then I asked for her last bottle because I noticed it wasn‚Äôt in her bag and she didn‚Äôt know where it was. Luckily I found it. It made me a little uneasy the afternoon teacher couldn‚Äôt tell me how her day was and didn‚Äôt know where her bottle was. I also noticed an unexplained scratch on her wrist. We got no incident reports or any explanation which again made me a little anxious. But I told myself she‚Äôs with other babies ranging from 6mos-12mos so I‚Äôm sure small scratches will happen from time to time and not to overreact. When I dropped her off on her third day, her teacher told me that she is not taking bottles fast enough and she‚Äôs a very slow eater, I explained that‚Äôs her norm on bottles she really likes to take her time. She‚Äôs only given bottles by dad sometimes and daycare. I breastfeed her 95% of the time at home. I also asked how the day before was since the other teacher couldn‚Äôt tell me. Her teacher did the so/so hand motion and said it was an improvement from the first day but that‚Äôs all she said. Throughout the day the kept updating the app that she was refusing her bottles, only drinking a few oz at a time, not finishing them. I messaged them and told them to please let us know if we need to pick her up or come up there to try to get her to eat. They messaged back and said they got her to take the rest of it so it was fine. I get there to pick her up that evening and it‚Äôs 2 teachers I‚Äôve never met again which I didn‚Äôt like but, trying to go with it. I understand teachers probably call in and get sick themselves so I told myself maybe that‚Äôs why the last 2 days it hasn‚Äôt been the teacher who said she would be in here for afternoons. The teachers told me she had a really good day and she is a happy baby which made me happy, a little shocked given everything with the bottles but I thought maybe this meant she was adjusting. As I‚Äôm putting her in her car seat i notice pinpoint purplish red spots that looked like bruises all over and all the way around lower legs below her knees. There had been no incident report made and the teachers didn‚Äôt say anything when I picked her up. She had on shorts all day and I noticed it right away when buckling her in so in my head there‚Äôs absolutely no way the teacher missed these. I walked her back in and took her to the directors asking them to explain these marks on her legs and why I wasn‚Äôt notified. They agreed it looked like bruising and told me another baby couldn‚Äôt have caused those marks which really sent me into a panic. They advised I take her to the ER to be checked out and in the meantime they would reach out to all teachers that had been in her room and ask them if they noticed them. I picked her dad up and took her to the hospital. At the hospital they explained with suspected child abuse they have to do a full skeletal work up and run labs to make sure there‚Äôs nothing internally wrong and to rule out anything that would cause this medically. My poor baby had to endure getting an IV, 22 X-rays and a head CT. I was distraught. She was so upset during all of the tests. At the end, all labs were clear and luckily all X-rays and CT were normal. The doctors essentially said they can rule out there is nothing medically wrong with her to cause these marks and started a CPS case listing the daycare as the perpetrators. Also, during all of this the daycare messaged us and said the teachers denied seeing any marks on her all day. It‚Äôs also worth noting they uploaded a photo of her at 10AM that day and there are no marks on her legs. So it had to of happened sometime after 10AM and before I picked her up. We took her to her pediatrician the next day (the same one who had just seen her Monday) and she agreed it did appear to be bruising on her legs and my baby or another baby couldn‚Äôt have created those marks on her legs. So now we are waiting for CPS to do their investigation to see what happens next. I have sent messages to the daycare letting them know we have decided to unenroll, & asked them to remove cards from autopay so we aren‚Äôt charged another week. We also still need to pick her up her extra belongings we left. No response. Idk if it‚Äôs bc they know there‚Äôs a CPS case or what. It‚Äôs been 3 days since the incident and the marks look a lot better but they‚Äôre still there and I‚Äôve been a wreck since. I‚Äôm so angry at myself for sending her. I feel like I sent her directly into harms way. The CPS worker said it can take up to 45 working days to finish the investigation. I don‚Äôt want to ruin anyone‚Äôs reputation, I don‚Äôt want to falsely accuse either I just want to understand what happened to my baby and how apparently none of the teachers saw it. Has anyone gone through something similar? And what happened in the end? I‚Äôm sorry if it seems like this is rambling I just wanted to see if any other moms had advice. Thanks for reading (:",

      "content_preview": "Seriously, how do you do it? My baby is 5 months old and I've been trying to take her to visit family or friends or even meet a friend for a coffee at a caf√©. Because if we stay home for too long, she gets bored as well - only going for daily walks and shopping won't cut it. So out we go, or we try to. Almost always, it's a catastrophe. Car ride? Fine for 10 minutes max, after that, full on crying. Falling asleep in the car seat is not a thing. Being out after her last nap? Full on drama. The stroller? Fine for fifteen minutes sometimes. Any more than that, no can do. The carrier? Alright for naps but no more than that. Like how is this supposed to work?? Even if I manage to get to my destination, it's usually exhausting because I need to make sure baby is entertained enough and she won't accept anyone else to hold her either. Sometimes, just sometimes it would be nice to get a break and to enjoy going out for a little bit. I'm hoping it will get better as she gets older but right now this is hard. Sorry for the rant, just needed to get this off my chest for once. Love my baby to bits but some days are just sooo hard. Edit: Oh wow I didn't expect to get so many replies here. Thank you so much for your advice, solidarity, empathy, and kind words! Still reading through comments and replying to as many as I can manage.",

I‚Äôm hoping 2 years before ever introducing TV (big screen) and never introducing little screen until baby is old enough for their own phone. My only tip is, until you break YOUR phone addiction you can‚Äôt prevent your baby from getting one. Deleting tik tok, instagram, and learning that I can indeed eat a meal, clean the house, and chill without using a video or show as background noise has made all the difference. Also I‚Äôve noticed my patience with my baby and older children (like my nephews/friends children) has improved so much. I now reserve phone time for after bedtime or my lunch break! introducing screens is super cool if you want to! My reasoning was I‚Äôm scared of a child having unmonitored access to the internet. When we do introduce TV I‚Äôm planning on utilizing DVDs as opposed to streaming services/YouTube to prevent that from happening",

Anyway, that pain cry was DIFFERENT. Of all the hungry and tired cries we've heard up until then, nothing was even close to the emotional reaction I had that day. The visceral anger and hatred I felt towards the nurses was insane. I know they're just doing their jobs, I calmed down and I never lashed or anything. I teared up, my wife cried, it was bad. We had to hang out in the lobby afterward so my wife could cuddle him longer before he went back into the car seat for the drive home. For all the new parents out there, get as ready as you can be if you plan on getting shots, it hurts your soul probably more than it hurts your child lol. u/Slight-Ad-5016 brought up something important to include that I forgot about. We weren't warned by our pediatrician or nurses that after the shots, your LO will have an upset stomach and pains at the needle location for a couple days. Lots of spitting up and be weary not to touch the vaccine location for a short while. I made that mistake when I was giving him legs rubs and he winced, I felt so bad üò≠",

      "content_preview": "My wife and I (both F) have a 4 month old daughter using my wife's egg. I carried her for 9 months and felt her move, and then she felt like mine. But she was born the spitting image of my wife, not even tempered by the donor who looked a bit more like me. I love that because it's what I hoped for going into this, but other people aren't always great about it. The three of us were out in a park about a month ago and two older women came up to admire the baby, who I was holding at the time. One of them asked whose she was, and when my wife answered \"both of ours\" the woman looked at the two of us, laughed, and said \"you can always tell who the real one is.\" I've honestly been pretty down about going in public together since then. Most people are less brazen but I get a lot of those kind of looks. My other problem is that it kind of feels like there is nothing that makes my relationship with my daughter special other than breastfeeding/pumping milk. Her other mom is better at calming her than I am, and she's a very social and confident child so she doesn't look for or need reassurance from me. I make a point to talk, sing, and play with her but she's so friendly that I might as well be a neighbor. On the other hand, when my daughter and my wife lock eyes she lights up and it's like she knows that's her mom. I love my daughter so much it takes the breath out of me, but it really hurts to feel like just the partner of her mother, when I'm her mother too. Thanks for letting me vent.",

      "content_preview": "Im a FTM and naturally fell down the rabbit hole of baby sleep when my LO was going through her 4 month regression. I didn't understand why she was waking up so often and found myself influenced by the \"sleep training\" world. I started implementing schedules, playing around with wake windows, timing naps etc all in a desperate attempt to get my baby to sleep longer stretches at night. The amount of hours I spent on Reddit and TikTok trying to find a magic solution was criminal. I was beyond stressed, sleep deprived and regret spending so much time obsessing about my baby's sleep. People were telling me it was because my baby had sleep associations to being fed to sleep so that's why she was waking up. I always felt that was wrong - when my baby woke in the night she wasn't looking to nurse and in the past she had connected sleep cycles despite being nursed to sleep. It wasn't until I stumbled across the Possums Sleep Program (recommended by another Redditor) that my perspective completely changed. The author (a Dr) spoke about how sleep is not determined by associations, its determined by sleep pressure and the body clock. She encouraged feeding to sleep because its the most natural and quickest way to get your baby back to sleep in the night. She also encourages letting abby sleep in natural light during the day so baby only takes the sleep they need to take the edge of their sleep pressure. This was shocking to me because alot of the stuff i was reading previously was saying all naps need to be in a dark room with white noise. I agreed with majority of what the author was saying and implemented some of her strategies. Since doing so my baby is sleeping long stretches at night and naps are no longer a battle. Sleep will happen when sleep happens - its inevitable and it just goes to show sleep associations are complete rubbish. I wish I didnt feel like I was doing something wrong by feeding my baby to sleep in the early days. The honest truth is that babies wake frequently in the night during certain periods of their development because they are growing and learning new skills. Its completely normal. We survived by doing shifts and riding the wave. Once baby came out of the regression she was doing 4-6 hour stretches. I still feed to sleep. I dont know what the purpose of this post is other than to maybe help someone else out there who may be struggling like I was. If you feel sleep training isn't right for your situation and want to explore a different approach I highly recommend Possums - it honestly isn't talked about enough and is all scientific and evidence based.",

I know you feel nap trapped sometimes and the house is a mess and you could be doing so much more while the baby sleeps. But my baby is barely 4 months and a half and he has not wanted a contact nap in the past 3 weeks and guess what‚Ä¶ I miss them.",

      "content_preview": "So, I'm a young dad. Baby is two weeks old. I feel horrible. Nothing is right. And it's all my fault. From the first second until today. When I first saw my baby at birth, I was shocked. He was white, very white (I am mixed race Creole). My first reaction was not happiness, nor fear, but just: ‚ÄúWho are you? ¬ª I know he'll take color and I know he looks a lot like me, but I managed to ruin the first time I saw him. It's only been two weeks and I'm already exhausted. His mother had an infection and I had to deal with everything alone. (It's not his fault, of course.) Despite that, I blame him. It's visceral. I'm angry with her. I don't show it directly but I think you can feel it... and poor thing. And the worst part of it all, what makes me feel the most horrible, is that I can't love my baby. Well‚Ä¶ yes, I love him, but I haven‚Äôt yet felt this ‚Äúunconditional love‚Äù, this famous thing that goes beyond everything. I take care of him, I am meticulous in his care and his meals because he didn't ask for anything and that's my role. But that's all. I can't give him sincere affection. In short, I regret the situation. If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have had children. The worst part is that it's only been two weeks, and I feel worse than I ever have in my life. I feel like a horrible person ‚Äî and I probably am. I just had to write it down somewhere. THANKS.",

      "content_preview": "Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs changed with my wife since she‚Äôs had our baby. I want to be supportive, but I‚Äôm not really sure what to do any more. I‚Äôm with our newborn baby 10+ hours a day taking care of her, and most of the night feeding (I do all except one of the feeds). She is so amazing and honestly such an easy baby. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt mind taking care of her 100% of the time if I had to. My real struggle has been my spouse. I love her so much and want to do everything for her, but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gotten into her and I just can‚Äôt manage any more. She asks me to do exercises with the baby to make her less tense. I do them maybe 2-3 times a day when I can remember and she‚Äôs awake. But she gets upset that I‚Äôm not doing them 4-5 times a day a day. I try to match that frequency, but honestly sometimes I just forget. She has very specific requirements for me feeding her. How to position the bottle, how to support her back etc. And I try to do these things, but sometimes I just want to get in comfortable position. Unfortunately, when she notices I‚Äôm doing it wrong, she always comes by and gives me a lecture and try to correct me. There‚Äôs been tensions about non-baby things too. I was doing yard work yesterday and I absent-mindedly trimmed a plant of hers. She just got so angry today, went on and on even I said sorry, I won‚Äôt do it again etc. Same thing with cleaning. I clean all the bottle and pump parts, and if there‚Äôs any oily bits or residue, she gets upset. She got upset cause the oatmeal I cooked her wasn‚Äôt the right consistency. That the bottle is in the wrong position. That I forgot to take baby out of the room when she was sleeping (even though she never takes the baby out of the room when I‚Äôm sleeping during my shift). I tell her it‚Äôs just not possible for me to be as exacting or engaged as she would like me to be. I‚Äôm getting 3 hours of sleep a night, if not less. She doesn‚Äôt seem to really care, she is really having none of what I tell her about how I feel. She literally tells me I have to do things exactly, or I‚Äôm just engaging in learned incompetence. (This is literally what she says.) She did promise to try to control her anger. I am just so tired I can‚Äôt possibly meet all of desires. And because of that, I just don‚Äôt know what to do any more when I‚Äôm around her‚Ä¶ I really want her to be happy and help her as much as I can, but it seems impossible.",

We have a clear shower curtain so I think she‚Äôs interested in my movements as well as the shower sound. I park her in her bouncer :)",

      "content_preview": "ETA: My son is safe and has never been alone with her in a car. Never will be... My friend completely ignores car seat safety.... She front faces her child that IS NOT ready... The front buckle? All the way down as low as it can be... The straps? Might as well not even have them on they're so loose. The car seat is strapped so loose that it can move all the way to the middle seat. I had noticed when she sends me car pictures he wouldn't be strapped in good at all but I never said anything because I wasn't sure if she was really driving around with her child like that... Surely not... When we hung out together with our little ones for the first time, I had to install my son's car seat in her car.(She has always been safe driver at least) Low and behold, I see her child unsafe in the car seat.  She definitely noticed how careful and thorough I was and had asked questions. So I walked her through everything. She had said she had felt terrible. And I told her not to! Now she knows car seat safety so she can move forward doing the right thing. And I also gave her my carb seat specialists number I still had in case she had any questions and wanted a professional to double check. She was very thankful and sweet. Now the other day, a month later,  I left with her to help her out, and her child was STILL completely unsafe. Didn't change a thing. Might as well not even be in a car seat. I'd like to note I'm NOT the one to judge parenting styles or step in to correct someone's parenting because I'm still a FTM myself and it's not my place and I'm definitely not the queen of parenting lol. But I am judgey when it comes to completely ignoring safety for your child... What scares me the most is she's having another baby...she will pop any time now. I want to step in and say something so bad... I'm not sure I could live with myself if something happened to those babies and I didn't try to say something one more time...I'm not even sure if I respect her anymore.  But I know that'll be stepping out of place...but I almost don't care anymore... What are your thoughts?",
