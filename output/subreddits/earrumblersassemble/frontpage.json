For the last two nights I've been waking myself up by rumbling in my sleep (who knew?) and when I do, there is a pop sound like this. https://youtu.be/ynjHLrQSm68?feature=shared Because it is in my ear it is quite loud.  It is only in my right ear. So then I get up and go pee and while I'm doing that I rumble and sure enough the pop pops. There is no discomfort at all. It pop for a few minutes after I take the CPAP off and then rumbles go back to normal. This morning, wondering if I was losiing my mind, I asked the spouse to put his ear on mine and I rumbled. He is not a rumbler. He was quite surprised to hear an audible pop. Anyone else have anything similar? I prolly will go to the doctor for the wtf of it.",

I have hypermobility Ehlers Danlos which is a genetic connective tissue disorder that causes generalized joint hypermobility, joint instability, and chronic pain.  People with HEDs have defective collagen which makes our connective tissue weaker and more stretchy which enables us to overextend ourselves.  I am not aware of any studies to date tying the ability to control the tensor tympani muscle to HSD or hEDS but I can see how indirect connections could be made via: connective tissue and muscle control, neurological sensitivities, and auditory symptoms and sensitivities.  Just curious to know if this group has any other zebras??",

Yesterday I guess I blew my nose too hard my ears made a loud popping sound and my tinnitus got overwhelmingly audible, extremely loud. It did got quiet down a bit later but even a minute of that torture was too much, now my right ear doesn't pop when I do the valsalva maneuver and feels extremely uncomfortable also does this creaking (not cracking) slimey, gooey sounds..like when you're on a cold and my right ear haven't popped since. What this could be? Is this a passing thing or did anyone else experience this as well I'd like to know 🙏🏻",

      "content_preview": "Hello! So basically, I can control my tensor tympani (I mean duh I'm posting here lol). But what I've found is that I've been able to connect it with my synthesesia. So when I activate the \"rumble\" sound, I can use it in a variety of ways. I have many mental issues, so being able to rumble in my ears is something that actually grounds me. I also am able to calculate BPM using it. Since I can use it to mimic the rhythm of songs or beats, and I can calculate the amount of beats over a period of time to be able to get the BPM. This has proved to be incredibly useful, I'm a trumpet player and I've hardly had to tap my foot to keep rhythm, its just a natural thing my brain does. I'm also able to use it as kind of like a \"vibrate\" sense when I'm playing video games or doing something that requires my reflexes. You ever use the vibrate controls on a video game controller? I basically was able to adapt my control into that, so I have like, CRAZY reflexes sometimes lol. I call it my \"spider sense\". I also love using the rumble to play along with the bass and the drums in songs, its SO satisfying and fun. Furthermore, i can play music and shift the pitch of the noise so I can turn them into notes rather than one uniform sound. This is what makes me think it isn't a useless superpower for me, I've been able to make so many uses out of it. But you gotta admit this stuff is WICKED cool!",

It’s nice to have found my people! I have been having an issue that I suspect is related. I would love to know if any of you have a similar issue. I have an issue with my hearing (or my brain as it interprets sounds or frequencies or vibrations). I had my hearing tested. The results are below. My biggest concern is this “puffing” or “whooshing” sound I hear when I play my electric guitar. It happens worst when I do NOT have it plugged in. There is an uncomfortable pressure sensation that occurs just after I play each note. Some notes cause it worse than others. It’s uncomfortable. It does not happen (or at least it’s not nearly as noticeable) when I play acoustic guitar. I might also describe the sound/sensation like when water is in your ear and it’s starting to come out. I can trigger this whooshing sound at will by flexing muscles in my ears. Also, if I open my mouth really wide I hear the same type of whooshing sound. AUDIOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\nOtoscopy:\nClear canals AU\n\n226 Hz Probe Tone Tympanometry:\nRight - Type A, suggestive of normal middle ear function\nLeft - Type A, suggestive of normal middle ear function\n\nBehavioral Testing:\nConventional Audiometry\n\nTransducer: Headphones and Bone conduction\nReliability: good\nPatient State: Cooperative\n\nRight ear: Hearing within normal limits.\nLeft ear: Hearing within normal limits with a mild high-frequency hearing loss at 3000 and 4000 Hz only.\n\nSpeech recognition threshold(s) obtained via open set testing support tonal findings.\n\nWord recognition scores were 100% at 50 dB HL in the right and 100% at 50 dB HL in the left when presented via monitored live voice with NU-6 word lists.",

      "content_preview": "I've had ETD and tinnitus for several years and basically lived with it. Ringing only in a quiet background, crackling, etc, plus sometimes when burping I feel a thump in the ear. Fast forward to April 2025, I had a burp then a thump in the ear then multiple pulses. That went away after a few days, then by yawning, I get episodes of pulsing, or by random. In May 2025 and June 2025, I notice I have a less chance of pulsing after I yawn, but sometimes they occur randomly in both ears. No episodes. July 2025, I started noticing my pulse in ear more often, by random, not by yawning. However the pulsing has started getting intense, mainly in the left ear. There have also been episodes once again. I have been starting to stress out when it pulses around this time, so that may be why episodes are longer. I also notice when I go out I don't notice the pulse (mainly because I'm focused on outside stuff). Rarely it pulses when I'm out in public (it has done so before). I'll keep updated when I can in a few months.",

But my right ear has been rumbling pretty bad and especially when my left ear is hearing a sound louder than my right (which is weird to me bc you’d think my left ear would rumble). For example, for my job we have to wear an earpiece on our left ear. Literally every time someone speaks into it my right ear rumbles. My left one doesn’t. I don’t think it’s overly loud or anything and even sometimes when I’m listening to something and laying on my right side (so my right ear is in my pillow and muffling the noise) my right ear alwaysssss rumbles. I know the involuntary rumbles are a muscle tensing to kinda protect our ears from loud noises but it’s just really odd to me how my right ear does it when my left one is hearing the most noise. It’s been driving me insane lol does anyone know if I can make this go away or if it’s caused by anything? I know I’ve been stressed lately so that might have something to do with it??

The same thing happens sometimes right after I burp. Also, when I use headphones and there’s a louder sound, it feels like something thin or membrane-like clenches up inside my ear. It sounds like a crumpling plastic bag. The pulsing is not in sync with my heartbeat; it’s completely random, kind of like Morse code. I know I’m not imagining it. It’s been going on for quite a while (2 years), and it happens every single day. It’s really messing with my ability to sleep. Taking naps during the day is impossible. I have no idea what this could be. My first thought was a ruptured eardrum, or maybe a blockage deep inside the ear. I’m definitely planning to see a doctor, but I’d really appreciate it if someone could shed some light on what this might be. Some background: the symptoms started not long after I began university. So I’m wondering if this is stress-related?",

This spring/summer my allergies came like usual, but I've been getting this low rumbling only on my right side and coincidentally my right nostril is also a lil stuffy. It started off with just for a few minutes/ hours and would go away when I go to bed, but now I feel like it comes earlier in the day and lasts longer, almost the whole day. It's never been bad to the point where I can't sleep, but it definitely  drives me a lil insane when I'm home or when it's quiet. Recently I discovered that whenever my ear is rumbling/ nostril is stuffy, my inferior turbinate is swollen, blocking my airway 85%. I was wondering if anyone's ever had the same/ similar experience?? (Yes, I'm gonna go to the doctor's soon)",
