      "content_preview": "Hey I just don't have another good place to post this, but as I was doing research for my newsletter I saw a trend kind of popping off. If you're already in the Roblox Space you probably know about it but anything to do with 99 Nights in the Forest seems to be killing it. Currently what seems to be working: Providing in-depth guides/walkthroughs Decent-ish thumbnails 10+ minute videos but under an hour Niche-Adjacent (explained below) Currently not seems to be working: Terrible thumbnails (lol duh) Niche-Same (When you just take what's working for other creators in the space and slap your name on it) Let's plays (sorry) Overly bright thumbnails Anything that shows a human face (Just what I've noticed/Unless you're already pretty popular) Niche-Adjacent : What seems to be working is when people are taking trends from other niches and putting it into 99 nights in the forest Ex: Nuzlockes (Pokemon) I walked in a straight line (Zelda + others) There's a ton of examples of other niches, stardew-esque of 100 days would probably work pretty well but i imagine there's already quite a few of those Comments sections: What I've noticed from the people that are raking in like 100k-1M views is that - They all provide value, stuff like \"OMG this was so helpful emoji emoji etc\" - Some are funny - for gamers this can be a goldmine if you can figure out the humor of the niche - Voices - so if you have a good voice or a decent mic apparently that goes a long way here If this sort of thing is helpful, I'll be building a full post of this on my account, and I'll also be dropping a new issue of my newsletter on Monday (linked on account, it's free, it's for gamers) If this sort of thing isn't helpful, let me know what would be - pretty obsessed with YouTube and providing value to gamers",

      "content_preview": "Hello everyone! My friend and I are planning to start a gaming YouTube channel together. Our goal is to post gameplay videos and maybe do some live streams. We also want to create shorter content, like video clips and YouTube Shorts, from our main videos. The thing is, we're not sure about the right strategy to grow the channel. We have a lot of ideas but don't know the best way to start and get noticed. For example, we were wondering: is it a good idea to promote our most popular Shorts to get more views on our longer videos? Or should we focus on something else entirely? Any tips on how to plan our content, the best way to promote the channel, and what we should prioritize (long videos vs. Shorts vs. streams) would be incredibly helpful. Thank you so much in advance for any advice!",

I feel like the \"big secrets\" and most famous stories, like GTA 's Hot Coffee , the Herobrine legend in Minecraft , or the SEGA vs. Nintendo rivalry, have been told and re-told to exhaustion. It feels like all the Easter eggs and mysteries have already been uncovered. I personally love this kind of video, but as a creator, I'd like to know if you, as the audience, are still interested in it. Do you think there's still room for new channels in this niche?

While recording these videos generally takes less than an hour, the editing process takes much longer (sometimes around a day and a half of combing through footage). In addition to this, I work 4 days out of the week and I'm almost always working at nights. I figured a two-week upload schedule would be consistent, meaning I could push out at least 2 videos or more every two weeks. But I'm on the fence whether this is a good idea or not. I don't want to rush or push out half-baked videos, I want to put the time and care into them that they deserve. But I'm also not sure if making people wait two weeks for an upload, will help my channel growth. Should I instead be posting weekly? Or stay with the bi-weekly uploads?",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone, I’m starting my content journey as a gaming creator. I’ve wanted to do this for a long time, but one thing keeps tripping me up: picking a niche. The truth is — I love everything. RPGs, shooters, indie games, weird little story games, big triple-A releases, you name it. And every time I try to narrow down to one lane, I feel like I’m locking myself in a box. But I also know that without focus, it’s hard to build a consistent audience. People join for one thing, not everything. Right now, I’m leaning toward starting with RPG content (since that’s where I feel most at home), but I still get that itch to branch out, especially when a new release drops or a game just looks too fun to pass up. So I wanted to ask the other creators here: How do you stay in your niche without getting bored or feeling restricted? Do you give yourself room to experiment? Or do you go all-in on one thing until you’ve built a solid base? Would love to hear how others navigated this early-stage struggle. Appreciate any advice or stories!",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, I have my own let's play channel and have been running it for two years now. I've come across a couple of confusing issues and need help from those who know their stuff. The first problem is that I don’t understand how to keep viewers watching (AVD). Just by looking at the analytics, it sometimes feels like YouTube is recommending my videos to the wrong audience. The second issue is random views and subscriptions from India that YouTube later removes, and I think this causes the algorithm to mark my videos as unsuccessful. I know that for growth, CTR and AVD are crucial, but I’m not sure how to increase them. I’ve adjusted the audio and put effort into editing, but I still don’t get what I’m doing wrong because, in almost every video, most of the audience drops off in the first 5 seconds. Hopefully, someone can point out what mistakes might be causing this or share their solutions or experiences on how it looks for them.",

I’ve seen plenty of channels that post emulator gameplay without problems, but I don’t know if that’s just luck or if YouTube doesn’t really care as long as it’s gameplay footage. So for anyone here who’s uploaded emulator-based gameplay: Have you had issues with copyright, strikes, or takedowns? Or is it treated basically the same as playing on original hardware? Would love to hear your experiences before I dive in. Thanks!",

Don't bother consulting with AI about titles and thumbnails, it's all BS even if you disable the insufferable flattering speech and human like behavior it's all nonsense It can help with reading and explaining stats, sure, but that's where it ends. Both Gemini and DeepSeek explained why my current latest video Thumbnail text and title are excellent for CTR and both chose that among other things, I'm sitting at over 700 nearly 800 recommendations and only 13 views 4 hours later. So that's 0.6CTR, now I've had way worse CTR that bounced back up to 5+% after a simple change in title and thumbnail text (not style) and videos with super low CTR do well , but what irks me is that these systems are set up to analyze and predict this stuff and they can't. I genuinely am tired of thinking up slogans and titles just for a video to get noticed, after working hard on videos we have to be clowning around with titles and slogans and nonsense. My previous video on atari 2600 did amazingly well for my channel, but not before I changed the title like 10 times within a few hours My first title for my latest video: \"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - A Profound Journey \" was rated high by both gemini and deepseek, supposedly great for CTR and the text in the thumbnail \"Art Meet Heart!\" as very clever and good for CTR with tons of explanations why.....it's clearly not doing the job it was supposed to so I changed the title. EDIT: I changed the thumbnail completely, instead of the painting I used a screenshot from the game and change the thumbnail text to \"I wasn't prepared\" and title \"Does Clair Obscur Hold Up? The Post-Hype Verdict.\" so let's see how that works out",

      "content_preview": "I’m planning on starting a FC channel on YouTube. The idea comes from the fact that I’ve a passion for football. I currently play FC25 extensively and quite like the manager career mode. I’m able to play on “Ultimate” difficulty and planning to create a playlist of rebuilding certain clubs and going through multiple seasons with them. I’m planning on uploading 30-35 mins videos as episodes for the series. I know it takes a long time to get eligible for the partner program but I’m trying to do it as I love playing FC and after recording and some voiceover I might get something from it. Since FC26 is launching in a month, I’m also thinking of uploading some Ultimate Team videos as well. But not sure if I keep my channel down to specific niche (manager mode only) or have all sorts of mode from FC. I need suggestions on where I can do better (based on my thoughts) and avoid common mistakes before starting the channel. I’m not an extrovert person and maybe not a camera confident person to have videos like NickRTFM or Nepenthez or AA9skills. I don’t prefer coming on to camera.",

      "content_preview": "Hey everyone! 👋 I’ve been seriously considering starting up a YouTube channel centered around gaming,  mostly Nintendo and Pokémon content (Walkthroughs, News/Updates, How tos, Top X lists, Reactions, Reviews). I also occasionally play some PC games, so I might sprinkle those in too. Similar to the likes of Austin John. I’m not completely new to being in front of a camera, I’ve done a fair bit of social media content (talking head videos, reels, etc.) and I’m definitely comfortable hosting or narrating. That said, I’m brand new to the world of capturing and editing gameplay footage for YouTube, so I’d really appreciate any insight or advice from folks here who’ve gone down this path. Particularly equipment but also general advice. Right now, here’s what I’m working with: Nintendo Switch 1 & 2 Gaming PC RØDE Wireless GO II (Not a traditional mic setup, can I use it as a temporary solution?) No capture card yet I’ve been eyeing the Elgato 4K60 S+ (Model: 10GBH9901SKU), but I’m open to suggestions — especially if there are more affordable options that still give great quality. I’ve also read a lot of people recommend OBS Studio for recording and streaming gameplay. Is that still the gold standard? A few specific questions I’d love help with: Would my RØDE Wireless GO II be good enough to start with, or should I prioritize getting a proper mic? Is the Elgato 4K60 S+ overkill for Switch gameplay, or is it worth it long-term? Do most of you edit your videos yourself or work with editors? I’m decent at learning software but wondering what the time investment looks like. Any tips on growing a brand new Nintendo/Pokémon-focused channel in 2025? - Should I just do it? I’m mainly looking to create content that feels fun and chill, stuff that fans of Pokémon and Nintendo games would vibe with and come back for. Thanks in advance for any tips, suggestions, or even gear recs! Really appreciate this community and looking forward to learning from you all 🙌",

      "content_preview": "I’m a small YouTube creator making highlights and clips of MOBA game tournaments in my own style. My channel was recently terminated due to multiple copyright strikes. I did not knowingly violate copyright and was unaware the footage was protected. Most of my videos were low-view (10–100), and I never intended to profit. I received multiple copyright strikes within a few days without prior warning and didn’t have time to react. I had never received any copyright issues before and didn’t know gaming tournaments are copyright protected. I only made clips and videos from official tournament livestreams. I tried contacting the copyright owner multiple times but got no response. I want to know if anyone has advice on how to appeal or communicate with the copyright claimant to possibly get my channel back. Should I submit a counter-notification? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated",
