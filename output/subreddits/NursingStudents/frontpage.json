I have been working a lot and going to 12 hour clinical days, and trying to go to all of the back to school stuff for my kids after class. I'm exhausted. Today I set my alarm early to give myself some extra time in the morning, but I was so tired that I just snoozed 5 times and ran out the door in a rush. But I made it to school on time! Everything was going to be fine! Then, when I was waiting for the elevator, I realized everyone around me was wearing lab scrubs. Because we have lab today. I was also supposed to be in scrubs. But I was wearing street clothes. My friends, I literally turned around, walked back to my car, and took myself out to breakfast instead. Sometimes you just need a break. Tomorrow is a new day.",

      "content_preview": "I’m 19 years old and currently studying nursing in Montreal, Canada. It’s a three-year program and I’m halfway through, about a year and a half in. I’m starting to wonder if I should quit. I chose this program because nothing else really interested me, but I knew nursing offered job security, good pay and a career my family considers respectable (as all jobs are). I’m a sociable person but I quickly realized that doesn’t matter much here since there’s no time for small talk, and that was fine with me. The real issue is that after starting the program and working as a CNA during the summer, I discovered that nursing is really for people who can handle others’ bad attitudes. Even though everyone says they want to “help people,” I struggle with the idea of caring for someone who constantly yells at me or treats me poorly. On top of that, the job requires analyzing patients’ conditions, finding solutions, calling doctors and pharmacies, monitoring progress, learning medications, mastering techniques and taking responsibility for people’s lives. You move from room to room, deal with families, manage constant stress and there’s even the risk of being sued or facing legal trouble if something goes wrong. I don’t want to make so many life or death decisions on my own. If people consider me lazy, that’s fine, I just want a job where I have clear directives, stay in one place instead of moving from room to room, and don’t need to ask fifteen people for help. I just want to learn what to do and do it. For example, I was thinking about radiology technology, but I’d like to know what you think. People tell me “You’ve come this far, why quit now? There’s more to nursing than bedside care.” I know that but the core of the job feels the same everywhere, it’s just about choosing what’s less overwhelming. The problem is I don’t know what other healthcare path could offer the same benefits as nursing such as job security, salary and respect without carrying the same weight and pressure. So now I’m stuck wondering: should I stay or should I leave?",

      "content_preview": "DO NOT GO TO ANY JERSEY COLLEGE SCHOOL OF NURSING FOR LPN PROGRAM. Please Listen because I didn’t and it costed me wasted time and money & stress at this school I had heard about Jersey College school of Nursing through word of mouth. They only have evening classes only at the Fort Lauderdale location for LPN program. The program is 15 months long and is a clock hour school. I was the in Second first term students of Guinea pigs for this program by the way. The only had term 2 available when I started and just now starting term 3 as of September 2nd, 2025. This program was unorganized, the fundamentals teacher they kept replacing since the first ( first term students ) earlier 2025. My fundamentals teacher was removed from teacher due to consistent low tests scores on exam. Her clinical style teaching was amazing but teaching the class room.. half the class would wanna fall asleep. Imagine passing all your classes and failing in the very same class they removed your teacher from mid semester and not give any remediation tests or retakes. They failed me and said they prepared us to the best of their ability for all exams. A LIE ! Half of the class of 13 students including me had to retake the entire first semester which is 3 + months if you fail one class ! They never had grades in the system even RN students day and evening classes didn’t have their grades put in at all. Every Exam you have to wait almost a week just to find out what you scored ! The teachers can’t even prepare you for what might be on the test due to them having teachers from all Jersey college submit one question to create an exam. They do not release the tests to show you what you got wrong or anything only summary reports which you get when you find you finally get your scores. These people do not care about you , just your money. If I continued it would’ve taken me 18 months with only failing one semester just to get a LPN degree when there is PUBLIC school charging less and it’s only 12 months. The tuition is close to 30k for the LPN program. I withdrew from the program like many of the videos I seen warning me not to go when it was already too late I was already 2 weeks in when I saw the horror videos but I felt like I’ll give them a chance. They showed the colors real bad ! I passed all my classes and they failed me by 1 POINT 72 ( need a 73% overall grade ) to pass the class. In the same class they keep firing and hiring teachers in ( fundamentals ). I will not be attending no more private nursing schools in south Florida. They all wanna take peoples money and hold you back so you can waste more money with them. DO NOT GO TO JERSEY COLLEGE , the system is not set up for you to pass when you’re willing to put in the work for your future career. This is the current update of FALL 2025. Please watch all TikTok videos and if you do plan on asking about the program. Ask them how many students are in the higher terms that will let you know everything you need to about the program !",

I have classes Monday, 8am to 3pm, clinical on Tuesday (starts Sept. 23rd) from 6am to 2pm, then class again on Wednesday from 8am to 12pm. I just landed a fantastic job as a PCA in a well-known hospital in the unit I always saw myself being a nurse on (cardiac- I have been a tele tech, cardiac device specialist, EKG tech, etc in the past along with CNA work in between). They couldn’t offer me much schedule wise besides three 8 hour shifts a week but I’m able to get full benefits from day one being 0.6FTE… the catch? Rotating shifts. So I may start at 6:45am, 2:45pm, or 10:45pm. I’m already overwhelmed trying to figure out how to study for nursing classes and just got my schedule- lots of housekeeping stuff the first week then I end the week with my first shift on the floor… a 12 hour overnight shift since I’m in training and they schedule you slightly over your agreed hours to retain info. It’ll be worth it in two years. They will also outright pay for my BSN and I qualify for tuition reimbursement next year. Am I absolutely nuts? Anyone else in the same boat? How do you manage… just not sleep? Thanks for listening to my vent. 🫶",

I am one month sober from marijuana today after being a heavy user for the past 7 years (I quit several times in those years, but only for a few months at most). I have a bachelors in biology but felt really unsure what I wanted to do for a long time. I’ve recently realized that I think I would really love to be a midwife and am in the process of applying to an ADN program to get my RN certification and eventually apply to a msn in midwifery. The past month has not been easy, but I’m trying to stay motivated by remembering why I want to do this: To help mothers feel safe, heard, and understood in their pregnancy and birth, and to improve my own life and be more present for my future family and children one day. Remember your goals and your “why”. You can do this and you will be so much more present and able to tackle what life throws at you on the other side.",

      "content_preview": "So at 21, I just began an ADN program for Fall 2025 at my local college, and I’m already starting to doubt whether nursing is for me. Between patient care, assessments, med administration and formulating care plans, it just seems like a lot of responsibility and if anything were to go wrong, I know I’ll never forgive myself. School has been extremely rigorous to say the least, and I’ve had little time for anything else but reading, studying, doing practice tests and practicing nursing skills. Not to mention I feel so behind compared to my older, more experienced classmates, many of whom have backgrounds as CNAs and the like. But I realized that I truly don’t enjoy doing interviews, assessments and patient interactions all that much. Im definitely more of an introvert, and it sucks realizing that I would not make a good nurse because of this. Patients deserve a good nurse who is a skilled, can communicate effectively with them and provide the best care possible, and it’s ok if that nurse isn’t me. I simply don’t think I can succeed and become an RN. And no, I don’t have a crystal ball, Im just going by my current intuition. Though I know a lot of my family members would be very disappointed that I can’t make it as a nurse 😔 I really don’t want to just drop out of school. I have to finish with some degree, otherwise this would all have been for nothing. I’ve always did well in science courses with labs, which draws me towards medical lab science, but im still not too sure… Tomorrow I’ll go speak to an advisor, maybe they’ll convince me to stay in nursing, or maybe they’ll show me other options.",

      "content_preview": "I’ve been working toward becoming a nurse for almost 10 years now. I’ve started and stopped school, switched programs, and had to retake classes more times than I’d like to admit. Now I’m facing the possibility of having to retake another class. Nursing has always been my dream not just for the career itself, but because I wanted to prove people wrong, to be something more, and to build the life I’ve always wanted but missed out on. But after so many setbacks, I’m starting to wonder: should I keep pushing, or is it time to step back and consider another path in healthcare (or even outside of it)? For those of you who’ve struggled through nursing school, had to repeat courses, or even pivoted to something else—what helped you decide? Do you regret pushing through, or do you regret walking away?",

      "content_preview": "I’m currently completing my first semester of my accelerated nursing program. Throughout the semester we have 6 skills check offs. We get two tries to complete them and if we’re not successful we get booted from the program. This morning I had a fairly difficult skills check off final. 6 sterile skills and 6 clean skills where we performed one of each. During my sterile skills assessment, I fumbled around a little bit and appeared visibly nervous. My instructor told me it was fine and to just continue on with the assessment. Halfway through, I was putting on my sterile gloves and accidentally ripped one, no big deal, I grabbed another pair and continued on. After I finished putting on my second pair, I realized I forgot to uncap the sterile saline. I told my instructor that I had forgotten to take it off, and that I can take off my gloves and open it, then get another pair, or I can just verbalize. She told me that it was looking like I might not pass this assessment. I basically begged her to let me continue with the time I have left, I only had 7 minutes and I was told I would have to start completely over. I started again and finished quickly with a passing mark. I realized as I was leaving I forgot to put the drape on my patient despite my preceptor not noticing. I feel so incompetent despite having passed, and I can’t help but feel like I didn’t earn the passing grade. I saw some students who didn’t pass crying in the hall and I got hit with a huge wave of guilt. I worry that my skill set is not good enough for me to be a decent nurse. Despite having done everything on my own, I can’t help but feel like I cheated my way through that assessment. I love nursing and I’m very passionate about this program and this career path so it’s just all hitting me very hard. I’m not sure why I’m posting this, just didn’t know who I could possibly talk to. Anyway, thanks guys !",

So is exploring the mental blocks! I graduated just under a year ago and I have a six figure job in a facility that is my DREAM job. I had to step away for 6 months and get my mental health back from the garbage can and finished .4 points from cum laude. How did a PTSD inflicted adhd bisexual like myself in a competitive master’s program at university walk away with the 150k piece of paper? I can’t believe it either. My grandma came to my graduation and then died a month later. I became a hospice nurse immediately because me having the nursing knowledge allowed me to be not only the most understanding family member there for her but it allowed me to support her the whole time and her last words to me were “My granddaughter knows I love her.” I wanted to give that experience to others. I did. Then hospice burnt me out and now I’m were I wanted to be and were I belong. It’s going to take more time to recover from the burn out from school! I’m going with the flow! What’s the point of this ADHD pep talk?! FIND what makes you happy and DO IT A LOT. I picked up an acoustic guitar for the first time since middle school and started singing at open mics and now I get paid to sing and singing is my side gig! BECAUSE I was so bent out of shape and needed to sing my feelings to a room of strangers while my mind and body were getting screwed up from stress. don’t put your life on hold because you are in an intense program!! ( I did an accelerated masters at University from a background in art-WOOF) I didn’t come up for air until I paused school and start real deal therapy. SCHOOL IS STRESSING YOU OUT, YOU’RE DOING SOMETHING SUPER HARD. NOTORIOUSLY HARD! Believe this: you will recover and earn a comfortable living! SCHOOL IS STRESSING YOU OUT and if you had a tough childhood or underlying trauma you’re caught in the undertow just surviving AND YOU WILL SWIM AGAIN! HELL, YOU’LL BE ON DRY LAND! Don’t stay one of the nurses you wouldn’t want to have as your nurse! Take care of your heart, emotionally/spiritually/physically! IF YOUR SOMEONE WHO CAN GO THROUGH NURSING SCHOOL AND NOT HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH Relapse honestly, I can’t relate to you but FANTASTIC FOR YOU! Congrats on the loving trauma free childhood, honestly! For the rest you, I’ll hold a metaphorical candle for you as you find how to rock and roll and get through the shit! Please comment anything you’d like below to vent or share some humor. It’s hard to interpret tone in writing but there’s a heaping scoop of humor, not taking myself too seriously and a lot of understanding and love. Other info I passed the NCLEX at 87 questions. I went in there with my head thick like a rock and felt nothing and then went to my brothers house and made vevetta Mac and cheese and just played with it for a while, then ate it, then took a forceful nap and was numb for three days before I got the thumbs up that I was a registered nurse.",

      "content_preview": "Hey all, currently getting ready for my freshman year of college to get my BSN and I’m very excited about it. As part of that excitement I’ve obviously been doing the classic looking into far future career possibilities. One thing that is irking me however is the fact that applying to med school after getting a BSN is weirdly difficult. The premed requirements seem so nonsensical and pointless to me, for one there’s an absurd amount of chemistry requirements that I don’t see any practical use for outside of just being really hard classes, also physics requirements?? I get maybe understanding basic physics concepts that would come into play like pressure and how it would effect things in medicine but I feel like that’d be better taught as a more specific “how would this effect your day to day as a doctor” more than generic physics classes. I take like a handful of bio classes, a chemistry class, and a stats class, and then boom I’m doing clinicals and then graduating fully able to go out and work in medicine. Why is it that someone who has a BSN and potentially even real hospital job experience isn’t even considered to be able to apply for med school, but someone who got a high grade in OChem is? It’s also weird to me because I feel like majoring in nursing would be the safer option compared to being a bio premed major as you have a career to fall back on if med school applications don’t work out. It feels like the system is set up to make it arbitrarily hard to even come close to becoming a doctor, not hard for the sake of making sure they’re properly trained and equipped to work as one, but hard as in just for the sake of being difficult. Sorry that this is mostly a rant but as someone who wouldn’t mind getting to call themselves “Dr. Name” I find it weird that the path is the way it is.",

I’ve never really had to study much for classes since a lot of the classes I’ve taken have come easier to me so I never really had to study for them but this class is very hard and I need tips on how to study because just reading a text book and watching videos isn’t cutting it for me. Any help would be appreciated!!",

I’m really excited (and nervous!) and want to set myself up for success from the very beginning. For context, my goal is to become a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner one day so I can provide both medication management and therapy. I know nursing school can be intense, so I’m trying to prepare myself academically, mentally, and financially before classes even start. I’d love to hear: •\tWhat you wish you knew before starting nursing school •\tStudy habits or learning strategies that helped you succeed •\tAny advice for time management or avoiding burnout •\tRecommended resources (books, YouTube channels, apps, etc.) •\tCommon mistakes to avoid during nursing school •\tThings you did during school that helped your future career Also, if you have any mental health–specific tips for a student interested in psych nursing, I’d be all ears. Thanks in advance for your advice! I really value the experience in this community.",

I start upgrading next week, and I start the LPN program in January. I am a male, 23, from British Columbia, Canada. I feel like I’m a little old to be starting college, but after browsing this subreddit, I understand that it’s completely fine. That won’t change my reservations, though, so I would also appreciate feedback from others who “started late.” My plan is to become a PN, work for 2–4 years, and then hopefully get into a bridge program (I understand they are VERY competitive). Is this a reasonable goal, or should I expect to eventually do the full BSN program? I would appreciate hearing others’ experiences with either path. I am currently the primary caretaker for my sick grandfather. That experience has made me feel like nursing is the right path for me. I tolerate all the “gross” aspects of taking care of him fairly well (dressing wounds, wiping his bum, helping him on and off the commode). What should I expect to be doing as a PN? Questions about the job: What responsibilities do PNs have? What does the average workday look like? How many hours should I expect to work? Is the pay livable/comfortable enough? Should I expect to move? (I’m currently living in rural BC) What are the best and worst parts of working as a PN? Is it viable to never become an RN or go back to school? I am a little worried about being a male nurse as well. Are male nurses treated well, or at least equally to female nurses? Are there any financial or employment benefits to being a male nurse (e.g., would I find positions easier)? What skills or habits should I work on? Are there any books, videos, or other resources anyone recommends? I am also currently on PWD (history of mental illness that I now have under control). Will this affect employment at all? I plan on getting off PWD by 2026, but I’m not sure if that will still affect anything. Any and all tips or information are much appreciated.",

      "content_preview": "My hunt for a nurse internship/externship started at the end of the spring semester once I had completed the required Med-Surg I clinical that hospitals in my area require to apply as a nurse extern/intern. As for experience, my resume consisted of my two work experiences (tutor and event organizer/ canvasser for an organization), my relevant community service experiences, and an emphasis on my clinical rounds on ICU and ER floors (as well as skills i’ve become proficient in). Since I was freshly 18 and straight out of high school when I began nursing school (I did my pre-req’s/ associates in high school), my work experience was limited so I also tried to emphasize that although I don’t have much experience, I have been a very committed nursing student with a 3.9 GPA thus far (I know they don’t care about grades but I have nothing else to show). Finally, I submit personalized cover letters with each application. Obviously I included all the other basics on my resume, but I am so curious as to why it has now been nearly 5 months of applying and I still haven’t been able to even get an interview. I thought this was an entry level position, but I’m assuming they’re not hiring me due to my lack of experience because I’m not sure what can be so awful about my resume that I’ve gotten denied an interview for every single position I’ve applied to. Please, if anyone can give me any recommendations on what I could do better, let me know. At this point I’ve already even completed Med-Surg II and my final semester will be this upcoming spring. I desperately need some type of medical experience to show when I begin applying for nurse residencies because new grads with no previous experience in my area are really struggling to land any type of nursing job with no experience!",

I don’t know what to highlight as important and it seems like I don’t recall anything. This makes studying and test taking extremely frustrating. Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like with the way I write notes, study, and recall information will lead me to be unsuccessful. I’ve tried quizlet, some GPT prompts, and I use an iPad for my notes.",

Things like medical terminology and memorization arent my strong suit. I also have social/general anxiety so sometimes my brain does a full stop when im asked anything 😭😭 something im trying to fix before i graduate, just want to get ahead of the game so i wont be overwhelmed or fall behind once classes/clinicals start. Any tips, study tools, or advice from current/previous nursing students would be super appreciated!",

For reference I am applying to spring 2026 with decisions on admissions being sent out in mid September. Would I just have to test before admission in January(if I get in) or do they give you a time limit after acceptance? I infrequently use marijuanna for anxiety.",
