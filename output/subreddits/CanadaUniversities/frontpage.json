      "content_preview": "hey there, so atm im pursuing my bachelors in applied psychology in india and had initially planned on pursuing my masters in forensic psychology in the UK, mainly due to the straightforward route of licensure over there and also because i have family residing there. however due to the recent changes in the immigration policies I'm hesitant in going ahead with UK and considering looking at other countries. can someone provide insight on what a career in forensic and clinical psychology looks like in canada? whether its feasible enough for an international student to get a job after masters, top universities for these courses, and other things to keep in mind? also, im aware of the high rate of indian international students in canada, so would you say racism is commonplace as a result?",

My options are as follows: Simon Frazer University (Vancouver) UoT (Toronto) Bishops' (Quebec) Queens' (Kingston) Western (London) I am aware that SFU and UoT are the two that are close/in major cities which has definitely been a consideration of mine but I'm also super open to the other options as they seem to have great campus life. The main thing I'm looking for out of my experience is enjoying the social aspects of the uni and general area. added bonus if accommodation situation is easy/cheaper. Has anyone been to any of these unis  and can provide some insight into their experience? For reference I want to go Semester 1 (winter semester?) 2026 (August-December time) Thanks heaps!",

I'm in my junior year at my regional university, my average grade is somewhere around a 3.8 GPA, my English is probably at a C1, and I'm currently looking for a marketing masters in Canada in a province that would allow to find a job after finishing my degree. Funds are tight, sadly; I'd say 50,000 CAD at max for a tuition fee, but my standards of living is very low, like I'll live in Yellowknife if I would get a good degree and a chance to work afterwards. So what do you think I would need to know before starting to evaluate the options? What uni would you recommend? Maybe I can apply to some scholarships to have more than my current savings? Maybe there would be a problem with applying because I'm from Russia? Like, any advice would be appreciated, thank you in advance",

While I am passionate about medicine, I’m not naturally inclined towards the hard sciences and am more of a social sciences artsy kid. Would you say it’s more efficient and better to do health sciences as an undergraduate degree or do something super easy and take science electives? With just health sciences, I’m glad I wouldn’t have to go the extra mile trying to meet medical prerequisites because I heard if I do the second option I might even have to take some courses in the summer and that’s more costly and more stress after the school year. I’m just worried because even though sciences aren’t my strong suit I’m still interested in them and want med as an option, but I’m worried my gpa will not be exemplary if I do a major with that in focus. I also just want a slightly more useful undergrad you know? like I can’t do much besides post-bachelor’s with a degree in let’s say philosophy. What should I apply for? Or is there another undergrad that meets medical prerequisites and is also very easy to maintain a gpa with??",

      "content_preview": "Hi everyone, sorry in advance for the long post, just needed to rant to strangers on here. I graduated this past June with a business degree in marketing. I never managed to land a co-op or proper summer internship during undergrad, but I did a short marketing intern role at a small company and worked other jobs like admin, customer success, and now I’m in client support. Since graduating, I’ve been feeling super lost and dealing with post-grad depression. I change my mind about my career path every few days. One day I’m convinced I want to apply to teacher’s college, then I think about HR, then career coach at a uni, or a proper marketing job, or consulting… it’s exhausting. I don’t want to rush into a master’s and regret it later, so I told myself I’d take a year to figure things out. Right now, I’m keeping a routine: I work part-time (25 hrs/week), go to the gym 5 days a week, apply to jobs regularly, and travel here and there while I still have the time. But I can’t shake this feeling like I’m running out of time. I’m fine taking a year off school, but applications are already opening for next year and I don’t want to waste my shot by not having a plan. So I guess I’m asking: how did you figure out what you wanted to do after graduating? How did you pick a career path? And does this “I’m so behind” feeling ever go away? I just feel really stuck and overwhelmed, and honestly I cry myself to sleep some nights because I don’t know what direction to take. Any advice would mean a lot.",

Because that way I’d still be studying with peers my age and would just need to take summer classes to full catch up. But I’m afraid I would have already missed frosh, halloween, christmas, new years etc. And most people will already be in friend groups and even if I do make friends they aren’t even living on res second year and I won’t even know anyone enough to be moving out with them. However, if I were to start the year after I wouldn’t miss any of these events at all I’d really just be with people who aren’t my age, which, my birthday is later in the year so I’ll probably have couple month differences and the age gap won’t be much but I don’t know I feel so embarrassed and weird about it strangely even though I’m older by a year.

      "content_preview": "I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in but I'm writing this for anyone who knows people who are applying to schools or is applying themselves. I go to Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. It's kind of a funny school because when I tell people they have two reactions. The first and significantly more common is \"What?\" or \"Where is that?\". The second one is people specifically from the East Coast and they often say something like, \"Oh wow, that's a great school!\" I have a somewhat idea where this reputation was built but I seriously think it's genuinely damaging and I've seen it a lot in the Maritime students who attend the school and think they're going to a good school (or their parents who are paying for it). Mount Allison is not a great school, it's not even a good school, it's an extremely expensive tiny school with very few opportunities and a surprisingly terrible quality of education. One of the big draws of the school (I've also worked in recruitment for this school so I can say this first-hand) and they have us specifically say this to people as much as we can, that it's ranked the \"#1 undergraduate university in Canada for twenty-five years\". This is, at best, an omission and at worst, an outright lie. Mount Allison was ranked the #1 UNDERgraduate university first of all by MacLean's magazine not an official source (they won't mention this) and second of all, most importantly, they never, ever mention the \"undergraduate\" part. Almost every known university in Canada is a research university, there's literally only like ten PURELY undergraduate universities in Canada and that's that Mount Allison was ranked #1 out of. This is their biggest selling point and it seems kind of dishonest to me since I've come across a lot of students who actually believe they're attending the \"#1 ranked university in Canada.\" On top of that, the actual schooling is genuinely a joke. This part actually confuses me since I heard a lot about Mount Allison being harder than other universities, but the courses are laughable. Courses are literally genuinely stupidly easy. And the student population at Mount Allison is honestly quite a bit dumber than any other university I've seen. This is anecdotal, so feel free to disregard, but I have come across so many students who struggle in classes that I would say are not much harder than my Nova Scotia public high school. During final exams you have students OPENLY cheating, like phones out in the exam hall cheating. Athletics, if this is something you're interested in, are worse than a joke. Every team performs terribly, the football team had a 0-52 home opener, and the teams themselves tend to not have great atmospheres. The hockey team was rumored to have been taken out because of the large amounts of sexual assault the team members were engaging in. The worst part is that the amount this school charges for being a subpar, shitty school is completely insane. Tuition for domestic students for a year is $10,800. A single room ($10k) plus the required all-access meal plan (you need to get one if you're living in residence and the only option is the full all-you-care-to-eat $6,091) is another $16k for a year. If we compare this to University of Toronto just as an example (the actual #1 ranked school in Canada) arts and science tuition for a year is $9,894. That's also for out-of-province, it's slightly lower for Ontario residents (Mount Allison doesn't do that for the five people who live in New Brunswick lol). Rent is also expensive even in off-campus housing which is crazy when you think about how it's literally in the middle of nowhere. There's a lot I also hear about the culture of Mount Allison being very laid-back and the students being \"chill\", especially in opposition to other East Coast schools like Acadia and King's and St. FX. Honestly, from what I've seen, because the school has delusions of grandeur and is so overly expensive, the majority of students are small-towners from the Maritimes and British Columbia (oddly) with very wealthy parents. They're often also not very academically inclined because they chose a school like Mount Allison and not a school that's known for academics. There's not enough information online I think talking about what kind of university this school is because it's not really an important enough school, but the niche exists for a lot of people especially in the East Coast, so I'm writing this just for visibility in the hopes that someone might make an alternate decision. I personally attended the university because I received a scholarship large enough in size to cover most of my expenses, but I think it would be truly insane to attend this school and actually pay the exorbitant amount it requires while under some misguided impression that it's a \"good\" (read: worth the money) school. The last thing I'll say is if you do end up in Sackville, I hope you don't get sexually assaulted because the school will do nothing. The bar in Sackville does more in banning people from coming in than the school. Oh, and if the person you got assaulted by is an athlete (more likely than not), they'll be team captain next year.",

      "content_preview": "I’m currently an undergrad in the US, but I’ve recently met with a couple of PIs in Canada who were really nice and do some awesome research. However, from what I’ve gathered, the net stipend of most students is pretty low esp. after deducting tuition fees and taxes. This is probably even more drastic for international students who aren’t eligible for a lot of scholarships. Take USask as an example, which already has one of the cheaper tuition fees. Starting with a $27k stipend and subtracting tuition (5.7k) and taxes ($7k), that leaves less than $15k left, which is 1.2k/month. Considering the COL in Canada, that seems unlivable. Do most students survive off of personal savings/familial support? Or does tri council funding help out at least for citizens? Edit: Thank you for the corrections on taxes, I wasn’t aware that only TAships are taxable. That certainly helps.",

      "content_preview": "Hi!! I am a recent graduate from McGill CS. In my final semester, I built a web app to help students with degree planning. This summer I took some extra time to refine it, and I’ve just completed the updated version. I would love to share it with current students to see if they find it useful. I also plan to keep improving it based on feedback: acamapa screenshot When I was picking electives, I often struggled to find ones that actually fit what I wanted. On top of that, it was hard to see what advanced courses I could eventually take, since the information is scattered everywhere. The program requirements were just a flat list of courses, but whenever I tried to plan out a semester I’d end up opening a dozen different tabs to cross-check prerequisites and rules. For overall planning, I mostly just used general tools like Notion or a simple Google Doc, but whenever I needed to make changes I’d often lose track of things or have trouble keeping it organized. That’s what pushed me to build this tool, it started from my own pain point of trying to make sense of all this: AcaMapa.ai *AcaMapa stands for Academic Mapper, in case if you’re wondering;) Here’s what it does: Takes the messy McGill course/program info → parses it → presents it as clean, interactive cards. Handles complicated pre-/co-/anti-requisite logic with simple, color-coded feedback (green = qualified, red = not yet). Shows you the future courses that open up once you take a prerequisite , so you can plan ahead strategically. Lets you drag-and-drop plan your entire degree visually by choosing courses for each terms. Links back to official McGill sources for trust + details. I think that this might be helpful for these people: Pre-university students → Explore programs easily, preview what courses/requirements look like before applying/choosing. First-year students → Build a degree roadmap from the start, avoid surprises, see how requirements fit together. Upper-year students → Track what you’ve already taken, unlock new course options, fine-tune elective planning. Still a work in progress! but I’d love to hear if anyone else runs into the same problems. (I've so far only adapted the UI layout to PC and laptops) Please come to try it out! … … This project has taken me wayyy longer than I expected, and TBH I have no idea if anyone will actually find it useful🥲. I also regret that the product missed a big half of this term’s course selection period due to how slow it has came together. Still, I really hope this project can be seen, tried out and liked by some of you So please — If you have any comments, questions and feedbacks, please please leave a comment or reach out to me. I’ve also planned on making more releases moving forward to bring new features to live (ex. Log-in and AI feature). This site is currently only set up for McGill students, but you’re from another University and wish that this can be adapted to your school, please reach out to me! Lastly, see how there’s 5 As in AcaMapa.ai ? This is a grand wish for y’all to gain at least 5 As in your upcoming term ;) Huge huge thanks!!!",

I'm facing a dilemma because I'm currently confused about what I want to do after high school. My whole life I have said that I want to be a dental hygienist. I've never even considered anything else. However, recently my mind has begun to change. My social media feeds have been flooded with posts about how dental hygiene is draining and the schooling is very tough. I know I should take everything I see online with a grain of salt, but these videos have been really swaying what I thought I wanted. I also have really bad FOMO. I live in Ontario, Canada and my only real option for dental hygiene schooling is George Brown. The school does not have the best reviews from what I have looked up and I am worrying that I will miss out on the fun uni experience that you will get at universities like Western or Guelph. I've heard that the social life at GB is not good and I feel if I did select that school/dental hygiene, I would be missing out on many opportunities. I wonder if I would still feel this conflicted if this social life factor was not involved. I do not enjoy science or maths AT ALL. However, I love my english classes. I am now considering pursuing a degree in english with a bachelor of arts, but I don't know what the career options would look like. At the end of the day, I want to go into something that I will have a great schooling experience, as well as lead me into a stable, well paying career. I wish there was a way to test drive different programs before deciding lol. I'm not sure if i did the best job explaining what I am feeling but I wanted to keep it concise. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

For some reference, I’d initially accepted my university offer and was really excited and ready to go but I kept having doubts about the program and what I wanted to do etc. My dad said to defer, take a gap and apply elsewhere so I’d still my initial offer there in case I didn’t like anywhere else. And I did think it was maybe right decision at the moment, but my family’s honestly stressing me out because we’re downsizing atm, and all my closest friends will have left for university after today. I honestly feel like I’m starting to regret it a lot, feel like a waste of space and I’m really annoyed at the fact that next year when I go to school all the first years are going to be a year younger than me. Especially, if I go to a school where some of my friends are attending idk I would just feel embarrassed. Could someone tell me what their experiences were like after a gap? Thanks.",

I also scored an overall 8 bands in IELTS (no less than 7). Along with academics, I’ve worked on projects related to machine learning and generative AI. My first preference is University of Waterloo – MDSAI. Do you think I stand a chance of getting in? As backup options, I’m considering: McMaster University – MEng in Computing and Software University of Ottawa – MSc in Computer Science with AI concentration My main focus is getting a good job after graduation, and I am only looking for course-based programs (not thesis). Which one would you suggest I keep as my 2nd and 3rd choice? Any advice from students or alumni would be really helpful! Thanks in advance!",

Even if they aren’t established Institutions, they can become so, and it could also help offload certain applications only looking for baseline education, who end up applying to bigger universities because they have to",

Here are the 4 options I’m currently considering (all PG in Supply Chain Management, except Douglas where I plan to combine Finance Planning + SCM): 1.\tLambton College – PG in SCM (2 years)\n\n2.\tDouglas College – PG in Finance Planning (1 year) + PG in SCM (1 year)\n\n3.\tAlgonquin College – PG in SCM (1 year / 2 years)\n\n4.\tLoyalist College – PG in SCM (2 years) 📌 My personal priority is: •\t1st choice: Finance Planning •\t2nd choice: SCM 👉 My concerns: •\tTuition cost is important (I’ll fund everything through loans). •\tShould I do 1 year PG + 1 year PGWP or 2 years PG + 3 years PGWP?\n\n•\tMy final goal: get a job in Canada after graduation and eventually apply for PR. For international students (or those familiar with these colleges): •\tHow is the quality of classes & professors?\n\n•\tHow easy is it to find part-time jobs?\n\n•\tHousing (on-campus dorms or rentals)?\n\n•\tWhich school has better career opportunities for PR pathway?\n\n•\tOr would you recommend another program/college instead?

I need to have at least 3 safety schools (pretty much guaranteed to get in for worse case scenario) to apply to college. My grades are mostly 90%+, though I am taking 2 of my hardest courses this year (AP Calculus and AP Chemistry) so I will have to wait and see. My SAT is a 1380 and I am waiting on the results from August. I have a 5 in AP Biology, AP Psychology, AP English Language, and AP Chinese (I'm not Chinese). Based on these statistics, what are some programs that I could get into? I've been thinking about Simon Fraser, York, and TMU, although I am unsure if they are actually safeties for me or not. Should I aim for an easier school? Could any of these potentially reject me? I understand that acceptance rates for schools in Canada is less accurate due to the program being more important when it comes to acceptance. No one around me is knowledgable about this so I would like some advice please!",

I'm looking for anyone's experience and advice. I'm not sure if I should go to Dal or Mt. A for my undergrad (probably bio or biochem) if im planning on going to Dal med school. Would going to Dal for undergrad increase my chances of getting into med school? Also any insight to the lifestyle, professors, etc. at Dal or Mt. A would be appreciated. These loose choices are only based off my research and I'm just looking for personal experiences and advice.",
